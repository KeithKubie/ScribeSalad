00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello, We are New
Teachers Thriving,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.440
and we are so grateful
to HILT for the support

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.750
that they have
provided to us so far.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.100
So my name is Tyler Hester.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.662
I'm the CEO and founder
of New Teachers Thriving,

00:00:11.662 --> 00:00:13.120
and I have the
privilege of working

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.900
alongside two incredible
colleagues, Dana and Merry.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.770
Quick story, so it was October
of my first year of teaching,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.490
I was having breakfast with
my mom at this literal IHOP

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.530
restaurant in
Southern California.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.960
My mom asked me how I
was doing, and I started

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.299
crying into my pancakes.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.260
Being a new teacher
was kicking my butt.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.530
And you can see the fact
that I'm not the only one who

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.370
experiences this.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.620
If you Google "phases of
a first-year teacher,"

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.420
this is a really
common phenomenon.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.090
People step into
survival mode, as you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.530
can see, and disillusionment
in a lot of instances.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.200
This is in the face of the fact
that we have severe teacher

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.471
shortages across our country.

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:58.220
There's one statistic
here from California

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.330
that 80% of school districts
are reporting shortages.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.720
This is also in the context that
the teachers we have sometimes

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.220
quit.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.330
We saw a study that showed
that 22% of teachers

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.475
in urban districts don't
return for a second year.

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:16.100
And what that often
looks like is that,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.570
sure, some people are able
to get to rejuvenation,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.820
and reflection,
and anticipation,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390
but we also have
others who don't really

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.120
get much beyond
disillusionment and who

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.010
leave at the end of the
year, and still others,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.670
unfortunately, who leave in
the middle of the school year.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.360
This is obviously bad for kids,
and it's really expensive.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.500
A study of all the costs
associated with this

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.800
demonstrated it
costs about $21,000

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.660
for every teacher who's lost.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.220
So it's a significant problem.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.910
So what do we do about it?

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.150
Well, we provide a
research-based supports

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.670
to help early career
educators achieve well-being,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.450
and we do it in three ways.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.630
First, is through
in-person training courses.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.510
Second, we're developing
an online course.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.150
And third, I'm writing
a book with the title,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.300
Don't Be Miserable in October.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.890
We're actually
piloting our course

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.630
in person with
Boston Public Schools

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.540
and the Boston teachers
union this year.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.730
This is a picture from the
end of our first session

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.630
a little while back.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.080
So who are our customers?

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.700
Well, our customers are
school and district leaders.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.610
And the problems
that we're solving

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.880
are, A, student learning
in early career educator

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.940
classrooms; second,
teacher retention;

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.390
and third, the costs
associated with high turnover.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.790
Our users, though, are
early career teachers.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.430
And the problem we're solving
with them is pretty simple.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.200
It's them not feeling well.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.290
So what are we
encouraged by so far?

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.560
A few things.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.120
One is the fact that we're
basing these trainings off

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.500
of research that we know
is really sound and solid

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.010
about how to achieve well-being
and higher rates of retention.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.050
Second, we've had a lot
of encouraging feedback

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.550
from the district leaders
we've spoken with.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.390
And third, as we've seen a lot
of enthusiasm from teachers,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.000
both in terms of feedback
during the sessions,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.370
and also substantially
more applications

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.770
for the course than
we anticipated.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.170
So in closing, we just
want to thank HILT

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.860
for helping us turn
educator frowns upside down.
