00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.219
There are so many factors at play when it
comes to making a movie that actually completing

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.110
one can feel like a miracle.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.630
After months of blood, sweat, and tears, there’s
a lot riding on the final product.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.300
As you’re about to see, it doesn’t always
end well.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:28.660
Here are 10 Popular Movies That Actors and
Directors Regret.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.560
Josh Trank, Fantastic Four
Given the insane success the MCU is currently

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.050
enjoying, it’s easy to assume that all their
movies are slam dunks.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.730
But there’s one group of characters that
have been getting the short end of the cinematic

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.610
stick for quite some time now: the Fantastic
Four.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.010
They’ve had a few shots at glory and fallen
spectacularly short every time.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.640
The 2015 incarnation directed by Josh Trank
was no exception.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.790
Hopes were high that a shakeup would be just
what the doctor ordered, but again the offering

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.970
fell flat.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.400
Many blame the studio for muddying the waters
during post-production.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.790
The movie was a let-down for everyone involved,
and talks of a sequel have been swept under

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.350
the rug for the time being.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.189
Daniel Craig, Spectre
Daniel Craig made the PR team work for their

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.920
paychecks during press for 2015’s Spectre.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.999
The actor is done with playing James Bond,
and he doesn’t care who knows it.

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:23.499
Craig has voiced concern over how 007 is part
of the problem with Hollywood depictions of

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:24.499
masculinity.

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.810
The actor argues that the super spy is a violent
misogynist and all-around prick.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.960
And that might be true.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.850
But after consistently being told what an
“honor” it is to play the character, fans

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.759
may have been surprised to hear the opposite.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.149
Ryan Reynolds, X-Men Origins: Wolverine
Ryan Reynolds knew he’d be the perfect guy

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.730
to play Deadpool, so when the opportunity
came up back in 2009, the actor took it.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.939
But anyone who’s seen X-Men Origins: Wolverine
knows the merc with a mouth started as the

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.340
merc without a mouth.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.939
Reynolds was given every assurance that the
role was gonna be awesome, but it wasn’t

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.600
until he showed up on set that he realized
he’d been straight lied to.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.659
The actor campaigned hard to have the character
taken in the right direction, and as a thanks

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.940
for his efforts, production threatened to
replace him.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.940
After the success of the 2016 installment,
it’s hard to imagine the character as anything

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.590
less than great, but all good things take
time.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.400
George Clooney - Batman &amp; Robin
Of all the sins committed in the name of Batman,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.400
there is one that reigns supreme, and will
never be forgiven for as long as the character

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.310
exists: bat nipples.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.249
And while the batsuit modification first appears
in Batman Forever, it’s 1997’s Batman

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.549
&amp; Robin that whipped audiences into a tizzy.

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.870
It’s not the only change that had fans pissed
off, but it’s definitely the funniest.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.650
And just in case you think George Clooney
is oblivious to all this criticism, he’s

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.650
not.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.480
It seems like he hates it more than any of
us could, even referring to it as “a waste

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.319
of money”.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.549
Channing Tatum, G.I.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.961
Joe Franchise
Contracts are a tricky thing, and can come

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:03.230
back to bite you in the butt if you don’t
read the fine print.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.120
When Channing Tatum was a Hollywood newbie,
he signed a document that production used

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.269
to corral him into a role he never wanted:
Duke in the G.I.

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.569
Joe franchise.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.700
The actor is on record as saying he hates
the movies.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.989
And that if the bosses didn't threaten to
sue him to high heaven, he’d have passed

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.400
on the role completely.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.319
The promise of guaranteed work seemed like
a gift at the time.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.530
But the lack of agency over which work he
got to do was a major blow.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.840
Woody Allen, Annie Hall
Creative types are notoriously hard on themselves,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.989
and Woody Allen is no exception.

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.900
The accomplished filmmaker has made some of
the most renowned classics in movie history.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.160
And while many may find his films inaccessible
or pretentious, for others, nothing can compare.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.049
But for Allen, once the movie is made, the
party’s over.

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.021
And the director has talked about distancing
himself from the final product because it’s

00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:54.140
almost always a disappointment.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.730
Even one of his most popular works, Annie
Hall.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.040
Allen says he was dissatisfied with the final
cut because audiences only focused on the

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.129
relationship between he and Diane Keaton.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.760
What he considers a small portion of the film’s
larger, more cerebral message.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.220
Edward Norton, The Incredible Hulk
Edward Norton was the star of 2008’s The

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.349
Incredible Hulk.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.739
But you’d never know that by looking at
the press junket that followed.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.110
The actor was so disappointed in the film
and it’s script that he refused to participate

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.750
in promotional interviews.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.819
After joining the project, the actor reportedly
disagreed with the direction of the story

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.580
and constantly argued for changes to be made.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.470
From his perspective, Norton explains that
he simply wasn’t afraid to speak his mind

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.760
about the poor decisions being made on set.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.810
It seems as though everyone had high hopes
for the movie, but Norton came away the most

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.980
disappointed.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.490
Bill Murray, Garfield
There are a handful of people in Hollywood

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.180
who have similar names.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.970
And when those people get mixed up, some super
weird movies get made.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.460
So when a script by Joel Cohen landed in front
of Bill Murray, he jumped at the opportunity

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.520
to work with the great mind behind The Big
Lebowski, No Country For Old Men, and Burn

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.590
After Reading.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.940
Murray admits being apprehensive about wether
or not a lasagna-loving feline named Garfield

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.729
could carry an entire movie.

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.229
And when he learned that the story wasn’t
actually written by the Coen brothers like

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.020
he thought, it was too late.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.190
Turns out, he agreed to work with the Joel
Cohen behind Daddy Day Camp, and Cheaper by

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.190
the Dozen.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.390
Murray reportedly scrambled to make the script
funnier once he realized he was locked in,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.400
but was met with constant resistance.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.440
Halle Berry, Catwoman
Catwoman is a beloved character in the Batman

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440
canon.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.330
And any actress tapped to play the feisty
feline has some big claws to fill.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.210
When the character was blessed with a solo
movie in 2004, hopes were high.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.750
After a string of appearances in other bat-related
properties, finally the cat-burglar was going

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.220
to be the center of attention.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.530
The movie was panned by audiences for being
over-the-top and cheesy, and is remembered

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.620
today for all the wrong reasons.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.319
But when the movie won a boatload of Razzie’s
for being the “worst” across multiple

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.849
categories, star Halle Berry and screenplay
writer Michael Ferris showed off their senses

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.800
of humor, accepting their awards in person.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.770
David Ayer, Suicide Squad
If you ever find yourself cursing Hollywood

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.960
for pumping out the same flick year after
year, consider what happens to filmmakers

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.310
who take risks.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.840
2016’s Suicide Squad was another divisive
addition to the DCEU.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.440
And David Ayer hasn’t heard the end of it
since.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.720
The director has come under fire from all
sides of the debate, and oftentimes for things

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.949
outside of his control.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.610
Ayer’s acknowledged some flaws in the final
cut, and said that if he could do things differently,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.610
he would.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.729
Ticket holders felt duped by a bait-and-switch
marketing strategy which led everyone to believe

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.340
the Joker would be a central figure in the
storyline.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.530
And after reflecting on it, the director wishes
he’d given more screen time to the Clown

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.540
Prince of Crime.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.020
Hey thanks for watching.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.180
In a conversation about cinematic regrets,
those are the actors and directors who come

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.629
to mind for us.

00:06:50.629 --> 00:07:03.409
But did we miss any of your favorites?
