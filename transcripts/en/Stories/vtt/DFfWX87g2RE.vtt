RYAN BUSH: 13th voice.

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:18.740
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.420
Sounds are the
dream [? kissing. ?]

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:38.140
RYAN BUSH: Welcome to the
Cannaiseur Dinner Series--

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.800
hopefully, the first of many.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.300
COREEN CARROLL: The
cannaiseur event

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630
is about bringing
people together

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.880
that are interested in
cannabis, but creating

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.105
an environment that doesn't
exemplify the stoner.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.230
We're doing four
courses, starting off

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.220
with a medicated amuse-bouche
before the four courses.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.680
And in between each
course, we will be doing

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770
an [? inner-metzo ?]
of cannabis joints.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.260
The feeling of the cannabis
that it's going to create,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.610
it's more elevated,
more elegant,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.000
and it's going to create a cool
feeling throughout the evening.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.110
Everyone coming to the
cannaiseur dinner series

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.980
tonight will have a prop
215 medical marijuana

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.510
recommendation.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.760
The types of people that are
going to be at this event

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.280
are marijuana
lawyers, activists,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.200
people who are fans of cannabis
and want to change the stigma,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.692
and want to experience
cannabis in a different way.

00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:32.650
What you have on your
plate is some [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.750
of three different
types of cucumbers, one

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.700
that's infused with beet juice.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.020
Then you have a Persian one,
as well as a Japanese style.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.240
Then you have a mustard
sauce and a dill oil.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.790
We hope that events
like this will

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.260
create a better and cooler
environment for people

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.000
to come and share
cannabis together.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.150
You don't always have to go
to a bar and have drinks.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.150
You can just smoke a joint
and meet a new friend.

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:02.490

SPEAKER 4: The disconnection
from distraction

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.570
gets your brain daydreaming.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.099
When you're in
daydreaming mode, you

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.140
start to do a little bit
of the lateral thinking,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.098
so you start connecting
this, to that, to this.

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:26.290
And you start to go
through the aha moments.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.970
And if you are lucky enough
to have the camera around,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.460
you're capturing
that real time flow.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.890
It's creativity
happening in real time.
