00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
CÉDRIC VILLANI: This... is a Fields Medal.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.880
In a way it's the dream of mathematicians, but

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.880
we would never say it openly.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.000
It would be considered as…

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.640
…very outrageous.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.640
And…

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.700
the best thing you have to do to get the Fields Medal

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.120
is to do some good work, and not thinking about it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.400
BRADY HARAN: And for anyone watching,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.860
this is Professor Villani's Fields Medal — you won this.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.500
CÉDRIC VILLANI: Yes.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.160
But my name is there very discreet, you know?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.860
Here is the date: 2010.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.180
And here is my name.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.680
It's very small, because… You know…

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.420
We mathematicians are small in front of the mathematical accomplishment.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.020
This is pure gold.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.940
And this is Archimedes.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.220
Maybe the greatest mathematician of antiquity.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.420
The inscriptions here are in Greek and Latin language.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.100
[reading inscription]

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040
Means something like, you know,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.380
"To get above oneself and conquer the world."

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.840
Something like that.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.880
Which is about mathematical accomplishment.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.520
Great mathematical accomplishment.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.040
To really do things that you would not
believe yourself are possible.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100
You have to find it within you.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.540
With the help of many people, this Fields Medal…

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.640
…owes so, so, so much to my collaborators.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.460
It was award for my works in statistical physics.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.620
Study of the qualitative properties
of the gases and the plasmas.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.000
Please look at the… What is on the other side.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.900
Because this also is important.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.520
[reading inscription]

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.500
It means something about the mathematicians
who have come from all around the Earth,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.240
to give this to the people who most deserve it.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.640
Something like that.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.900
And this is one thing with the Fields Medal:

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.220
It's really an award from the community.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.000
And is attributing the public ceremony.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.660
In front of thousands of mathematicians.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:07.280
It is given by the head of state of the country in
which this conference is taking [place].

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.240
BRADY HARAN: Who did you get yours from?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.120
CÉDRIC VILLANI: President of India. In 2010. Yes.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.640
Such memories.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.180
Here, you may see that…

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.200
something like a sphere,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.620
and here's something like a cylinder.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.100
And it's an allusion to one of the most famous theorems of Archimedes.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.220
The identity of the volume of the sphere

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.480
and of the cylinder in which you can inscribe the sphere.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480
The outer cylinder.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.760
BRADY HARAN: How did you find out you'd won it?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.000
When is the first time you're told
that you're gonna get the medal?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
CÉDRIC VILLANI: I was exactly here.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.620
This place.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.860
And I was having an interview.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.380
And then the phone rings.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.420
"Hello?"

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.480
And the voice was saying,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.660
"Hello. This is László Lovász from Budapest."

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.800
And then my heart skipped a bit.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.860
Because, you know…

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.620
…I knew László was the President of the
International Mathematical Union.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.920
So, the only person whom I knew to
be on the jury of the... Fields Medal.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.100
Related to the committee.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.200
And so, "Yes, Professor Lovász.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.160
"Nice to hear you."

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.040
And then, "I have news. Good news for you."

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.540
Then you can think of me becoming all white and so on.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240
And, "Yes?"

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.540
And then,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.020
"You've won the Fields Medal!"

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.020
[mimes excited exclamations]

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.940
BRADY HARAN: What, did you
shout? Or did you make noise?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.960
CÉDRIC VILLANI: "This is extraordinary! [incomprehensible]", et cetera.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.260
"I can't believe it! Such beautiful day!
Extraordinary!", blah blah blah.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.820
And so on and so forth.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.620
And then he explain me, "Yes, and
please keep it strictly confidential.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.620
"It's very important you keep it secret."

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.820
And then I, [exhales]

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.900
I shut down [the phone], then I was like, [exhales]

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.220
And then I realize, journalist was there.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.760
Couple of metres away.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.540
"Ah!"

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.780
Did I make a big blunder?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.000
Turns out, he did not realize.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.380
Maybe he did not speak English after all.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.080
BRADY HARAN: The Fields Medal is often described as sort of a Nobel Prize of mathematics.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.700
Like, it's a big prize.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.040
Do you ever feel like you don't deserve it?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.660
Or did you — by that point, did you think,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.660
"Yeah, I should get the Fields Medal for this!"

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.860
CÉDRIC VILLANI: Um…

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.220
We all have this feeling, at some
moment, that we don't deserve it.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.220
Or, most of us.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.560
And… often, I would say,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.220
for a given round of Fields Medals,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.660
there are those who do such amazing work,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.700
that you know, "Okay, this guy WILL get it

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.420
"and everybody knows it."

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.440
Like Perelman — it was clear.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.680
It was so extraordinary, that it was clear he should get it.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.300
And there are people who did some… good stuff.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.260
But then it's not clear. You know?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.340
And it's… partly a matter of appreciation. And of luck.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.940
And on this I think that I was lucid.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.360
BRADY HARAN: Another thing that's famous about the Fields Medal,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.860
and different from the Nobel Prize,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.920
is the age limit.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.720
What do you think about that rule?

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.260
It seems arbitrary.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
CÉDRIC VILLANI: There is some dose of arbitrariness,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.960
in particular in the fact that…

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.300
…changes of perspective depending on your birth date.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.520
But there are many arbitrary rules in life.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.860
You know, once I was discussing
this with one of my colleagues.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200
Back in 2006, maybe.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.760
In the International Congress
of Mathematicians in Madrid.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.860
And I was saying,

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.360
"Well, it's unfair, because this and it depends
on your birth date, etc., your chance to get it."

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.140
And he looked at me with a smile, and said,

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.620
"Are you saying that life is unfair?"

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.720
You know… There are so many
rules, and so much in life.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.660
So you should not strive for perfect,
um, you know… fairness.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.180
It makes no sense.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.800
And it's good to have rule of age limitation.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.120
Because it favours the young.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.860
And, um…

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.240
Historically, it's clear that the Fields Medal was conceived as an encouragement,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.240
rather than a crowning achievement.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.620
Then it kind of took the place in the
media, that Nobel Prize usually takes,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.560
because there was no Nobel Prize in math.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.560
There is the Abel Prize.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.500
Which in some sense is closer to Nobel.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.260
I would say that it's good to have this age limit.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.440
Also, it makes sure that

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.240
people who do something real great

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.660
get honoured…

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.660
…you know… on time.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.860
Sometimes people, for the Nobel
Prize, they have to wait thirty years.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.880
Sometimes they are dead, and we say,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.420
"Okay, this guy should really have got it."

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.100
But now… too late.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.180
BRADY HARAN: When you win the thing that
every mathematician dreams of winning,

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.040
how do you keep motivating yourself?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.380
How do you keep doing good mathematics?

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.440
What makes you wake up in the morning and think, "I wanna make a new discovery"?

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.600
'Cause you've won a Fields Medal!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.780
Like… You've done the best thing you could do!

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.320
CÉDRIC VILLANI: It's a recurring question,
"What makes you wake up in the morning?"

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.280
You know… We all have our missions
to do, that we have to complete.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.360
And it would be very silly to think that when
you have won the crowning achievement,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.360
[it's] the end of the mission.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.760
Most of the time, people get rewarded for
work which is not the one they dreamed of.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.320
There are exceptions.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.280
Take Andrew Wiles.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.780
He solved his child[hood] dream, the Fermat Theorem.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.060
But for most of us, you know…

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.480
I did not solve the question that
was most dear to my heart.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.640
And most of us, rewarded, we can say the same.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:14.120
Our big problem, the ones we are most
motivated about… They are still open.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.120
So much to do.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:24.840
But if I had all this time, there would be a list that
long, of things that I really would like to work on.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.220
And at least four projects of books
that I would like to write.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.680
A real mathematician, a true mathematician at heart…

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.200
…always keeps in his heart issues
that are extremely dear to him.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.320
And that he wants or that she wants

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.020
to go on, and to dig, and to explore.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:52.060
And a real, true mathematician can put these
questions in the fridge for twenty years

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.060
and get back to them after.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.480
Still with the same motivation.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.280
BRADY HARAN: Andrew Wiles had
Fermat's Last Theorem, very famously.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.480
What's Cédric Villani's "Fermat's Last Theorem"?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.000
What's the one that…

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.060
What's your… What's your "White Whale"?

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.120
What's your, you know, what's your great…

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.460
Great one that you can't crack?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.160
What would be your dream?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.240
CÉDRIC VILLANI: Please allow me
to keep my heart for myself…

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.740
…until I solve it.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.340
BRADY HARAN: Is it the Riemann Hypothesis?

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.600
CÉDRIC VILLANI: Wow, it would be lovely.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.480
But no.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.440
That one is not for me.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.580
That one will be for somebody else.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.380
I hope.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.020
CHARLES FEFFERMAN: "…That is not the same thing as the full Kakeya problem,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:44.340
"because maybe as the direction varies smoothly, maybe the pole would have to jump around."

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.340
BRADY HARAN: Will the Riemann Hypothesis be solved while Cédric Villani is still alive?

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.940
CÉDRIC VILLANI: I would not take bets.
