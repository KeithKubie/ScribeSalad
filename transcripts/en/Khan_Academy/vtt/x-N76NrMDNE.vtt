00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:01.439
Voiceover:What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.637
is further connect our understanding

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:05.335
of the binomial theorem.

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:08.269
Two combinatorics, two Pascal's triangle.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.564
Just to review the ideas again,

00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:12.830
if we're taking x plus
y to the third power

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.199
and I'm just using this as an example

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.017
that's a little bit easy to get around,

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:17.142
get our heads around

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.256
that's essentially taking
three equivalent expressions

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:21.776
and multiplying them by each other.

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:24.015
You're taking x plus y, times x plus y,

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:25.575
times x plus y.

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:27.752
Let's call this the first x plus y,

00:00:27.752 --> 00:00:31.222
the second x plus y,
and the third x plus y.

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.851
If you're looking at the expansion of it

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:37.817
and you're saying well how many ways

00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:41.149
can we construct x y squared

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.690
or another way to think about it is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.390
you have these three expressions,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.279
you're going to choose two of them

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:49.447
to contribute a y and take the product.

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:52.704
For example, you could pick expression one

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:54.918
and expression two to contribute the y.

00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:57.946
You could pick expression
one and expression three

00:00:57.946 --> 00:00:59.172
to contribute the y,

00:00:59.172 --> 00:01:00.914
or you could take expression two

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:02.787
and expression three to contribute the y.

00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:03.657
Of course the other expressions

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:05.345
what's going to contribute to the x.

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:09.117
You have three expressions

00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:12.327
and you're going to choose two

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:14.007
to contribute the y

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.222
and so that's why you have
this combinatorics idea

00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:17.365
it's three choose two.

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:19.372
It's the exact same mathematical problem,

00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:22.044
if you have three friends
and you're choosing two

00:01:22.044 --> 00:01:23.671
to ride in a car with you,

00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:25.965
you don't care which sit
they are going to sit in.

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:27.211
You're just saying which two friends

00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:29.827
get to ride in my two
seater or get to ride,

00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:32.356
what are the two friends
that I'm going to pick?

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:34.326
Same way here, out of three friends

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:36.268
which are the two that I'm going to pick

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:38.789
to contribute a y to this product

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.039
and then the third is
going to contribute an x.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.188
Now let's go to Pascal's triangle

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:45.142
and hopefully see that this is actually

00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:46.387
a very similar idea.

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:48.179
We could go to the same term,

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.328
so the x y squared term,

00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:51.895
so that's right over there.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:54.856
Pascal's triangle, I always
visualize it as a map.

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:56.478
This is a node in the map

00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:58.201
and I think what are the different ways

00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.984
that I can get to this node on the map.

00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:05.653
I could have a y squared,

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:07.215
and then multiplied by an x.

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:08.399
Since we're multiplying an x

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.974
that's why I made this line orange

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:11.441
or I could have an x y

00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:14.409
and I could multiply by a blue

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.812
so there's two immediate things above it

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:18.063
that I can get to them

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:19.738
but there's two ways to get to this one,

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:21.271
there's one way to get to this one,

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.664
and so the combined
ways to get to this one

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:25.671
is two plus one is equal to three.

00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:27.695
Just to make it the connection

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:29.071
between what we just said,

00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:30.663
what's really going on here

00:02:30.663 --> 00:02:33.830
is at each of these
nodes as we pick a path,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.421
we're essentially saying
are we picking an x or y

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.944
from each of these expressions.

00:02:37.944 --> 00:02:40.121
We number the expressions,
let's number them here.

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:41.787
Let's say this is expression one,

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.126
this is expression two,

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:45.115
this is expression three.

00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:47.339
We said that there's three paths

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.562
that we could take us here,

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:49.851
let's mark them out.

00:02:51.143 --> 00:02:53.263
There's this path,

00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:57.835
there's this path right
over here that gets us there

00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:01.119
and that's equivalent to picking the x

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:02.982
from expression one.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.339
Notice we picked the left hand side

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.939
then we go to the right hand side.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.246
We pick the y from expression two,

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:13.078
and then we pick the y
from expression three,

00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:14.683
the last two, we pick the right path,

00:03:14.683 --> 00:03:16.154
we picked the blue path.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.127
That's essentially one way

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:20.178
that we could choose two y's

00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:22.426
out of these three expressions.

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:24.713
Once again, one way to choose two y's

00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:26.530
out of three expressions

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.303
but we don't care about just that one,

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:29.785
we care about all of the different paths.

00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:31.098
This was one way,

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:33.292
another way would be to go like this.

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:36.703
Pick a y from the first one,
an x from the second one

00:03:36.703 --> 00:03:38.818
and a y from the third one.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:42.147
Or pick a y from the first expression,

00:03:42.147 --> 00:03:44.180
a y from the second expression

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.908
and an x from the third expression.

00:03:46.908 --> 00:03:51.100
It's really a kind of
fundamental mathematical level.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.377
It's solving the exact same problem.

00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:56.185
Hopefully this gives
you a little intuition

00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:59.136
on why Pascal's triangle is connected

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:00.577
to two combinatorics

00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:02.178
and why they're both useful

00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:04.447
for finding binomial expansions.
