00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.790
When a man and woman love each other very
much (and sometimes not) they end up making

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.790
a baby.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:18.430
And the woman's body goes through a ton of
changes, but then again, so does the man's!

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.010
Pregnancy causes a lot of visible (and invisible)
changes to mom bods.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.760
Mental, physical, hormonal, emotional, and
so on… but the moms aren't alone in this

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.830
brand new world, science has finally begun
to recognized Dads might be going through

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.719
changes right alongside.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.129
In 2007, a study came out describing Couvade
syndrome -- also known as sympathetic pregnancy.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.780
The study followed more than 500 men and found
a majority of the men displayed pregnancy-associated

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.629
symptoms of morning sickness, stomach cramps,
mood swings, and a few developed swollen stomachs

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:51.999
(called pseudocyesis).

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.549
A ton of studies have documented these sympathetic
effects, which worsen as the pregnancy progresses,

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.379
clearing up after the birth.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.120
They're not sure exactly what causes Couvade
Syndrome, but they think it's psychosomatic

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.860
-- or caused by the mind; thus, it's not a
medical condition, but a psychological one.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.030
So though sympathetic pregnancy might be caused
by anxiety, attention-seeking behavior, or

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.899
as a quote "statement of paternity" as some
hypotheses say… there are actual changes

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.460
men go through during pregnancy.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.100
Male marmosets and cotton-top tamarins, primates
with similar child-rearing practices to humans,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.200
gain as much as 20 percent of their body weight
during their mate's pregnancy -- perhaps to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.280
store extra energy in preparation of raising
their offspring.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.609
Studies in humans found cortisol (a stress
hormone) and prolactin (lactation hormones)

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.460
spike in men alongside their pregnant ladies.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.759
Recently, a study from the University of Michigan
found surprising hormonal changes in fathers

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.659
which started rather quickly.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.450
Within the first 12 weeks of their mate's
pregnancy, testosterone and estradiol levels

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.909
dropped in the Dads-to-be, and the drop continued
to throughout the pregnancy.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.360
The researchers admitted they don't know why,
but they expect it has something to do with

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.670
the changes the woman's body is going through,
perhaps to prepare the men as they quote "transition

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.670
to fatherhood."

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.250
Anecdotally, it might be a good thing for
testosterone to drop, as it's associated with

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.660
aggression, risk-taking and sexual savoir
faire; but curiously it rose in women over

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.660
the same period!

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.260
Estradiol is similar to estrogen, and estrogen
in men hasn't been very thoroughly studied;

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.060
though scientists think a drop in estrogen
in men show symptoms similar to menopause

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.220
in women: i.e. -- decreased bone density,
a decline in libido, and fat around their

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.220
midsection.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.220
And finally… we can't talk about fatherhood
without mentioning the infamous Dadbod; well,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.220
sort of.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.380
Men who lived with their child gained 2.6
percent in their BMI or an average of 2 kilograms.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.120
Men who lived apart still gained one-and-a-half
kilos, or a 2 percent BMI increase.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.210
The study, in the American Journal of Men's
Health found lifestyle changes caused weight

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.930
gain, but could this be explained by a lowering
of estradiol levels?

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.930
Maybe?

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.530
Ultimately, most of the studies of pregnancy
are lady-facing, which makes ALL the sense,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.960
but to completely dismiss or ignore men because
they're not actually pregnant seems kinda

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.460
stupid; especially in light of the surprising
science we've seen.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.320
Humans evolved two-parent caregiving to give
our offspring the best parental resources

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.650
available and that does seem to extend pre-birth.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.360
Say it with me now.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360
More.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.360
Research.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.360
Is.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.360
OBVIOUSLY.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360
Needed.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.360
What do you think about sympathetic pregnancy?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360
Is it real?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.360
Have any of you experienced it?

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360
We KNOW some of you out there are parents.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.670
Hey parents, if you haven't subscribed, go
sign in and subscribe.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.670
Really.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.670
You won't regret it.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.800
And we'd love to know you're out there, so
we can make more videos for you too.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.250
Do y'all know some other things about pregnancy?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.060
Are you sure they're not myths?

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.930
