00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
Thank you.
- I've never understood

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.900
why we can't just use

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.280
our side of the arm rest, you know?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.647
Like, you, just like use
the edge of it, you know?

00:00:07.647 --> 00:00:10.163
I don't think that's so bad.
- [Nikki] Like share an edge?

00:00:10.163 --> 00:00:10.996
- Yeah, both have an arm on the edge.

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:12.100
- Because then your arms will touch,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.306
and that will not be fun.
- That'll make you gay.

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:16.889
(upbeat music)

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.760
We're back, it's You Up with Nikki Glaser.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.600
We're in the middle of
talking to Pete Lee.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.070
I wanna just get to how you
met your girlfriend because

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.810
you met your girlfriend on a plane.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.670
I think we talked about it--
- Flying to see you. (laughs)

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.990
- Flying to see me and possibly--

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.610
- With a possible hook-up--

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.443
- Scenario.

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:37.230
- Yes, scenario, and--

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.063
- Between you or?

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:39.940
- Okay, so, (stammers).

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.773
For any listener--
- Her.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.860
who doesn't know the
history of me and Pete Lee,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.720
and then how this lovely lady,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.770
who is one of my best friends came to be,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.700
is that Pete Lee and I
fell in love when I was 20,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.764
you were like 43.

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:55.014
(laughter)

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.200
Pete Lee was my first love.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.430
We fell in love.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040
I was on the road in Kansas City.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.840
He was on the road, I lived there.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.900
I was doing a guest set, he was featuring.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.410
We met, we had a weekend
together, we fell in love,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.870
we had sex at the end of the weekend,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.830
which we all know what happens,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.140
I've talked about it already.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.973
And,

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:15.881
(laughter)

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:16.714
first orgasm.

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:17.593
Not a big deal, okay.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.363
Major deal to a woman.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.843
So I fell in love with him,

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.860
we were gonna be together forever,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.910
he had a girlfriend back in New York,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.620
who he was gonna break up with,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.660
and I was gonna move to New
York after I graduate college,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.493
and go live with him.

00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:33.370
He never broke up with her.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.200
He chose her over me, Bachelor style.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.250
(laughter)
He loved us both, apparently.

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:41.250
But then I never talked to him.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.397
I said when he broke
up with me, I was like

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:43.580
I'm never gonna talk to you again,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.770
and I didn't talk to him for 11-ish years.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.350
- [Pete] 11-ish years.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.170
And we were both doing comedy
and would see each other,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.003
never saw him.

00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.850
Finally, I started hating someone else

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.421
more than I hated you.

00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:55.254
(laughter)
It freed up space

00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:57.020
to be friends with you because I was like,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.790
I want him back in my life, he's,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.660
he married that girl, by the way.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.530
He made the right choice at the time.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.740
- At the time, it was, it's like war.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.040
It's, everything's okay
until nothing's okay.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.240
And then the marriage fell apart.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.710
I became--
I was elated

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.377
to hear that news when I did.

00:02:14.377 --> 00:02:16.196
It was like the greatest
news ever it was like.

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:20.297
(evil laugh)
(laughter)

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:21.330
It was that laugh.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.630
Your laughing like the lady

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.827
that stole the Little Mermaid's voice.

00:02:24.827 --> 00:02:26.020
(laughter)

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.380
- Ursula, oh my god, totally.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.175
It makes me evil how much I
loved that you were in pain.

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:34.187
(laughter)

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.830
Oh, I loved it.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.673
So then,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.280
so then, I ended up, and
then Pete was single.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.620
I knew that, but I didn't really care.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.477
He reached out to be like,

00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:46.900
"Hey, can we talk about what happened 10,"

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.430
I think it was like 9 years at that point.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.170
You were like, we ran
into each other at Stand.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.003
It was awkward.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.400
You brought me on stage
'cause we had never had

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.100
to interact at all.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.480
And I went to The Stand one night,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.690
and he was hosting and I was like,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.100
I'm on the show, he has to say my name,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.150
I have to shake his hand.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.250
Shit.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.590
I go on stage, I just go, this is weird.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.830
Or what did I say?
- You go, "This is not ideal."

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.294
- This is not ideal.

00:03:06.294 --> 00:03:07.440
(laughter)
And then I just took the mic,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.720
and was like I ain't run.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.290
And then I got home,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.770
I had an email from Pete being like,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.650
that was not ideal was the subject.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.450
- Subject, this is not ideal. (laughs)

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.647
- And then he wrote, he was like,

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:17.727
"Hey, it's been a long time.

00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:18.787
"I have a lot to tell you.

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:21.137
"I made a promise to my
ex-wife that I would never talk

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:22.710
"to you again, like I
wouldn't reach out to you."

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.827
Which makes sense.

00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:26.467
"So I never had a chance to
tell you how I felt about it,

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:28.037
"and why I chose it and all this,

00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:30.450
"and I would love to get
coffee and talk about it."

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.240
And I was like no thanks, still hate you.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.620
Not ready for, this is enough closure.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.750
Like hello, goodbye,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.170
no friendship.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.050
Then, then I started hating someone else

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.400
with the same venom that I
hate you for 11 years almost.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.830
And the one night I saw you at The Stand,

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.940
and you were in some
interaction with someone,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.880
having a conversation.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.980
And I was like oh I want,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.420
you would always be talking to my friends,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.530
and I couldn't talk to them

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.830
because you would be talking to them,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.040
and I had to not talk to you.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.280
So one night you were talking
to Yanis and some people,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.200
and I just remember you
said something funny,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.300
and I looked at you,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.548
'cause I was involved in the
conversation at this point.

00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:07.381
And I looked at you and I was like,

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:09.080
oh, I don't hate him anymore.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.492
And I was like that's so weird.

00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:11.360
(laughter)

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.210
It just was this thing
that was there forever,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.043
and it just wasn't.

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:17.450
And I was like, I felt
an affection for him.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.120
Not like oh, sparks, but it was just like,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.360
ah Pete,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.253
I miss you.

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:25.459
And it was because I hated someone else,

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:27.780
and I'm monogamous with hate,
(laughter)

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.660
and I'm polyamorous with love.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.293
But I can only hate one man at a time.

00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:32.850
- I think we should all do that.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.720
I think we should all pick one
person in our lives to hate.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.553
- [Nikki] Yes.

00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:37.880
- And then one to love.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.474
- And now I don't even
hate that guy anymore,

00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:40.463
so I don't know who I hate now, that's--

00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:42.668
- When you started to not
hate that guy anymore,

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:43.501
I was like uh.

00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:46.030
- I know, I know.
(laughter)

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.863
Watch out.

00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:48.400
- Yeah, I felt like a baseball player

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.233
that's having a bad season.

00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:51.880
I'm like, I'm gonna be traded.
(laughter)

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.435
I am out.

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:54.763
- Battin' a nice 200.

00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:55.900
(laughter)

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.820
- So am I telling,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.630
is there anything you'd like to interject?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.463
At this point?

00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:00.410
- No, I, first of all,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.150
you've told it very efficiently.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.070
- Yeah, I've told it so many times,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.170
I'm just getting through,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.003
just so you can get to you meeting--

00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:06.550
- Reader's Digest, yeah.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.190
- So then,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.380
he writes and then that night, I was like,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.700
oh I wanna be friends with him again.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.350
Then, I was still, I think
still in a relationship

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.170
at the time and then I
broke up with my boyfriend.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.870
I heard Pete Lee had
broken up with a girlfriend

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.470
that he was with after his marriage ended.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.130
And I was like oh we're both single,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.530
he's someone I had sex with before.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.180
This would be an easy thing to just like,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.850
I need to get back on the horse.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.683
Ya know.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.552
I should just have casual
sex with Pete Lee probably.

00:05:31.552 --> 00:05:33.170
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.760
Not like pursue a relationship,
but see what's there.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.593
- [Pete] She was like,

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:37.630
"This is ideal.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.200
- This is ideal.
(laughter)

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.100
This is ideal.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.420
So I wrote you and was like
hey, let's get that coffee.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.924
I'm ready to be friends
or whatever it was I said.

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:46.250
(laughter)

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.360
And then, Jaime, is this weird?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.150
I know it's, you're the coolest.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.983
What?

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:52.816
- Coaching him, and--

00:05:52.816 --> 00:05:53.817
- [Nikki] Oh yeah, yeah we'll get to that.

00:05:53.817 --> 00:05:54.650
- [Pete] Oh you guys knew
each other at the time.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.030
- We'll totally get to that, that's so,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.867
it's so insane.

00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:58.700
So then.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.897
So then, I reach out to
him 'cause my friend goes,

00:06:00.897 --> 00:06:02.260
"Oh, Pete broke up with this girl."

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.750
And I was like, oh I need to have sex,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.500
and I'll, I'm ready to
be friends with him.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.350
I already knew that.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.710
And so I reached out to you.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.850
You were in LA at the
time, I knew you were.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.627
And I was like let's hang
out and you were like,

00:06:13.627 --> 00:06:15.290
"Hey, I'm really busy."

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.890
And I was like oh he's not single.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.080
There' no, he would make
time to hang out with me

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.210
if he were single, I just know it.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.060
- Yeah, I would've.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.900
- And whether or not you
wanted to sleep with, we,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.970
there was, we have a good friendship.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.773
Or it was always there,
that chemistry of good love.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.350
And so I was like, I just sensed
the girl was still around.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.707
And so you were like,

00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:39.937
"I'm running sets for Fallon,
I'm working on my Fallon set,

00:06:39.937 --> 00:06:41.120
"so I don't have any free nights."

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.180
And I was like well I'm taking
the nights off of comedy,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.932
so I have no sets and I
won't be seeing you anywhere.

00:06:45.932 --> 00:06:47.310
(laughter)
I remember saying that.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.330
And really believing it.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.530
And then I got asked to
do this set last minute,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.140
and I was like ah, I have
nothing to do tonight.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.230
I walk in and Pete's there with that girl,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.460
so my lie is now--
- Wow, yeah.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.570
- It wasn't even, and I have
to walk by, it was just.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.620
And but we were like, I was like hi.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.733
I think I just grabbed
your shoulder or something.

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:03.820
- We hugged, you and I hugged,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.200
and she was not happy about that.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.260
- I knew her from before you.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.270
I was friends with her ex-boyfriend.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.940
And she iced me that night and I was like,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.270
whoa this isn't good.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.180
So I quickly left after my set.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.840
Cut to, we started being friends again.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.120
Shortly after that, you
were still with her,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.944
and then, can I get in on this?

00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:23.830
- Yeah it was at the end,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.880
and it was at the end of her and I,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.253
and things were rocky.

00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:31.300
And then Nikki and I were
legitimately just friends,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.460
but I had her saved in my
phone as a different name

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.460
'cause I felt weird.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.630
- That's always a good
feeling inside, isn't it?

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.817
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:39.817 --> 00:07:40.650
(laughter)

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.483
- And I knew it.
- At one point you--

00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:42.316
I go, Pete,

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:45.620
we're really emotionally
involved right now.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.160
We were just talking on
the phone all the time,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.240
always friends.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.580
Nothing, nothing that your ex-girlfriend

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.777
could've overheard and been like,

00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:52.610
"You guys!"

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.490
Like nothing.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.080
- Yeah, zero perversion.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.300
- Zero, literally zero.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.850
But I go, I have a feeling
that she doesn't know.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.810
I would only get to talk to
you when she wasn't around.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.410
She didn't know, but I just had a feeling,

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.910
because she's wasn't someone
that would be able to handle

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.890
you having a girl friend
as close as we were.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.367
- [Pete] That's a good way to say it.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.940
- And so, I said, I'm gonna say, I go,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.690
I have a feeling that
right now I'm in your phone

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.840
not as Nikki Glaser, like it is.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.673
And you were like,

00:08:20.673 --> 00:08:22.920
"Yeah, you're, you're not."

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.080
- Yeah.
- Like you're--

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.720
- You are, yeah, you are not,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.623
you're saved as my friend Josh Wade.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.370
Still, when Josh Wade
texts me, I'm like Nikki.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.600
It's really weird. (laughs)
- And so then I was like,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.010
you got, this is gonna end.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.740
I gotta pull out because you're getting

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.730
the fun of like friend,
like this emotional support

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.370
that I know you're not
getting in your relationship,

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.440
and I'm providing that for you

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.253
because she is not nice.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.323
And so I'm gonna pull out.

00:08:47.323 --> 00:08:48.980
So I'll talk to you in two
weeks when you guys break up

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.540
because there's now way
that you're gonna be able

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.750
to stay with her without
having me as your friend,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.610
talking you through it.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.780
- The table leg.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.060
- The, I was a table
leg and I pulled it out

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.130
'cause your table is
now gonna be unsteady.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.987
Two weeks later he's like,

00:09:00.987 --> 00:09:01.970
"We broke up.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.803
And I wrote back ha ha ha.

00:09:03.803 --> 00:09:05.280
(laughter)

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.340
And you, and then I called
you and you were crying.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.920
- I called you, yeah, you
called me, I was crying

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.270
pathetically in a hotel in Iowa,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.500
which is even worse.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.080
- Yeah, that's a bad spot to cry.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.367
- Yeah and then Nikki
was like, she was like,

00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:19.200
"Where are you?"

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.866
"I'll come see you." And
blah blah blah blah blah.

00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:21.730
- [Nikki] No, I literally said

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.070
I just got out of a relationship too.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.530
Do you wanna have sex with each other,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.156
and project our feelings about
our exes onto each other?

00:09:27.156 --> 00:09:28.364
- Yeah.

00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:29.197
- I'll come find you.

00:09:29.197 --> 00:09:30.330
So we looked at our schedules.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.140
I was like you're in
Chicago, I can fly out there.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.590
I almost bought a ticket
and then I was like,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.600
no that's ridiculous.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.530
You're gonna be in LA in a couple weeks.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.363
So then?

00:09:37.363 --> 00:09:39.370
- Yeah, so I was like
yeah I'm gonna be in LA

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.137
next weekend and you were like,

00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:41.970
"Oh what for?"

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.020
And I was just like
stuff, meetings, whatever,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.423
but it was to go see her.

00:09:46.295 --> 00:09:47.128
But I couldn't admit that

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.347
'cause of cool guy stuff,
you know I'm so cool.

00:09:49.347 --> 00:09:50.600
(laughter)

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.360
I'm flying there that weekend,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.664
and I sit down next to Jaime on the plane.

00:09:55.664 --> 00:09:58.832
- Randomly sit next to
this girl on the plane.

00:09:58.832 --> 00:09:59.665
- Randomly sit next to it,

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:02.230
and we were sitting in
the last row, first class,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.580
the reason being, tying this all together,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.230
we don't wanna recline our seats on anyone

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.147
'cause we're both nice, people pleasers.

00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:09.980
(laughter)

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.853
And, yeah, and so I say hello to her.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.560
I was like yeah, I'm gonna
go to sleep, blah blah blah,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.910
bathroom and then she wraps
her sweater around her head

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.000
and falls asleep 'cause she

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.760
calls herself an ugly sleeper.
- 'Cause that's what she does.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.538
- She says.
- Yeah.

00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:24.371
(laughter)

00:10:24.371 --> 00:10:26.650
- And so she creates a
cocoon around her head

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.320
so no one can see her ugly sleep.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.790
It's brilliant.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.791
I respect it.
- It's brilliant.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:32.579
- It also makes it dark,
which is quite nice.

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:34.418
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

00:10:34.418 --> 00:10:35.570
- [Jaime] Protects all the parts.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.581
- Yeah, everything, you're protected.

00:10:37.581 --> 00:10:38.414
I love it.
- Everything.

00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:41.490
So she, so then we wake up
about two hours into the flight,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.990
and I start telling her,
yeah I'm going to see Nikki,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.700
and like we were friends,
I tell her the whole story.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.210
I just, you know, we just told.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.920
And so she's rooting for us, you know?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.730
I remember the next day,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.230
'cause we got there, you
stayed the night at my hotel,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.070
nothin' happened.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.083
- Well, I got my dogs out for the night,

00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:01.860
I was like I'm goin' to Pete Lee's.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.600
I packed my little bag.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.240
I just, (laughs) I had just taped,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.430
I was coming from a
taping of Drop the Mic,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.850
which is a rap battle competition,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.289
another worse idea I ever signed up for,

00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:13.315
(laughter)

00:11:13.315 --> 00:11:15.770
where I competed in a rap battle.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.570
And I rap taping and I had my car service

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.670
just take me straight to The Roosevelt,

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.030
to go hang out with you.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.780
- To go hang out and
the thing we're missing

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.210
is we had lunch and I landed,

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.990
and then I told you about her.
- Oh yeah.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.823
You told me about her, yeah!

00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:28.940
- I told you about her,
which is not a good move,

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.010
but the reason why I told you
about it is 'cause I was like

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.680
we're friends and I
don't wanna be dishonest,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.660
but then also you're
kind of a cock, you know?

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.540
And whatever.
- Oh right, yeah.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.200
- So I was like if there's
anybody that'd be cool

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.530
with meeting a girl that
I vibed with, it'd be you,

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.490
and nothing happened.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.270
- Exactly, that's a good point.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.770
- That's funny, you are kind of a cock.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.440
- I am, I like hearing about guys I like

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.790
being into other women
and them being into them.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.530
So that was a, I didn't
realize that was a move

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.080
you were doing, but.
(laughter)

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.290
- I wasn't really doing a--

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.620
- And it didn't work
(laughs) because I went over

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.910
to your hotel room and there was,

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.470
I was just like we're just friends.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.580
What are we doing?

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.970
- It was so weird.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.313
It was just so weird.

00:12:07.313 --> 00:12:09.620
- But, I had gotten my, I had already

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.000
had the night from the dogs,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.810
I was far away from my apartment,

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.290
and I go,

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.340
Pete, I, we were just like, it was just,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.060
we were having fun, but it was like,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.320
when are we gonna hook up, if at all?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.160
You know, that vibe?

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.040
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.410
- And I was just like,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.150
Pete, I gotta be honest.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.560
I'm just feelin' a friend vibe right now.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.587
And you were like,

00:12:28.587 --> 00:12:30.290
"Oh my god thank god, me too."

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.450
And we were both, and I go,

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.740
can I still spend the night

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.960
'cause I don't wanna go back home?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.710
Can I just sleep in the same bed?

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.960
And so we slept next to
each other as friends.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.530
I had my noise-canceling headphones,

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.363
and my sleep mask.

00:12:40.363 --> 00:12:42.560
He had his sleep apnea machine on.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.530
- CPAP machine.
(laughter)

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.200
Hell yeah.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.910
I kept thinkin' the whole night,

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.920
when's she gonna come over
and make a move, ya know?

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.885
- [Guy] That's the clench it,
the old sleep apnea machine.

00:12:52.885 --> 00:12:54.295
(Nikki blows air)

00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:55.128
(laughter)

00:12:55.128 --> 00:12:57.030
It would be great if you had
like a Darth Vader fetish,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.530
and that was your way of getting her.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.510
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.320
- Okay, Pete Lee, back to you
meeting the love of your life

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.223
on a plane.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.710
So you flew to LA, you meet this girl,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.490
you're telling this girl
about this other girl

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.960
that you're gonna meet that,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.712
and what was her advice to you?

00:13:13.712 --> 00:13:15.500
What did you think about this
girl when you first saw her?

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.510
Was there like,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.420
I mean you were obviously
attracted to her.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.210
- Very attracted to her eyes were just,

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.893
I was melting with her eyes.

00:13:24.108 --> 00:13:24.941
And I remember thinking--

00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:26.549
- [Nikki] I know the feeling,
I saw her last night,

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:27.382
and the night before.
- Yeah, right?

00:13:27.382 --> 00:13:28.550
Those eyes.
- It's crazy.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.690
She's so pretty.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.822
- She's so pretty and she had
such a chill, warm, deep vibe.

00:13:33.822 --> 00:13:36.310
- And she talks like this,
like she just talks like,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.120
so very like.
(laughter)

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.440
It's just earnest and kinda just,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.350
she's I hears you and
will put her arm on you,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.840
and just, you feel understood.
(laughter)

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.820
I said this the other day,

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.290
but one night I was crying at the cellar

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.930
because some said something,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.540
and she just, I didn't even know her.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.970
It was the first time I had met her,

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.040
and she reached across
the table and was like,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.760
"Can I hold your hand?"

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.110
And she held my hand as
I weeped into my hummus.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.280
And then later, and it felt so nice,

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.890
and I'm really uncomfortable
with hand-holding.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.620
I've never held hands with
boyfriends or any, it just--

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.300
- Yeah, we've never held hands. (laughs)

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.820
- My parents don't hold my hands,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.253
as a kid I just crossed
the street on my own.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.680
And so I was like I hold your hand,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.890
'cause she seems like she knows
that this is gonna help me,

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.090
and I trust her.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.420
And then she, the thing that killed me was

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.827
later on, she wrote me a text that said,

00:14:24.827 --> 00:14:26.560
"Thank you for letting me hold your hand."

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.240
And I wept when I read that.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.660
It was so sweet 'cause I was like,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.030
that was hard for me to do
and she acknowledged it.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.300
It was so, and I'm like,

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.537
why is she thanking me?

00:14:35.537 --> 00:14:36.750
She was comforting me!

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.420
She's a god damn angel!

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.363
Okay, go on.

00:14:39.363 --> 00:14:40.196
- [Pete] Yeah.
(laughter)

00:14:40.196 --> 00:14:41.029
She's a magic person.

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:42.620
- She really is.
- She really is.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.290
Yeah, so then, I just,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.190
I felt such a deep connection.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.730
When I left her at the airport,

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.390
I missed her, like immediately.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.850
And then,

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.410
we went on our separate
ways and stayed in touch

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.733
via Instagram.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.850
I remember the next day, I was like,

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.080
yeah it didn't work out, blah blah blah.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.750
We went back and forth
and talked about that.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.350
Just kinda stayed in
touch, like at a distance,

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.610
for a long time.
- Sure, yeah.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.610
- For a long, long time.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.820
And then, yeah and then,

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.130
I was single and I was dating.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.180
You and I were kinda, I
don't know how to say it,

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.010
like single together, you know?

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.100
It would be like awful date, come back,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.210
talk to each other on the
phone kind of a thing.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.450
All of the, just the worst
of the worst situations.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.887
And you always went,

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.247
"But what about plane girl?

00:15:31.247 --> 00:15:32.740
"What about plane girl?"

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.960
And then it turned out that I--

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.107
- P-L-A-N-E.

00:15:35.107 --> 00:15:37.419
(laughter)

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:38.259
- Shawn was like,

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:40.307
"Wow, what a shitty thing to call you.

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:42.743
(laughter)

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:44.012
- "What about plane girl?"

00:15:44.012 --> 00:15:45.046
Well because,
(laughter)

00:15:45.046 --> 00:15:48.290
when I landed that day and I told you,

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.667
you looked at her Instagram
and you go, you're like,

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.250
"I think something's there."

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.082
I go, first of all you look alike.

00:15:54.082 --> 00:15:54.915
(laughter)
- You said that

00:15:54.915 --> 00:15:55.748
we look alike, but--

00:15:55.748 --> 00:15:56.581
- When two people look,

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.600
people are always drawn to
people who kinda look like them,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.460
and it's not an insult
like you look like a man,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.710
or that you look like a woman,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.540
even though you kinda do.
(laughter)

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.743
That was a joke, but no.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.000
You guys have similar things going on.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.420
- Similar features, I
have a joke in my act

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.330
where I can't ever lie
to her 'cause she can

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.558
open my phone with her face.

00:16:13.558 --> 00:16:15.893
(laughter)
- Ah, that's so funny!

00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:17.477
You had a joke last night that you go,

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.357
"You ever eat so much that your phone

00:16:19.357 --> 00:16:20.973
"doesn't recognize your face?"

00:16:20.973 --> 00:16:23.315
(laughter)

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.440
That was such a good joke.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.273
Oh my god.

00:16:26.273 --> 00:16:28.120
- That was basically, I
ate so much at a party

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.653
that I, my phone wouldn't
unlock and I was like,

00:16:30.653 --> 00:16:32.753
(laughter)
god Peter, what are you doing?

00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:35.767
You're off the rails.
- So funny.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.870
- But so, yeah so her and I,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.100
I remember when we finally
came back together,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.933
to meet up,

00:16:44.297 --> 00:16:47.200
I walked into the hotel
lobby where she was staying,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.530
and I just felt that
vibe, that energy again,

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.470
that deep connection of
like this is the person

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.360
you're supposed to be with.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.990
But when I first met
her, that was a few days

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.977
after I had gotten out
of that relationship.

00:16:57.977 --> 00:16:59.880
And I was like well anybody you meet,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.010
you're gonna vibe with them.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.480
And I didn't realize that you could go on,

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.210
you know, 20 dates and you
wouldn't vibe with any of them,

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.690
and that was such a special thing.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.940
- And a lot of times I
feel like people discount

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.310
who, they'll meet the person
they're meant to be with

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.037
right out of a relationship and they go,

00:17:15.037 --> 00:17:17.577
"But it's probably just
my out of a relationship,

00:17:17.577 --> 00:17:18.730
"like everyone's."

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:19.960
Because that does happen.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.870
And sometimes you can discredit
those actual true things,

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.840
and you need to come back
around to them later,

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.660
because you don't acknowledge
them for what they are

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.000
in the moment because
you can't because it's--

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.410
- [Shawn] You're clouded.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.370
- Yes.
- Like the idea

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.320
that it's impossible.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.790
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.460
- Yeah and it's so weird because, I said,

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.563
I told her I loved her like right away.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.270
I had a, you know my Ron Cagoni?

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.936
- [Nikki] Yeah.
- He told me, he was like,

00:17:44.936 --> 00:17:46.997
"Pump the breaks, pump the break, sister!

00:17:46.997 --> 00:17:47.830
"You're movin'

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.500
"at lesbian speed here."

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.333
(laughter)

00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:52.200
"Alright, there's gonna be a
moving van out front next."

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.840
And I was like, I just
kept telling people,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.890
no, no, she's really great.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:57.723
And they're like,

00:17:57.723 --> 00:17:59.347
"No, you move fast, you're moving fast.

00:18:00.609 --> 00:18:02.547
And then people, now that
they meet here, they're like,

00:18:02.547 --> 00:18:03.380
"What are you doin'?

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.857
"Move faster!

00:18:04.857 --> 00:18:06.800
"She's special, what's happening?"

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.070
'Cause yeah, when she meets people,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.758
she changes them.

00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:11.403
It's insane.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.580
- Last night Elna, even,

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.740
or we hung out last night and
we just talked about Jaime

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.850
after you guys left for the whole time.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.450
Just about how amazing she is.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.560
People get it right away.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.810
And it's not, that's not hyperbole.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:26.900
It is, there's something,

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.000
and I knew it when you guys finally,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.800
when you were connected, I was like,

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.590
uh oh, this is it.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.980
I felt it from your texts even about her.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.840
I was like yeah, this is.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.661
I was like can I be your best man?

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:40.930
(laughter)
I asked right away.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.990
- You said that, yeah.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.774
I texted you sex with a bunch of Xs.

00:18:44.774 --> 00:18:45.607
(laughs) And you wrote,

00:18:45.607 --> 00:18:46.885
"Can I be your best man?"

00:18:46.885 --> 00:18:49.135
(laughter)

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.933
- [Nikki] Can I?

00:18:50.933 --> 00:18:51.977
- Yeah, you can.

00:18:51.977 --> 00:18:52.810
- Okay, good.
- Seriously, you can.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.570
- [Nikki] Thank you, me and your brother?

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.950
- Yeah, you and Rob can be co-best men.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.320
- Okay, thank god.
- Best theys.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.153
(laughter)

00:18:59.153 --> 00:19:01.894
It's gonna be a
gender-neutral ceremony, but.

00:19:01.894 --> 00:19:02.727
(laughter)

00:19:02.727 --> 00:19:04.949
But yeah, I remember I
sent you a picture of us

00:19:04.949 --> 00:19:06.087
fairly early on, and you go,

00:19:06.087 --> 00:19:08.150
"Oh my god, that looks like
an engagement picture."

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.520
And then I sent you,

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.040
it was one of the first times

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.140
that we were really hanging out.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.370
And we were having sex,
like I sent you a picture

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.860
of us.
(laughter)

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.450
We were just like in bed, but
we have shirts on and stuff.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.850
- It was too,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.877
it was too in bed for like a,
(laughter)

00:19:24.877 --> 00:19:27.335
it was too, it was too in--

00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:28.880
- But that's what those throws will do,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.780
is you'll lose the filter all night.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.737
- Yes!
- Well this is where,

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:32.769
this is the one.

00:19:32.769 --> 00:19:34.237
- You're right, you're
so in it, you're like,

00:19:34.237 --> 00:19:35.950
"People gotta see this.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.286
- Look at what we have.
(laughter)

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:39.110
Look, he loves me!

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.857
- And you go, (laughs) you wrote back,

00:19:40.857 --> 00:19:44.228
"Okay... I gotta set
some boundaries here."

00:19:44.228 --> 00:19:45.655
(laughter)

00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:46.637
'Cause I, you go,

00:19:46.637 --> 00:19:49.000
"I feel like I'm having a
three-way with you two right now."

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.857
- I thought you guys, it felt
like when you guys are like,

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.470
"We can't wait to meet you."

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.470
It felt like that kind
of vibe and I'm like,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.710
I don't like this.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.570
I'm so happy for you.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.270
And the thing was, I was already
becoming friends with her

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.834
through your texts.

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:03.800
You'd be like, "Jaime said
she can't wait to meet you."

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.880
And I'm like I can't wait to meet her.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.823
And then I called you once,

00:20:07.689 --> 00:20:08.522
and you were in the car together.

00:20:08.522 --> 00:20:09.840
That was the first time we talked, Jaime,

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.760
was in the car when you guys were driving,

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.820
on the way to something.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.945
And I think I just,

00:20:13.945 --> 00:20:14.900
what?

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.324
- You were worried about something

00:20:16.324 --> 00:20:18.013
(laughs) getting stuck in you.

00:20:18.013 --> 00:20:19.350
That is so funny.
- Oh wait.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.220
What story was that?

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.900
Oh, when there was a cap stuck in me?

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.733
- [Jaime] Yes.

00:20:23.733 --> 00:20:25.200
- Yeah, yeah, I don't, that's so,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.990
oh my god that's so weird.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.440
I remember I was getting done with a run,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.430
and then I called you.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.810
And whenever I get done with
a run, I just run a lot,

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.390
so I'm like (speaking gibberish).

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.370
And I'm talking so fast
and I remember being like,

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.640
she's gonna think I'm psycho.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.290
And then I was talking about, oh!

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.740
'Cause I was talking about
Sully landing on the Hudson.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.490
Because I was running along
the Hudson and I was like,

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.310
I'm right by where Sully landed.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.890
And I remember the day Sully landed,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.830
because that was the day
that my boyfriend found

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.460
a weird cap inside my vagina
(laughter)

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.330
that was left by an, and
I mean it's a crazy story.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.430
But he was (stammers).

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:58.158
- Please just finish
the sentence about why

00:20:58.158 --> 00:20:59.651
there's a cap inside you.
- Yeah why was there

00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:01.673
a cap in you?
- Do you not know this story?

00:21:01.673 --> 00:21:02.734
- I have never heard this
story, I don't think.

00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:04.048
- No way.
- It's a great story.

00:21:04.048 --> 00:21:05.137
- Okay.
- I'm pretty sure

00:21:05.137 --> 00:21:06.150
I've never heard this one.
- How many minutes do we have?

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:06.983
- [Woman] Eight, go, go.

00:21:06.983 --> 00:21:07.816
- Oh my god.
(laughter)

00:21:07.816 --> 00:21:10.050
I'm so sorry that this, I'm really,

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.390
I hate that it is.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.364
So, January 17th, 2,000.

00:21:15.364 --> 00:21:16.710
(laughter)

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.260
Whatever he landed on the Hudson,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.060
I got a hotel room, I was in St. Louis.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.300
My boyfriend and I both lived
with out parents at the time.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.520
I was like, we were both drunk and broke.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.120
And I got us a hotel room that night,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.130
and I remember I was waiting all day

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.020
for him to get off work. He
showed up, we're having sex.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.990
He goes, what,

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.543
we had just started dating,
maybe a couple weeks then.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:34.497
And he was like,

00:21:34.497 --> 00:21:35.330
"What is that?

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.960
And I'm like what is what?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.793
And he's like,

00:21:37.793 --> 00:21:40.800
"I feel something scraping my dick."

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.210
and I'm like what?
- Oh shit.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.360
- I don't have an IUD or anything,

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.140
so I was like what, I was really offended.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.973
And he's like,

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:48.970
"I swear to god."

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.720
And I was like what are you talking about?

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.502
And so then I reach inside
myself and I was like,

00:21:52.502 --> 00:21:54.234
(gasps) what is that?

00:21:54.234 --> 00:21:55.067
What is that?

00:21:55.067 --> 00:21:57.037
And he's like, "I don't
know, I felt it for a while.

00:21:57.037 --> 00:21:58.080
"I didn't want to say anything."

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.390
And I'm like I don't know what that is!

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.870
I'm really, and I was just so embarrassed.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.260
I'm getting embarrassed
right now even reliving it.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.173
'Cause I was like I
don't put things in me.

00:22:07.173 --> 00:22:08.690
(laughter)
I don't have anything in me.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.490
And so, he, my fingers weren't
long enough to get it out.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.630
It was so lodged up.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.761
So he had longer fingers, so
he fuckin' slender man's up,

00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:20.790
(laughter)
and forceps it out.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.690
It is a blue cap, it
looks like ChapStick cap.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.440
- Oh, damn.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.080
You're dry and you
thought that would fix it?

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.735
- I did, doesn't that make sense?

00:22:29.735 --> 00:22:31.985
(laughter)

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.680
But the ChapStick was nowhere to be found,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.420
and it still exists up there.
(laughter)

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.980
Anyway, I mean trying to
make a long story short.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.110
I pull it out, I am like
I don't know what this is.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.943
And he's like,

00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:47.933
"Yeah right, why would you
have something in you?"

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:49.750
And I'm like I don't know what it is.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.033
I kept it, 'cause I was like
I'm gonna figure this out.

00:22:54.978 --> 00:22:57.620
I don't, I call my doctor and I'm like

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.900
is there anyway you could've
left something in me?

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.760
And I'm like I'm gonna make some money.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.650
Because this is bad malpractice.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.570
- Sure.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.357
- And then I got a
lawyer and they're like,

00:23:07.357 --> 00:23:08.837
"Are you affected, were you,

00:23:08.837 --> 00:23:10.290
"is your health impacted at all?"

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.333
And I'm like, 'cause I went back to,

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:14.530
it would've been a year
that it was left in me,

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.165
based on the last time
I was at the doctor.

00:23:16.165 --> 00:23:16.998
- Jesus.

00:23:16.998 --> 00:23:19.030
- And that's the only time
things are in my vagina,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.890
like, things, you know?
- Right.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:21.780
- When they are doctors down there--

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.123
- Odds and ends. (laughs)

00:23:23.123 --> 00:23:24.480
- Buttons, legs.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.313
- Yeah, you don't know what's goin' on.

00:23:25.313 --> 00:23:27.640
There's a sheet, you're
just like whatever.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.473
Willy-nilly.

00:23:29.823 --> 00:23:31.870
And so, I remember the lawyer being like,

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.030
"Were you affected at all?"

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.050
And I was like, I mean
emotionally, it was embarrassing.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.055
He's like,

00:23:37.055 --> 00:23:38.784
"Maybe there's something
there, but probably not."

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:39.750
And I was like damn it.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.960
So then I convinced my
boyfriends at the time that,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.070
he believed me.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.810
I was like I truly don't know what it was.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.430
It's so weird.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.860
I was gonna string it on a
necklace for Valentine's Day

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.693
as a joke.

00:23:50.693 --> 00:23:52.466
Never did that, grateful that I didn't.

00:23:52.466 --> 00:23:53.693
(laughter)

00:23:53.693 --> 00:23:57.057
And then I, one night, I was like

00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.410
I'm gonna Google

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.450
blue cap vagina and just see what pops up.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.700
And sure enough, there
was a girl that posted

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.837
on a message board,

00:24:05.837 --> 00:24:07.827
"I found a blue cap in my vagina.

00:24:07.827 --> 00:24:08.977
"I don't know what it is.

00:24:08.977 --> 00:24:12.890
"Does anyone else have this, found this?"

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.270
And there was a picture of it,

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.540
and it was the same thing.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.450
And I was like--
- Whoa.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:21.003
- Oh my god, I found my like
Traveling Pants sisterhood.

00:24:21.003 --> 00:24:25.140
So I emailed her and I was
like, girl, I have this.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.980
I took a picture of mine, I was like we

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.813
what is this?

00:24:27.813 --> 00:24:29.479
And she was like, "I
don't know what it is!"

00:24:29.479 --> 00:24:30.340
She lived in Des Moines.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.400
I was supposed to be in
Des Moines the next weekend

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.233
at the Funny Bone.
- Wow.

00:24:33.233 --> 00:24:35.547
And I go, come to a show,
I'll get you in, she's like,

00:24:35.547 --> 00:24:36.730
"I'm not interested."
(laughter)

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.850
She literally did not go to the show.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.830
- That's insane.
- And I gave her free tickets,

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.660
and she's my age and a
cool girl, I thought.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.160
I was like, what--

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.458
- Cool girl type of girl
who has caps in her pussy.

00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:46.730
(laughter)
- Yeah, cool cap girl.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:47.823
- She's verified.

00:24:48.983 --> 00:24:50.292
(laughter)
- It literally has a blue.

00:24:50.292 --> 00:24:53.207
(laughter)

00:24:53.207 --> 00:24:55.310
So, she never showed, but
she got weird about it.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.143
She was like,

00:24:56.143 --> 00:24:57.270
"I think this is a government conspiracy.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.280
I think it's a camera.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.200
I think that doctors are
doing some weird shit."

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.780
And I was like (breathes deeply),

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.100
I don't know if I believe that.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.030
And so I kinda left it alone.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.110
Couple more years pass
and I was just like,

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.430
well there's one girl with a blue cap.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:09.660
We still don't know what it is.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.980
Doesn't have a serial number on it.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.830
It's just a plastic
ChapStick cap lid size thing.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.870
And then I Googled it one
more time, years later,

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.940
and another thing came up
and it was another girl

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:21.837
in a message board that said,

00:25:21.837 --> 00:25:23.800
"I found a blue cap in my vagina."

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.350
(laughter)
And then,

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.067
there was a response to it that said,

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:29.337
"That's a Monistat cap

00:25:29.337 --> 00:25:31.000
"from a Monistat

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.773
thing.

00:25:32.773 --> 00:25:35.830
So I had given myself, I
guess I had a yeast infection

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.100
at one point, which I didn't
even remember ever having one.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.250
I literally was like I've never put any,

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.090
I don't remember having one, but I,

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.070
you know when you do a thing?

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.190
There's a cap that you're
supposed to take off

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.500
that many--
- Oh!

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.960
- Many bitches are forgettin'
to take this cap off.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.110
And I did it to myself and so I wrote back

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.410
the Des Moines girl to be like hey girl,

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.250
long time no talk. (laughs)

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.840
I'm not coming back to town anytime soon,

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.673
but I found out what the,

00:25:58.673 --> 00:26:01.040
it's not an alien- government conspiracy.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.910
Like you, you and I are
stupid and don't know how

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.717
Monistat works, and she was like,

00:26:05.717 --> 00:26:07.675
"No, I still think it's..."
(laughter)

00:26:07.675 --> 00:26:08.955
She literally would not give up the--

00:26:08.955 --> 00:26:09.788
- [Guy] Oh my god.

00:26:09.788 --> 00:26:12.750
- So in the end, I just didn't
know how to use a thing,

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.200
and it, I had a cap in my
vagina for a really long time.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.180
And it was gross and
that's the story of the cap

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.183
that I told on the phone
with you the first time

00:26:19.183 --> 00:26:20.983
that I met you.

00:26:20.983 --> 00:26:22.070
(laughter)
We're gonna talk to my mom,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.480
and my mom just is probably on the line

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.470
listening to all this.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.810
I don't know if you knew about
this, Mom, but now you do.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.517
We'll be back with more show after this.

00:26:29.517 --> 00:26:31.934
(rock music)
