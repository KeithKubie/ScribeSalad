00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:04.779
My name is Axel Gern.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.979
I'm head of autonomous driving here at

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.320
Mercedes Benz Research and Development in North America in Sunnyvale.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.240
We started the group three years ago,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.070
out of a team of seven people and we have grown it now up to six teams.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.573
I'm really excited to work on that hot topic.

00:00:21.573 --> 00:00:25.925
We have a very long tradition in autonomous driving at Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:32.045
We drove autonomously on the highway already 20 years ago during the Prometheus project.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:34.789
The latest big achievement was driving

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.695
the historic world events route from Manhattan to Fordham in 2013,

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:45.091
showing that driving on country roads and inner city traffic is possible.

00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:48.575
We introduced the stop-and-go assist in 2013,

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:52.710
which allows you to drive semi-autonomously in stop and go traffic.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.329
And we recently launched the Drive Pilot,

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.070
which allows you to drive semi-autonomously on

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.555
highways. So we take autonomous driving very seriously,

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:05.299
and I think we have been really successful already in that field.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.489
When hiring people for the autonomous driving team,

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:15.004
we're looking for strong computer science skills especially programming in C++.

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:16.905
In addition for prototypes,

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:20.135
we're using MATLAB and we are using Python for

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:24.751
scripting and deep learning tools perspective.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.980
We are looking at a general good understanding

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.704
about autonomous driving and how that works.

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:35.405
And we are looking at the solid foundation in terms of math,

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:40.310
statistics, probabilistic and algorithms.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.615
When preparing for the interview,

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:45.652
the applicants should brush up their programming skills.

00:01:45.652 --> 00:01:52.519
Secondly, they should think about how their experience and education fits to the job.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.569
Some applicants are surprised to hear questions,

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.324
how does an autonomous system works and then people should prepare that in advance,

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:02.064
should have an understanding

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:04.009
what's going on in that field.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.342
And also, what Mercedes has already achieved in that field.

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:10.550
Personally, I want to see in the interview from

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.450
the applicant that he or she is interested,

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.449
motivated, curious about the topic,

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.419
wants to learn how it works.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.469
At Mercedes, we have lots of interns and we are happy to

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.344
train people to get the right skills and get experience in the field.

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:32.750
We have employees from all around the world from China,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.580
from India, from Germany,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.740
from the US, from France,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.585
from Spain, from actually all around the world.

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:46.090
I think, the nanodegree is a great thing to get the right experience in that field.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.710
So if you have already a really solid foundation in computer science, for example,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.990
and you have successfully achieved the nanodegree you are a pretty good candidate for this.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.372
First of all, I love the topics of working on autonomous driving is terrific.

00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:06.545
Probably, I have the best job in the world right now.

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:09.589
Working in Mercedes also is highly motivating

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.979
because we can bring autonomous cars to reality.

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.689
People are coming here because they are

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.629
motivated to work in the best project in the world I think.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.224
They are keen to work on it.

00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:22.400
They're focused on getting their job done and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.770
explore new ways of solving this really challenging task of autonomous driving.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.389
In terms of teamwork and the culture and the collaboration,

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.659
it's awesome in here.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.819
So we have a highly motivated team working together to solve the problems.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.639
It's also where I love to come to work every day.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.849
