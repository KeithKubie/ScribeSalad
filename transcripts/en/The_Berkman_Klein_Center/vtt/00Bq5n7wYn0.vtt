00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.590
This is the final segment of
the first lecture in a series

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.180
of lectures on copyright.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.710
In this segment, I'll
examine the system

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.880
of multilateral
treaties that bind

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.584
most countries in the world.

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:29.500
A WORD OF WARNING: This
material is intricate.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.380
You are unlikely to retain
all of it right now.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.410
Several times
during the remainder

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.480
of this lecture series we
will return to these themes.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.650
By the end of the series,
you should feel comfortable

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.000
with this important
dimension of copyright law.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.110
Each country in the world
creates, interprets,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.550
and enforces its
own copyright laws.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.480
With minor exceptions that
we'll consider in a minute,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.620
the force of those
laws reach no further

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.750
than the country's borders.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.190
To put the same point
a bit more formally,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.700
copyright law has no
extraterritorial application.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.610
It controls conduct only so
far as the nation's edge.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.550
Suppose, to illustrate, that
I'm an American musician.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.500
I write and record a song
in the United States.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.910
You're a French musician, in
the United States on vacation.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.620
You hear the song
broadcast on the radio.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.650
You like it.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.020
You return home.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.820
Without my permission, you
make your own recording

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.630
of the song in France
and sell copies

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.380
of that recording in France.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.080
Or you perform the song in
a public venue in France.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.480
US copyright law will
not reach your behavior,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.460
because none of the
acts that might violate

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.010
my exclusive rights under US
law occur in the United States.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.630
French copyright law might,
because the acts at issue

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.330
occurred in France,
but only if French law

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.000
shields US composers, like me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.520
In any event, US copyright law
won't apply to your behavior,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.509
because it has no grip
outside US territory.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.800
As I mentioned earlier, there
are some minor exceptions

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.699
to this principle -- a few
of them noted on your screen.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.310
--The so-called
"predicate act" doctrine

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.530
enables US copyright
law to reach

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.920
acts commenced in the US that
are completed outside the US.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.690
--When a defendant engages
in infringing behavior

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.490
in the US, that enables him to
earn profits outside the US,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.390
courts will permit
the copyright owner

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.030
to recover those
profits in US courts.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.340
--For a while, some
courts took the position

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.180
that if a defendant
in the United States

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.880
"authorized" behavior
outside the US,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.060
he would violate US copyright
law if the behavior at issue

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.340
would have been unlawful
if it happened here.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.300
The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.790
reconsidered this issue in a
case involving the distribution

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.440
outside the US of videocassettes
of the classic Beatles

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.790
movie, "Yellow Submarine."

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.790
The outcome of the case
is that the court rejected

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.100
its earlier position,
finding authorization

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.560
of extraterritorial behavior
insufficient to trigger

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.490
a violation of US law.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.100
There has been some
grumbling about this stance

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.930
among lower courts in other
circuits, but for the most part

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.000
the judgment of the Ninth
Circuit seems to have held up.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.900
Troublesome edge
cases of this sort

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.890
are likely to multiply
in the future,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.800
as technology blurs
national boundaries.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.270
For example, which
country's laws

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.760
apply when a radio or
television broadcast containing

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.190
copyrighted material
originates in country #1

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.620
but is then received and watched
by viewers in country #2?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.640
A pair of judicial decisions
in the United States take

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.930
the position that such acts are
governed by the law of country

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.960
#2 -- and thus that a Canadian
broadcast received by US

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.810
viewers is subject to US law.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.310
The Internet will surely
generate many more worrisome

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.940
problems of this sort.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.020
But the presence of these
difficult edge cases

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.440
should not cause
you to lose sight

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.490
of the basic,
fundamental principle:

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.290
each country adopts
its own copyright laws,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.570
and those laws only apply
to acts in that country.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.839
When a country develops
its own copyright law,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.410
may it discriminate in favor of
its own citizens or residents?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.870
In other words, may it
disfavor foreign authors?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.940
For a long time,
the answer was yes.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.080
Indeed, until the
late 19th century,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.860
it was common for countries
to deny copyright protection

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.600
altogether to foreign authors.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.150
For example until 1891,
works by foreign authors

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.420
first published outside United
States received no copyright

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.700
protection at all in
the United States.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.050
Foreign authors (most
famously, Charles Dickens)

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.670
and some US authors
denounced this practice

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.390
and sought reform of US
copyright law, but to no avail.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.030
What underlay this practice?

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.790
What would prompt a country,
like the United States,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.380
to discriminate against
foreign authors?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.320
Several forces seem
to have been at work.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.260
Simple nationalism is
part of the explanation.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.620
A more complex explanation
is that copyright protection

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.570
is often thought of
as a tax on consumers.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.090
By granting an author
exclusive rights,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.060
copyright law enables the author
to raise the price of copies

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.850
of his or her work -- or to
charge more for admission

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.400
to performances
of those works --

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.640
thereby forcing consumers
to pay more for those copies

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.270
or performances.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.200
The rationale of that
price increase, of course,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.750
is to provide a reward or
incentive for creativity --

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.270
a rationale that we will
examine in much more detail

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.950
in subsequent lectures.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.180
For present purposes,
the crucial point

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.290
is that copyright protection
causes price increases.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.640
Historically, many nations
were reluctant to force

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.130
their own residents
to pay those increased

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.650
prices if the monies
raised thereby

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.790
were to be paid to authors
in other countries, even

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.740
(or especially) if
the result would

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.590
be to stimulate creativity
in those other countries.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.290
Attitudes of these
sorts help to explain

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.840
the origins of the
practice of discriminating

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.230
against foreigners.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.780
Perpetuation of that
practice, however,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.240
is probably better explained
by interest-group politics.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.930
For example, as Bill
Patry has shown,

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.390
in the United States
during the 19th century,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.130
many businesses came
to depend financially

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.760
upon their privilege
to print and distribute

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.210
inexpensive copies
of British books.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.090
Such businesses included
publishers, printers,

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.630
and bookbinders.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.980
Not surprisingly, when
legislative proposals

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.280
to end the discrimination
against foreign authors arose,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.260
the interest groups that would
have been hurt by the change

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.880
lobbied against it.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.390
They were successful until 1891.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.960
Indeed, when the law
was eventually changed,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.940
the publishers and
printers were able

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.380
to secure an important
qualification:

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.290
copyright protection
was extended

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.500
to nonresident foreign
authors (more specifically,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.420
to foreign authors
from countries offering

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.810
similar protection
to US authors),

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.250
but only if copies
of their works

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.570
were manufactured in
the United States.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.050
This protectionist measure,
known as the "manufacturing

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.650
clause," was
eliminated with respect

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.620
to foreign authors in 1955
and eliminated for US authors

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.380
in 1986.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.300
Its significance in the present
context is that it illustrates

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.760
the ways in which the financial
interests of an industry often

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.170
congeal around a particular
set of copyright laws --

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.750
and then retard any
modification of those laws.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.350
We'll see several other
examples of that dynamic later

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.100
in these lectures.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.420
Let's return to the main
theme: As we have seen,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.410
one byproduct of the principle
that copyright protection is

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.940
nation-specific and has no
extraterritorial application

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.020
is that countries could, and for
a long time did, discriminate

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.340
against foreign authors.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.570
Another important byproduct
is that, historically,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.480
copyright laws in
different countries

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.380
differed dramatically.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.020
Here's an illustration to which
we'll return frequently in this

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.130
course: Countries in continental
Europe have long accorded

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.320
generous protection to what is
referred to as "droit moral" --

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.669
loosely translated in
English as "moral rights."

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.400
These are said to be
noneconomic rights;

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.130
they shield the personal
or personhood interests

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.730
of authors and artists,
rather than their interests

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.640
in making money.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.120
For example, moral rights forbid
the purchaser of a painting

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.710
from defacing it or obscuring
the identity of the artist who

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.780
painted it.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.160
Such acts might not damage
the artist financially,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.720
but they threaten the
bond between the artist

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.270
and her creations.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.490
By contrast, countries whose
legal systems were primarily

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.660
influenced by Great Britain
have long been more skeptical

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.990
of these moral rights.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.760
Such countries include the
United States, Australia,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.330
New Zealand, and so forth.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.110
The upshot is that the existence
or force of moral rights

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.660
traditionally varied
sharply across the world.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.000
The more general point
is that, historically,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.530
the entitlements enjoyed
by authors and artists

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.150
were quite different
in different countries.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.650
That's where things stood
in the late 19th century:

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.730
widespread discrimination
against foreign authors,

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.970
and wide divergences among the
laws in different countries.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.590
There then began a
long process, which

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.560
continues to the present
day, of convergence

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.580
of national copyright laws.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.200
Convergence has encompassed
3 intertwined trends:

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.620
1st the elimination
of discrimination

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.150
against foreigners.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.750
2nd the mitigation of
variations across countries --

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.880
exemplified by the reduction in
the divergence among countries

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.030
concerning the meaning
of originality,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.860
discussed earlier
in this lecture

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.530
And 3rd, a steady increase
in the scope, strength,

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.650
and duration of copyright
protection in all countries.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.860
These are important,
so I'll repeat:

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.890
1st the elimination
of discrimination

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.480
against foreigners.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.240
2nd the reduction of
variations across countries.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.690
And 3rd, an increase in the
scope, strength, and duration

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.840
of copyright protection.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.900
There's no logical link
between those three dimensions.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.080
For example, you could imagine
harmonization having been

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.800
achieved through universal
adoption of the least common

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.660
denominator -- the laws of
the least protective country.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.600
In other words, we could
have seen a leveling down,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.710
rather than a leveling up.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.100
How and why the three
trends nevertheless

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.130
have been linked
historically is one

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.770
of the major issues in the
legal history of copyright.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.210
I hope, by the end
of these lectures,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.565
you'll have a better sense
of the possible answers.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.380
The primary vehicles of this
process of convergence were

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.580
a series of multilateral
agreements --

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.890
treaties or analogous
deals among many countries.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.360
Since the late
19th century, there

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.150
have been seven major
multilateral agreements

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.040
implicating copyright law.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.760
They are listed on the
map in front of you:

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.180
--the Berne Convention;

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.979
--the Universal
Copyright Convention;

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:28.020
--the International
Convention For the Protection

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.580
of Performers, Producers of
Phonograms and Broadcasting

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.420
Organizations, commonly
known as the Rome Convention;

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.380
--the "Agreement on
Trade-Related Aspects

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.820
of Intellectual
Property Rights,"

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.760
commonly known
(confusingly) as TRIPS;

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.220
--the 1996 treaty adopted
under the auspices of the World

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.090
Intellectual Property
Organization,

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.900
commonly known as
WIPO Copyright Treaty;

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.000
--the contemporaneous WIPO
Performances and Phonograms

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.390
Treaty;

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.750
--and the recently
concluded Marrakesh Treaty

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.260
for the Visually Impaired.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.240
All of these
agreements are complex.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.790
I'm not going to attempt
here to walk you through all

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.240
of their various provisions.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.710
Instead, in this
lecture, I will identify

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.520
the most important general
themes of these agreements.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.970
In subsequent lectures, when
addressing specific sets

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.480
of legal rules that have
been shaped or constrained

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.845
by these treaties, we will
return to the relevant treaty

00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:25.345
provisions.

00:12:28.265 --> 00:12:29.640
The two most
important agreements

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.000
are the Berne Convention
and the TRIPS agreement,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.410
so we will spend most
of our time on those.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.180
The Berne Convention
is the grandparent

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.970
of these multilateral
agreements.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.410
It was the first to be adopted.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.130
The negotiations that resulted
in the Berne Convention

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.790
began in 1858 and finally
culminated in 1886,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.260
with the adoption
by 10 countries

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.250
of the original version
of the convention.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.830
Since then it's been
revised 7 times.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.000
If you click on the icon
associated with the "History"

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.550
subtopic in the map, you'll find
a series of slides that provide

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.300
details concerning the evolution
of the Berne Convention --

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.010
when different
provisions were added,

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.120
and how many countries
signed on to each version.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.770
Today (meaning, as
of January 2016),

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.190
the Convention has been
joined by 168 countries,

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.400
extending its reach
over most of the world.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:34.760
Here's a map showing
its coverage.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.590
Three dimensions of the current
version of the Berne Convention

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.030
are crucial:

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.640
The first is the so-called
national-treatment principle.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.760
Prior to the Berne
Convention, some countries

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.380
had been chipping away at
the widespread practice

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.540
of discrimination
against foreign authors

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.120
through adoption in
bilateral treaties

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.660
of the so-called
reciprocity principle.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.930
As its name suggests,
the reciprocity principle

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.950
depends upon two or
more countries each

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.380
extending rights to the
residents of the other(s).

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.680
Country number #1 agrees to
grant copyright protection

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.860
to the residents of Country
number #2 if and only

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.200
if Country #2 grants
copyright protection

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.700
to the residents of Country #1.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.730
The Berne Convention
-- and, as we will see,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.580
all subsequent
multilateral agreements --

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.180
repudiate the reciprocity
principle in favor

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.930
of the simpler and more powerful
national-treatment principle.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.830
The key idea in
national treatment

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.100
is that country #1 must grant
to the residents of country #2

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.880
the same rights it grants to
country #1's own residents.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.574
To illustrate,
today French authors

00:14:44.574 --> 00:14:46.490
are given the same rights
in the United States

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.020
as are given to US
authors, and US authors

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.630
are given the same
rights in France

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.124
as are given to French authors.

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:57.040
The application of this
principle in the Berne

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.150
Convention is actually
somewhat more encompassing

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.070
than I have thus far suggested.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.970
As the map indicates,
the Berne Convention

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.800
requires each signatory country
to grant to "protected authors"

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.490
the same rights it
accords its own nationals.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.470
If you follow the
links in the map,

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.930
you will see that the
term "protected authors"

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.410
is capacious.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.030
The net effect is to
require all member countries

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:26.930
to extend the benefits of their
copyright laws quite broadly.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.870
In one respect,
however, the application

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.870
of the national-treatment
principle in the Berne

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.370
Convention is less encompassing
than I have thus far suggested.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.980
Specifically, the
Berne Convention

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.270
does not apply to what are
called "neighboring rights."

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.080
This is the term used
in many countries

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.360
to describe the legal rights
of performers and producers.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.080
They are said to be "neighboring
rights," because they

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.370
are adjacent to copyrights
but not true copyrights.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.310
Such neighboring
rights are governed,

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.850
not by the Berne Convention,
but by the Rome convention.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.250
The geographic coverage
of the Rome convention

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.730
is substantially smaller
than that of Berne.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.800
As of today, 91
countries have joined.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.320
Among the major countries
not participating

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.310
is the United States.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.280
We will return later in this
series of lectures to the ways

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.410
that the Rome convention
affects the definition

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.960
and scope of rights
of public performance.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.170
For present purposes, the
crucial point is that members

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.750
of the Rome convention are
permitted to discriminate

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.710
against the residents of
nonmember countries --

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.830
including US nationals.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.290
And they do.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.780
Here's an example:
France imposes

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.370
a levy on sales of blank tapes.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.640
The money raised to that levy
is distributed as follows:

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.620
25% is devoted to French
cultural purposes;

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.900
25% is paid to the composers
of the musical compositions

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.450
recorded on those
tapes; 25% goes

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.500
to the performers
of the recordings

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.650
of the songs recorded
on the tapes;

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.450
and 25% goes to the producers
of those recordings.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.380
US composers get a
share of the 2nd slice,

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.410
because musical compositions
are governed by the Berne

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.440
Convention, and thus
France may not discriminate

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.310
against US authors.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.950
By contrast, US
performers and producers

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.192
are excluded from the
3rd and 4th slices,

00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:22.400
because their interests are
not governed by the Berne

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.880
Convention.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.660
So, to review, the first
key dimension of the Berne

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.240
Convention is
national treatment --

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.300
the principle that each
member country must extend

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.382
to the residents of other member
countries the same rights it

00:17:37.382 --> 00:17:38.590
extends to its own residents.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.680
The 2nd of the 3
major dimensions

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.660
of the current version
of the Berne Convention

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.220
is the prohibition
on formalities.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.880
As the map indicates,
the key idea

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.170
here is that member
countries may not

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.990
impose upon protected authors
any administrative obligations

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.552
that they have to satisfy in
order to acquire, enforce,

00:18:01.552 --> 00:18:02.760
or maintain their copyrights.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.600
Curiously, member countries
may impose such obligations

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.320
on their own nationals -- and
occasionally they do so --

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.490
but as one might imagine,
discrimination against

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.200
one's own citizens is rare.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.690
This prohibition on formalities
creates a sharp contrast

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.910
between copyright
law and patent law.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.220
Roughly speaking,
while copyright law

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.820
protects works of authorship,
patent law protects inventions.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.770
To obtain a patent,
an inventor must

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.670
comply with myriad
administrative requirements.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.900
Typically, he or she
must apply for a patent

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.120
within a limited period of
time, and must demonstrate

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.660
to the satisfaction
of a patent examiner

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.610
that his or her invention is
useful, novel, and nonobvious.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.350
Most patent applicants
eventually succeed,

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.470
but not all.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.760
And compliance with these
requirements is costly.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.330
Copyright law, in the
overwhelming number

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.480
of countries that adhere
to the Berne Convention,

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.120
is radically different.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.310
In those countries, there are
no administrative preconditions

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.050
to the acquisition or
enforcement of copyright.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.350
So, for example, if you
happen to be taking notes

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.070
while watching this lecture,
and (as we discussed previously)

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.340
your notes contain a bare
minimum of creativity,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.530
then you have acquired a
copyright in your notes.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.720
Similarly, if you take a
snapshot of your family,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.020
and that photograph
is minimally creative,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.620
then you acquire a
copyright in the photograph.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.870
No formal grant, no governmental
imprimatur is necessary.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.470
Historically, what underlay
this hostility to formalities?

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.330
The traditional explanation
is that the countries

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.960
most influential in the
shaping of the Berne Convention

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.420
subscribed to the so-called
"natural rights" theory

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.590
of copyright.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.510
If an author's control
over his or her creations

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.740
is a natural right,
then the interposition

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.540
of governmental formalities
would seem unacceptable.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.730
Professor Chris Sprigman, who
has written most insightfully

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.360
about this issue,
persuasively argues

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.110
that this traditional
explanation is unconvincing.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.210
It's more likely
that the drafters

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.710
of the Berne
Convention provisions

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.970
pertaining to
formalities believed

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.020
that disparate
administrative requirements

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.390
in different countries
would frustrate

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.990
authors' ability in practice
to secure global protection

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.390
for their works.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.700
Whatever the reason, the
current draft of the Convention

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.490
is firmly set
against formalities.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.880
This issue might seem
technical and unimportant,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.800
but for two reasons it's not.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.490
First, lawmakers
in some countries

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.030
have long been hostile to the
Berne Convention's prohibition

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.870
on formalities.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.590
The premier example
is the United States,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.730
which, as we will see, retained
many formal requirements

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.350
for copyright protection until
late in the 20th century.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.380
Reluctance to surrender
those requirements

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.850
helps to explain why the United
States did not join the Berne

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:05.400
Convention until 1989.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.320
The second reason is that
an unexpected byproduct

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.120
of the absence of formalities is
that our social environment is

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.640
increasingly clogged
with billions

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.030
of modestly creative
cultural products

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.060
over which someone enjoys
copyright protection,

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.600
but persons who wish to
make use of those products

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.620
have no effective
way of ascertaining

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.910
the identity of the owners
of those copyrights.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.660
Copyrights, as you will
soon see, are everywhere,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.430
but identifying the
persons to whom they belong

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.330
is often infeasible.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.390
As a result, some
scholars and lawmakers

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.800
advocate the reinstatement
of formal requirements

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.760
for copyright protection.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.150
The result would be
to reduce sharply

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.170
the number of copyrighted
works and thus

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.840
the density of the legal soup
through which we daily move.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.310
The principal impediment
to such a reform

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.466
is the Berne Convention.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.510
The 3rd of the three main
dimensions of the Berne

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.110
Convention consists of a
set of obligations, imposed

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.960
on all member countries,
to establish minimum levels

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.800
of copyright protection.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.440
For example, member
countries must

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.610
extend copyright protection
to certain kinds of works,

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.430
must grant the
authors of those works

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.140
specific exclusive rights,

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.660
must allow those rights
to continue for specified

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.900
periods of time, and so forth.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.820
The details of those
minimum standards

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.850
will be examined in
subsequent lectures.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.820
For present purposes,
the main point

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.650
is that, although the
Berne Convention has

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:39.390
lots of such requirements, it
contains no effective mechanism

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.410
for punishing member
countries when

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.110
they fail to comply with
their duties in this regard.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.530
As a result, countries that
want the benefits of the Berne

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.360
Convention, but don't want
to comply with all of its

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.520
obligations, are free as a
practical matter to join up --

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.290
and then delay or refuse to
comply with the provisions that

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.170
they find unattractive.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.940
The United States
between 1989 and 1994

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.510
definitely fell
into this category.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.340
The posture of the United
States changed substantially

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.840
with the adoption of
the TRIPS agreement.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.030
The history of the negotiations
that resulted in the TRIPS

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.110
agreement is intricate -- much
too intricate to be explored

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.210
here.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.710
If you're curious,
the chronology

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.930
is reviewed in the
series of slides

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.340
that can be accessed
through the link associated

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.930
with subtopic "origins."

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.870
Today, the geographic coverage
of the TRIPS agreement

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.280
rivals that of the
Berne Convention.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.600
All member countries of the
World Trade Organization --

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.340
as of January 2016,
162 nations --

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.760
are subject to the agreement.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.760
In important respects,
the TRIPS agreement

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.650
parallels the Berne Convention.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.070
Like Berne, TRIPS
adheres to the principle

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.680
of national treatment.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.990
Also like Berne, TRIPS
imposes on member countries

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.410
the obligation to establish
certain minimum levels

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.140
of copyright protection.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.450
As the map indicates, these
obligations pertain to:

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.520
-- the kinds of works that are
subject to copyright protection

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.670
(including, for example,
computer software);

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.820
--the entitlements that
copyright owners must be given;

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.120
--the duration of
copyrights and so forth.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.620
We will return to the
details under these headings

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.350
in subsequent lectures.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.500
That said, TRIPS differs
from the Berne Convention

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.510
in three major respects.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:34.300
First, it imposes upon
member countries obligations,

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.620
not merely to
establish legal rights,

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.360
but also to establish
effective remedies when

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.470
those rights are violated.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.430
Some of those remedies
-- for example,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.020
pertaining to the availability
of preliminary injunctions --

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.750
were more expansive than some
member countries had previously

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.520
adopted and so required
the adoption of new laws.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.770
Second, the TRIPS
agreement, because it

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.790
is part of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.380
has (unlike the
Berne Convention)

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.970
a mechanism for compelling
member countries

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.260
to comply with
their obligations.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:12.220
Specifically, the GATT contains
a dispute-resolution procedure

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.550
that enables a member
country to initiate

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.740
a complaint against
another member country

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:21.790
that has failed to live up
to its TRIPS obligations.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.110
Details concerning the
handling of such disputes

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.450
can be found by pursuing
the links in the map.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.800
The principal penalty imposed
upon a country found to have

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.180
failed to comply with its
obligations under the agreement

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.950
is so-called
"cross-sectoral" retaliation.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.930
In other words, the
complaining country

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.700
is permitted to impose trade
sanctions on other goods.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.260
This process is
far from perfect,

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.590
but it does have teeth.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.970
The third of the three
respects in which the TRIPS

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.130
agreement deviates from Berne
is related to those teeth.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.380
As you can see from the
map, the TRIPS agreement

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.970
incorporates by reference all
of the obligations imposed

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.560
on member countries by the
Berne Convention except one:

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.820
article 6bis.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.820
What's that?

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.740
That article, it turns
out, is the provision

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.030
of the Berne convention
that covers moral rights.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.830
Recall that moral
rights have a lower

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.040
status in common-law countries
than in civil-law countries.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.760
The result of the
exclusion of article 6bis

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.330
is that countries such
as the United States,

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.910
reluctant to adhere fully
to the Berne Convention

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.070
obligations with
respect to moral rights,

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.040
are still able to give them
short shrift without running

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.050
the gauntlet of WTO
dispute-resolution proceedings.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.400
The TRIPS Agreement is the
most controversial aspect

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.250
of copyright law -- and indeed,
of the law of intellectual

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.650
property as a whole.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.154
Debate concerning the merits
and demerits of TRIPs --

00:26:50.154 --> 00:26:52.820
and, in particular, whether it's
been good or bad for developing

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.700
countries -- has been intense
since the agreement was first

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.704
adopted.

00:26:57.704 --> 00:26:59.870
If you follow the link
associated with the subtopic,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.530
"Merits and Demerits," you
will find a few slides,

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.890
summarizing the principal
contending positions

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.080
on this issue.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.900
Later in this lecture series,
once we have on the table

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.380
more information concerning
the actual impact of TRIPS,

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.340
we'll return to this
fundamental issue.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.940
We come next to
two 1996 treaties,

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.280
both of them negotiated
and administered

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.010
by the World Intellectual
Property Organization.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.530
They have almost identical
geographic coverage;

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:31.410
currently, 93 and 94
countries respectively.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.720
The first requires member
countries to expand somewhat

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.560
the rights of
authors; the second

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.390
requires member countries to
expand the rights of performers

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.100
and producers.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.740
The most novel and
important provision

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.040
in both of these treaties
is the obligation

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.000
imposed on member
countries to reinforce

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.070
technological
protection measures.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.530
Specifically, both
require member countries

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.420
to penalize in some way the
circumvention of encryption

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.790
systems or the removal
of information contained

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:04.090
in copies of copyrighted works
that identify the copyright

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.240
owners.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.970
A major branch of
copyright law has grown out

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.620
of these treaty provisions.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.090
We will consider that
branch in lecture #11.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.230
The most recent of the
seven multilateral treaties

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.820
is the Marrakesh
Treaty on Exceptions

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.210
for the Visually Impaired,
which was wrapped up

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.070
in Morocco in July of 2013.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.450
There are over 300 million
visually impaired people

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.460
in the world.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.390
Their ability to gain access to
copyrighted material in formats

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.710
that they can
apprehend has long been

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.240
curtailed by the
combination of copyright law

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.110
and the reluctance
of copyright owners

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.040
to grant permission for the
creation of digital versions

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.140
of their works that, if
they escaped into the wild,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.660
could corrode their
primary markets.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.870
The Marrakesh Treaty attempts
to overcome that impediment

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:59.100
by requiring member
countries to adopt laws

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.020
that permit the reproduction
and distribution of published

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.380
works in formats accessible
to the visually impaired

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.530
and then to permit
organizations that

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.240
serve the visually impaired
to take them from one

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.130
country into another.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.610
The hope is that this new
regime will eventually result

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.450
in the standardization
of accessible formats --

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.320
thus increasing the set of
materials available everywhere

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.760
and saving money.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.390
The Marrakesh Treaty
is unique among the 7

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.470
multilateral agreements
in one important respect:

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.790
it's the only one that requires
member countries to limit

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.870
the scope of copyright,
rather than requiring

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.405
member countries to create
minimum levels of protection.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.950
Overlaid on the pattern
of obligations created

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.780
by these multilateral agreements
are a few regional agreements,

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.400
which further constrain the
freedom of member countries

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.210
to shape their national
copyright systems.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.570
The most prominent of the
regional organizations

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.740
that generate such agreements
is the European Union.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.510
Several EU directives
listed in the map

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.350
oblige countries
within the Union

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.590
to manage their copyright
systems in particular ways.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.640
Less well known is the
African Intellectual Property

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.570
Organization (commonly
known as OAPI),

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.890
the members of which are
subject to similar obligations.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.520
We'll take up the details
of these regional directives

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.120
later.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.350
The framework created
by this welter

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.870
of multilateral and regional
agreements is not stable.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.210
On the contrary, countries
-- and major interest groups

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.760
within countries --
struggle constantly to tilt

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.210
the framework in their favor.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.430
Sometimes the struggle
involves interpretation

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.300
of existing provisions.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.410
One of the most important
of those provisions

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.870
is known as the three-step test.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.680
This is not a separate treaty.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.610
It's rather a recurring
principle, variants

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.630
of which can be found
in most of the treaties

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.360
we've already reviewed.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.300
These variants are not
identical, but they're similar.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.510
Shown on the screen
is the version

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.160
contained in the Berne
Convention-specifically

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.510
in article 9(2)
of the Convention.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:15.080
I've inserted, in
brackets, letters that

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.360
divide the so-called 3 steps.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.430
With those insertions,
the provision reads:

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.980
"It shall be a matter
for legislation

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.870
in the countries of
the Union, to permit

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.820
the reproduction of such works
a in certain special cases,

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.670
provided that such
reproduction does not conflict

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.720
with a normal
exploitation of the work

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.920
and does not
unreasonably prejudice

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.470
the legitimate interests
of the author."

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:47.690
The TRIPS Agreement contains
a similar provision --

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.610
although note that
the TRIPS version,

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.930
unlike the Berne version,
applies to all "exclusive

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.990
rights" enjoyed by
copyright owners,

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.700
not merely to the
right of reproduction.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.975
Analogous provisions can
be found in other treaties.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.220
What's going on here?

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.920
What these provisions
are designed to curb

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.860
is the impulse of some
countries to limit

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.090
the scope of copyrights
by granting exceptions

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.860
or privileges to users who
wish to employ copyrighted

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.120
works in ways that would
otherwise be illegal.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.410
The basic idea underlying
the three-step test

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.680
is that such exceptions
may not cut too deeply

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.580
into the rights of owners.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.620
But how deep is too deep?

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.790
The language of the
treaty provisions

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.030
is notoriously vague
on that crucial point.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.280
As a result many
different interpretations

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.720
of the so-called three-step
test have proliferated.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.650
Some are quite strict.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.430
If widely adopted, they would
require the United States,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.650
for example, to abandon or at
least to curtail significantly

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.570
its fair-use doctrine -- which
we will consider in detail

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.330
in lecture #9.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:33:00.570
Others are substantially
more permissive.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.770
An intermediate position on the
spectrum of interpretations,

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.670
which has much to recommend
it, is the interpretation

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.540
offered by Professors
Berndt Hugenholtz and Ruth

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.000
Okediji, set forth on the map:

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.680
"Limitations and exceptions that
(1) are not overly broad, (2)

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.120
do not rob right holders of
a real or potential source

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.090
of income that is
substantive, and (3)

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:28.090
do not do disproportional
harm to the right holders,

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:32.277
will pass the test."

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:34.610
The debate concerning the
meaning of the three-step test

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.670
will likely continue
for quite a while.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.520
Another source of instability in
the International Framework is

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.040
that countries -- often
nudged by interest groups --

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.380
are constantly attempting to
supplement the treaties we have

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.020
considered with additional
bilateral or plurilateral

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.200
agreements.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.120
Three ongoing efforts of this
sort are listed in the map.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.680
The AntiCounterfeiting
Trade Agreement --

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.010
commonly known as ACTA -- has
been under negotiation since

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.662
2006.

00:34:06.662 --> 00:34:08.120
It differs from
all of the treaties

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.900
we've considered thus far,
both in the small number

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.969
of countries that were
involved in the negotiations,

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.610
and even more
importantly in the fact

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:19.130
that those negotiations were
conducted largely in secret.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:23.600
Despite considerable resistance
to that secrecy and to some

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.670
of the substantive
provisions that emerged from

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.130
the negotiations, ACTA
looked well on its way toward

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.909
ratification and adoption
until July of 2012,

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.900
when the European Parliament,
responding in part to growing

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.600
public outcry, balked
-- refusing its consent

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.280
to the agreement by
a vote of 478 to 39,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.860
with 165 abstentions.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.494
It is now unlikely that ACTA
will ever enter into force.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.360
Next in line is the
Trans-Pacific Partnership

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.530
Agreement or TPP.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.960
This too was negotiated
by a small group

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.390
of countries (shown
on your screen)

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.450
in a series of
confidential meetings.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:09.440
The final draft was released to
the public in November of 2015.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.790
The legislatures of the
participating countries ???

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.840
including Congress in
the United States --

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.840
are currently considering
whether to approve

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.130
the agreement.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.150
The outcome of
their deliberations

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.660
is far from certain.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.320
If it is approved by the
requisite number of countries

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.860
and enters into
force, the TPP will

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.140
lead to some medium-sized
changes in the global copyright

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.190
system.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.490
Copyright law in the US
will change very little.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.680
However, some of the other
participating countries

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.970
(and countries that
later join the group)

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.690
will have to adjust their laws.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.330
Three such adjustments are
particularly significant.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.270
First, roughly half of the
participating countries will be

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.530
obliged to increase the duration
of copyright protection --

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.910
from the life of the author 50
years to the life of the author

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.350
70 years.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:02.530
Second, some countries
will be obliged

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.160
to enhance their
prohibitions on circumvention

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.350
of technological
protection measures.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:13.810
Finally, some may be obliged
to adopt or modify statutory

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.300
provisions permitting successful
plaintiffs to recover so-called

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.370
statutory damages -- although
their duties in this regard are

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.660
less severe than they would
have been if the original draft

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.100
of the TPP had survived.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.840
Whether these three
changes are good or bad,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.855
we will consider in Lectures
6, 11, and 12 respectively.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.200
More modest in ambition
and thus less controversial

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.060
is the Beijing Treaty on
Audiovisual Performances,

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.360
which, if it comes
into effect, will

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.080
expand the moral
rights of actors

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.880
and other audiovisual
performers.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.570
We will discuss those
rights in lecture #8.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.230
The general point is that,
while the broad contours

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.820
of the International
Framework are firmly in place,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.760
many important details
are in continued flux.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.610
Typically, the representatives
of major institutional holders

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.390
of copyrights and other
intellectual property rights

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.720
push for treaty
provisions that require

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.260
member countries to increase
the scope of their rights,

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.430
while public-interest
organizations play defense,

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.410
resisting reform.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.220
With the exception of
the Marrakesh Treaty,

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.860
the public-interest
organizations

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.160
rarely offer treaty
provisions of their own.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.582
This concludes our
preliminary review

00:37:34.582 --> 00:37:36.540
of the structure of the
international framework

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.810
of copyright law.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.530
To repeat, my ambition in
this section of the lecture

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.050
has not been to itemize all of
the features of that framework.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.066
That would be impossible
in a single lecture --

00:37:47.066 --> 00:37:50.420
or even an entire
course for that matter.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.560
Rather my goal has been
to convey to you the key

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.550
principles and trends --
and to mark the locations

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.100
of the treaty provisions to
which we will return when

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.870
examining specific
features of copyright law.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.660
Next week, we will focus, not
on copyright law, but on theory.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.620
We will begin our examination
of the questions: What concerns

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.170
or values underlie copyright?

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.270
And how might copyright
law be reshaped

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.080
to advance those concerns
or values more effectively?

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.220
Thank you.
