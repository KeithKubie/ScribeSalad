00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.859
This cannot be determined.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.740
This triangle is not a right triangle.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.960
So we cannot use
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.330
In order for us to be able to
use the Pythagorean Theorem,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.340
a triangle must have
an angle that is 90 degrees.
