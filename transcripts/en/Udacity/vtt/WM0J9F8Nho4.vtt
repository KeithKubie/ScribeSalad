00:00:01.242 --> 00:00:02.960
A much simpler table.

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:07.867
Just a standard primary key, 
a few values, and a few constraints.

00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:10.616
Note that we use 
ON CONFLICT IGNORE.

00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:13.600
This means an insert into the database 
with the same key

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.050
will not actually update 
the database at all,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.333
and therefore will also not return an ID
in the Android helper functions.
