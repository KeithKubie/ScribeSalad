00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.120
So now, we're going to move on to night terrors. This occurs most often in

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.035
childhood and results in waking from sleep in a terrified state. Most of these

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:14.856
occur in the first third of the night. Now, if this happens, the person might

00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:19.050
be difficult to comfort because they're going to be thrashing around violently.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.719
This could last 10 to 20 minutes and then, they'll fall back asleep.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.774
Oftentimes, the person will have no memory of the event and can't explain what

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:31.035
happened the following morning. Now, some people with night terrors, also sleep

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:36.026
walk in which they engage in behaviors they would do while they're awake. Even

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:40.813
though they're asleep. For example, this could include eating, getting dressed,

00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:46.064
moving furniture, or even driving a car while asleep. Now, sleepwalking can

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:52.170
occur in children and adults. About 4 to 15% of children sleepwalk, and about

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.918
1.5 to 2.5% of adults sleepwalk. Now let's go to my friend who has night

00:00:57.918 --> 00:01:00.220
terrors, and let's see what he has to say about it.
