00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.384
- [Voiceover] So let's say
we have the radical equation

00:00:02.384 --> 00:00:06.006
two-x minus one is equal

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.429
to the square root of eight minus x.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.041
So we already have the
radical isolated on one side

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:13.842
of the equation.

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:15.696
So, we might say, "Well, let's
just get rid of the radical.

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:18.126
"Let's square both
sides of this equation."

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:19.728
So we might say that
this is the same thing

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.967
as two-x minus one squared

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:27.776
is equal to the square
root of eight minus x,

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.447
eight minus x squared,
and then we would get,

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.999
let's see, two-x minus one squared

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.006
is four x-squared minus four-x

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.922
plus one is equal to eight minus x.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:42.788
Now we have to be very,
very, very careful here.

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:45.187
We might feel, "Okay we
did legitimate operations.

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:47.044
"We did the same thing to both sides.

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:50.721
"That these are equivalent equations."

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.907
But, they aren't quite equivalent.

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:54.346
Because when you're squaring something,

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.228
one way to think about it,

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:58.084
is when you're squaring it,
you're losing information.

00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:00.615
So, for example, this would be true

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:04.566
even if the original
equation were two-x...

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.199
Let me, this in a different color.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.159
Even if the original
equation were two-x minus one

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.819
is equal to the negative

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.463
of the square root of eight minus x.

00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:17.959
Because if you squared both sides of this,

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.642
you would also get,

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:21.314
you would also get that right over there,

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:25.036
because a negative squared
would be equal to a positive.

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:27.293
So, when we're finding a solution to this,

00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:28.616
we need to test our solution

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.032
to make sure it's truly the solution

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:32.319
to this first yellow equation here,

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.920
and not the solution to this up here.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.696
If it's a solution to
this right-hand side,

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.880
and not the yellow one,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.363
then we would call that
an extraneous solution.

00:01:41.363 --> 00:01:43.661
So, let's see if we can solve this.

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:46.935
So let's write this as kind
of a standard quadratic.

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:50.557
Let's subtract eight from both sides.

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:53.552
So let's subtract eight from both sides

00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:54.817
to get rid of this eight over here,

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:57.731
and let's add x to both sides.

00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:00.494
So, plus x, plus x,

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:02.816
and we are going to get,

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:06.612
we are going to get four-x squared

00:02:06.612 --> 00:02:11.476
minus three-x, minus seven,

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:14.750
minus seven, is equal to,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.571
is equal to zero.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.999
And let's see, we would want

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.238
to factor this right over here,

00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:24.931
and, let's see, maybe I could do this

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.857
by, if I do it by...

00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:30.573
Well, I'll just use the
quadratic formula, here.

00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:32.952
So the solutions are going to be...

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:37.973
X is going to be equal
to negative b, so three,

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.847
plus or minus the square root of

00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:43.715
b-squared, so negative
three squared is nine,

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:47.755
minus four times a, which is four,

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:50.146
times c, which is negative seven.

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:51.992
So I could just say times...

00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:54.534
Well, I'll just write a seven here

00:02:54.534 --> 00:02:57.088
and then that negative is
gonna make this a positive.

00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:58.528
All of that over two-a.

00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:00.408
So two times four is eight.

00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:01.790
So, this is gonna be three

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.855
plus or minus the square root of...

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:09.713
Let's see, four times
four is 16 times seven.

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:13.027
16 times seven is gonna be

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:15.326
70 plus 42.

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:17.090
Let me make sure I'm doing this right.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.354
So 16 times seven.

00:03:19.354 --> 00:03:21.827
The two, four.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:24.973
So, it's 112 plus nine.

00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:27.933
So, 121, that worked out nicely.

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:30.232
So, plus or minus the square root of 121,

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:31.927
all of that over eight.

00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:34.945
Well, that is equal to
three plus or minus 11,

00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:37.399
all of that over eight.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.250
So that is equal to, if we add 11,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.607
that is 14-eights.

00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:44.627
Or, if we subtract 11,

00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:48.969
three minus 11 is negative eight.

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.523
Negative eight divided
by eight is negative one.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:52.451
So we have to think about...

00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:53.926
You might say, "Okay,
I found two solutions

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:55.087
"to the radical equation."

00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:57.188
But remember, one of
these might be solutions

00:03:57.188 --> 00:03:58.860
to this alternate radical equation

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.170
that got lost when we squared both sides.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.283
We have to make sure
that they're legitimate,

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:05.686
or maybe one of these is
an extraneous solution.

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.183
In fact, one is very likely a solution

00:04:07.183 --> 00:04:10.859
to this radical equation which
wasn't our original goal.

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.326
So, let's see.

00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:15.205
Let's try out x equals negative one.

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:16.621
If x equals negative one,

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:19.249
we would have two times negative one

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.426
minus one is equal to
the square root of eight

00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:24.239
minus negative one.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:27.988
So that would be negative
two minus one is equal

00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:30.784
to the square root of,

00:04:30.784 --> 00:04:32.561
is equal to the square root of nine.

00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:34.105
And so we'd have negative three

00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:36.101
is equal to the square root of nine.

00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:37.013
The principle root of nine.

00:04:37.013 --> 00:04:38.342
This is a positive square root.

00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:39.607
This is not true.

00:04:39.607 --> 00:04:40.548
So this, right over here,

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:43.229
that is an extraneous solution.

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.539
Extraneous.

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.616
Extraneous solution.

00:04:48.616 --> 00:04:51.715
It is a solution to this
one right over here.

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:53.996
Because notice, for that one,

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:57.323
if you substitute two times negative one

00:04:57.323 --> 00:04:59.540
minus one is equal to the negative

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.500
of eight minus negative one.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.453
So this is negative three is equal

00:05:04.453 --> 00:05:07.260
to the negative of three.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.640
So, it checks out for this one.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.493
So, this one right over here
is the extraneous solution.

00:05:12.493 --> 00:05:14.913
This one right over here is
gonna be the actual solution

00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:16.524
for our original equation,

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:18.761
and you can test it out on your own.

00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:21.209
In fact, I encourage you to do so.
