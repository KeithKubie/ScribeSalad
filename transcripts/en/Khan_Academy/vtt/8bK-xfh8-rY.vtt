00:00:00.558 --> 00:00:01.476
- [Voiceover] So right over here,

00:00:01.476 --> 00:00:04.540
I have a type of spinner
that you might see

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.593
in a child's game.

00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:09.659
You can see there's seven
equally likely possibilities.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:10.999
Let's see, there's one, two,

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.936
three, four, five, six,

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:16.165
seven equally likely possibilities.

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:17.442
It looks like in four of them,

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.932
you've spun an elephant.

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:21.147
Two of them, you have this mouse

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:23.004
running away from something,

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:23.650
and then in one of them,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.681
you have this monkey doing some type

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.083
of acrobatics, fair enough.

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:32.481
Now let's pose ourselves
an interesting question.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.541
At least I think it's
an interesting question.

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:38.592
Let's say we were to spin
the spinner 210 times.

00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:42.517
So we're going to spin 210...

00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:44.154
We're going to spin that spinner

00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:46.416
210 times.

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:48.657
And I want you to make a prediction.

00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:50.932
I want you to predict...

00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:55.926
I want you to predict
the number of times...

00:00:55.926 --> 00:01:00.115
Number of times...

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:03.089
We get an elephant.

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:05.740
We get an elephant...

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.859
Number of times we get an elephant,

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.261
out of the 210 times.

00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:13.503
So why don't you to have a go at it?

00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:16.318
All right, so you've, I'm
assuming, like always,

00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:18.149
pause the video and then had a try.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.226
So one way to think about it,

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:20.142
is, well, for one spin,

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:22.638
what is the probability
of getting an elephant?

00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:25.679
So let's do this, one spin.

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.117
So for one spin,

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:31.391
what is the probability of getting

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.021
an elephant?

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.992
Well let's see, we have
already talked about,

00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:37.448
this is a fair spinner.

00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:40.653
There are seven equally
likely possibilities.

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:42.796
And then how many involve
getting an elephant?

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:46.753
Well, so we have one, two, three, four.

00:01:46.753 --> 00:01:50.446
Four out of the seven
equally likely possibilities

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:53.290
involve us getting an elephant.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.833
So one reasonable thing to do,

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.134
and this is actually what I would do,

00:01:56.134 --> 00:01:59.966
is go, look, a 4/7 probability means

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:03.490
I should expect that 4/7 of the time,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.839
especially if I'm doing it over,

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:06.738
and over, and over again,

00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:09.229
it's a reasonable expectation that, hey,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.809
4/7 of the time, I will get an elephant.

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.923
I've just calculated the theoretical

00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:16.909
probability here, based on this being

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.092
a fair spinner.

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:19.091
And that should inform,

00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:20.810
that if I were to do a
bunch of experiments,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.479
that 4/7 of the time that I should see

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.666
me getting the elephant.

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.245
So it would be a reasonable prediction

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:31.368
to say well, look, I'm
going to spin this thing

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:34.642
210 times, and I would expect

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:37.660
that 4/7 of those 210 times,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.748
I would get an elephant.

00:02:40.748 --> 00:02:42.954
And so, let's think about what this is.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.090
210 times 4/7,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.600
210 divided by seven is 30.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.138
30 times 40 is 120.

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:52.216
So 120 times.

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:54.050
My prediction, or maybe your prediction

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.849
was this as well, I think it's

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.138
a reasonable prediction,

00:02:57.138 --> 00:03:00.947
is that if I spin it 210 times,

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:04.186
that I'm going to get
an elephant 120 times.

00:03:04.186 --> 00:03:06.393
That's very important to think about,

00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:09.248
what this is saying,
and this is not saying.

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:11.605
Is it possible that I get an elephant

00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:15.284
121 times, or maybe 119 times?

00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:17.804
Sure, sure, it's completely reasonable

00:03:17.804 --> 00:03:19.382
that you might get something
different than this.

00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:21.588
In fact, there's some probability

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:23.321
that you get no elephant.

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:24.967
If you consider getting an elephant lucky,

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:28.124
that you just happen to keep landing

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.421
on the monkey or one of the mice,

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:30.919
and that's a very low probability

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.682
that that would happen
if you spun it 210 times,

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:36.503
but it is possible.

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:37.699
So it's important to realize

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:38.743
that this is just a prediction.

00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:40.481
There's actually a
possibility that you might get

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.824
an elephant on all 210 spins.

00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:44.935
Once again, that's a low probability,

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:46.234
but it is possible.

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:47.930
So this isn't saying
that you're definitely

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.019
going to get the elephant 120 times.

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.003
In fact, it's very reasonable,

00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:56.580
that you might get the elephant 123 times,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.599
or 128 times, or 110 times,

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.144
or even 90 times.

00:04:01.144 --> 00:04:05.399
These are all completely
reasonable things to happen.

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.495
All you would say,

00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:08.399
is that, look, if I had to predict it,

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.581
this, out of all of the different...

00:04:10.581 --> 00:04:13.018
I can get the elephant anywhere between

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:16.239
zero and 210 times, out of all

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.594
of those possibilities,
before I even start spinning,

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:23.429
I'll say, okay, I think that this is the

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.786
most reasonable one, that I'm going

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:27.618
to get it 4/7 of the time.

00:04:27.618 --> 00:04:31.081
But it's not saying that, hey,

00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:33.827
that I'm definitely going
to get it 120 times,

00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:37.136
it's not saying that 118 times,

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:41.687
or 129 times aren't reasonably

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:43.568
possible as well.

00:04:43.568 --> 00:04:44.311
It's just saying, look,

00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:45.634
this is a reasonable prediction.

00:04:45.634 --> 00:04:48.119
I'm using the experimental probability,

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.011
4/7 probability, and so,

00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:52.356
if I'm going to do something 210 times,

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:53.981
well, I could expect that it's going

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:55.954
to happen 4/7 of the time.

00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:57.231
I don't know for sure that it's going

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:59.020
to happen 4/7 of the time,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.881
but that is a reasonable
prediction to make.
