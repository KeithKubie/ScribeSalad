1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,950
But it's not an ethereal thing like a
thought, you know what I mean? Yeah. Like,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,810
so here's one of fiddy of
phobia or rack neophobia,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,120
fear of snakes or spiders.
Those that, have you ever
seen anybody who has that? Oh,

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,420
you were on fear factor with
me. Oh my God. That was awesome.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,660
That was the word I should say. You
were, you made it out bro. Boge laces.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,270
No. Do you remember I was on this in
one episode one I was the pilot episode,

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,660
the pilot episode. That's where
I met you for the first six T.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,560
Can you believe 16 what? 2001
yeah. What does that, what are we,

9
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:34,440
it's eight 18 years ago
we met because that was,

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,940
that was right after nine 11
yes. Yeah, right after it.

11
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:41,310
And they flew us down and
the first time I met you,

12
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:45,690
it was that saddle ranch and you're
like, welcome this dude. Oh Man.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,490
Okay. This, this is later.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,440
This is later is way later when we did
the new season of it in like 2011 yeah.

15
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,690
You tried to get me to eat that spider.
Yeah.

16
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:58,980
That's when I was acting like a spad
bro. Dude, dude, that's not a normal,

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,830
and you just chomped it like a chance.
So this whole scene,

18
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm acting like a little bit,
how a little,

19
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,240
little fearful you had eat sheeps,
eyebrows, eyeballs to eat. Dude.

20
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,780
Now those were disgusting. Have
you ever, did you eat the sheep?

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,060
He did because I felt bad for you guys.
That was before I had hardened.

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,110
I'd been hard into the world as you
guys were episode one. Season One.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,900
It didn't seem right for me that you
guys would have to eat these things and I

24
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:25,410
didn't need it. So I said, all right,
if you guys eat it, I'll eat it too.

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,940
But they didn't show it like they wouldn't
show it on television that I ate it

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,870
because they didn't like, they didn't
want it to look too easy. Yeah.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,570
So weird shit. But yet, oh my God.

28
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,710
I remember biting down into it and it kind
of like burst. Yeah. Then that retina,

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,660
the, he had to just chump change. Yeah.

30
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,300
You had to chew on that rent and
we had to eat three of them. Yeah,

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,530
they weren't good. No, they were horrible.
But you know, it was surprisingly mild.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,670
I ate a roach. Well, I'm not not bragging,

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,270
it's a place like much just a Roche
even though it doesn't taste like much.

34
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:59,250
Like why don't you eat a roach?
Is that part of the show?

35
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,230
It was a celebrity fear factor.
And um,

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,960
there was a young lady who was
scared to eat a roach and uh,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,720
she was going to get eliminated from
the show. And so I said, listen,

38
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:17,490
I'll make you a deal. I'll, if you do
it, I'll do it. And she's like, you will.

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,880
I go, yeah, I will. And she wouldn't do
it. So she made a deal like three worms.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,210
She decided I'll eat three warm, like
we can go shoot up to three more times.

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,110
And so then I ate a row.
I remember when I was on that show,

42
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:31,770
the question they would ask you in the
survey is, what's your fear of dying?

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,570
And I wrote down dying on the water
because that would be my biggest fear is

44
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,690
dying underwater.
And so the,

45
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,750
our last stunt was when they dumped us
on the water and my friends still send me

46
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:46,470
screenshots of that because that's when
I had long hair and I'll put a bunch of

47
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:51,390
gel in it and they dumped me under the
tank and literally it looked like a squid

48
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:55,650
shooting out. Oh my God. If you
could Google it, Google Michael,

49
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,840
Yo uh,
fear of fat and it's,

50
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,330
my friends will just screenshot that
and they still play that to this day.

51
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:05,070
They still play that episode of your
family. All of them. They play him on um,

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,170
different like true TV or something like
that. One of those, I remember those.

53
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,340
I remember when we were
talking I'll go cause you are,

54
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,790
what show were you on at that time
was radio. You were on news radio.

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,990
That was a couple of years
earlier. Hey, you are, look
at that. What happened? Yeah.

56
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,720
And okay, so that's the
cheap, I bought Michael Yo

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,710
cheap sai bowls.

58
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:31,390
So at the Ed at the ed I go
to Joe and I go, hey man,

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,710
I can't do the last dot.
Look at that. I can't. Okay.

60
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,780
So this is you talking to me cause
Joe goes, Joe goes, hey, I, I go Joe,

61
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,700
I'm not going to be able to make
it through this whole stunt.

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,880
I can't hold my breath for
that long. And you go, oh,

63
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,690
just make it look great for the camera.
So what I,

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,310
I was going to try to talk you into it,
but I wasn't good enough at it.

65
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:55,480
Then I did.

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,970
I had to figure out how to talk people
into it because I knew there's some

67
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,020
people that were just psyching themselves
out yet in the smoker one our episode,

68
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,560
that guy that we thought that was
going to lose no oxygen. Yeah,

69
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,550
it's fucking system.

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,720
He's used to having no oxygen and that's
when they cast it fear factor Alpha

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,170
personality. And then it just became a
hot fest. Like if you're a sexy of it.

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,150
It was also, um, you know,

73
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,360
they kept ramping up
the difficulty of stuff.

74
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:26,680
Like the last season scared the shit
out of me when they were launching a car

75
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:31,480
through a moving train and an explosion
happens when the car looks like what you

76
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,110
can kill somebody. Like, and
when I came up to your, uh,

77
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,200
I think it was the last season,
y'all are doing something with a donkey.

78
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:42,900
Dong Daci come that's
got canceled. Yeah. Yes,

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,280
because I remember showing up
and Joe says, come here Yo,

80
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,130
you're about to try talking.
Like what was so crazy,

81
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,110
everybody was going to quit when I showed
up that day and they brought the paper

82
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,180
into my trailer and they told
me what it was going to be.

83
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:01,620
I don't think I knew about that one
before. Some of them I had known about,

84
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,090
knew about before,
but I don't think I knew about that one.

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,210
I think when they brought that in,
I had no idea and I was like,

86
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:09,610
you can't do this. I'm like, no
one's going to do it. First of all,

87
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,444
they're all gonna quit.

88
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,130
But what was hilarious is I'm sitting
there next to you watching them drink this

89
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,180
stuff.
We're just laughing.

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,420
How about an intern had a drink
it and intern had drinking.

91
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:26,110
I think they only got like $100.
What for what? Well there was like,

92
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,630
part of the thing is that they
would have to test it when,

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,380
when they would like say
here's some fear factor info.

94
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,270
So like say if you had to eat
like a kidneys, right? How many,

95
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:41,200
how many kidneys can someone eat in
a minute? You know, like how much,

96
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,690
how much meat can you
actually look consistent,

97
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,300
gusting dried meat can you consume?

98
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,140
And so what we had was certain interns,

99
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,930
they would volunteer for it and they
would get like an extra hundred and

100
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,940
something dollars and I would
always give him money too.

101
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:57,710
I was getting a couple hundred
bucks on top of it, but they would,

102
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,550
they would eat whatever the fuck it was
and then they would determine all right,

103
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,590
well Mike usually can put it
down like, like, like no one.

104
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,100
And if he could only get through three
and then some other producers would come

105
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,840
in and go, fuck this. We're being pussies.

106
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,920
Making me for like for you guys are crazy.

107
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,420
And this was like the debate,

108
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,270
the bay debate on the set would be
like how much blood did they drink?

109
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,720
One Gallon, one gallon of blood,
like they never drank but,

110
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,580
but you know what I'm saying?
Like how many horse Dicks,

111
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,060
they never had a horse deck, but they
did eat like what? What's six and elk?

112
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:33,410
Dick's and deer. Dicks. But the
donkey come was the worst. Oh yeah.

113
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,110
And I even remember at the
shit you were like, yeah,

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,170
I think the show's over after
this. I like, they didn't air it.

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,310
I think they didn't, they couldn't even
other countries though of did it. Really?

116
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:44,840
Yeah.
So he could get it like in,

117
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,390
I think it's like Dutch
and so it's like you hear,

118
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,640
you hear us talk in English but then
they have Dutch subtitles. Yeah, that,

119
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,160
that was, that was such
so stupid. It's so, Doug,

120
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,000
are you surprised how
stupid people are to go? No,

121
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,910
because I think people are
like, look, it's an experience.

122
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm here for the experience. I'm
going to have some fun. This is crazy.

123
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,780
But when you get to donkey come yet
you're kind of being rude. Yes folks.

124
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,010
You know you got donkey,
this donkey,

125
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,220
then the donkey come is like an advantage
of their need for fame in a weird way.

126
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,240
No you are. But Hey, they want
to give it, that's the game.

127
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,890
And I remember you showing it to me
first and it was in this large glass

128
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:28,460
container and they, and it wasn't a
little, they had to drink. No, no, no.

129
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,130
It was like to drink a lot.
Yeah.

130
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,730
It was like the aforementioned
rhino horn beer mode.

131
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,590
Fuck large chunk.
Yeah.

132
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,720
You know what's even more offensive
on donkeys are they're not fertile.

133
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,400
Look at it. There it is. Oh that's
him. Yes. So that come is useless.

134
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,260
It's not just come.
But imagine it's like it's,

135
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,300
it's come that can never even
be babies. Okay. To Mail Shit.

136
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,990
But I remember when y'all used
to do stuff, this is disgusting.

137
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,650
I remember I used to do stunts.
It was actually a delicate,

138
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,000
like people in other
countries that actually ate
it sometimes. Both. Sometimes.

139
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,900
Yeah. Like balloon. So that's not, that's
just being done. It's just being me. Okay.

140
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:15,680
That's no other country is doing that
just for fun. Keep up on that whole, uh,

141
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:18,230
this in other countries,
this is considered a delicacy.

142
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,670
He gave up on that in a long
time ago. Yeah. You had to
push the envelope on that.

143
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:26,990
Now one of the things that
made things gross smell wise,

144
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:30,800
it was actually really expensive
cheese. They would go to this, uh,

145
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,640
expensive was if a full monitoring,
what do they call them?

146
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,930
What are they call one of those cheese
places like Italian for cheese for my

147
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,110
Tomas formality is for my shirt.
Isn't it French too?

148
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,890
Something like that is my,
that's my translation.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,300
They both come from that. I'm dumb.
I'm dumb. So there you go. But anyway,

150
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,050
this cheese that we
would use was disgusting.

151
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,680
It smelled so bad,

152
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:59,490
but apparently it tastes really good
if you're into that kind of cheese.

153
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,990
Like Bordain was really into stinky
cheese. Like would talk to me about it.

154
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,700
Like with passion like that,
just the,

155
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,920
the fucking stinkier the
better like disgusting smelling
cheese and the taste is

156
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,660
fantastic. I'd be like, wow.

157
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,710
I would think that the smell which we're
turning you off taste buds. Absolutely.

158
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,731
I don't know.

159
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:22,470
It's like one of those things where I
guess you catch like the right vibe,

160
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,610
like you going in with the right attitude.
There is no attitude. If it stinks,

161
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,080
fuck that dude is anything
that smells cheese.

162
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,650
And they would squeegee it off into a
blender and then they blend it up with the

163
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,000
other stuff,
like worms and shit.

164
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,630
It would make the worms taste
horrific or smell horrific. Oh,

165
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,120
so you were just messing
with the smell sense.

166
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:46,140
So it can make it seem like it was worse
than the way can get worse because it

167
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:50,160
smelled worse. So it was
making more like smell it, but

168
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,140
people would just start retching more.
It was,

169
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,090
it's a ridiculous fucking thing.

170
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:01,950
It's a ridiculous thing to
the show is really silly. No,

171
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:06,510
but I, I love that these people wanted to
be famous or you know, and that too, bro.

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,230
But I wasn't, but no, no, no, no.

173
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,330
But I was different to me too. That is
different too, because how it happened,

174
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:19,500
I was in Austin, Texas and there
was an ad in a paper that goes, hey,

175
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,170
have you ever done anything
adventurous? And I was like, no,

176
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:25,900
let me go in for this Cathy.
I was a radio DJ out there and um,

177
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,030
at this radio station. So
I go in and then Mikey, uh,

178
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,300
they called them the chimp.
He was the casting person.

179
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,940
And literally two weeks later,
three weeks later,

180
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:38,460
I'm in Hollywood shooting this
thing and then I meet you.

181
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:41,280
And then I remember going up to you,
cause I was in all,

182
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:44,040
it was the first time in a Hollywood,
I'll go and I knew you from news, right?

183
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,620
And I was like, how do you do it? And
you're gonna just fucking be yourself.

184
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:49,050
You can be successful.
And that's what you're doing right now.

185
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:51,500
Just fucking being yourself.
That's what you're doing to where,

186
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,620
where we're trying, we're
trying this. And I did listen,

187
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,110
let ridiculous piece of
advice. Just be yourself. No.

188
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,980
Do whatever you do.
Don't improve

189
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,660
right now forever. Good luck.
Just be yourself. That's all
you need, Bro. That's it.

190
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,060
Just tell you wrong. Just believe in
your dreams and make a vision board.

191
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,020
Joe was just trying to get me on his
face. Oh, just be you. All right?

192
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,350
But it that is the right
advice if, especially if you
want to be an entertainer,

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,440
if you can figure out how to be
yourself as long as yourself is actually

194
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:25,650
something interesting and if
it's not working yourself. Yeah.

195
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,550
And then you even said that
about acting and he's like,

196
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,330
I remember specifically
saying, aw, act is not hard.

197
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,230
It's just you yourself and you
play that emotion. And I was like,

198
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,430
oh that sounds easy.

199
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:40,431
You like if they can comparison to stand
up in some ways but does not like a

200
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:41,911
disrespect,

201
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:46,530
like the kind of shit that like Daniel
late Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo

202
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,850
Dicaprio. Well yeah, when they, when they
get into a fucking roll and you're like,

203
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,010
God damn that guy just own that shit.

204
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,460
Like they get into what I'm talking about
like sitcoms, acting. Yeah. Sitcom Act.

205
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:01,060
And they were hiring you to be easy
at that time. 100% yeah. So it was a,

206
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,680
a slightly dumbed down version of me
who is into slightly more conspiracy

207
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,720
theories than me when I was on news
radio. That's how it was. Yeah.

208
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,581
It was basically me,

209
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:13,000
like they wrote a lot of that conspiracy
shit in after I'd talked to them about

210
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:16,390
like JFK and fucking no Ufos and stuff.
