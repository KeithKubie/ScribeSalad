ALEX LEVICH: Welcome to Women
Techmakers, Product Management

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.040
with Alex Levich.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.120
I created the show
to show all of you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.950
how a product manager plays
a key role in building

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.240
and launching products.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.030
As you will see,
it's very exciting,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.175
and I'm thrilled to introduce
Gayathri Rajan, Product Manager

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.754
and Director at Google.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.795
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Thank you,
Alex, for inviting me.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.503
ALEX LEVICH: It's our
pleasure, Gayathri.

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:27.407
Tell us about you
and your career.

00:00:27.407 --> 00:00:29.740
GAYATHRI RAJAN: So I've been
a product manager at Google

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.980
now for more than nine years.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.990
And over the course
of these nine years,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.180
I've worked in a spectrum of
products ranging from payments

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.510
through to local commerce, and
now I work on Android with you,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.310
building the next
generation of computers

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.250
and other interesting
new devices.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.400
So it's been an
awesome experience.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.600
I just feel like I've learned
so much about very, very

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810
different product areas.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.820
ALEX LEVICH: It is definitely
a range of products.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090
Tell us about how you
began your career.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.379
I know that you actually did
start out as a product manager.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.620
GAYATHRI RAJAN: You know
at 18, it's really hard

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.560
to know exactly what you want.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.124
So I picked chemical
engineering,

00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:12.540
because with
chemical engineering,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.850
I got to stay an extra
year at Cambridge.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.150
And I thought that was a pretty
cool thing to do at that time.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.821
So I enjoyed-- I
enjoyed studying.

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.070
And then I went out and
worked as an chemical engineer

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.200
for a few years, but realized
that it was-- while I really

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.800
loved the engineering
aspects, I started

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.900
to feel that I was--
that was not exactly

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.120
the right career for me.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.940
And at the same time, I was the
mother of two young children,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.800
and various things
came together,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.130
and I decided I was going
to go back to school

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.920
and do a master's in computer
science, because I really

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.420
loved-- even as a
chemical engineer,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.970
I really loved to build
computer simulations,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.560
to design destination columns,
and compressors, and all

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.230
those heavy equipment that you
see in chemical engineering

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.780
companies, they're actually
designed with computers

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.960
and using programming languages.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.510
So I decided that was the thing
that I was going to do next,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.670
and that's how I got
into computer science.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.960
I was an engineer
first, learned really

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.440
how to build products as an
engineer, got very comfortable

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.350
with the programming
languages and all

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.330
the different technologies,
client server,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.520
web mobile, et cetera.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.770
And over the course
of that time realized

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.110
I really enjoyed
defining the products,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.820
figuring out what the
right priorities were,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.411
evangelizing the product
across large engineering teams,

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.160
more so than actually
building the product

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.150
to developing the code itself.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.750
So that's how I moved
again from being a computer

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.260
scientist to a product manager.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.207
So it's been--

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:42.665
ALEX LEVICH:It's
been quite a path.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:44.440
GAYATHRI RAJAN:It's
been quite a path,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.200
but I've learned
something along the way.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.310
And when I became
a product manager,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.500
I realized at that point I
was done, no more wondering.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.379
This was the place I wanted to
be and really grow my career.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.420
ALEX LEVICH: Tell me about
other product managers

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.586
that you've seen successful.

00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:00.997
What other paths that people
that up to get us get here?

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:02.580
GAYATHRI RAJAN: At
Google, many people

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.200
take a fairly technical
path to get here.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.000
So they've either
done computer science

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.550
or electrical engineering
or some kind of engineering

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.520
or science degree.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.720
But, I've also seen very
successful product managers

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.002
who are now senior leaders
in the company, who

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:23.300
had a liberal arts background
and were still able to do

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.570
a very nice job building
credibility, and working

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.760
with engineers, and really
establishing themselves

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.730
as key product managers.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.954
So really it just depends.

00:03:34.954 --> 00:03:38.790
I think your background to
some extent helps lay out,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.330
helps lay out your future.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.730
It helps sort of at least
provide the right signals,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.490
and it may give you
some of the skills

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.680
you need to get into product
management more easily,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.690
but ultimately, the key
skill for successful product

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.790
managers, in my
opinion is as you said,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.325
the love of building products,
building products that

00:03:57.325 --> 00:04:02.100
can have impact, two people,
two people such as ourselves

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.800
and doing it with
a lot of people

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.385
and being really
excited and energized

00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:06.820
about that whole process.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.870
So really regardless
of your background,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.492
if you have that core
passion of building product,

00:04:15.492 --> 00:04:16.929
you can get there.

00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:18.720
ALEX LEVICH: Yeah, it
makes complete sense.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.880
That's probably what makes
us wake up every morning

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.029
and be excited about work.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.957
It's that [INAUDIBLE]
for people.

00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:26.290
GAYATHRI RAJAN: It's a great
career, product management,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.577
because it doesn't
limit you in any way.

00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:32.410
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.243
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Yes.

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:36.090
You learn you can move from
one product area to another.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.180
You always take some skills
with you, the basic skills

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.800
of how do you
build products, how

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.830
do you set roadmaps, how do
you prioritize, how do you

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.750
define features?

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.070
These are very basic
fundamental skills

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.980
and talent that you can transfer
from one area to another.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.970
But everything
else is completely

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.244
new within that space, and
that's where the excitement is.

00:04:58.244 --> 00:05:00.160
That's where the excitement
is, because that's

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.340
when you learn about that
space, and what is needed,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.140
and how you can then take
your basic fundamental skills,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.860
but actually translate that
into a very different area.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.390
So you can never stop learning
in product management.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.990
It's almost inevitable
that you will never

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.870
be completely sure
of your domain

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.820
area, which also makes it very,
very much a growth experience.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.780
So you can wake up in
the morning and you can--

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.140
I never feel like I kind
of know how to do this.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.520
I can now do this in my sleep.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.440
No, I have to wake
up and get in to work

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.670
and get fired up, because it
is-- everyday is a challenge,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.540
but in a good way, because
everyday's a growth experience.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.740
ALEX LEVICH: That's probably
one of the best things

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.260
one could wish about of their
job is wake up in the morning,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.720
be excited, and be challenged.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.640
GAYATHRI RAJAN:
Look at you, Alex.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.220
Six months ago you were
working on a social platform

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.690
for Google, and now you are
building the next generation

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.470
of computers.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.522
ALEX LEVICH: Yes, indeed.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.839
Two very different things.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.130
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Very different.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.580
ALEX LEVICH: But the excitement
is the same, actually.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.840
It is just like you say.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.590
It's figuring out the
solutions every day

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.270
like it was the first day.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.920
Gayathri, thank you so much
for joining us and sharing

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.900
your path.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.830
Thanks, everyone, for tuning in.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.090
