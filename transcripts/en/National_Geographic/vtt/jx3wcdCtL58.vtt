00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.700
I'd like to continue
our work together.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.233
So why don't you come to
Prague with me, Jakob?

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:07.767
Maybe I could get you a
position at the University.

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.867
We'd have time to work
on accelerated motion.

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:13.100
Albert, I am flattered.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.200
But I've received another offer.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.000
A [inaudible]?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.800
No, assistant
to Philipp Lenard.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.033
Well, Lenard's a genius.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.667
Of course, you must accept.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:28.233
Yes, but he's got a bit of a
reputation, quite a taskmaster,

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:29.800
apparently.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.333
Honestly, I get a pit in my
stomach just thinking about it.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.266
I know how you feel.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.767
In Salzburg, I was so
nervous before my lecture,

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:42.200
I thought my heart was going
to stop right in the elevator.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.100
Actually, I imagined
something very strange.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.600
So the elevator was falling, and
I was just floating inside it.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:08.200
It was terrifying at first,
but then, suddenly, it was

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.133
as if I had no weight at all.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.400
Because a falling man does
not feel his own weight.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.233
Me, the floor, my papers were
all falling at the same rate.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:28.100
So I couldn't feel the pressure
of the floor on my feet.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.667
But what if the
elevator was rising?

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.133
I'd be accelerating in
the opposite direction.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.967
It would produce
the opposite effect.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.033
You'd feel the floor.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.800
I'd be glued to
it, as I am now.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.200
That's gravity.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.133
Exactly.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.200
I should've seen it before.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.300
This is so simple, so beautiful.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.367
Acceleration and gravity
are the same thing.

00:01:55.367 --> 00:02:00.433
This is the idea I've been
missing to complete relativity.

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:04.567
This may just be one of the
happiest thoughts of my life.
