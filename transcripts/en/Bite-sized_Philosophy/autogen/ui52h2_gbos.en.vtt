okay well I could talk let me talk about

okay well I could talk let me talk about
 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.169
okay well I could talk let me talk about
the situation at the Ivy League

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
the situation at the Ivy League
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.940

universities first the question broadly
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.509
universities first the question broadly
speaking covers the question about

speaking covers the question about
 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.070
speaking covers the question about
intelligence and about its diverse

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
intelligence and about its diverse
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.830
intelligence and about its diverse
manifestations and about its role in

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
manifestations and about its role in
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.070

selection for university to go back and
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.689
selection for university to go back and
look at the records at Harvard for

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
look at the records at Harvard for
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.210
look at the records at Harvard for
example in the early 1960s the typical

example in the early 1960s the typical
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.000
example in the early 1960s the typical
idea for a Harvard student was about 105

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
idea for a Harvard student was about 105
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150
idea for a Harvard student was about 105
to 110 not much above average but that's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
to 110 not much above average but that's
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.620
to 110 not much above average but that's
because they were finishing schools for

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
because they were finishing schools for
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.169
because they were finishing schools for
they for the rich roughly speaking and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
they for the rich roughly speaking and
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.359
they for the rich roughly speaking and
you know you're if you had a rich father

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
you know you're if you had a rich father
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.870
you know you're if you had a rich father
and he made his money he was probably

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880
and he made his money he was probably
 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.850
and he made his money he was probably
well above average and intelligence but

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
well above average and intelligence but
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.920
well above average and intelligence but
if you're his offspring there's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
if you're his offspring there's
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.389
if you're his offspring there's
regression towards the mean so there's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
regression towards the mean so there's
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.459
regression towards the mean so there's
no reason to assume that by nature of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
no reason to assume that by nature of
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.630
no reason to assume that by nature of
your position you were going to be

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
your position you were going to be
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.670
your position you were going to be
particularly intelligent anyways the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
particularly intelligent anyways the

average Ivy League student wasn't was
great but not outstandingly so now it's

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
great but not outstandingly so now it's
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.819
great but not outstandingly so now it's
like 100 IQ 145 3 standard deviations

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
like 100 IQ 145 3 standard deviations
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.590
like 100 IQ 145 3 standard deviations
above the mean because the reason for

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
above the mean because the reason for
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270
above the mean because the reason for
that is because they're selected by the

it's an IQ test they won't say it's an

it's an IQ test they won't say it's an
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840
it's an IQ test they won't say it's an
IQ test but that doesn't matter

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
IQ test but that doesn't matter
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.859
IQ test but that doesn't matter
it isn't test it's an IQ test as simple

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
it isn't test it's an IQ test as simple
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.090
it isn't test it's an IQ test as simple
as that any any test that contains a

selective because they can and so the
