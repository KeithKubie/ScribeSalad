ANDREW URMAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.930
My name's Andrew.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.090
I work on the Developer
Relations Team at Nest Labs.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.710
Just a quick show of hands,
who's heard of Nest so far?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.390
All right.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.350
That's great.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.950
For those who haven't, we
kind of have a simple mission.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.860
And what we want to
do is build a home

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.200
that's thoughtful-- one that can
think for you, react for you;

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.760
something that doesn't involve
a lot of set up, process,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.440
or configuration.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.120
And build products
that people love,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.600
products, typically,
that haven't

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.270
seen innovation in years.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.680
And one of the products
we started out with

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440
hadn't seen innovation in
about 30 or almost 50 years,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.312
actually.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.990
And it was the first-generation
Nest Learning Thermostat.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.350
And the idea was the
thermostat, packed

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.650
with a bunch of onboard
sensors, could learn for you,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.380
could learn the
schedule for you,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.810
and take automatic action to
lower the set point for you

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.540
and save energy.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.082
We added features
like Auto Away,

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:03.790
which could detect if
you're home or not,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.230
to further save energy.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.320
We then expanded to the
Nest Protect, a device that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.870
could alert you to smoke
or carbon monoxide danger,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.330
and specifically,
what room it's in.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.610
And then just recently
launched the Nest Cam,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.120
a camera that you can
check in from anywhere

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.810
just about any time.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.470
But that wasn't just it.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.006
We want to build
a thoughtful home.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:28.380
What that means
is we didn't want

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.470
to have another remote to
control, an app to open,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.350
or even a hub to plug in.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870
What we really
believe is devices

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.960
should be able to speak to
each other, locally, as well

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.780
as devices outside the
home, like cars and phones,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.440
so they can inform the home
to make better decisions.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.240
You can see this today
with our own products.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.920
For example, if the Nest
Protect senses carbon monoxide,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.820
the thermostat can automatically
shut off the heat furnace,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.345
which is typically the source.

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:58.720
And if you have
a Nest Cam, it'll

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.261
automatically start
recording a video

00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:05.190
and save it, regardless of
if you have service or not.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.970
That really isn't it.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.650
What we really wanted is
a home that could think,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.680
one that didn't respond
to just certain things.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.210
So we built what we
like to call Nest Sense.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.270
It's an intelligence
layer available to users

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.780
and developers.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.250
And it can take all
sorts of information

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.380
and make better decisions.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.260
This is the part of the smart
home that really sets us apart.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.110
This is the hardest part.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.690
It's not just about triggers
or anything like that.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.680
So some examples
are Home and Away,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.330
which is our whole home
occupancy model, determining

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.870
if anyone's home or not.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.190
ETA, which is-- we kind of
saw an example of a slide

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.600
ago-- where a car can tell the
home exactly when someone's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.460
going to be there, and
line up the set points

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.690
at the exact perfect time.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.610
And Energy Rush Hour, which
is our type of energy demand

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.500
response.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.180
If you don't know what that is,
it helps utilities shift load,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.924
and we also help
users save money.

00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:07.340
So we built this
for our products,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.840
but we didn't want
it to stop there.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.609
We also wanted to
work with developers.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.650
About a year and a half
ago, we launched the Work

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.320
with Nest platform.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.250
It's currently about
14,000 developers,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.090
building anything from--
we've seen washing machines

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.630
to connected pet feeders,
like you saw the other day.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.580
All sorts of devices.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.010
It's been a lot of fun to
see what people come up with.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.220
It's been very popular.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.690
Right now, one in
every eight Nest homes

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.180
has a Work with Nest
developer in it.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.800
And I think the popularity
is due to us working

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.280
with developers to figure
out great features, not just

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.910
integrations.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.451
We don't want to
connect devices just

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:43.940
for the sake of connecting them.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.310
We want things to happen
in a great way that's

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.907
easy for a user.

00:03:48.907 --> 00:03:50.490
And, of course, it's
almost impossible

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.880
to talk about the connected
home without mentioning privacy.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.390
And at Nest, we really
believe in user transparency.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.490
So as developers--
keep this in mind--

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.490
when you're building Works
with Nest connection,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.820
you have to explain to a
user in very plain terms

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.120
exactly what piece of
data you're asking for,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.576
and give a reason for it.

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:10.200
Unfortunately, as
developers, if you're

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.180
trying to ask for a piece of
data without a clear use case,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.690
we won't allow that.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.540
Users must know what's
going on with their data.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.940
And we're fully
focused on the home.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.360
It's not a research
topic for us.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.370
It's not a testing
the waters type deal.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.800
We're not seeing how
it's playing out.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.320
We're all obsessed
with the home.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.950
We feel when it doesn't work.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.700
We know when things happen,
and should happen differently.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.770
And we love working
with developers

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.140
who feel the same way.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.780
And we love showing
them off too.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.200
We recently launched a
Works with Nest catalog.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.120
It's a place online
where developers

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.180
can submit their
integrations to this portal,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.890
and users can come in
and browse by device,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.370
and see what else is compatible.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.120
And it doesn't
matter if you're one

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.170
of the biggest
companies in the world

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.695
or just a single
developer at home.

00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:03.690
But we've also built
some great tools,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.610
and this one actually
has a funny backstory.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.710
We heard horror stories
of developers lighting

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.340
paper towels on fire to test
their carbon monoxide sensor

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.560
and smoke sensor.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.580
So I said, it's about
time to build a simulator.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.900
It runs as a Chrome app.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.280
It runs fully as a Chrome app.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.704
And it can simulate just about
any readable field in the API.

00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:27.870
And you can also, actually,
respond to changes, too.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.170
So if you make a
change into the API,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.180
the simulator will
update in real time.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.000
What's also great
about the simulator

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.500
is you can test all
sorts of home scenarios.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.710
So you don't have to go out and
buy 20 thermostats, and 20 Nest

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.770
Cams, and devices.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.052
In the simulator,
you can simulate

00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:48.510
two different locations with
all sorts of different devices

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.300
to really test what
you've been building.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.830
But let's take a quick look at
what a typical response would

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.080
look like.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.590
This is from our
newly-released Nest Cam API.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.930
You can see it's formatted
in very basic JSON, very

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.930
standard structure,
key value pairings.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.600
Get really interesting
information

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.790
like the name, which is typical.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.850
You can tell if it's
streaming or not.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.850
And probably the
most important one

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.630
is if you see this
last event bucket here,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.350
that is real-time notifications
on motion or sound.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.420
So as a developer, you can now
hook into the Nest Cam's motion

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.026
and sound capability
and get responses.

00:06:25.026 --> 00:06:26.900
If the user happens to
have Nest Aware, which

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.660
is the subscription
model, then you

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.500
can get image snapshots
and GIFs of events,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.580
and surface them
in your interfaces.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.380
But the foundation was
important for the API.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.895
So we built it on a fully
cross-platform ideology.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.980
And Android is great.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.070
We all love Android,
but for the smart home

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.640
to really be realized, it has
to be fully cross-platform.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.590
We have Windows
Phone integrations

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.850
that we've seen people
make, and, of course, iOS.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.230
Everything is RESTful.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.840
Just about all your
calls, bulk of it

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.550
will be done using
HTTP GET and PUT,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.860
some POST here now and then.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.140
And, of course, like you
saw, everything's in JSON.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.990
It's all encrypted.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.250
It's all over HTTPS.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.890
Someone actually
asked to not have

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.520
that for some reason,
which I thought was insane.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.454
And all authentication
is done using OAuth2.

00:07:22.454 --> 00:07:24.870
And we use these technologies
because they're very simple.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.410
There's widespread
documentation for them.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.530
There's communities full of
developers helping people out.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.280
And you can get started
almost immediately.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.460
Actually, we've seen people
launch integrations in 10 days,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.280
and I've seen developers
get started in 20 minutes.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.210
But let's say you've
signed up, you've

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.950
downloaded your simulator,
you understand what JSON is,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.100
and now you want to get started.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.180
We've built three
connection methods for you.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.120
A Firebase and REST
Streaming, which are realtime,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.120
and, of course,
your typical REST.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.520
We almost always push
developers to do realtime.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.230
There's really no good reason
to not do realtime anymore,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.290
especially when it comes to IoT.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.580
People have UX and UI that
they need to keep in date.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.450
Users really know when
that's not perfect.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.780
And it would be weird
to have a device trigger

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.209
something 10 minutes after
the actual event happened.

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:22.500
There was actually some good
talks about Firebase here,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.760
and there will be one later,
as well, on the Android.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.180
But let's take a typical
look at some architectures

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.700
that we typically see.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.394
Here, Firebase is
great for mobile.

00:08:32.394 --> 00:08:36.679
It has awesome libraries for
just about every platform.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.630
And where it really excels is
in the type of architectures

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.519
where there are no
middle-ground servers.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.560
So these devices are
holding their own databases,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.320
or they're holding their
own source of truth.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.800
And using Firebase, you can
use the asynchronous nature

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.590
of the streams to make
all calls, in and out,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.910
in that single stream.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.469
And we'll update you
once things change.

00:08:58.469 --> 00:09:00.510
Firebase has actually been
pretty popular lately.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.576
I've seen a lot used
in web browsers.

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:04.450
Like I mentioned,
Raspberry Pi has been huge.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.050
There's a lot of Raspberry
Pi Firebase examples.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.680
But it's really good
for devices that

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.231
are powerful enough to hold
their own basic node server.

00:09:14.231 --> 00:09:15.730
For the cloud type
of architectures,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.840
we have REST Streaming,
which is a one-way get.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.190
So information only flows from
the Nest cloud to your service.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.550
And what's nice about
this is it provides

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.980
a really good
foundation to scale

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.370
architectures to thousands of
users, hundreds of thousands

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.440
of users hopefully, right?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.051
And if you're a
developer managing

00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:39.300
all sorts of different
devices, different connectivity

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.230
types, devices, or phones,
this kind of cloud architecture

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.770
is really ideal, because
now you have our device

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.270
as part of the Nest cloud, and
a realtime input into what's

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.937
going on there.

00:09:52.937 --> 00:09:54.520
And, of course,
there's just sometimes

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.090
no substitute for your
garden variety REST.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.950
Information only
comes when asked for.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.870
You asked, what's the
temperature today?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.700
And it is 65.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.700
The only problem with
this is it's not realtime.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.470
You have to constantly
ask for updates.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.070
It's not a great
user experience,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.540
but it really does
have its place.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.650
I personally use this constantly
when prototyping or debugging.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.330
I use it a lot when testing.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.210
I can use it quickly
to make a call

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.200
and see if it succeeded or not.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.670
And the other day, I
was just testing around

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.300
and I messed up the URL path
in the API, which is arguably

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.572
the easiest part of the API.

00:10:31.572 --> 00:10:34.030
But really put it all together,
this is what it looks like.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.110
You have your Nest devices
talking to each other

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.060
and talking to the Nest service,
as well as communicating back

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.962
with the mobile app.

00:10:41.962 --> 00:10:44.420
Connected all through the cloud
API to a developer service,

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.760
or like we saw earlier
with Firebase, a phone.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.050
And this is a good start.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.060
It's where we are today.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.650
But it's not where
we wanted to be.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.692
And that's when we decided
to come up with Nest Weave.

00:10:57.692 --> 00:10:59.400
And what Nest Weave
is is a whole new way

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.700
to connect connected devices.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.750
And we built Nest Weave
out of frustration

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.930
about what we saw out there.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.470
Nothing else provided a
local, direct device-device

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.890
communication,
which is critical.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.890
If a device is connected
directly to each other,

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.432
things can work
without the internet.

00:11:17.432 --> 00:11:19.431
And the home needs to
work without the internet.

00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:21.788
If your cable goes down,
everything should still work.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.300
Weave is an application layer,
purely an application layer,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.590
which means it can run over
different network types.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.440
We're targeting a low power
mesh network called Thread.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.610
It launched, and it will quickly
expand to Wi-Fi and local land

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.440
devices, as well.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.120
It runs all over IPv6,
which means that we'll now

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.400
have a comprehensive solution
for just about every scenario

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.310
out there.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.760
Where Nest Weave really excels
right now is with low power

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.240
battery-constrained devices with
very small hardware footprints.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.090
Keeps cost down.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.630
Typically, these devices
can't last on battery

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.110
on your normal Wi-Fi
connection for more than five

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.177
to six months.

00:12:06.177 --> 00:12:08.260
But now with Nest Weave,
with your low power mode,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.593
you can have a battery device
last for up to five years.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.210
And it's secure.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.860
Regardless of if
you're connecting

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.670
a Thread device
to a Wi-Fi device,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.580
or low power to full power, it
provides end-to-end security.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.910
Every message is
encrypted from the host

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.125
to wherever it's going.

00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:28.000
There is no snooping.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.541
There is no
man-in-the-middle attack.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.146
The full message is encrypted.

00:12:31.146 --> 00:12:32.520
Every device should
be encrypted.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.930
In fact, we just had someone
argue that oh, a light bulb

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.350
doesn't need to be that secure.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.360
But it absolutely does.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.359
It provides weak points.

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:40.670
So everything is
absolutely secure.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.280
And what Nest
Weave also provides

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.110
is a local access to
the Nest Services.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.287
So here's what we saw before,
the typical architecture.

00:12:50.287 --> 00:12:52.620
Again, it's a good start, but
it's reliant on the cloud.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.750
It's reliant on two developer
services functioning.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.760
And this is where we see
the typical Nest Weave

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.550
architecture looking like.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.310
Devices are communicating
locally to each other,

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.950
but still back to
the Nest service.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.970
And if you can see here, even
back to the developer service.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.879
So you still don't have to
lose all that information.

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:14.420
Actually, our products
do this today.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.570
Our Nest Protect, if it senses
smoke or carbon monoxide,

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.860
can alert the other Nest
Protects in the home,

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.160
using this Nest Weave network.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.927
We use it today.

00:13:23.927 --> 00:13:24.510
This is great.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.330
It works without the internet.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.788
Doesn't matter if
the router is on,

00:13:26.788 --> 00:13:28.970
if the Wi-Fi is working,
if the power's on.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.080
And it provided
great functionality

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.480
and we can't wait to
extend it to developers.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.050
But reliable messaging
isn't the end of it.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.510
Currently, there is
a semblance of IoT

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.641
where people are just
manufacturing these devices

00:13:46.641 --> 00:13:47.890
that can be remote controlled.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.580
I can turn on.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.180
I can turn it off.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.130
It is a good start.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.250
Or they have this
assemblance of smart homes

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.850
that you have to build
complex rule systems for.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.810
When condition A happens,
trigger action B.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.080
The problem is it can be
very complex and confusing

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.820
for a standard user.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.280
They now have to remember every
single rule that they made.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.710
And if anything steps
outside of that rule,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.956
they're kind of screwed.

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:13.830
Think of it this way.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.300
If someone sets a rule up,
says when my phone leaves,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.460
I want my lights to turn
off, the TV to turn off,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.690
and the thermostat to cool down.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.270
The problem is,
if someone leaves,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.811
that will trigger--
even if someone's

00:14:23.811 --> 00:14:25.930
sitting on the
couch watching TV--

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.050
it could provide a very
frustrating environment,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.100
especially in your home.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.495
Also, a lot of race
conditions happening.

00:14:34.495 --> 00:14:36.120
Again, these users
now have to remember

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.030
every single rule they set up.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.790
And we've seen horror stories
of people setting up a rule.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.290
Turn off the power at five, and
then turn on the power at five.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.550
So then what happens?

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:51.050
The way we see it, is we
want to expand Nest Sense.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.310
And we're doing it in a way that
can adapt to the environment.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.380
It can actually determine
what's going on.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.480
We can use confidence levels to
say, I know if someone's home,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.020
or I know no one's home.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.330
And for the user, hopefully
that involves zero set-up.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.370
Maybe a little option
here when they pair it,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.070
but it should be very
easy and clear to a user,

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.770
and it can adapt to their lives.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.770
And all this is just kind
of getting to the fact

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.894
that we need to really
understand what's happening,

00:15:18.894 --> 00:15:25.000
not just send info
from rule A to rule B.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.650
And we're starting to
expand this to developers.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.130
Actually, no one's
seen this yet.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.460
This actually has not
been released publicly.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:37.240
But this is an example of what
our sensor API will look like.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.240
Here, you can see an
example, a standard, again,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.150
very basic JSON.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.410
Looks just like our web API.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.180
You have a light
that was turned off,

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.530
physically, and a motion
sensor that was just

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.750
activated for about a minute.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.150
And let's go back to
that phone example.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.960
A lot of people set up rules
that say, when I see motion,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.910
turn a light on.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.860
But in this scenario, someone
turned the switch physically

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.850
off.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.000
Are we going to turn
the light back on?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.020
That would be really weird.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.470
So we're working on this
data API for developers

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.470
to start sharing
information, as well as

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.340
Nest sharing information back.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.260
So all these inputs can now be
read locally by the Nest Sense

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.040
algorithms, and
developers can subscribe

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.980
to what's going on in the home.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.860
And this is the hardest part,
by far, for developers to build.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.905
And with this
solution, you don't

00:16:26.905 --> 00:16:28.446
have to go build
your own algorithms.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.805
You don't have to go build
a motion sensor algorithm.

00:16:30.805 --> 00:16:32.930
You don't have to go build
a temperature algorithm.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.145
You can participate
in the Nest home,

00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:36.645
and we'll give you
that information.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:47.300
So we got a quick look at
the Works with Nest API.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.160
You saw a little bit
of tools that we have.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.850
And you're going to get started
with a realtime stream, right?

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.419
Either Firebase
or REST Streaming.

00:16:56.419 --> 00:16:58.210
When building a product,
consider what else

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.670
that you could do
besides basic control,

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.390
especially with
connected products.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.431
It's not just about remote
controlling something.

00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:05.780
That's not a smart product.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.520
That's a connected one.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.224
And sign up for more
information on Nest Weave.

00:17:11.224 --> 00:17:13.140
We'll have a lot more
for you later this year,

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.010
and if you sign
up on our website,

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.120
we can get a lot more
information going.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.193
We're going to have some
Q&amp;A in about a minute,

00:17:22.193 --> 00:17:23.609
so if you guys
have any questions,

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.319
feel free to bring it up.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.780
I'm assuming there's
going to be a few.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.910
So thanks a lot for listening.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.790
My name's Andrew.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.410
You can find us on
developer.nest.com.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:41.290
We have a Stack Overflow account
with a Nest-API tag, as well as

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.520
a GitHub account.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.620
Ryan Seys on our developer
engineering group

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.110
just created a really awesome
REST Streaming example,

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.710
showing building
a quick dashboard

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.900
in your mobile browser.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.270
And thank you.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:59.205
So let's see if we
have any questions.

00:17:59.205 --> 00:17:59.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.480
I think the big obvious
one is all day yesterday,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.710
we were listening
about Brillo and Weave.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:11.570
I know that Nest Weave is
different than the other Weave.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.399
Are you guys talking
to each other at all?

00:18:15.399 --> 00:18:16.190
ANDREW URMAN: Yeah.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.710
Once in a while.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.545
Just kidding.

00:18:18.545 --> 00:18:20.827
We are constantly in
communication with each other.

00:18:20.827 --> 00:18:22.660
As you might have heard
from the other ones,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.140
we will share device schema.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.150
We'll have a common
schema between each other.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.340
But really, Nest Weave
is about the home.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.350
All of our connectivity
methods are

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.720
about the home-- low-power
battery constrained devices

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.690
like context sensors
and motion sensors, that

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.461
need to run on really
small hardware.

00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:42.710
And it's an application layer.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.918
So it's fully cross-platform.

00:18:43.918 --> 00:18:48.180
We didn't want to silo anybody
into one platform or not.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.860
And one of the biggest points
is whether using Nest Weave

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.410
locally, it will look the
same in the cloud, as well.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.451
So if you don't want to
adopt Nest Weave locally,

00:18:55.451 --> 00:18:57.170
you could still
use our cloud APIs.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.820
But where we're
focused on the home,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.950
Google's focused on the world,
connected to everything.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.440
And that's really
where we differ.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.680
We kind of used Weave as
a broad connectivity word.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.779
So that's kind of the main
difference between both of us.

00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:14.320
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.778
Because a lot of
the statements you

00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:19.680
made today, the low
power, the connect local,

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.440
that's exactly what
we heard yesterday.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:21.710
ANDREW URMAN: Yeah.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.660
AUDIENCE: I think
the biggest thing

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.868
I heard just now that was
different from what I heard

00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:27.750
then is you're
giving us some really

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:32.060
good-- the last part of-- you're
giving us some really good

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.330
analytics, some really
good decision-making, which

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.690
we sort of heard when we
were listening to Tensor Flow

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:38.190
yesterday.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.310
So we're seeing a lot of
overlap between you guys,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.420
and not getting a
lot of clear answers

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.680
about who we're supposed
to be listening to.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.040
ANDREW URMAN: Yeah.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.581
AUDIENCE: And if
you guys are, again,

00:19:48.581 --> 00:19:50.930
if you guys are working
together at all.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.780
ANDREW URMAN: We are working,
again, very closely together.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.450
And we would like
to converge the two.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.050
But right now, again,
we're focused on the home

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.700
and Google's focused
on the world.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.250
But other than the
standard schema,

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.000
they're really different
connection types.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.120
And we started as a purely
cross-platform play.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.310
And we wanted to stay a
purely cross-platform play.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:21.190
So being everything's
based on IPv6,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.310
it might provide something
easier down the road.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.800
But as a developer, if you
want to build a Nest Weave

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.490
product that connects
with the Nest ecosystem,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.550
you're going to have
to use Nest Weave.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.500
Yeah.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.490
And, again, we'll
have a CodeLab right

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.090
after this for about an hour.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.410
We have some of our great
engineers here as well.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.105
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:41.105 --> 00:20:42.150
Can you hear me?

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.112
ANDREW URMAN: Yeah.

00:20:43.112 --> 00:20:44.570
AUDIENCE: What
about considerations

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.950
for user interface?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.730
Any issues or thoughts?

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.240
ANDREW URMAN: Oh, tons.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.740
As part of the certification,
we do a user interface review.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.360
We do a US and UI review.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.890
But it's not hard requirements.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.060
For Nest Weave, we will
have hard requirements.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.960
Things need to look
really simple to users

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.190
and be really easy to use.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.270
So a device can be
connected to the network

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.019
and have all this
access to all this data,

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:12.710
but not be very easy
to use and simple.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.690
So yes, we do have
considerations.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.680
We don't have a requirement,
any information on requirements

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.610
right now, through.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.700
AUDIENCE: And no
platform, or open source

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.770
for like UX designers yet.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.240
I know things are heavily
geared towards developers,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.139
but if you need designers.

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:31.930
ANDREW URMAN: Yeah.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:32.429
Yeah.

00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:35.860
So everything being based
on this standard schema,

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.340
in the Nest app, everything
could look the same.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.491
We're also excited
to hopefully open up

00:21:41.491 --> 00:21:43.990
to developers to build their
own experiences within the Nest

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.040
app.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.460
But it would be interesting to
build a community around the UX

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.500
and UI of the home, what's
good and what's bad.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:51.920
That would be interesting.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.450
I'd like to talk to you
about that a little more.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.283
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:21:54.283 --> 00:21:55.150
Sure, thanks.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
maybe this is taking

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.890
that question up a
little bit level to sort

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.580
of the ethnographic level.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.550
Does Nest participate
in the public discussion

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.220
of what home life is,
again, from an ethnographic

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.680
descriptive point of view?

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.730
How often do North American
front doors open and close,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.040
stuff like that.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.870
ANDREW URMAN: No, we don't.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:19.130
We don't in the sense where
it's about Nest user data.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.400
We don't really
release user stats.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.049
We don't like to use the users
kind of as-- yeah, what's that?

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:27.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just
mean scientifically.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.080
ANDREW URMAN: Scientifically.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.162
Unfortunately, we don't.

00:22:30.162 --> 00:22:31.620
We sometimes work
with universities

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.370
on specific topics.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.560
But not in this.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.410
If you have anything in mind,
I'd love to kind of bounce

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:37.910
around.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.034
I'd love to do a research
project with a university

00:22:40.034 --> 00:22:42.661
or something.

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:43.160
All right.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.269
I can't really see
anything, so earlier

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:46.810
when I asked if
anyone heard of Nest,

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.893
I really hope everyone
raised their hand because I

00:22:48.893 --> 00:22:50.240
can't see anything.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.740
All right.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.240
If there's no other
questions, we'll

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.460
have a Code Lab, sorry, a Code
Review in our office hours

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.700
just across the hall.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.748
Thank you.
