00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.120
 I am very fascinated by chess. 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.040
 Not just because I was playing in middle school. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.380
 Or participated in the competition in high school. 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.200
 It’s not a trophy at college. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.480
 The chess is wonderful because it has a lot of meaning in the movie. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.140
 Whether through metaphor, metaphor, or storyline 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.220
 Producers like to add chess to the story to present something that other games can’t show. 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.140
 So let's get started! 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.420
 1: If you want to learn, I will teach you 2: Hey, please, we are still comparing. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.460
 Basically, chess is used as a metaphor 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.480
 It is often associated with "patience" and "precision" 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.160
 Is boxing a kind of chess known? You must choose tactics to kill each other. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.540
 The main character in the interstellar terminator is set as a chess player. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.220
 He referenced the chess in the whole movie. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.740
 A is like chess 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.840
 First you have to strategically locate these pieces. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.380
 When the time is right, they will fight each other. 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 The next step is to use chess to show someone's cleverness. 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.140
 Here is where the director cleverly uses it. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.400
 In 2001: Space roaming, Hal's intelligence is based on the ability to defeat humans in chess. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.000
 For the current movie fans, this scene has lost its importance. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.540
 Because in the past 20 years, computers have been defeating humans. 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.640
 But in 1968, this scene shows that Hal not only has high IQ, but is also very powerful. 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.980
 If you look at this scene more closely, it is actually a layman of some important episodes. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.820
 When this super computer tells humans a better choice 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.860
 Hal: I am sorry, Frank, I think you missed it. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.080
 The queen moved to the bishop 3, the bishop ate the queen 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.000
 The Cavaliers eat the bishop 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.280
 From the chess we see that the computer does not agree with humans. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.460
 And moved a better step for him, subtly showing that the computer can touch and surpass him. 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.080
 This scene has been very well laid out for the storyline. 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.540
 I am sorry, Dave. I am afraid I can't do this. 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.300
 Hal actually made a mistake when talking about the game. 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.820
 His chess advice, the Queen moved to Bishop 3, is impossible 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.080
 So Hal execution was forced to die, but was wrongly announced 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.580
 You can say that it is the fault of Cooper. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.300
 Or, more interestingly, it is Kubrick's subtlety that paves the way for Harr's final disintegration. 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.360
 Hal and Frank's showdown brought to the third point 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 Chess can skillfully present a confrontation between two people. 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.940
 This can be what you think is symbolic or just trivial. 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.300
 In Sherlock Holmes, the actual conflict in the chess game made this meaning more obvious. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.680
 This is a dispute of wisdom, but there are other implications for this matchup. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.620
 Chess is a very versatile game, Pixar has made a short story about the chess 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.620
 It’s like saying that it’s common to show someone’s sacrifice with chess. 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.540
 Perhaps the most "literal" example is Harry Potter. 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080
 Knight moved to H3 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.040
 Sherlock Holmes sacrificed his queen in the game, directly reflecting his intention to stop Moriarty’s plan. 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.780
 The strategy of victory sometimes needs to be sacrificed 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.980
 Think further, you can even let the chess pieces metaphorize what will happen. 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.700
 Wan Wang Wang played the car and the Cavaliers, but Professor X sacrificed the powerful chess. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.240
 And pawn to win 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.980
 These moves reflect the worldview of each player 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.700
 Wan Wang has a strong chess to represent the struggle with the mutant 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.320
 However, Professor X showed his trust in humanity and the desire for cooperation with his paws. 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.500
 This scene is a clever metaphor for the movie, because the pawn in the chess can be transformed into a knight or a car. 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.440
 When human beings are used as pawns in X-Men movies, this metaphor will be strongly supported. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.780
 In chess, the pawn moves first. 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.800
 I think the chess game metaphor is very powerful in the story. 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.960
 In the American crime story, Laubert Shapiro and Johnny Carson both placed chess in the office. 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.140
 In this episode they decided to debate the race 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.480
 In this scene, the chess is placed on the right side of the foreground. 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.500
 From this it is obvious that the chess is shifted to the lens focus. 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.920
 And what do I think this might represent? 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.420
 Of course, I hesitate to over-interpret, but if the chess is only a war of black and white, it is meaningless. 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.820
 In this scene about black white dialogue, chess has a powerful visual effect. 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.260
 And added that this trial is about racial meaning 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.980
 Perhaps the best summary of using all of these techniques comes from the scene of the TV series FireWire Crime Squad. 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.940
 Daniel essentially uses chess to explain drug trafficking 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.760
 The car is a poison cave, the queen is an accomplice, and the king is the head. 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.380
 They even took the names of gangs on the pieces. 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.700
 He won’t panic 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.920
 The people in this gang cover him. 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.900
 They are blocking, he doesn’t have to do anything at all. 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.320
 Just like your uncle 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.760
 Right like my uncle 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.020
 The pawn is compared to a soldier. In reality, these children are small soldiers in the gang. 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.160
 So they naturally agree with the pawn identity. 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.460
 Interesting is the question raised by Florus after understanding the pawn. 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.420
 They like to rush to the front, on the battlefield 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.360
 Then how do you become a king? 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.820
 not like this 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.460
 Look, the king is always the king. 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.980
 Alright? No one will change. 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.380
 The pawn will always serve the king, no matter how 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.180
 Even walking across the board 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.820
 If you caught the other king 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.840
 Then set the trap, then you win. 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.800
 Ok, but if I stay until the end 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.020
 I am the head 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.200
 This is not the case 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.320
 From chess, we learned about drug friendship and how his class hierarchy is consolidated like a flag. 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.080
 In any case, these pieces are bound by their identity, nowhere to escape. 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.700
 They sacrificed for the king, but they will never be in power anyway. 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.100
 These pawns, dude, will soon be caught in the trick. 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.220
 "Game" will end soon 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.380
 Unless they are a small pawn 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.520
 Most games are linear in the use of the movie. 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.020
 Bingo builds on family life after retirement 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.320
 If you are playing dungeons and dragons, then the character is the stereotype of the nerd. 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.880
 But if it is chess, there is always more worth analyzing. 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.100
 So try to take the first step 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.080
 Where is your majesty? 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.260
 Hi, sir, the king is playing chess. 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.440
 chess? 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.420
 I hate chess! 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.400
 Thanks for watching!
