00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.553
[inaudible]

2
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.500
<v 1>one of the commonalities, one of the patterns that you spot really quickly.</v>

3
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:21.170
If you interview hundreds of world class performers,

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.500
and I just interviewed 130 or so for my new book tribe of mentors is the fact

5
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:29.810
that they have consistent morning routines.

6
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:33.980
They have some type of recipe of boot up sequence that they use to win the day

7
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:38.090
in some fashion and it ranges from, for instance,

8
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.590
mindfulness and that could be mindfulness meditation where you find,

9
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:45.590
say Evan Williams, who is well known for blogger Twitter,

10
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.780
also medium a who spends time every morning as I do with some type of meditative

11
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:54.950
practice, could be insight. A could be a transcendental meditation.

12
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.810
You could use an app like headspace,

13
00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:00.560
which I think is a great place to start and it trains you.

14
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.030
It allows you to practice becoming more aware and less reactive so that you're

15
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:10.010
not thrown off by the unexpected challenges and problems of the day and that

16
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:13.130
helps you to be much more productive and much more centered.

17
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.750
You can achieve that in other ways. Gratitude is a common element.

18
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:22.040
So Tim O'Reilly, who's just an incredible entrepreneur, thinker, writer,

19
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.610
and a thought leader in silicon valley goes for a run and we'll take a

20
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:32.570
photograph of a single flower on his run every morning. Right?

21
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.310
And this teaches you to pause, to pause and to assess how you're say,

22
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:38.720
responding to things.

23
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.980
So that is a really beautiful practice that can be done with gratitude lists.

24
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.280
I use something called the five minute journal about Whitney Cummings,

25
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.980
incredible standup comedian writer,

26
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.530
and much more also has gratitude lists. Uh,

27
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.840
and this is saying naming three things that you're grateful for each morning.

28
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.510
Tony Robbins does this. Brian Grazer,

29
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.570
incredibly well known iconic TV and film producer also does this.

30
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.060
I think he's had 180, I mean nominations or something like that.

31
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.160
And that achieves very much the same thing of present state awareness and

32
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:16.580
looking for the positive as opposed to fixating on the negative.

33
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.410
And last but not least, you have, say Jocko Willink,

34
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.040
retired navy seal commander who will lay out his clothing,

35
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.070
his workout clothing the night before so that there's no conscious decision

36
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:34.400
required were willpower or lack thereof could intercede.

37
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:37.240
His clothing is ready. He's already set his to do list for the next day,

38
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.103
wakes up at,

39
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.470
he wakes up at four 30 that's not quite when I wake up and grabs the clothes,

40
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.670
boom directly to the gym and he has a home gym where he does his workouts.

41
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.540
This is also very common where people recognize these very busy,

42
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:53.600
very driven people that if it's inconvenient to work out,

43
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:54.710
they probably won't do it.

44
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.770
So Jocko has a gym where barbell plates squat rack,

45
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.180
three sets of rings at different heights like kettle bell and you're good to go.

46
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:04.990
That's all you need.

47
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.560
So this is a few of the things that I've seen repeatedly in different forums

48
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.890
with hundreds of top performers that they use to win the morning so they can win

49
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.220
the day. Hey guys,

50
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.990
if you're enjoying the tips and tactics and how to on this channel or in the

51
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.320
podcast, the Tim Ferriss show, I made this for you.

52
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.140
Try to mentors short advice from the best in the world.

53
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.130
This is the book that I wanted to read. So I went out and I put it together,

54
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.350
created a dream list of 130 of the best at what they do.

55
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:39.130
People who are icons, legends, and ask them all the same questions.

56
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.110
These are people in some cases I want it to reach out to.

57
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:44.860
My whole life ranges from many, many billionaires,

58
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:47.590
cofounders of every company imaginable,

59
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.940
elite athletes ranging from surfing to tennis to power lifting. Everything else,

60
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.050
country stars, actors, directors, and you can spot the pattern.

61
00:03:57.051 --> 00:04:00.040
So some of my friends have said this is the easiest to read,

62
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.010
most useful book that I've put together yet.

63
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.510
So checking out tribal mentors.com you can find sample chapters,

64
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:10.690
the whole list of mentors, everything, tribe, mentors.com.
