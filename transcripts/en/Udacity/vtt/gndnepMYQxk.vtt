00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.460
Now, you've got a good idea of what jQuery has to offer.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.490
You've learned that jQuery is just a JavaScript library and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.860
it doesn't contain any hidden magic.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.330
You've learned how to easily select anything in the DOM with jQuery.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.300
You've learned a few basic DOM access methods and

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.520
you've manipulated the DOM with ease.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800
You've gone beyond that to add to and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.270
remove from the DOM, and you've even learned how to use jQuery to

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.660
simply iterate through the DOM in a few lines of code.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.310
But best of all, you've learned how to read through jQuery's documentation and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.840
make sense of it all.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.180
It's not some big, scary beast.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.170
jQuery is a tameable library with methods that are as simple to

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.435
learn as they are to write.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.690
You're ready to get out there and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.460
start writing some elegant, concise front-end code with jQuery.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.890
But before I let you go, there's one more jQuery trick I want you to learn.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.510
In the very last part of the lesson, you'll find some written instructions about

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.160
one of the most interesting features of jQuery,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.370
which is passing a function into the jQuery object to run on document.ready.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.800
Are you feeling up for one last challenge?
