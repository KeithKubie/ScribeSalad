00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer to that is that this example is actually wrong.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It does get everybody across, and it gets them across in 19,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but there's another solution that's faster than that.

00:00:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So let's look at our program and see what we did wrong and why we missed the fastest solution.
