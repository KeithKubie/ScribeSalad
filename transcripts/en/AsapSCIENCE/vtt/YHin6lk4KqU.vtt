00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.880
The sun is around 4.5 billion years old, and
just like you and I, it's aging.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.889
In just over a billion years, the sun will
have expanded so much that the heat will begin

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.589
to melt the earth's surface.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.469
So, is there any way us Earthlings can avoid
this detrimental event?

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.010
Can we save ourselves from the suns ultimate
death?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.450
Sure, none of us will be here, assuming we
don't find the secret to everlasting life.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.609
But, at the billion year mark, the sun will
have used up the hydrogen fuel in its core,

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.670
forcing it to burn at its surface.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.040
The increased radiation will boil away all
of the water on Earth creating an international

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.040
desert.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.370
Flash forward about 5 billion years, and the
swelling sun will begin literally melting

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.020
mountains, with most, if not all life on earth
now extinct.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.790
Around 7.5 billion years, the expanding sun
- now a Red Giant - will engulf the Earth

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
entirely.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.250
Sounds bleak -- so can we avoid this hot mess?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.890
It turns out; our best bet lies in something
called "Gravity Assist".

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.330
A technique we've been using for years, only
to launch space crafts throughout our solar

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.330
system.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.080
Anytime a spacecraft or satellite comes in
close proximity to a planet, gravity grabs

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.080
hold.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.620
And if the spacecraft arrives at the perfect
angle, it's able to use some of the planets

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.650
velocity to catapult it further into space.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.640
This 'extra' energy comes from the planet's
own energy of motion around the sun.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.390
But, as Newton famously said "To every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction".

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.261
As the spacecraft uses the Earths gravity
to speed up and move towards Earth, the planet

00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.960
will ever so slightly slow down and move towards
the spacecraft.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.530
Of course, the spacecraft's mass is so small,
comparatively, that it gets launched incredibly

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.180
far, while the planet experiences little change.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.050
But, if we were to increase the spacecraft's
size -- or use an asteroid -- we could potentially

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.530
move the Earth's orbit away from the sun.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.640
This would take millions of years, and involve
large objects coming just close enough to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.530
not collide with Earth, but hey, we've got
a billion year head start!

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.040
It may seem far-fetched, but it's already
happening!

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.380
On October 9th, 2013, Earth will be used to
gravity assist a spacecraft called Juno, which

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.050
is on its way to Jupiter.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.250
As Juno flies within 559 kilometers of us,
it will use Earth's gravity as a slingshot

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.799
to boost its velocity by 7.3 km/s; Meanwhile,
Earth will have been moved by a fraction.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.579
Juno will later arrive at Jupiter, in 2016,
where it will study the interior of the planet

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.510
and help to unveil many new spectacular mysteries
of our Solar System.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.340
In order to move the Earth within our billion
year timeline, we would need approximately

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.499
1 encounter every 6,000 years, using an object
with a mass of approximately 10^19kg.

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.529
That's 19 zeros - somewhere around the size
of a 100 km-wide asteroid.

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:38.239
In between passes, the asteroid would slingshot
around the sun, fly out to Jupiter, and then

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.310
be gravity assisted back to Earth - like one
long version of catch between planets.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.669
Over millions of years, this would move Earth
to a comfortable 225 million kilometer orbit

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:49.669
out from the sun.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.170
And while it is feasible, even with today's
technology, it doesn't come without risks.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.959
For one, we may lose the moon, which could
ultimately create some extreme weather patterns.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.510
Not to mention, the Earth's spin may increase,
making days only hours long.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.269
The surrounding planets, like our new neighbor
Mars, would likely have their own orbits destabilized.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.499
And...you know...the asteroid could come plummeting
into Earth by accident.

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.400
But, perhaps these are the risks we need to
take to give our descendants, the planet and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.379
all life on it a few extra billion years.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.160
