00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello, and
welcome to "YouTube Developers

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.040
Live." Today, we have an
exciting show for you.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.540
We'll talk about gaming.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.900
Let me introduce our guests.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.690
Wayne Karo from Free
Range Games.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.270
How are you doing, Wayne?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.000
WAYNE KARO: Great.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What do
you do at Free Range?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.470
WAYNE KARO: I'm the director
of products.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.360
And I fill-in a lot of holes,
do business development,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.900
coding, whatever it takes.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
We're quite a small development
studio, and we're

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.770
making all kinds of games.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.920
And Kevin Wang from Kamcord.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.490
How are you doing, Kevin?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.960
KEVIN WANG: Good.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.090
How are you?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you for coming.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.770
This is your second appearance
on our live show.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.360
KEVIN WANG: That's
right, yeah.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I guess the
last time wasn't too bad,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.780
since you decided
to come back?

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.930
KEVIN WANG: It's worth
coming back for.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And tell us
one more time what do you do

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.560
at Kamcord?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.640
KEVIN WANG: I'm one of
the co-founders.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.690
And I basically work a
lot on the code and

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.770
the client-side SDK.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, great.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.350
So you are doing some coding.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.940
And hopefully we'll get
into that later

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.310
on in the show today.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.545
All right, great.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:02.260
So let's just talk a little
bit about Free

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.490
Range Games and gaming.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.250
And one thing that I wanted to
cover today is, what does

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.650
video have to do with
mobile games?

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.960
We see more and more companies
integrating video uploads into

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.360
their mobile games.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.460
I wanted our audience to
understand better why you guys

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.670
do that, and why you see
any value in it.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.600
So maybe, Wayne, starting with
you, tell us more about Free

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.140
Range Games.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.920
How did you guys get started?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.350
And a little bit of a history
of the company.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.020
And then we'll talk about your
product that we'll be

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.290
featuring today.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.840
WAYNE KARO: OK, Free
Range Games started

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.290
at the end of 2009.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.920
A group of guys from Activision
and a studio that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.990
was around for quite a
while, Shaba Games,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.460
formed Free Range Games.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.740
And it started with about 20
game designers, artists,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.260
software engineers.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.330
And started working
on games in Unity.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.680
Specifically, browser games for
Facebook, trying to bring

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.510
that console-quality experience
to a Facebook game.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.510
But then about a couple of years
into that, the market

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.840
kind of changed.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.430
And we decided to start making
mobile games, as well as

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.290
continuing with some browser
and PC-downloadable games.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.100
But everything in Unity.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.090
The Unity engine allows us to
make these games that are

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.490
cross-platform.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.790
And now, over half of our
efforts are in mobile games.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.790
We launched several last year.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.670
And we're going to launch
several more this year and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.322
continue with that.

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:43.970
A lot of our company's
background is

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.700
in 3D action games.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.700
Shaba Games was the studio that
worked on "Tony Hawk,"

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.870
for example.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.490
So a lot of those guys in our
company have that kind of

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.820
experience.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.300
And we think that video of
action sports is exciting, and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.680
video of action games
is also exciting.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.230
And it's a good way to show off
the 3D games that we make.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.100
So we thought, about a
year ago, that this

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.050
would be a nice concept.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.710
You and I were working
on a project earlier.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.020
And then along came some
start-ups, like Kamcord.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.790
And we started working
with them recently.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.900
And for those of you that might
have watched a session

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.960
from Google I/O 2012 about
video gaming, Wayne was

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.200
actually one of the
presenters.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.880
So this is what he alluded
to in his conversation.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.450
So you mentioned that you're
working with Kamcord.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.180
And how does Kamcord fit
into this project

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.810
that we'll talk about?

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.380
WAYNE KARO: Sure.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.520
Well, the basic idea is, how
do we get video off of a

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.160
mobile phone and up
onto YouTube?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.220
And tools or services, like
Kamcord's, allow us to do that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.370
really easy.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.070
They take care of all of the
video capture and sharing

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.720
capability.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.330
And we don't have to, as game
designers, worry about all of

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.000
the nuts and bolts that go with
that and the layout of

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.320
that interface.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.529
Like many other third-party
services, we could just plug

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.829
it right in, and it's
ready to go.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.080
So we wanted to get
that feature.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.240
To build that would be a
lot of extra effort.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.060
And it's nice that we can use
a free service like this.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.290
So without further ado, should
we try to maybe take a look to

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.100
see how that looks
in practice?

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.180
I know you brought your tablet
here with a game that you guys

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.440
have built and has
this capability.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.660
Maybe you will transition
to a little demo.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.210
WAYNE KARO: Sure.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.480
Our game is "APO Snow." This is
a snowboarding game that we

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.280
made for our partner, APO.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.560
They're an actual
snowboard/skiing brand.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.080
It will be a little bit
difficult for me to play and

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.900
talk at the same time.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.060
So we just basically want to get
down the mountain and be

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.250
able to show you guys kind of
what it will look like when we

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.220
upload a video.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.880
So APO, like I said, is an
actual ski/snowboarding brand.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.110
They sponsor a lot of pro
athletes that are

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.413
featured in the game.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.035
And the designs for the
snowboard and the skis in the

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:53.140
game are actual product that
this company sells.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.350
So you can get the look of an
actual pro athlete using the

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.055
APO goods in the game.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.515
And we try to make
the experience

00:06:09.515 --> 00:06:11.140
as casual as possible.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.000
You notice I'm just using
one finger to

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.040
carve down the mountain.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.520
And the tricks are really
easy to do.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:29.220
And when you get done with the
run, you can write a little

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.980
message and then share this
replay on YouTube.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.660
So while this is uploading,
Kevin, can you tell us a

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.050
little bit about what happened
under the hood, like what was

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.830
actually happening?

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.410
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.160
So basically, in terms of
Kamcord API and iteration,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.180
there were some calls that were
made basically to tell

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.130
the SDK to start and stop
the video capture.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.470
So at the beginning of the run
down the mountain, they said

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.120
to start recording.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.170
We started capturing all the
frames that were basically

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.570
displayed on the screen.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.730
At the end, after you tell it
to stop recording-- and

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.620
basically, there's a way to
show the UI, which you saw

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.290
earlier, which allowed him to
type a message, watch the

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.360
video replay, and share onto
Facebook, Twitter,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.740
YouTube, via email.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.740
And so basically, that was just
all behind the scenes

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.680
with a couple API [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.945
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Does the frame
capture happen in real

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.480
time while the game
is playing?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.000
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.660
It happens in real time.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.410
It saves the video
to the device.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.010
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What
type of overhead do

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.830
you think that incurs?

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.690
KEVIN WANG: Most of the time
it's pretty small, actually.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.080
Yeah, for most games that
we see, they're already

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.970
at their max FPS--

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.410
30 or 60 FPS.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.190
It tends to stay there.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.760
So it's a pretty
small overhead.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.700
WAYNE KARO: Yeah, I'd like
to just respond to that.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.280
That's one of the things we're
really pleased with.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.410
We tend to max out the processes
on our game, and

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.660
always are trying
to get the frame

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.720
rate as high as possible.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.700
Because that allows for a
better 3D experience.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.950
And so we were very nervous that
the frame rate would take

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.680
a significant hit.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.390
But throughout the entire
game, you can't

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.460
notice it as a player.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.060
And if you look on one of our
optimizer tools, it's only a

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.530
frame rate or two that
we're taking hits.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.640
So it's really good.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.000
I'm really pleased with it.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.520
And the video upload has
completed by now.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.640
So what happens next?

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.530
WAYNE KARO: OK, so you could go
to YouTube and the video is

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.400
actually there.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:43.940
And we can watch my unskillful
playing, one finger from the

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.960
side while I'm talking.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.230
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Actually, that
was a good demonstration

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.300
of what you said earlier about
the ease of your controls.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.520
Because one thing I like about
your games is it's always very

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.890
easy to actually navigate
whatever it is that you're

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.470
actually trying to achieve,
versus trying to move the

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.050
device around or something
like that.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.500
So I think I'm always
very pleased with

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.220
how the design works.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.860
I'm sure a lot of thought goes
into the touch controls and

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.130
how the traditional controller
capabilities are actually

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.880
translated into this new
world of mobile gaming.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.600
I think that's critical to
building a good game.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.780
WAYNE KARO: Yeah, we do give
it a lot of thought.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.410
And we tend to develop controls
unique for each game.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.950
It's one of the areas that
we have a passion for.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.830
So each one of our games
is different.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.465
In this particular one, we've
tried to go very casual with

00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:32.630
the controls.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.320
In other games, we have much
more involved, more hardcore

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.290
controls, just depending on the
nature of the game that

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.150
we're developing.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So let's talk
a little bit more about

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.360
the technical aspects
of this work.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.200
So starting with implementation
technology, so

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.770
you mentioned the game is
implemented in Unity?

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.230
WAYNE KARO: Yes.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.920
For people that are not familiar
with Unity, can you

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.375
tell us a little bit more about
what does Unity do?

00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:59.420
WAYNE KARO: Yeah, Unity
essentially allows you to make

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.540
3D games very easily.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:08.770
And it's a tool that is
actually used for even

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.200
different kinds of media beyond
3D games-- any time

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.920
you're doing a 3D simulation.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.050
But it's become very popular
in the gaming world.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.400
If you go to any of the
conferences, like Game

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.290
Developer Conference or
E3, you can see a

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.140
lot of examples now.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.340
Many of the mobile games on
Google Play and the Apple App

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.170
Store are made in Unity
these days.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.620
Cool.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.090
And then, the part that actually
performs the video

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.010
capture, video encoding, video
upload, is something that

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.280
Kevin, your company
implements, right?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:39.720
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And how
is that implemented?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.290
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.690
Basically, behind the scenes,
we hook it in the raw OpenGL

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.510
recording in the engine.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.260
So we kind of intercept a lot
of rendering, do some extra

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.630
work on the side to capture
the frames.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.370
Send it off to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.780
as video, as MP4.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.780
So that's all basically
happening

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.110
on a different thread.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.180
But basically the core stuff is
down at the OpenGL level.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.440
We had to do a lot of management
of the frames and

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.410
stuff like that.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And for
someone who is building a

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.255
mobile game, how do they
integrate the capabilities?

00:11:08.255 --> 00:11:10.170
Is there a library that
they link with?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.120
What's the actual process?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.550
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.650
Basic iOS is a very
simple framework.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.680
You go to our site, sign
up, and download.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.360
Entirely free.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.672
And basically, it's very
drag and drop.

00:11:18.672 --> 00:11:21.040
Basically, it's a framework
you link against.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.920
And the actual integration
process is

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.970
very simple, actually.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.800
From the time you download it to
the actual set up, in terms

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.610
of getting a test video
recorded, should take maybe 5,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.270
10 minutes.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.585
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:34.040
KEVIN WANG: Yeah, the API
is very straightforward.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.670
Just start recording
and stop recording.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.680
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then,
you use the YouTube API to

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.540
actually upload the video
to YouTube, right?

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.090
Are you using YouTube API
v2 or v3 for that?

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.710
KEVIN WANG: Right now
we're still on v2.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.340
But we're planning on upgrading
to v3 very soon.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.140
So one question that we
typically like to ask on this

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.610
show is, is there anything
surprising that you have

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.520
encountered while working
on this project?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.490
And is this your first game
that has the video upload

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.830
capability?

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.000
WAYNE KARO: Yeah, that's true.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Anything that
you have learned by going

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.800
through this process?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.060
I know you've always been trying
to push the envelope,

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.755
and you have a lot of great
ideas about video game play

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:10.040
and multiplayer and
things like that.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.940
So I'm curious to kind of poke
your brain, see what happened.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.320
WAYNE KARO: I think the
most surprising thing

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.440
was just the results.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.852
We injected the Kamcord feature
right in the middle of

00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:26.670
the game play.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.870
As you saw in the demo, you
finished the run, it comes up

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.450
right there.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.530
I expected that we would have
a lot more people actually

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.780
sharing video than they did.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:46.120
Recently, we ran a promotional
campaign and had about 180,000

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.820
new users come into the game.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.860
At the same time, we updated
the game and it included

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.580
Kamcord for the first
time at that point.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.130
We saw about 7% of those
users actually

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.520
upload a video to Kamcord.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.000
And then, in total across
YouTube, Twitter, Facebook,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.930
and email, it was about a
percent or so that actually

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.180
shared from that point.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.850
I guess the biggest surprise--

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.560
I had a higher expectation that
there would be a lot more

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.320
video sharing.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.550
Because one of the prime
motivators that we had to put

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.210
this in from a business
standpoint was the

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.870
discoverability of our game.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.710
Many of the people that uploaded
videos, if you go on

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.160
YouTube, you look at the
views, they only

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.000
have a couple views.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.050
That's fine, because people are
primarily uploading for

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.940
their friends to take a look at
and maybe family members.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.650
Not everybody is a PR machine.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:57.780
But I hoped that there were
upwards of 50,000 or more

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.100
video uploads for
the same time.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.280
Granted, maybe not everybody's
happy with the results of the

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.710
first time they're playing.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:10.100
They don't want to show their
scores off or the runs, like I

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.930
just showed, that
was pretty sad.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.950
So that could be part of it.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.260
I think one thing that we
can do is have a deeper

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.590
integration into the game.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.100
We, like I said, just put it
right into the game flow.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.930
And that was easy enough,
but we didn't think

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.220
deeper about it.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.150
Perhaps what we should do is
something like when the player

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:39.050
has a really awesome run, gets
a high score or a gold medal,

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.130
then pop it up at that point
and say, hey, you did an

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.140
awesome job.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.010
Why don't you share this?

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.550
To make it a little bit more
special and like a reward.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.930
And even though the numbers
might not increase at that

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.610
point, maybe we see a little
bit more sharing.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.290
So there's things like that
that we could do.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.260
That's actually very
good insight.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.000
Thank you.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.080
Thank you for sharing that.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.790
How about you, Kevin?

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.760
Anything on the technical front
that came up during the

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.550
integration?

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.800
KEVIN WANG: I think in terms
of the tech stuff, it was

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.550
pretty straightforward.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.350
I think in terms of the end
user behavior, we saw some

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.150
interesting things.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.290
We found that people tend to
share a lot-- so right now the

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.090
options are YouTube, Facebook,
Twitter, and email.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.330
Or they can share directly to
Kamcord without any of those.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.760
We do find that any of these
logins sort of have a drop-off

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.140
in the funnel.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.520
So we tend to see more people
will share to just Kamcord

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.280
directly without picking any
of those four choices.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.970
But people tend to like to share
actually a lot through

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.230
Facebook and email.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.830
That was actually the
two most popular.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.960
I think part of it is
just that people--

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.725
with email, they can just send
an email to a few people that

00:15:46.725 --> 00:15:48.230
they want to share it
with particularly.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.690
With Facebook, there's
a lot of people

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.500
on Facebook, obviously.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.940
And that's a part of people's
daily lives.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.010
I think in terms of YouTube, I
think people don't necessarily

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.200
recognize that they even have
an account at YouTube.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.970
I'm sure many people
use Gmail.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.780
But they're less aware
that those are one

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.910
and the same now.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.000
And the log in process is--

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.900
anytime you have a login box,
the funnel just narrows a lot

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.790
at that point.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.480
So I think just some simple
things, like for Facebook,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.400
even integration to iOS 6,
basically they don't have to

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.160
enter their information
at all.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.660
Whereas with YouTube there's
one extra login that causes

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.415
the funnel to drop
a little bit.

00:16:26.415 --> 00:16:27.110
That's where we found.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.210
And are you guys using the
WebView-based GTM 2 OAuth

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:31.920
controller for the OAuth flow?

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.010
KEVIN WANG: Yes, we are.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.190
That was actually very
easy to use.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.390
You basically just drop it in.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.495
It takes care of all
the login for you.

00:16:37.495 --> 00:16:37.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.900
For those of you that are
watching and didn't catch that

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.070
part, we do have an open source
project, Safari OS

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.100
applications, you can
just integrate.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.390
I'll just share a link
to that project.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.720
So to implement the video upload
capability on the OAuth

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.520
2 flow, it's actually quite
easy to do that.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.880
And this is what Kamcord is
using in order to log-in the

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.530
user and obtain the OAuth 2
permission so that the video

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.349
can be uploaded on
their behalf.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.099
Additionally, as Kevin
mentioned, if you have a

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.480
Google account, such as a Gmail
account, you're actually

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.690
very close to be able to upload
the videos to YouTube.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.790
There is an additional step
that must be performed for

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.440
people that don't have a
YouTube account yet.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.900
Namely, they need
a user channel.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.030
But that is also something
that we recently made

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.190
available to application
developers

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.339
through a WebView process.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.920
So for folks that have a Google
account and they don't

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.220
have a YouTube channel yet, we
have a create channel URL,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.165
which will basically take the
user through the channel

00:17:37.165 --> 00:17:39.910
creation flow, and then return
to a point which you can

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.770
recognize in your WebView.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.140
And then close the WebView and
proceed with the upload.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.250
So we're trying to
make it easy.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.710
But as you said, I think this
is always a hurdle whenever

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.620
people have to login
yet again.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.580
Because mobile is very
transactional and quick.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.200
So one thing that I found is
people have a little bit of

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.390
time, they play a little game
and they want to move on.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.420
They don't want to spend too
much time dealing with stuff.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.720
So we really need to make
it as smooth and

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.300
transparent as possible.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.790
Yeah, I mean, that's perhaps--

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.680
also the user experience may
be-- that should be something

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.130
done earlier in the process.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.900
So when they register or
whatever, they have an option

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.510
to actually go through that
OAuth flow when they

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.250
actually have time.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.750
Because once that is done and
you have the refresh token,

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.510
then you can actually use it.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.800
And they can upload
it, basically

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.410
frictionlessly, at any point.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:32.990
Great.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.230
Anything on the API side, any
feedback about things that you

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.310
think we should be implementing

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.500
that we're not yet?

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.850
Or any kind of general
API feedback?

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.700
KEVIN WANG: Overall, it's
been pretty easy to use.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.950
I think we're using all
the most of the basic

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.200
functionalities.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.010
I'm not sure if this is in the
pipeline or you guys are

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.860
working on this, but the ability
to kind of manage more

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.095
of the channel stuff
from an API side.

00:18:54.095 --> 00:18:55.070
That's my only thing.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.230
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:01.220
We don't have much of that
exposed, other than playlist

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.170
management capabilities.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.110
One thing we are doing that is
relevant to this use case in

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.610
API v3-- and again, this is why
I ask you if you're using

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.940
v3, because we do have
some extra features.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.890
So one thing that typically
comes up in these use cases is

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.760
when you upload a video, we
actually transcode it to all

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.360
the different formats.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.560
And then that process can take
a while, and it's not

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.700
synchronous with the
video upload.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.330
It happens asynchronously.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.180
So if the video's shredded a
little too early, chances are

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.530
somebody who is watching it on
the device that does not yet

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.865
support it by the transcode will
not be able to watch it.

00:19:36.865 --> 00:19:37.260
KEVIN WANG: I see.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.120
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So in API
v3, we actually have this

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.050
progress API.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:45.720
So you can actually check on the
processing status and see,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.810
have all the transcode
completed?

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.210
So in this use case, you
uploading the video will

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:54.590
actually transcode it
to H.264 web band

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.960
for different devices.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.960
And then theoretically, it
should really only be shared

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.320
once all the transcode
is completed.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.170
Because this will guarantee
that whoever picks up the

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:06.320
video from, say, social media,
will be able to watch it.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.630
So this is something we have
in the API v3, so I highly

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.330
encourage you to get it.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.000
But that's something we're
doing to make it easier.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.810
And as far as the channel
management--

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.090
yeah, this is good feedback.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.130
Because going back to what Wayne
said, I think helping

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.660
the users to feature that
content, then it's really

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.650
going to drive the objectives
that you guys have for this

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.380
type of integration.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.250
And I've seen this before.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.600
For me, it's kind of like if a
tree falls in the forest, no

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.240
one notices.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.360
So if the views are very low
for this content, then it's

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.020
really sub-optimal.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.160
And what we've seen looking
at some of the larger

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.600
integrations we've done with
the console makers is,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.310
realistically, this is a very
Long Tail distribution.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.830
So there's a few number of
videos that have a large

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.080
number of views, and everything
else has reasonably

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.200
small number of views.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.150
But we do need to get to the
point where for mobile sharing

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:05.470
you will have that Long Tail
with a few ones being actually

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.610
used to promote the game or
some accomplishments and

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.340
things like that.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:09.500
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.310
Actually, to that point about
making the video easier to

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.940
find-- and Wayne mentioned
this before--

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.680
thinking about deeper
integration where when

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.650
basically really cool things
happen, you want to expose the

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:20.450
API and let them share.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.680
I think that's a good idea.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.400
Some other very simple things
that people who use the API

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.170
can do, just to set all the tags
for the metadata rights.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.875
And that makes it much
more easier to serve.

00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:30.950
Stuff like that.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.210
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.590
Cool.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.270
All right, anything else you
would like to share with us?

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.250
Or are you going to go
back and design yet

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.120
another awesome game?

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.880
WAYNE KARO: Yeah.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.060
Kevin and I were just talking
about that the other day.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.300
What's the next step?

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:52.350
We are going to continue working
on "APO Snow." We've

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.470
got some good things in
development there.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.830
So we hope to continue to expand
the game and perhaps

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.880
even do a sequel.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.440
And then we have a lot
of other games that

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.370
we're working on.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.040
We have a shooter.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.770
It's pretty fun.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.270
It's got a lot of traction
on the web.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.030
We're bringing it to mobile.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.770
Right now it's on Android.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.290
It requires wireless controllers
to play it.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.970
We don't have the touch
controls yet.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.390
But hopefully in a few
months we're further

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.150
down the road there.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.180
And we're talking about, what
are the possibilities for this

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.800
Kamcord video recording
technology?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.310
Because in that particular
game, a session could be

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.650
upwards to 20 minutes long.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.180
How do you record
and all of that?

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.960
But fortunately, in a shooter,
kill streaks is a

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.240
great way to show off.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.660
So if we just cut around every
time you get a kill for the

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.220
kill streak, then naturally
videos get longer and longer

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.330
with more kill streaks.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:59.010
For those videos that are
uploaded, players can easily

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:04.350
search on, like 30 kill streaks,
50 kill streaks.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.560
And they'll be obviously
fewer of those videos.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.090
But they probably will look
cooler and cooler because the

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.500
better, more skillful players
are playing those.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.080
So it could be some exciting
watching without all the rest

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.980
of the stuff that's happened
in the game.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yep.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.780
I think that you bring
a very good point.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.050
I mean, we are still very
early in this process.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.200
I think PC games and console
games have done quite

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.060
a bit in this area.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.840
And some of them have a theater
mode with editor

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.160
capability, slow-motion
capability, and so forth.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.120
Like, for example, "Call
of Duty" does this.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.270
But we're just getting
started on mobile.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.240
And I definitely agree that if
the game can signal, to a

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.650
technology like yours, some of
the additional information to

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.670
decide which content is actually
interesting to

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.810
showcase, it'll be great.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.650
And it's a general use
case in video.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.410
You have a lot of content, how
do you make it interesting?

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.480
What actually cut?

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.480
I think whoever solves
that problem will

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.790
be a very rich person.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.960
All right, let's transition
to questions.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.240
We have a few questions
from the audience.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.870
So there's one question
for you, Kevin.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.380
If you're not using Unity, can
you still use Kamcord?

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:11.680
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.700
We support any game
built for iOS.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.090
So all you need--

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.790
we have a plug-in you can
download and install.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.910
Otherwise, it's a simple frame
where you can drag in.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.650
And we also have the docs online
for how to do that.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:24.980
Great.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.340
And then related question, are
there any other titles that

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.100
have integrated Kamcord?

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:30.650
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.860
There are a few.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.270
One is called "Slingshot Racer."
I think it was one of

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:40.460
the Unity award winners
last year.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.200
A few others.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.600
We're integrating right now with
"Scramble with Friends."

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.820
Basically doing a test
integration with them that

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.170
should be out in the
coming few months.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.200
So those are some games
that come to mind.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:59.410
And then, another question
about the discovery

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.400
optimization.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.210
So the question is, what are
the tips on metadata that

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.210
would help with discovery
and maximizing views?

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.260
Any knowledge you could
share in the SEO area?

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:11.770
KEVIN WANG: Yeah.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:16.040
I think for that two major
things come to mind.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.270
And the first is basically we
allow the user to enter a

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.030
title for the video.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.190
And if they do, that
would be the title.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.380
But oftentimes, users
are kind of lazy.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.900
They just want to press Share.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.070
And if that's a case,
we allow you to

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.740
basically set the title.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.570
And so basically, after every
round or level or however your

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.340
game is structured, we
definitely recommend you

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.530
change that tile to match what
happened in the video.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.010
So that makes every video
title different.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.410
So when people are searching
online, they can see what they

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.110
want to find.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.310
Maybe you got three stars or
a certain time for a level,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.180
something like that.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this is
something that the game

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.370
developer can set up
in Kamcord as a

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.200
part of video upload?

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.130
You basically give a callback
capability or configuration

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.240
capability, right?

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.480
So the point is, just make sure
that whatever happened in

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.470
the game is actually reflected
in the title before you invoke

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.580
the upload operation.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:01.845
KEVIN WANG: Exactly.

00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:02.415
Yeah.

00:26:02.415 --> 00:26:05.420
But basically, right after you
call a stop recording and the

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.930
video clip has ended, you can
set all this information about

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.840
the video, with the title
and stuff like that.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.610
So I think the title is one
of the very big things.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.690
And somebody else suggested
all the tags for YouTube.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.500
We definitely recommend that
you change all the tags.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.150
You add your gaming and
stuff like that.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.610
And you add whatever information
about that video

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:20.320
that was just recorded.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.960
That makes a little
bit of difference.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.560
KEVIN WANG: Makes a
big difference.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:23.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.200
So one more question.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.130
I think this one is
addressed at me.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.220
Is YouTube Developer
Operations hiring?

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.350
And yes, we are hiring.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:36.170

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.430
OK, so I think this is all
the time we have today.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.050
