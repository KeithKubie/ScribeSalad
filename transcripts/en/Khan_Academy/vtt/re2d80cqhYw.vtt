00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.993
- [Instructor] Many parts of

00:00:00.993 --> 00:00:02.930
the United States Constitution deal

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.550
with rights of an individual,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.010
and many amendments talk about protecting

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.620
or expanding the rights of an individual,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.850
but the 14th Amendment is perhaps one

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.900
of the most important
amendments in this discussion

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.920
of protecting civil rights.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.090
And, in particular, Section 1 is the part

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.900
that is most cited.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.507
So, let's just read this together.

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:26.637
"All persons born or naturalized
in the United States,

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:29.087
"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:30.997
"are citizens of the United States

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.037
"and of the state wherein they reside.

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:37.727
"No state shall make or enforce any law

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:39.577
"which shall abridge the privileges

00:00:39.577 --> 00:00:42.637
"or immunities of citizens
of the United States,

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:46.507
"nor shall any state
deprive any person of life,

00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:50.787
"liberty, or property,
without due process of law,

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:54.547
"nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction

00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:57.870
"the equal protection of the laws."

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.470
So, let's just focus in on parts of it.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.930
So, one big takeaway
about the 14th Amendment,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.507
this is the federal government saying,

00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:08.430
"Hey, these are things
that the state cannot do."

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.257
So, for example, when it says,

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:14.387
"Nor shall any state
deprive any person of life,

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:18.440
"liberty, or property,
without due process of law,"

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.570
this is a restatement
of the 5th Amendment,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.167
that, "Hey, you know,
people can't just stick you

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:25.107
"in jail or take away your
property without you going

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:28.590
"through some type of a
process, a legal process."

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.790
Well, in the 5th Amendment,
this was really talking about

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.340
the federal government not being able

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.020
to just take your property
or your liberty away

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.930
from you without the process of law,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.070
but here, it's saying,
"Nor shall any state."

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.540
And this clause right over here,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.440
this is known as the due process clause

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.220
of the 14th Amendment.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.327
Then, right after that, it says,

00:01:47.327 --> 00:01:51.397
"Nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:54.047
"the equal protection of the laws.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.680
"The equal protection of the laws,"

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.990
I'm gonna underline that.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.760
And this, you might guess is called

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.450
the equal protection clause.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.070
Now, the context in which the
14th Amendment was ratified,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.950
it happens in 1868,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.620
shortly after the end of the Civil War.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.400
You, of course, have
the 13th Amendment that,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.040
among other things, abolishes slavery,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.280
but then, you have these things

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.230
in the south called black codes,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.690
which continue to repress the
rights of African-Americans,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.270
and that's why Congress felt the need

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.840
for the 14th Amendment to be passed.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.680
Now, one of the most notable cases

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.913
in which the 14th Amendment
was brought up happens in 1896,

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:36.360
Plessy v. Ferguson,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.970
and we have a whole video about this.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.090
And this is a case in which it was argued

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.300
that is was unconstitutional
under the 14th Amendment

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.020
for African-Americans to have to travel

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.150
in a separate train car
from white Americans,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.737
and the Supreme Court
infamously said that,

00:02:52.737 --> 00:02:54.827
"Hey, as long as it is equal,

00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:56.717
"it is okay for it to be separate

00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:59.850
"and that it would not
violate the 14th Amendment,"

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.143
and so, this idea of separate
but equal comes about.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.490
Now, that was significantly challenged

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.890
as we go into 1954,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.630
where you have Brown v. Board of Education

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.520
of Topeka, Kansas.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.833
Board of Education.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.000
And here, the argument
was that, inherently,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.140
separate could not be equal,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.600
and once again, the 14th
Amendment was invoked.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.580
And this time, the Supreme
Court unanimously ruled that,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.050
yes, separate can't be equal,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.450
and that the schools
needed to be desegregated.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.970
So, even though it wasn't
an official overruling

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.710
of Plessy v. Ferguson, it
was a functional overruling

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.800
of this doctrine of separate but equal.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.810
And, as we go into the
1960s civil rights movement,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.810
led by folks like Martin Luther King,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.500
it was the 14th Amendment
that was cited often.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.620
In another video, we're going to look

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.960
at Martin Luther King's
letter from a Birmingham jail,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.140
in which he articulates the ideas

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.880
of the civil rights movement,
it's a quite moving letter.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.410
But, once again, it's evoking these ideas

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.730
of the 14th Amendment,
and it goes onto movements

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.090
as disparate as the
women's rights movement,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.430
led by organizations like

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.270
the National Organization for Women,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.300
citing equal protection of the laws

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.660
in situations of sexual
discrimination in the workplace.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.710
You have pro-life groups
citing the 14th Amendment,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.890
arguing that an unborn
fetus' right to life

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.710
is protected by the 14th Amendment.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.850
You have rulings around whether quotas

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.860
in higher education are legal or not,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.680
once again, citing ideas of
equal protection of the laws.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.560
So, as you go forth in your study

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.420
of United States government,
the 14th Amendment,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.623
especially Section 1, is
going to keep showing up.
