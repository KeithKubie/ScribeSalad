00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.976
In 2013,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.280
I had a life-changing epiphany.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.176
I was a painter and decorator

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.800
in Castlemaine, a small
country town in central Victoria.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.536
I'd gone to see Pete, who was renowned
for his workmanship with steel.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.760
I'd gone to his shed to get
some steel edging for the garden.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.856
This day, with hindsight,
which is a wonderful gift,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.680
Pete seemed happier than usual.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.176
Two weeks later,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.216
I was painting a house
down the end of Pete's street

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.080
when I heard the tragic news.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.640
Pete had suicided.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.296
Pete, like myself,
was a tradie, or a tradesman.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.056
We do like to shorten things
in the Australian vernacular.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.576
A tradie.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.936
There was an expectation as a tradie.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.096
You're expected to be stoic.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.056
You're expected to be strong,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.016
robust, macho.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.040
You're expected to be tough physically

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.760
and silent in the face of adversity.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.256
There is a pronounced ripple effect

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.680
when someone suicides in your community.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.600
Pete's funeral was in July. It was winter.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.656
The mood was bleak and somber

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.816
in the packed community hall.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.376
It was a grieving community

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.680
who had no answers

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.920
to Pete's suicide,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.536
no answers at all.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.536
As I wandered around between the tradies
and the community members,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.320
I started hearing some tones
of another underlying tragic level.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.976
I heard people talking
in that community hall

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.760
about the struggles
other people were going through.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.296
The essence of the conversations
was contained in two words

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.920
that I heard several times:

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.600
Who's next?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.760
Who's next?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.336
That was the epiphany.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.256
That was the moment
where I was standing in a community hall

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.056
in a place where
this Castlemaine community

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.216
had given me such support for 20 years,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.176
this community had backed my work,
I'd played footy there,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.576
I'd done theater there,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.176
I was so grateful
for what they'd given me.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.936
But I was standing there in that space,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.456
and I was looking around
that hall as well,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.176
and I could tell people in that hall

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.176
who were struggling with alcohol,
drugs, finance, gambling,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.776
domestic abuse, bullying and harassment.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.256
Yet because of my tradie culture

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.616
and that ignorant attitude
that we have in the tradie community,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.920
I didn't feel confident at all.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.736
I didn't have the tools.
I lacked the experience.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.720
I didn't know what to do,
but I wanted to do something.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.816
I left the wake.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.096
I hugged a few tradie mates and said,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.056
"Please come and see me if you need to."

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.856
But I didn't know what to say
to them or what to tell them.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.096
I had no idea.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.696
I got a phone call two weeks later
from Catherine Pilgrim, my cofounder,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.896
wanting to do something for the family.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.536
We talked for a while and I said,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.896
let's do something
for the tradie community.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.096
We love our town, we're grateful,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.216
let's do something
for the tradie community.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.496
So we talked a bit more.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.776
What could we do?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.280
An awareness-raising event. Awesome.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.736
We're talking about tradies.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.656
How do you get tradies somewhere?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.696
Can you get them to a hospital? No.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.616
To a community health center? No.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.480
There's an ingrained culture
of being a tradie.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.296
I thought, where is the perfect place
we can get the tradies together

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.216
where they feel socially included

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.736
and they feel comfortable

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.216
and they can share, they can open up
and talk about mental health

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.576
in the building industry?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.480
Where can we have an event?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.136
A hardware store.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.376
(Laughter)

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.336
Yeah, that's what I thought too.
I thought it was very clever.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.336
More precisely, the timber yard
of a hardware store.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.216
So there we were. OK, we've got the venue.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.656
What else do we need?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.800
What else do tradies love?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.096
Food.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.096
I know, we all do, but tradies love food.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.576
Tradies especially,
and I'm a tradie myself,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.120
we love egg and bacon rolls.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.456
So we thought we'd supply
the tradies with egg and bacon rolls,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.696
and there was the slogan:

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.960
save your bacon.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.616
It's a bit corny, but it sort of works.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.560
And we also came up with a logo.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.376
"Hope Assistance Local Tradies."

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.480
Keep in mind, "HALT," our charity,
had no money to begin,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.696
nothing, not a single cent.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.096
We had conversations.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.536
This is a community issue.
It starts in community.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.416
So we went around to the butcher,
we went around to the baker,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.336
there was no candlestick maker,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.816
there was an egg place
and there was some chocolate,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.496
there was coffee, there was fruit,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.896
but we went around and said,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.111
"Hey, we're doing
this awareness-raising event.

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.176
Do you want to contribute?
Because we haven't got any money."

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.896
Of course, nearly every person
we initiated the conversation with

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.216
knew someone that had anxiety,
depression or thoughts of suicide

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.736
or had suicided.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.056
There was that unity,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.736
that whole of community approach.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.176
So we thought, that's great,
we've got some food.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.536
What else do we need?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.936
We need the support services there.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.616
A lot of tradies,
and a lot of men in general,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.560
don't necessarily know
where to go and get help.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.136
I myself was one of them,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.536
and this is what I talk about
at the HALT events,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.896
that four years ago when I founded HALT,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.096
I didn't know I could go to the doctor
about my mental health

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.616
and get a mental health plan.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.616
I didn't know about community health.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.656
I certainly didn't know about Lifeline,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.336
and I've called Lifeline three times,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.080
and they've certainly
potentially saved my life.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.696
I had to learn all these things.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.320
Tradies need to know them.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.456
We provided bags,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.936
bags of information,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.256
and I had quite a few tradies
say to me in the first year,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.336
"Aw, this is a load of you-know-what,"

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.216
but those tradies I know
still have those bags in their Ute

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.656
or in their shed.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.736
On November 10, 2013,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.296
we had our event,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.696
and interestingly enough, when I talk
about a whole of community approach,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.776
that was our first event
in Castlemaine at Tonks Brothers,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.016
and there's a whole of community there.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.296
There's counselors,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.736
there's people who have
gone through mental health.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.480
That first event set the scene.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.936
Since then, we've had more events.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.296
Interestingly enough,
it's not only tradies

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.976
that are affected by mental health
or anxiety or depression or suicide.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.296
We started working with TAFEs.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.896
We started working
in the farming industry,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.576
at councils, at secondary colleges.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.696
We did events for the partners of tradies,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.656
because often the tradies
would not go home to their partners

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.416
and say, "Guess what,
we talked about mental health,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.696
and we're going to do
this, this and this now."

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.616
So we're doing events for the partners,

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.096
who themselves may need help.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.096
TAFEs are very popular.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.416
For me, it's really crucial to get
to these young, vulnerable men and women.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.256
We've done events for men's sheds,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.016
so the high rate of suicide
is really high for older men.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.320
We've done events for council
depot workers and tradies.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.656
Interestingly enough,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.296
nearly every single event --

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.536
and we've actually done now,
with very little funding,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.800
150 events over four states.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.496
So -- oh please, thank you.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.456
(Applause)

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.256
And invariably at every single
HALT event at a hardware store,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.056
I have one tradie come up to me,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.600
at least one come up and tell me
about his suicide attempt.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.416
They're not suicidal there and then,
they've worked through it,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.416
but these men have never felt
they could share their vulnerabilities.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.656
They've never felt they can
talk about their suicide attempt,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.936
but the HALT events,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.656
where there's no expectations
for them to talk,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.736
makes them feel comfortable
to start talking.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.696
And it's not just they talk
to me and tell me their story,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.256
they actually now say,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.720
"We feel comfortable enough
to talk with other men."

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.936
I've had men stand up and say,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.296
"I've never mentioned before
that I've had depression, but I have,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.736
and if anyone else here
wants to come and speak to me,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.176
I'm here to talk to you."

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.240
It's very empowering
and cathartic to do that.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.456
We need a whole-of-community approach.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.696
We give the tradies bags of information
from local and national support services.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.976
It's one of thing to tell a tradie
or someone at one of these events,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.736
"You should go here, here and here,"

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.416
but we need the whole of community

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.216
to wrap around the idea
of suicide prevention.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.976
We need those services,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.616
and suicide doesn't discriminate at all.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.296
It's not a 9-to-5 thing.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.936
We need to do events before 9am,
which most of our brekkies are,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.056
and after 5 PM.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.216
That's what we need to do.
It's a whole-of-community approach.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.056
We need to get into businesses.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.816
We need to get into
sporting clubs, community clubs.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.376
We need to get in there and train people

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.120
to understand about mental health.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.976
Here's some sobering statistics
just to give you an idea.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.936
In 2016,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.256
in Australia, 2,866 suicides,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.496
very close to twice the road toll.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.456
Globally, 800,000 a year

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.176
suicides in the world,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.920
one every 40 seconds.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.936
We need a whole-of-community approach.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.080
We need to feel comfortable
in opening up the conversations.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.616
Men I know find it really difficult
to open up conversations.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.936
They certainly do.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.856
If you're going to open up
conversations, I tell the guys,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.976
you need to find a comfortable place
to open up and have a conversation,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.416
whether it's at the pub,
it's going for a walk,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.656
it's after footy.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.280
Find that really comfortable place
to have the conversation.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.456
Part of the ability
to have that conversation

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.776
is to understand what to say.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.896
We've all heard about, "Are you OK?"

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.776
And I've seen it. I've done this.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.216
"Are you OK?" "Yes." "Are you OK?" "Yes."

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.720
"Are you OK?" "Yes." "Are you OK?" "No."

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.880
What do I say now?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.056
What do I say?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.696
We need to equip every single person

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.776
with the ability to come forth

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.640
and be able to have that conversation.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.056
We need to be able to listen.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.336
I don't know who
out there is a good listener.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.376
I'm working on my listening abilities,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.216
but it's an art form
to listen and not judge.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.736
Don't make fun. If someone's coming
to talk to you about mental illness

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.416
and anxiety and depression
and thoughts of suicide,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.416
we need to respect that.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.656
They want to trust us
that we're going to hold that in tight

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.176
and not tell everyone.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.640
We need to do that.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.096
So we need to have conversations.
We need to listen.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.320
And we need to start reducing the stigma
associated with mental health.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.016
Companies are now starting
to have mental health days.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.296
What a great idea.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.040
It's not just physical sick days,
it's mental health days.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.520
Things are changing.
We can add to that change.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.456
I'm a life preserver.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.840
I think we can all be life preservers.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.280
The pain of regret

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.560
is far greater than the pain of hard work.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.416
Thank you.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.640
(Applause)
