00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.277
This time we have a difference of 2 cubes, and the thing that's playing the role

00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:10.087
of the y cube down here is 125z cubed. This means, that anywhere I have y

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:14.984
written up here in the general form, I need to write the cube root of 125z

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:19.715
cubed, the cube root of 125 is 5 and the cube root of z cubed is just z so y

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:24.943
will be replaced by 5z. Now, instead of z cubed, which was subtracted initially,

00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:29.643
we have 1, which means that instead of z, I'll put a 1. So again, like I said in

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:34.869
the question video, the z cubed up here, in this expression we're interested in,

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:40.010
is not at all related to the z cubed in the general expression. These are just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.933
placeholder names. Okay, let's plug this stuff in. The thing in the form of y

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:51.573
minus z down here is 5z minus 1 and our trinomial is going to be 25z squared

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:55.294
plus 5z plus 1. Awesome. That was really great.
