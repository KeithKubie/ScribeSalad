00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.770
Did you know there's a way to start a fire
by squishing air? In this project we're building

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.710
a tool that does exactly that. And with a
little it of resourcefulness we can make this

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.130
for under a buck.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.880
The materials for this project cost me less
than $1.00. I got these pieces of scrap acrylic

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.589
for free, and besides those, all I'm gonna
need are a couple of rubber O-rings, a 1-1/2"

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.649
bolt, and this handle I got off a lawn mower.
This piece of clear acrylic rod fits perfectly

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.230
into this tube so I'm ready to form the piston.
I'll use a 10" piece of rod and secure it

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.280
into the chuck of my drill press. A hacksaw
is my tool of choice for cutting a groove

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.890
in the plastic rod, and with a bit of guesswork,
I've made it just big enough to fit this O-ring

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.750
securely, leaving the rubber edges slightly
wider than the rod. Next, I'll place the rod

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.320
in a bench vise, protected with a terry cloth,
and when it's secure, use a 3/16th drill bit

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.350
to cut a hole right through the side. It's
a clean cut and the spacing is about 1/4"

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.440
from the O-ring, so I'll proceed to my chop
saw, and make a cut just barely touching the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.780
top of the hole. This has just created a claw
that will hold my tinder. It's time to cut

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.020
these pieces to length, so I'll mark them
at 6", and cut them together. While I'm here,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.210
I may as well cut an inch off of the tubing,
and a small square piece that I'll use in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.310
a minute. Ok, I've got all my pieces cut to
length, so now I'll remove the protective

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.840
paper from this little square, and carefully
cement it to one end of the tubing. This will

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.110
need to be an air tight seal, and I'm hoping
this weight on top will help. With that setting,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.350
I can get back to making the piston. This
time I'm using my drill press and a 1/4" bit

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.170
to drill a hole down the inside of the rod.
My goal is to get the hole as centered as

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.770
I can, and when it's roughly 1-1/4" deep,
it can be transferred back to my bench vise

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.780
for tapping. This is a 5/16th course thread
tap, and I'm using it because it matches the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.060
threads on this bolt. To make this handle,
I carefully used my vise and a 1/2" drill

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.640
bit to hollow out the center, which made a
large cavity that I'll be using later. I threaded

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.450
this hex bolt all the way in, and then secured
it tightly using a pair of pliers. You can

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.129
see the handle and the rod thread perfectly
together, and will just need to be tightened

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.670
by hand. A little acrylic cement is applied
to the rod near the handle, then the 1" piece

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.120
of tubing is added, and cemented in place
by dripping glue into the gaps. This piece

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.989
is to help reinforce the area where the handle
meets the rod. That's setting, and it looks

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.170
like the tubing is cured enough to knock down
the base on my belt sander. Just a minute

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.519
of sanding, and the base is rounded and looking
much better. To help it cure air tight, I'll

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.459
clamp it together and leave it overnight.
To finish off the piston, all I need to do

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.999
is slide the other O-ring into place. And
this will help cushion the acrylic pieces

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.299
from impact with each other, as well as create
a slight gap between the tinder claw and chamber

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.790
base. A little bit of lubrication is added
to the O-ring, and this $1.00 fire piston

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.450
is looking awesome. I even found a little
cap that fits perfectly into the handle. I

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.290
had enough material to make another piston,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.920
I'm gonna test the small one first

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.010
using some char cloth I made in a previous
video. I don't need very much and this little

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.719
piece should work fine. When that's rolled
up, and placed into the grips of the tinder

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.469
claw, I'll gently insert the rod into the
chamber until the O-ring presses inside. Then

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:21.730
with one swift downward stroke, I've got ignition
and my tinder is burning! I'll try that again.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.010
And this attempt was just as successful! By
compressing the air quickly enough, the temperature

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.129
shoots up hundreds of degrees Celsius in a
fraction of a second. Enough to ignite char

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.609
cloth and other types of tinder into burning
embers. The cavity in the piston handle is

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.969
perfect for storing some char cloth, and the
cap will hold it in place. To see if this

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.779
will work out in the woods, I've readied a
tinder bundle made from dry grass, and when

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:47.590
my fuel is loaded I'll give the piston a whack.
There it is. I've instantly got a glowing

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.829
ember, and using a piece of grass to transfer
it into the nest works pretty well. The heat

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.310
is building, and this little bundle almost
explosively bursts into flames. That happened

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.609
pretty fast and before I burn myself I'd better
get this over to the fire pit. This bundle

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.659
is a little damp, so I'm adding a piece of
char cloth inside the nest to help it develop

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:11.489
a flame. And there it is. And it's taking
off fast! Yikes! I've been getting ignition

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.680
on nearly every stroke, and this is proving
to be an easy and fairly reliable way to start

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.090
a fire without matches. Some people say this
little tool was commonly used in the 1800's

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.430
and was the inspiration behind the diesel
engine. With this tube being completely see

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.810
through, it's exciting to witness the actual
ignition point of my fuels, and for under

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.500
$1.00 it was definitely a project worth the
investment. That's another item for my emergency

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.710
kit, and a great way to see science in action.
