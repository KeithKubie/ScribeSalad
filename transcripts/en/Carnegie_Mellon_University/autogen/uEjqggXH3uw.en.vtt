well what was the vision of information

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460
well what was the vision of information
 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.690
well what was the vision of information
networking in 1989 is actually a reality

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700
networking in 1989 is actually a reality
 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.900
networking in 1989 is actually a reality
in today's world back in 93 we wanted to

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910
in today's world back in 93 we wanted to
 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.029
in today's world back in 93 we wanted to
create a testbed that could be used by

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039
create a testbed that could be used by
 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.430
create a testbed that could be used by
our wireless researchers we also hoped

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440
our wireless researchers we also hoped
 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.950
our wireless researchers we also hoped
we could build a wireless network

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960
we could build a wireless network
 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.390
we could build a wireless network
eventually for the entire Carnegie

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400
eventually for the entire Carnegie
 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.430
eventually for the entire Carnegie
Mellon campus one that would provide

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440
Mellon campus one that would provide
 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.070
Mellon campus one that would provide
high-speed Internet service to users of

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080
high-speed Internet service to users of
 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.460
high-speed Internet service to users of
mobile computers in 1993 I wrote a grant

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470
mobile computers in 1993 I wrote a grant
 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.019

Foundation to create the wireless test

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399
Foundation to create the wireless test
 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.200
Foundation to create the wireless test
bed it was funded by NSF in early 94 and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210
bed it was funded by NSF in early 94 and
 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.869
bed it was funded by NSF in early 94 and
then we were off and running it was

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879
then we were off and running it was
 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.450
then we were off and running it was
officially supposed to be used only by

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460
officially supposed to be used only by
 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.559
officially supposed to be used only by
the wireless researchers but we had lots

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:47.569
the wireless researchers but we had lots
 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.799
the wireless researchers but we had lots
of inquiries from other people asking

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809
of inquiries from other people asking
 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.779
of inquiries from other people asking
essentially how do I get on the wireless

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789
essentially how do I get on the wireless
 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.270
essentially how do I get on the wireless
network and this was my first hint that

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
network and this was my first hint that
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.910
network and this was my first hint that
there really was a demand for this

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920
there really was a demand for this
 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.669
there really was a demand for this
anytime anywhere high-speed Internet

the campus so we stepped up our

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520
the campus so we stepped up our
 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.510
the campus so we stepped up our
activities and within a few years we had

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520
activities and within a few years we had
 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.880
activities and within a few years we had
just that the campus-wide high-speed

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890
just that the campus-wide high-speed
 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.130
just that the campus-wide high-speed
wireless network to be used by any

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140

wireless Andrew was a forerunner to what

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700
wireless Andrew was a forerunner to what
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.990

we now call Wi-Fi
