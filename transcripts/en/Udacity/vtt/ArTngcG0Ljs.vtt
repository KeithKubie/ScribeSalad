00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There have been a lot of questions about this problem from homework 2

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
about whether this loop would ever terminate.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In particular, the third one where knowing whether or not the loop would terminate

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
depended on the Collatz conjecture, which is an open mathematical problem.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This was definitely a hard question to try to make sense out of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
based on what we've seen just in the class, but my hope was that that question

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
would get you thinking about several important things in computer science,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I think it did from the discussion.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It may have got you thinking about them in a more frustrating way than I would've hoped,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I'm sorry for people who found this very frustrating.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But there is some important lessons to draw from that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The first one is that you can never make a conclusion about 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
how a program will behave in all cases just based on experiments.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Any interesting program has an infinite number of inputs

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 like that loop where there are infinitely many different numbers,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and you can't try it it for all the integers because there are infinitely many of them.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You can do experiments running it for a bunch of them and see that it always seems to stop.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The loop always finishes for all the ones you try, 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but that's not enough to know that it always finishes for all input.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That's a very different claim than what you can show by any experiment.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The other point that I hope that question made, and I hope without too much frustration,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but I understand especially if you didn't find the hint that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 this was a very hard thing to figure out what to do with,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
was that reasoning about code and especially reasoning about properties

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that depend on following paths through a code is very difficult.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's not just difficult. It's been proven that it's impossible in general.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There is no way in general to take some code 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and answer this question of whether that code always finishes.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
For some code there is a way to answer that question,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and that was the case for the other two parts of that question.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
For the third one, even though it looked like fairly simple code 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and didn't use anything that we haven't seen in class so far 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that you couldn't understand from the class.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Even for that simple code, determining whether or not that code would terminate on some input

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is equivalent to solving some known open mathematical problem

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that no one knows the answer to.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There are other cases where we can actually prove that it's impossible

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to determine in general whether some code has some property or not.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Those are things we're not going to get into too deeply in this class.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There are things that am glad that you're starting to think about,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and we will continue t o encounter them.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I hope you'll be asking these questions and be disturbed enough by these questions

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that you'll want to take a theory class later that will really get into the reason behind this

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and understand the theory of what kinds of things computers can solve

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and the things that they can't solve.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That was the intent of that question, and I'm sorry people found it frustrating,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but I hope you also learned a lot from that and started to think about problems the way

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
computer scientists think about problems by doing that.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I think we do have some people on our hangout now.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Hello. &gt;&gt;Hi.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So our connection with the Hangout has been a little flaky, so hopefully we won't lose it again.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Welcome. &gt;&gt;Hi. &gt;&gt;Do you have a question? 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
First, if you would like to introduce yourself and tell us where you're from?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
My name is Michelle. I'm from upstate New York.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Hi Michelle. It must be pretty late there. &gt;&gt;It is. It's about my bedtime.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But I'm just actually starting today with the course,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
because I flaked out a little bit.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Okay. Well, welcome. It's not too late to get started.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Than you. So I don't really have any questions.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I just kind of wanted to see what was going on and try the Hangout.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Okay. Well, we're trying the Hangout too. &gt;&gt;Yeah, this is an experiment.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It's an experiment, and hopefully things will work. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It seems to crash every time there's more than about 3 or 4 people that join,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
so we'll see if it works better this time.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And where are you located? 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We're in Palo Alto, California. &gt;&gt;Oh, okay. &gt;&gt;More people?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We have two more people here now.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Well, while we're waiting, I guess we can go to another question from the forums.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay. Oh, we lost Luke.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
All right. So back to the forums. We talked about the Collatz conjecture.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Everyone had fun with that. Let's see.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
A lot of these are suggestions. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Okay. Well, we could discuss some of the suggestions.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Homework is hard. &gt;&gt;More discussion about the Collatz conjecture.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I think there's almost an infinite amount of discussion on the Collatz conjecture.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Wanting live office hours. &gt;&gt;Well, that's what we're doing. &gt;&gt;We're trying.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
A Google Hangout could work.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
What else do we have?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
The Python reference. Do you know what the status of that is?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
There is a Python reference posted for each unit.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
There was a bit of a delay getting it posted for Unit 2,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
but there are Python references posted for both Unit 2 and Unit 3 now.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
They include everything that's been covered in the class up to an including that unit.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So the Unit 3.1 includes 1, 2, and 3.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Where do we find those references?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I believe they are in the supplemental materials. Is that correct?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Yes. Below the video and the unit, you click on the supplemental materials tab.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
You will see course notes for that section and also there's likes to the reference materials

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
relating specifically to Python.
