00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.450
Okay.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.450
Time to debate movies again.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.090
Which movie are we talking about this week?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.120
The Jackie Robinson one.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.120
42.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.120
Good.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.880
I know exactly how I feel about that movie.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.520
Yeah, well, Im going first.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.990
I dont care how you felt about it.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.530
I think the movie is good.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.460
And my first reason is Chadwick Boseman.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.460
Alright?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.580
Hes the main reason this movie is good.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.910
Whose butler is that?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.369
Hes not a butler, hes and actor.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280
He plays Jackie Robinson.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.801
In the movie 42.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.040
I thought that was Wesley Snipes.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.530
Are you sure youre not a racist?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.540
Like, have you dug deep into your soul?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.540
No, its not like that.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.190
Its just that I didnt look at him all that
closely, to be honest.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.200
Hes in every single frame of the movie!

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.790
What were you looking at if you werent looking
at him?

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.480
Other stuff.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.630
Alright well if you didnt know it wasn’t
Wesley Snipes—who was in prison when they

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.040
shot this movie, by the way—then you definitely
don’t know whether the performance was good

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.040
or bad.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.439
Im taking a point.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.640
(That was easy)
Its mine.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640
Im up.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640
One to nothing.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
Thats fine.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.640
Thats okay.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.300
Because Im going to catch right back up with
my first point, which is the Disney-fied racism.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.950
Why do you have to keep making up new words?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.140
Why cant you just use words that are already
in, you know, accepted English language use.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.000
Theres a ton of them.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.640
Disney-fied racism is when they take the feel-good,
don’t-ruffle-anybodys-feathers cloth, and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.270
wipe it vigorously over any scene that has
to do with racism, rendering them basically

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
harmless.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.820
You thought the scene where the opposing manager
said the n-word three thousand times in a

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.850
span of about five minutes was harmless?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.850
No, no, I dont.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.850
Thats the point.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.420
That one scene the movie has the balls to
go for it.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.420
Yeah.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.200
Alright, but every, other scene that has to
do with racism, they cop out.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.771
They take the soft way out.

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.909
I mean, people called him names.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090
His teammates didnt like him at first.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.090
Come on.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.300
The real Jackie Robinson had to deal with
more than that in just a single day of his

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.300
life.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.540
I dont even know what to say.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.280
(That was easy)
Alright fine, my turn.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280
Harrison Ford.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.979
I thought Harrison Ford was awesome in this
movie.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:07.979
What?!

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.979
Come on!

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.149
You didn’t like Harrison Fords performance?

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.390
Come on, you didnt like him?

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.049
He was so far over the top he went sliding
down the other side, man!

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.280
You did not just say that.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280
I know you didnt just say that.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.930
If he had been any more cartoonish they literally
would have had to call his character Burgermeister

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.930
Meisterburger.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.290
So a guy has an accent and a little bit of
a limp, and hes a cartoon?

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.129
Dude he has Popeye face that whole movie.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.469
Come on!

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.560
This is not even up for—you know, case closed.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.769
(That was easy)
Im taking the point.

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.242
You cant just say case closed and have the
case--

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:34.809
Another problem I had was the speechifying.

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:35.980
Again with the speechifying.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.980
Here we go.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.719
How many inspirational, motivational speeches
do you think the real owner of the Brooklyn

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.419
Dodgers gave the real Jackie Robinson in his
entire career?

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.090
Im sure I have no idea.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.090
One?

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.090
Two?

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.090
Sure.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.030
In this movie, which only covers, like, two
seasons by the way, he gives twenty seven

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.709
inspirational speeches to Jackie Robinson.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.709
Come on.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.669
Alright, they could have called this movie
Lincoln 2: The Baseball Years.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.650
Yeah, with 130-something year old Lincoln.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.840
That makes a lot of sense.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.579
Harrison Ford is just about old enough to
play an unassassinated Lincoln.

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.040
Oh come on now, he's only 70 years old.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.329
Did you know Lincoln was assassinated on Jackie
Robinson Day?

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.329
No.

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.919
I mean, it wasnt Jackie Robinson Day at the
time, but its the same date.

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:15.950
April 15.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.010
Dont you think thats kinda kooky?

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.609
Maybe we should just call it a day here, man.

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.959
I mean, its not--
The other problem I have with the film is

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.060
the little racist boy in the audience.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.999
He hears his dad say the n-word and so he
says it too, in the cheesiest scene since

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.180
the ending of The Postman.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.180
(That was easy.)

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.329
You really dont like The Postman, do you?

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.489
Another problem I had was that Sammy Sosa
has a cameo in this movie in the stands.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.489
What?!

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.870
Im like 85% sure it was him.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.269
Why would they give Sammy Sosa a cameo in
this movie?

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.939
Because he played baseball.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.069
So did Cal Ripken.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.010
Yeah, but hes not African American.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.470
Neither is Sammy Sosa.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.129
Now whos an idiot?

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.129
You.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.629
The answer to that question is always going
to be you.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.099
Sammy Sosa is Dominican.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.499
So hes an African Dominican?

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:16.389
Wow, they are really going to call you racist
after this video.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.329
No, hes from the Dominican Republic.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.520
It’s a country.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.550
Is it anything like the Banana Republic?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.550
Yes.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.550
Its right next door.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.039
Oh, well, then I know where that is.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.910
You might know the store on the other side
too.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.280
It’s called the Notary Public.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.229
Yeah, what do they sell?

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.210
Stamps.
