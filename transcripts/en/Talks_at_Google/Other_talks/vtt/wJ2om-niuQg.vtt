ERIC SCHMIDT: Good
afternoon, or if you watch us

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.532
online, whatever time it
may be there in the future.

00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:07.490
My name's Eric Schmidt.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.630
I'm a product manager here at
Google on the Cloud Platform

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.230
team.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.720
This is the Google Talks
or Talks at Google series.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.100
Today it's a pleasure
to welcome the VP

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.755
from Sub-Pop records, Ms. Megan
Jasper-- Mrs. Megan Jasper,

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:25.840
or is it Miss?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.090
MEGAN JASPER: It's so weird.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.900
I never use any of those.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.536
I guess it's Ms. or Mrs. You
can call me anything you want.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.250
I've probably been called
way worse than anything

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.137
you can dream of.

00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:41.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: Great.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.910
Well, thanks for joining us.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.160
In full disclosure, you
and I talked about this.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.580
So I also DJ at KXP
90.3 down the street.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.510
So whenever I was asked to
do this, I was like, wow,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.280
this is amazing.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.360
I get to talk to you and get
to play in the music space

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.660
while we nerd out at Google.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.085
So thank you for
being here today.

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:01.668
MEGAN JASPER: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:02.939
I truly appreciate it.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:03.730
ERIC SCHMIDT: Sure.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.160
So I think most of
the folks in the room,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.990
maybe, but
potentially not online

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.500
may not understand
really what Sub-Pop is.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.430
Yes, it's a record label.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.710
And it's here in Seattle,
but what is Sub-Pop Records?

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.030
MEGAN JASPER: Sub-Pop
records is a record label

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.550
based in Seattle.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.460
And we have been around for
officially almost 28 years.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.990
But we are an
independent label, which

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.300
is also kind of a funny
term to throw around,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.430
because we're 49% percent
owned by Warner Music.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.820
But what we do is we focus
on developing artists.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.770
And we work with bands that
sometimes a small handful

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.360
of people know
about, and we hope

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.640
that we are able to develop
their careers to a point

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.920
where they can really make
a living as an artist.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.840
That's always our goal,
so long as that's what

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.840
the artist's goal is as well.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.320
But that's what we do.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.190
We've worked with
parents who have become

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.840
as popular as Nirvana, or
Flight of the Conchords,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.130
some comedians like David Cross,
the Shins, the Postal Service.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.980
And we work with
a lot of artists

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.710
that still very few
people know about

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.570
but that are important
enough in our eyes

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.740
that we can't imagine
not trying to expose

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.867
their art to the world.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:38.700
ERIC SCHMIDT: One of
the things I personally

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.005
love about Sub-Pop is that
especially from a communication

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.380
perspective, you're always
very consistent about what you

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.921
believe in and what
you don't believe

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:49.890
in to the extent on the site
there's no definitive mission

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.160
statement about, like,
this is Sub-Pop's mission.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.860
But the one thing they do say
is that at the end of the day,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.910
the label's about
serving artists.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.120
And as most
consumers-- and there

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.790
are some producers
of music here--

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.860
can you shed some light
on what specifically

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.150
serving artists means?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.711
Like, what happens
on a daily basis?

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.460
What you do to nurture
them and help them?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.110
MEGAN JASPER: And I have to
say I love that you brought up

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.410
the fact that we don't have
a mission, because that's

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.030
something that we've talked
about for so many years.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.980
Because we are a
mission-driven organization,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.250
but a mission-driven
one without a mission,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.340
or a declared mission.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.490
And there are times when I say
to Jonathan, who owns Sub-Pop,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.090
I think we need a
mission statement.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.090
And he'll be like, yeah.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.960
It would probably go something
like, meow, meow, meow, meow

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.420
with developing artists and
community and while having fun,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.540
and maybe a little
extra meow, meow, meow.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.400
And then we don't have a
declared mission statement.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.780
Because we're just, like,
yeah, that sounds good.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.600
Go back to work.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.090
So we say, when we
talk in meetings,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.890
we say, our goal is to serve
the artists with whom we work.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.940
And what that means is the
development of those careers.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.720
And what that means
in daily practice

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.329
is, first off, really getting
to know those artists, which--

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.180
it's funny.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.910
I think the first place a lot
of people's minds would go

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.070
is what it means marketing-wise
what it means sales-wise.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.000
And although those are
very important things,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.069
I think the most important
thing is knowing the people

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.110
that you're working with.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.870
Because you can't serve
them if you don't know

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.310
who they are-- if you don't
know who they are as people

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.350
and as artists.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.270
So for us, what that means
is, what are your goals?

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.600
How do you want to
present yourself?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.720
How do you want to make your art
and then express it afterwards?

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.970
Do you want to go on tours?

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.550
Does that stress
you out too much?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.140
Do you have family and you
need to prioritize your kids?

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.880
How is that going to work?

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.860
Because if we
understand those things

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.950
and what makes those
people come to life

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.610
or what makes them
shut down, then we

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.080
can understand what
situations to put them

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.400
or to spare them from
being thrown into.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.610
And so that's a huge
part of it, is just

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.150
knowing who they
are, and from there,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.650
making sure they're able to
make a record that they feel

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.140
proud of, making sure
that they have a record

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.190
that they feel like they
could stand behind and go

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.710
out and tour on.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.370
And we then do marketing
around all of those things

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.840
and then hope that the record
sales or that the streaming

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.160
is at a volume that can
bring in money for them,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.990
and ultimately, that
they can have the careers

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.791
but they want to have.

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:05.037
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
interesting, as I was listening

00:06:05.037 --> 00:06:07.120
to all those things, it
was not until the very end

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.000
that you really start
to talk about money.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.030
And maybe if you
could explain a bit,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.840
we'll talk a little bit about
Hardly Art, the other label

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.760
of the label in a bit.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.120
But can you explain
how in today's terms,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.670
how Sub-Pop does make money?

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.260
MEGAN JASPER: Yeah.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.710
We make money in a
lot of different ways.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.070
And for an industry
that has been screaming,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.150
the sky is falling,
for so many years now,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.950
we still make the majority of
our money off of record sales.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.570
And what sales-- the word
"sales" now means how many--

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.370
still, even though the
number is declining-- how

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.680
many CDs doesn't a band sell.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.870
We don't make CDs
for every band.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.920
But if we don't make CDs
for say, Beach House,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.130
we're losing sales.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.520
So how many CDs are selling?

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.180
How much vinyl a selling?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.840
It's a lot.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.360
And, what are we able to get
still in downloads and streams?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.940
That's what sales means.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.190
We also are able
to do a lot of-- we

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.820
get licensing opportunities
for our artists.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.630
And what that means is we
look into opportunities

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.190
with music supervisors
who are placing music

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.950
for ads, TV, film-- whenever
opportunities exist out

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.990
there that their songs
may be a good match for.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.130
And if the artist is OK
with those opportunities

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.270
then we attempt to secure them.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.580
We also do a fair
amount of merch.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.440
We make t-shirts and hoodies
and all sorts of stuff

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.730
that you might not need,
but people buy them.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.690
And we're able to give
some of that money

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.960
to the artists, which is great.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.020
And we look for international
opportunities as well.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.540
We're doing all
of the same things

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.410
that we do in the US in other
countries with partners.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.610
It almost sounds old-fashioned.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.265
ERIC SCHMIDT: No, I
was waiting for you--

00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:15.210
I don't know if you've seen
the movie Spaceballs with Mel

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:15.490
Brooks.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.410
He's going, "merchandising,
merchandising."

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.500
Do you remember that?

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.550
If you could hold this up--
this may be a flashback for you,

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.921
but an engineer on the team that
I work with, Bill [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:28.670
he sent me an email
this morning and said,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.680
I just dug this up
from my basement.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.230
And I asked him when he got it
and he believed it was 1991.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.842
And if you look at the tag--

00:08:35.842 --> 00:08:36.830
MEGAN JASPER: It
looks like it's 1991.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.919
ERIC SCHMIDT: If you look at the
tag, it even feels like 1991.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.210
It's heavy, like that's when
our t-shirts were made out

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.701
of real ingredients.

00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:45.200
And it was black
at the time, right?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.089
So how can you explain the
origin of the word "loser"?

00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:51.130
MEGAN JASPER: I sure can.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.860
ERIC SCHMIDT: Because
this is a mystery.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.390
Even on the internet,
with all the information

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.870
we have and Google's great
search engine, still it's

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.030
kind of confusing as to
why Loser is on that shirt.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.821
MEGAN JASPER: Yeah.

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:01.930
I can also tell you that
this t-shirt was printed

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:07.170
by a guy named Jeff Ross, who
was doing our early shirts back

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:07.700
in the day.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.140
And I know that because
I recognize the tag.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.595
And I'm old, so I
remember this shit.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:24.760
So Loser was a term that
Sub-Pop started using in 1988.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.370
And here's what I
love about Loser,

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.380
is the people who
started Sub-Pop

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.710
and worked at Sub-Pop
and not just Sub-Pop,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.720
but the people who were
music geeks and old punk

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.380
rockers at that
time, were usually

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.070
total misfits in the day.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.760
And that's kind of
where Loser comes from

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.920
is that feeling of
just not fitting in.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.780
And then you find a community or
a group of people or something

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.520
that you feel like
you belong to.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.160
And then you kind of feel
like a winner, right?

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.940
So when Bruce and John were--
Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.740
Poneman, who were
Sub-Pop's co-founders,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:19.120
when they started doing
The Singles Club, which

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.830
was a release of limited
seven-inch singles

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.390
that would go out to
people, you would say,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.560
yes, I would love
to sign up and I'll

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.230
get one limited colored vinyl
single every single month

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.100
for one year.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.200
And then you send your $60 in.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.230
Sub-Pop gets money
really quickly,

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.860
which was very
helpful at the time.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.920
And you can get these
singles and then

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.090
sell them for a ton of
money afterwards, that's

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.340
what a lot of people did.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.540
But they used the word
Loser in their campaign.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.660
They said, Hey Loser, come
join our singles club.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.967
And we had a lot of
losers signing up.

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:02.800
And then they were like,
God, this is great.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.530
Let's make Loser t-shirts.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.940
And I remember the first
time I saw a Loser t-shirt.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:14.990
It was spring 1989.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.940
And Tad was playing at a
really small club in Manhattan.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.930
And I had not yet
moved to Seattle,

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.350
but I was just about too.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.360
And he was wearing the white
version of this t-shirt.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.250
And I remember looking at it
and going, God, that's so good.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.460
Because Loser, it resonates.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.860
ERIC SCHMIDT: It
has this dual mode.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.690
Like, inwardly, as
people look at it,

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.009
they have some emotional,
maybe, sympathy for you,

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:45.050
like this person is
broadcasting they're a loser.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.000
But as soon as you attack
them, this idea of, I'm

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.660
banded with the rest of
losers and there's power.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.700
MEGAN JASPER: Yes, and
it makes you feel proud.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.050
And so there are people who
go to the airport store.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.860
We have a store
at Sea-Tac airport

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.717
and we sell the Loser shirt.

00:12:00.717 --> 00:12:02.175
And there are folks
who go in there

00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:05.540
and they're like, why Loser?

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.380
But I mean, hello.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.479
We're fucking losers!

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:14.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'm going to get
back to your f'ing loser issue

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.800
in a minute.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.042
But I want to--
specifically to yours-- I

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:21.750
want to talk a little
bit about loserdom.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.210
So right now, Sub-Pop is
offering a set of scholarships

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:30.870
for $15,000 to help eligible
high school seniors achieve,

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.260
as you call it, their
focused education as a path

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.520
to loserdom.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.580
And I read this.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.680
I'm an artist and
I'm also a nerd.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.030
But I felt a little passively
discriminated, like,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.320
is this the only path that I
can choose to get to loserdom

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.830
is to basically focus
on music, or are there

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.700
other paths, other
elements to this?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.610
MEGAN JASPER: For
that scholarship,

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.620
it can be any kind of art.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.010
So it can be visual art.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.910
It can be dance.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:05.450
We had one person get the
scholarship who made fanzines.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.560
It's more creative endeavors.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.020
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Excellent, excellent.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.480
I feel less
discriminated against.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.330
All right, so whenever I was
prepping for the interview,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.870
I reached out to my friends
at the station-- Cheryl

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.570
Waters, Kevin Cole, John
Richards-- and said,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.550
hey, I'm having a
challenge trying

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.340
to find interesting things
other than what's coming up

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.420
on regular search on Google.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.340
And I said, can
you please help me?

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.280
Like, I need dirt.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.570
MEGAN JASPER: I'm so psyched.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: Their
unanimous reply--

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.740
and I concatenated them,
for anonymity reasons.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.470
We'll see if you can
guess who they are.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.910
And the unanimous reply was,
I hope FCC violations aren't

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.550
an issue for you.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.120
She swears like a sailor
with Tourette's and can't

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.450
be fazed by anything.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.050
I can't think of a
more fun interview.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.820
She's a riot.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.350
There's nothing you can say
that will shock Megan Jasper.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.249
MEGAN JASPER: I guess
that's John Richards.

00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:00.040
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.160
It's a combination
of John and Cheryl.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.730
That was it.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.630
They just smiled and they
were like, good luck.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.990
MEGAN JASPER: They've all
heard some really terrible,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.566
nasty stuff fly out of this.

00:14:16.566 --> 00:14:19.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: Face to face, they
told me. some, but none of it

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.100
was documented.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.470
So for email
purposes, we're good.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.132
So quick, favorite
coffee shop in Seattle?

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:27.956
MEGAN JASPER: C&amp;P
in West Seattle.

00:14:27.956 --> 00:14:29.330
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Yeah, that's great.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.190
MEGAN JASPER: Lighthouse
Beans, delicious.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.930
Close second, Real Fine, also
in West Seattle, just opened up.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.900
Their coffee is fucking killer.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.700
ERIC SCHMIDT: And C&amp;P is
family-owned, which is great.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.530
Cam and Pete.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.190
Beer, wine, or both or none?

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.330
MEGAN JASPER: I like wine.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.121
ERIC SCHMIDT: Wine.

00:14:47.121 --> 00:14:47.810
Red?

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.890
MEGAN JASPER: Yes.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.767
I also love a Sauvignon Blanc.

00:14:50.767 --> 00:14:52.850
ERIC SCHMIDT: So finally,
why do you hate to cook?

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.296
What's up with that?

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:56.400
MEGAN JASPER: It's so stressful.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.590
And I just can't
fucking handle it.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.670
So you guys know, you
work all day, right?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:11.630
And you're tired and, OK,
so you can go for a walk

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.880
or you can cook in a kitchen,
after having been indoors

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.040
all day long.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.290
That sounds terrible to me.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:25.070
Plus, I don't trust-- I
like playing with colors,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.480
but I don't understand how
to translate that to flavors.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.510
And so anything
I'm going to make

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.030
is going to be kind of a bummer.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.680
I like baking.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.284
Can't handle cooking.

00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:38.450
I'd rather have hemorrhoids.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.341
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:45.280
I don't want to be stressed
out when I'm at home.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.100
Thankfully, my way better half
and more presentable half,

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.936
Brian, he's a really good cook.

00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:57.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: So the first
search result in Google is,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.230
quote, "foul-mouthed and
community-minded Sub-Pop

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.660
records executive Megan Jasper."

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.520
What would your mom
think about this

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.895
if she was here and
got to see this,

00:16:05.895 --> 00:16:07.750
that that's the
first search result?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.640
MEGAN JASPER: She'd
say, the apple

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.142
doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:16:13.142 --> 00:16:16.770
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Excellent, excellent.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:21.166
In the '90s, you were a
member of a band, Dickless.

00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:22.540
So you weren't a
founding member,

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.670
but you joined as a vocalist.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.100
By the way, if you Google
Dickless Megan Jasper,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.410
it's OK to look at the results.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.310
And the images.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.700
MEGAN JASPER: And, by
the way, "vocalist"

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.085
is a very generous word.

00:16:38.085 --> 00:16:39.960
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'm just
getting what Wikipedia

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.600
and the other thing said.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.360
My question is, if Sub-Pop's
business depended upon it

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.232
today, would you sign them?

00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:51.310
MEGAN JASPER: Oh, hell no.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.140
No.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.050
I mean, if Kelly Canary
were still in the build,

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.970
absolutely yes.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:02.400
If I was in the band, hells no.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.510
I would be fired, and should be.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: You don't
think the serving artist

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.551
power of Sub-Pop could save
the band at that point?

00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:11.510
MEGAN JASPER: No.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.140
I mean, let's just
say my talents are not

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.210
in the spotlight.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.244
Kelly Canary is a
different story, though.

00:17:19.244 --> 00:17:22.609
ERIC SCHMIDT: I was listening
to some of the tracks.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.599
And some of it was amazing--
others not so much.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:28.217
But that's why
there's so much music.

00:17:28.217 --> 00:17:29.800
So let's talk about
some other artists

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.190
that you did sign to
get an inside view.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.515
First one, Father John Misty.

00:17:33.515 --> 00:17:36.790
Is he really as dreamy and
as mysterious in person

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.110
as his music leads
you to believe he is?

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.314
MEGAN JASPER: That's
a good question.

00:17:42.314 --> 00:17:44.230
ERIC SCHMIDT: And by the
way, full disclosure,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.480
I have a man crush on him.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.340
So that's why I picked him.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.700
MEGAN JASPER: As you should.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.720
Did I just goof this thing up?

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.720
Sorry.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.890
Can you hear me?

00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:00.620
He is one of the most talented
artists we've ever worked with.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.000
And in person, you get
all of the elements

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.240
that he shows onstage,
but way less exaggerated.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:15.460
He is so razor-sharp
smart, it's crazy.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.410
He sweats over every word.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.660
But there's no delay
in him picking a word.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.880
And he is a funny
motherfucker, man.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.354
He is hilarious.

00:18:26.354 --> 00:18:28.770
ERIC SCHMIDT: So he's like a
funny Paul Simon with a beard

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.110
and not as irritating.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.039
MEGAN JASPER: Yes.

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:31.830
ERIC SCHMIDT: Cool.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.755
All right.

00:18:32.755 --> 00:18:34.700
MEGAN JASPER: He
dances less in person

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.440
too when you're
just hanging out.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.620
ERIC SCHMIDT: Awesome.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.980
Fleet Foxes-- explosive growth.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.740
I mean, I remember
whenever they had

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.460
the station the first
time and then everyone

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.230
was addicted to them.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.580
And then things changed.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.120
Forget-- it was the lead singer.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.790
Can't remember, decided
to go back to college.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:56.950
What's next?

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.450
Do you have any
insider information?

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.425
Like, are they starting to
circle the castle again?

00:19:01.425 --> 00:19:02.280
MEGAN JASPER: Yes.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.240
Robin is writing new material.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.070
I am hoping, as
a fan, that he is

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.240
getting ready to perform again.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.350
He took a lot of time off.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:21.050
He also is-- he is such a
gifted human being in that he's

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.950
just-- he's a really
talented musician

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:32.050
and he is a really bright,
interesting, dynamic person who

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.830
has the capacity
to do an awful lot.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.580
I hope he starts
playing shows again.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.725
I know he's writing stuff.

00:19:38.725 --> 00:19:41.100
ERIC SCHMIDT: Literally, the
hairs on the back of my neck

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.000
are standing up knowing
that this is happening.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.875
MEGAN JASPER: I know.

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.600
The world needs
more music by him.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.080
ERIC SCHMIDT: Mudhoney,
one of the founding four,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.450
if you will-- we'll talk
about the founding four

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.900
at the beginning of
the label-- what's

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.402
the key to their longevity?

00:19:57.402 --> 00:19:59.110
So I'm good friends
with their sound guy,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.690
and we share stories
here and there.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.600
But they seem to be
on tour all the time.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.610
And they look the same
and they sound the same.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.590
How do they do it?

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.270
MEGAN JASPER: Well, fillers.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.720
They get grunge fillers.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.830
Well, they tour a lot,
but they don't tour a ton.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.610
Because Guy is a nurse.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.580
He is an ER nurse at Harborview.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.980
So they have to be really
careful with their schedule.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.390
And they all have kids, except
for Mark, who works at Sub-Pop.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.640
He manages our warehouse.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:41.820
I think of that even though
they-- we all grow up

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.560
and we're all getting older.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.450
But I think they've just
held on to-- I think they

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.470
love playing together still.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.990
I think they've held
onto a lot of the beliefs

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.340
that they've always had.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.990
And I think they
have fun touring

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.560
and just being
around each other.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.760
And they are family, that band.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.800
And they write a great song.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.320
And they perform-- have you
guys seen Mudhoney play ever?

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.820
If you have, you know that
that's something so special.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.960
And seeing Mark transform from
actually a very presentable,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.660
normal guy to the thing he
is on stage is unbelievable.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.920
It's unbelievable.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.110
But he is a great front person.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.991
And they're just kind of magic.

00:21:39.991 --> 00:21:43.750
ERIC SCHMIDT: I see that the
concept of family and stability

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.350
a lot-- Eddie Vedder,
Dave Matthews,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.550
et cetera, as they're bouncing
around the city, family's

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.990
very important to them
connect into record labels,

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.820
other bands, venues, et cetera.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.810
So that seems like one of those
keys for people out there.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.480
It's like, it's just not about
chasing, chasing, chasing.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.790
You still gotta settle down
and nurture your roots.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.760
So your desk at work-- you can't
see it online, how much drugs

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.700
are filled in that desk?

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.110
Is it just like we see on vinyl?

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.330
Like, you just have
every drug as possible

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.630
that's needed to do your job?

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.640
MEGAN JASPER: I have
mounds of cocaine.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.990
You just never know when you're
going to just feel sleepy.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.010
And I have just shitloads
of dope and everything

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.760
you could imagine,
rolled up bills.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.560
No, my desk compared
to that show

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.570
is like the Mickey Mouse Club.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.690
I usually have a cup of coffee.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:46.640
I am so the boring version
of what that show is.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.530
But I will say that my
desk is way sloppier

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.290
than anyone's on that show.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.920
I like it when the
house is clean,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.240
but I apparently don't like
it when my office is clean.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.630
Because I do everything
to screw that up.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.820
And I have piles
of shit everywhere.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.450
But I know where my stuff is.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.380
I can't keep it organized
to save my life.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.810
ERIC SCHMIDT: To each his own.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.560
I'm glad to hear that
your desk isn't just

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.070
filling over with drugs.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.880
MEGAN JASPER: No, that's what
the parking lot's for outside.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.420
That's pretty bad too.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.810
My dog almost stepped on
a syringe the other day

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.970
and he picked up-- they
have those little drug bags

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.550
on the sidewalk all the time.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.020
And he picked one
up in his mouth.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.390
I was like, oh my
God, Pickles, no.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.172
Ready to throw him into rehab.

00:23:40.172 --> 00:23:41.755
ERIC SCHMIDT: He's
like a drug runner.

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:42.880
MEGAN JASPER: Totally.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: We'll talk about
drugs and some dysfunction

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.030
in Seattle in a little bit.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:53.580
I want to talk about something
that's completely different.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.080
And I want to thank
you for swinging

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.950
by on the flippity-flop
to do this today.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.790
If you haven't read
this story back in 1992,

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:08.740
Megan pulled off probably
one of best editorial spoofs

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.430
at the time, especially for
a paper like the "New York

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.870
Times," where she was asked
to basically kind of explain

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.480
grunge and somehow-- you
can fill in the story,

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.730
because you did the interview.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:27.287
But you made up a lexicon,
a language, of grunge-speak

00:24:27.287 --> 00:24:28.870
and the "New York
Times" published it.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.757
And it was completely made-up.

00:24:30.757 --> 00:24:31.590
It was all bullshit.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.006
MEGAN JASPER: It
was all bullshit.

00:24:33.006 --> 00:24:34.860
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
you used words like,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.580
on the flippity-flop, cob
nobbler, which actually is now,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.450
like, a real word.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.530
People use cob nobbler--

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.738
MEGAN JASPER: As they should.

00:24:40.738 --> 00:24:42.280
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah, wax slacks.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.310
So I have two questions.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.880
One, what you were thinking?

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.430
And number two, would you
attempt to do that again?

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.687
Like, now that Sub-Pop--
it's not small.

00:24:51.687 --> 00:24:52.520
Seattle's not small.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.762
You're repping tons of artists.

00:24:54.762 --> 00:24:55.845
You were the receptionist.

00:24:55.845 --> 00:24:56.744
Now you're the VP.

00:24:56.744 --> 00:24:57.660
Would you do it again?

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.840
MEGAN JASPER: I would
do it in a heartbeat.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.910
Are you kidding me?

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.430
That's what life is all about.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:08.230
My coworker, Derek, on my way
out today, said, all right.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.880
Do you think I can
get away with this

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.360
and promise I won't be fired,
or just tell me right now

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.120
and I won't do it.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.570
I'm like, what is it?

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.220
I want to make a t-shirt.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.260
It's going to say,
"Trigger" and then an arrow

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.400
pointed down to my crotch.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.130
I'm like, of course
you have to do that.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.600
That's like, so rated
G. Are you kidding me?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.060
Do it.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.640
I feel like life is way more
fun when you can laugh at stuff

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.380
and when you have
shit to laugh at.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.770
So as long as it's not mean
and it's not hurting people,

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.070
I am so all for it.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:49.230
That happened because
I was so buzzed out

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:54.490
on way too many French presses
that I had in my apartment

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:55.150
at the time.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.310
And when that phone
call came my way,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.836
I just remember
feeling like, yes.

00:26:01.836 --> 00:26:04.330
It was, I can either
chat with this person

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.840
and come up with some
crazy-ass answers,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.660
or I could go back to work.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.435
So I was like--

00:26:13.435 --> 00:26:15.819
ERIC SCHMIDT: If you haven't
read it, you gotta read it.

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:16.360
It's awesome.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.310
And then, who came to the
"New York Times" defense?

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.060
Forget the--

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.430
MEGAN JASPER: Tom
[? Marron. ?] No,

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.360
[? Marron ?] was the
journalist who wrote it.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.970
Tom Frank.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.770
Tom Frank worked at
The Baffler and was

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:36.300
a University of Chicago Ph.D.
student, I think, at the time.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.580
And he ended up
exposing the story.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.970
And I didn't know any of
that stuff was going on.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.460
But I remember him
calling me and saying,

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.680
oh, my God, the
"New York Times,"

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.000
they feel like such
pussies right now,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.180
and meow, meow, meow.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.100
It's like, awesome.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.484
This sounds fun.

00:26:55.484 --> 00:26:57.150
ERIC SCHMIDT: I would
have loved to seen

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.220
if we had Twitter and real
time search and everything else

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.380
that we have now, just how
differently-- because this

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.437
took days to play out.

00:27:05.437 --> 00:27:07.770
MEGAN JASPER: I have to say,
my favorite thing about all

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.380
of that was that the day it came
out at the "New York Times,"

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.440
they did a huge piece on
Seattle, and Seattle culture,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.090
and how to understand the
music, and how people talked.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.110
It's like, blah.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.790
Why would they talk any
differently than anyone else?

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.820
But my mom, who got the
"New York Times"-- she lives

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.480
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.240
She calls me up and she
goes, "Jesus Christ,

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.750
you're never going
to believe it.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.980
Go out.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.610
Run to the 7-Eleven.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.390
Get the goddamn paper right now.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:36.370
Go get the Times.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.992
All your bullshit's in it."

00:27:37.992 --> 00:27:40.352
And I was like, awesome.

00:27:40.352 --> 00:27:41.970
And she was like, "Good girl.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.360
Keep doing the good stuff."

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.730
And I'm like, lying?

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.750
And so when you get praised
from a parent for telling lies,

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.790
it's like, oh, my God, yes.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:51.670
The world is right.

00:27:54.922 --> 00:27:59.880
ERIC SCHMIDT: So most of the
stories that I read third party

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.600
and also the
interviews you've done,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.870
the majority, even today
you're so positive, almost

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:07.520
like a duck.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.200
Nothing sticks.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.460
It just washes off your back.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.710
You keep going.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.650
I want to take us back to
a time which is coming up,

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.300
calendar-wise.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.510
April 5 marks the anniversary
of Kurt Cobain's death.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.210
And in 1994, they had moved on.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.080
They were on DGC at the time.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.760
But nonetheless,
you had traveled

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.200
through many, many
journeys with them.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.380
And can you take us back to
that day, and what did you feel?

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.179
What was going on at Sub-Pop?

00:28:40.179 --> 00:28:41.970
Kind of know what was
going on in the city,

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.390
but can you explain
your reaction to that?

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.160
MEGAN JASPER: Yeah.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.860
So for me, at that time
I was working for ADA,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:57.420
which was Sub-Pop's-- Sub-Pop
is distributed still by ADA

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.310
in States.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:06.670
And I hadn't heard
anything that morning.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:11.800
And weirdly, every
four or six weeks, I

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.160
would have an appointment at
Fred Meyer's, the department

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.660
store.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.890
What is it called?

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.660
The one-stop shopping store,
whatever the hell it's called?

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.890
And I would sell music to them.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.730
And it was always a
little bit more stressful

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:32.900
than my other accounts, because
the buyer was a bit older

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.130
than me, had way more
experience than I did.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.140
I was like the little kid
going in there at the time.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.540
And so I always felt like I
had to have my shit together.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.810
And I had to be able
to tell them straight

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.880
up why he needed to
buy certain records.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.330
I just had to have everything
together in my head.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.380
And so that morning,
I just remember

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.340
driving to their main offices.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.395
And I didn't have the radio on.

00:29:58.395 --> 00:30:00.370
I didn't have anything
on, because I was just

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:05.810
trying to kind of make sure
I had my shit together.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:10.810
And when I walked in there,
the buyer, Don Jensen,

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.670
said, what's happening
with Kurt Cobain right now?

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:19.990
And then he told me that a body
had been found in the garage

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.760
to the house.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.500
And I remember kind
of feeling shocked.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:35.230
But I thought, because I
knew that Kurt was in rehab,

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:41.150
that I thought maybe it was my
friend Dylan, who was in Earth.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:49.730
And I just remember trying to
hold it together and just kind

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.410
of get my work done.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.110
The thing that I remember
the most was I walked out

00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:00.220
with an order of more
Nirvana records, more any

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.290
records than I had ever
walked out with before.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:07.200
And I felt so
conflicted, because not

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.490
knowing if it was
Kurt or not Kurt,

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.910
I just was like, oh my God.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.050
This is fucked up.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.530
Like, somebody has died.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:21.100
And this is what my
job is right now,

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.000
is to put in an order for
a whole lot of records

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.370
at Fred Meyer.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.900
And so I remember driving home.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:37.010
And weirdly, there was
an anniversary party

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.330
that Sub-Pop was having.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.620
And so everybody from ADA
was flying into Seattle.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.370
And so I had to do airport runs
after that and pick people up.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:50.000
And I remember people saying--
because here's the thing.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.840
It's like, whenever
anything happens,

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.990
we as humans often end up
just projecting our own stuff

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.020
onto it.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.890
And so there was a lot
of that, like what's

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.210
there to be depressed about?

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.170
He had a ton of money.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:07.730
It's just-- I just remember
hearing a whole lot of stuff

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:12.070
like that and just shutting
up and not saying anything.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.750
But I remember being
terribly concerned,

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.570
mostly for Jonathan, who
was in the Sub-Pop offices.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:24.770
And I knew there was just--
there were news people outside

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.020
of those offices.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.630
And it just was bad.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:37.100
And I remember,
just-- at the time,

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.130
you don't know what
anything means.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:44.250
You have to-- we
gain perspective

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.350
by having a beginning
and an end to things.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.600
And then moving
beyond it and having

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.860
the ability to process
that whatever lies

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.680
in the middle of those things.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.840
And so I just remember not
knowing what any of it meant.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.730
But I remember seeing
a lot of the people

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.570
that I know and love
in states of shock.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:14.975
And it was just a
pretty awful day.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:26.810
ERIC SCHMIDT: As time moves
on, memorializing folks,

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.340
like when David Bowie
passed, we were memorializing

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.120
him the next day on the radio.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.730
And so, yeah, as time moves
on, your perspective changes.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.850
Those feelings are still
there, but we can now

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.010
reflect on other things.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.870
I was doing some
research, and you

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:48.600
published the original contract
signed in 1989 with Nirvana,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.870
which was very open source
of you guys, so that's great.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.400
You published the
contract online.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.270
And the first advance
was a whopping $600,

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.077
to be recouped through
recoupable expenses,

00:34:02.077 --> 00:34:02.910
through [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:06.130
So my question is, how
did Sub-Pop overcome

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.214
recouping $600 on Nirvana?

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:10.589
That seems, like,
insurmountable.

00:34:13.265 --> 00:34:15.729
MEGAN JASPER: Well,
they're still not recouped.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:24.650
It's so weird that that first
record was made for $600.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:26.860
But it was, and it's
a perfect record.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:31.480
And if there's anything
to take from that,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:37.610
it is that artists can
do an incredible amount.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.110
I'm not saying that
they always have

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.469
to have very little,
what I'm saying

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:45.610
is it's mind-blowing what an
artist can do with very little.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.250
And that record's
an example of that.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.909
And I have to say also, just
going back to Kurt, just

00:34:52.909 --> 00:35:03.880
for a second, is that stuff,
I don't know that it will ever

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.760
really be reconciled.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.700
But I have to say,
I think there's

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:15.990
something so important about
just remembering that there

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.660
are so many people in our world
who are just larger than life.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.070
And at the end of it
all, really, everyone

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:27.110
is just the same, with
struggles and gifts

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.520
and joys and challenges.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.660
And Kurt was so no different.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.590
For most of the time
that I knew him,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.780
I always had the feeling that
he would rather kind of sit

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:45.400
back and just watch
and enjoy than be

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.770
the center of attention.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.940
And I think no matter how much
money anybody has or how much

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:59.040
success anybody has or not, it's
so important to remember that

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.800
we're kind of all in this thing
together and to be mindful

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.440
of that and never to think
that you know what anyone

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.998
in the world is going
through, because we don't.

00:36:12.998 --> 00:36:17.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: I was
thinking that that theme is

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.760
kind of pervasive
throughout the artists

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.440
that you have repped
over the years, both

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.220
the happy ones and
maybe the ones that had

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.280
a lot of loser inside of them.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.899
They're all very genuine.

00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:32.940
I remember hearing that
album for the first time.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.970
I was like, wow.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.180
Like, I'm angry too.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.219
And this person's angry,
and this is amazing.

00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:38.260
MEGAN JASPER: Feels good.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.551
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah, feels good.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:45.630
So I want to switch gears a bit.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.460
I want to talk about the role
of women in the workplace,

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.080
specifically in executive roles.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.160
You started out as
the receptionist,

00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:02.440
worked and worked through, how
many years now, 24 or 25-ish?

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.740
MEGAN JASPER: I started in '89.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.980
ERIC SCHMIDT: But you work in
a highly male dominated field.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.130
And I would say, because
I've been in this space

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.860
for a long time, it's not
even so male dominated.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.420
It's also kind of
sleazy at times.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.460
The record business
is a tough business

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:26.520
to be in, meaning there's not a
lot of rules that are enforced.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.860
How did you survive?

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.720
And then, what
advice would you give

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.820
to women who aspire
to stay the course

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.100
and move through,
say, like a rank

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.605
and file position to
an executive position?

00:37:38.605 --> 00:37:43.330
MEGAN JASPER: I would say
that I survived a lot of it

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.630
because I tried
not to give a shit.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:52.060
And for much of my time,
I didn't give a shit,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.050
meaning that I was way
less mindful of the fact

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.970
that I'm a woman.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:03.640
I also felt like I was just
doing what I love to do

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.040
and I felt pretty lost in that.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:12.590
And I have had the good fortune
to work for a guy, Jonathan,

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.790
who's pretty enlightened
and pretty great

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:21.940
and has never made me feel any
less-- I mean, God knows, I

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.750
am less in a million
different ways,

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.300
but not because I'm a woman.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.380
And so I've never
felt like that.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.380
I also feel like I've
had the good fortune

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.850
of helping to shape some of
the culture at the company.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.200
And we have a
pretty equal number

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.720
of men and women in the company.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:49.030
And if anyone showed
signs of being an asshole

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.520
to anyone because of who they
are or what they look like

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.840
or what their deal
is, there's just

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.305
no room for that in our office.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:07.490
So I was maybe
sheltered from it a bit.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:12.710
And I would say that
the biggest challenge

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.780
I think that women
have-- because women

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.980
are obviously every
bit as capable as men.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:25.480
But the biggest challenge I
think is women having families.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.130
Because to be able
to work in a place

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.030
where you can step
away and have a baby

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.680
and then be able to take
care of that baby in a way

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:40.840
that a mom needs to, whatever
that means for any mom,

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.010
it's different than a guy.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.260
I think there are
wonderful things

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:52.090
that men bring to a child and
that women bring to a child.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:56.830
But women have such
a greater challenge

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:02.780
of continuing with their
careers when they have families.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.940
And I know a lot
of women in music

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.290
and in other jobs who
have had to switch gears

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.075
in order to provide
for their kids.

00:40:10.075 --> 00:40:14.900
So I would say if
you are a woman

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.660
and you're in that
position, just do everything

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.830
in your power to stick
with it if that's really

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:20.900
what you love to do.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.420
And also, I think
you can't feel badly

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.200
for prioritizing your kid
over your friggin' job,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.080
because you kind of-- that's
what I would do if I had kids.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.680
Fuck, I have two dogs.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.992
And I'm sure there
are people in my life

00:40:37.992 --> 00:40:40.450
who have been afraid that I
might start breastfeeding them,

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.320
because I have a completely
dysfunctional relationship

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.590
with them.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:49.920
And if I could have kids,
I'd probably be a puppy mill,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.760
meaning if they came out
looking like furry puppies,

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.240
I'd be like, why not have more?

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.130
Because I love a dog.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:03.340
But I think it's just
challenging for women.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:09.480
And I feel like it's all
of our responsibilities

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.380
to make sure that we are mindful
and sensitive to especially

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.530
women in the workplace
and especially women who

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.980
are having families.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.530
Because that's ultimately
what it's all about.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.130
I mean, we have to
die off for a few

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.860
more generations
in order for things

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.040
to be a whole lot better.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.721
So we kind of need
some kids in the world.

00:41:32.721 --> 00:41:35.654
ERIC SCHMIDT: I love the
family reinforcement again.

00:41:35.654 --> 00:41:37.320
I want to go home and
give my little guy

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.330
a hug after listening to that.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:44.280
There's nothing in
my question flow

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.000
that talks about how you jump
from breastfeeding puppies

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.940
to the next question.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:53.240
So I want to talk about Seattle.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.940
The analogy I was
using is Sub-Pop

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.050
was the womb, if
you will, of kind

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:03.750
of birthing the original four
and then kind of nurturing

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.370
the city in terms of
growing music culture.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.770
And this place is completely
different in many ways

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.870
from the late '80s
and early '90s.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.640
It's one of the
fastest-growing cities.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.200
We're competing back and
forth between Austin, which

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.787
we are way cooler than Austin.

00:42:18.787 --> 00:42:21.120
No offense to Austin, but I
was there a couple weeks ago

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.326
and Seattle's way cooler.

00:42:22.326 --> 00:42:23.242
MEGAN JASPER: I agree.

00:42:23.242 --> 00:42:24.033
ERIC SCHMIDT: Good.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.319
But there's a ton of change
happening in the city.

00:42:29.319 --> 00:42:30.610
People are honking their horns.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.680
They're driving too fast.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.350
People aren't saying
"no worries" anymore.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.683
It's like, who are these people?

00:42:34.683 --> 00:42:39.040
It's like this confluence of
people that aren't Seattleites.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.770
And then you have impacts
of things like restrictions

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.310
on live music venues.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:47.495
Folks like here
in Fremont, Nectar

00:42:47.495 --> 00:42:50.612
is under a lot of
pressure because there's

00:42:50.612 --> 00:42:53.070
too much tolerance for noise
because we want higher density

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.260
housing, a decline in
artistry because it's just

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.510
too damn expensive.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.050
It's really
expensive, especially

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.960
where your offices are up
on Capital Hill, et cetera.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.350
And then you also have
the cultural aspects

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.190
of how people consume music,
snacking one at a time,

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:12.100
spending $0.99, listening to a
stream that they don't pay for.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.910
How has this impacted
Sub-Pop in terms

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.250
of how it feels about
Seattle, and where do you

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.454
think it's headed?

00:43:24.376 --> 00:43:28.333
MEGAN JASPER: It's such
the question right now.

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:30.666
ERIC SCHMIDT: I realize that
was three questions in one.

00:43:30.666 --> 00:43:32.190
MEGAN JASPER: That's OK.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:37.190
So as far as-- OK,
it's so funny because I

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.270
was thinking about this
exact thing this morning.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:44.340
Because I'm one of
the commissioners

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.270
on the city's-- Tom Mara is too.

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:52.410
Seattle has 21
music commissioners

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:56.610
who do outreach programs
and talk to people

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.305
and find out what the challenges
are and try ultimately

00:43:59.305 --> 00:44:05.170
to put together work
plans that make music

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:07.580
a greater experience
for people in the city.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.020
And when you have
exactly those challenges,

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.520
the biggest one being
Seattle is very expensive

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.340
to live in-- so how
can an artist who's

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:23.350
struggling to have a
career live here and not

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.640
go to Portland or LA, which is
happening constantly right now?

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:34.200
I don't know exactly what the
solution will end up being.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.760
But I do know that
it's something

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.030
that we're having-- at
least everyone's having it--

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.110
but we're having
that conversation

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.770
and trying to pull in
our local politicians

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:49.440
to help find answers
to those things.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.816
And I spoke to the folks
at Nectar just last week

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.190
about what they're
going through.

00:44:55.190 --> 00:45:00.900
And it is interesting, because
that's not a super high density

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.800
neighborhood.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.390
But the complaints are actually
coming from Queen Anne.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.480
And what it sounded
like to me is

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.340
that that sound is
traveling in such a way,

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.360
probably with the wind
at times, where it's

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.290
hitting a small number
of people on Queen Anne,

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.520
where they're hearing,
like, sentences

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.170
during someone's sound check,
even, which is bizarre.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:27.330
But I don't know
what the solution is.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:30.860
But what I do know
is that I think

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.630
the city is a pretty great
city, with some big challenges,

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:37.810
for sure, that need
to be figured out.

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:40.800
I hate driving to
work every day.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.220
Do you drive in from
West Seattle every day?

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.790
It sucks.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:51.190
And you have to figure out how
to make the commute bearable.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:52.790
It's tough.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:56.320
But the city is a great city.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.730
And I believe that there are
solutions to every problem

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.440
so long as you want
to find the solutions.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:07.020
And it's our job
for sure at Sub-Pop

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:12.060
and for sure at other music
organizations in the city

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:16.062
to help find the answers
to those questions.

00:46:16.062 --> 00:46:17.770
And I don't know what
they are right now.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.790
But I will tell you that
I feel really determined

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.400
to help figure that out.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.015
And it needs to get figured out.

00:46:26.015 --> 00:46:30.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: One of the things
that I've personally been doing

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:33.250
and my friends have been doing
is reinforcing to our friends

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:37.790
and as we meet new people
is to go and see live music.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:39.820
And also buy the music.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:45.000
So going out and
seeing and supporting.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.780
People are doing that less.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.450
And as that dies off, then
the venues start to die off.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:52.990
And I was thinking about back
in the late '80s and early '90s,

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.350
that was one of the amazing
things about Seattle.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.320
You could roll in and see
Nirvana or Soundgarden,

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.750
Tad, et cetera, live onstage.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.140
And yeah, it was really loud.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.440
And probably people in
Queen Anne were pissed off.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.337
But that's what
created the culture

00:47:09.337 --> 00:47:10.670
and pulled through the cutlture.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:18.940
So go see live music
and buy the records.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.720
You started a new
label concept in 2007

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.460
called Hardly Arts
where you were

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:27.590
splitting profit versus
taking points on royalties.

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.700
Some of my favorite
artists-- Seapony,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:34.070
Taco Cat, Chastity Belt--
how is this business doing?

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.600
MEGAN JASPER: It's doing
really, really well.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:42.030
So we spent many years kind
of figuring it out and trying

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.410
to understand how it
would work as a company.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.960
It's nine years old now
and it's doing super well.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.360
And we were talking
about one of the bands

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.470
earlier at lunch,
which is Gazebos.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:57.570
They're one of my
favorites right now.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.710
But the thing that's
interesting that's happening

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.780
at Hardly Art-- and it was
not a conscious thing--

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.056
but there are so
many female artists.

00:48:05.056 --> 00:48:06.680
It kind of goes back
to the other stuff

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.530
we were talking about.

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:18.560
Chastity Belt, La Luz,
Gazebos, Taco Cat, and more--

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.720
and there's really
good stuff coming out

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.800
that I don't know that
I can talk about yet.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.090
But it's super exciting.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.540
And it's very
female-driven right now.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:32.500
And the women who
are in those bands

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:38.500
are extraordinary human beings.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.050
And they're making great music.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.030
So I have to say it makes
me crazy happy right now.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.440
The company's doing well.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: Maybe there's
something more attractive

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.660
or logical for a
female to say, I'd

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.330
rather have equitable
distribution

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:56.020
versus cutting some more
aggressive point deals.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.590
I would only speculate.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.060
I have a bunch of
other questions,

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.760
but I want to open
it up to the audience

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.950
so that you can ask
questions, if you have them.

00:49:13.359 --> 00:49:15.690
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.750
Actually, spent a little time
when I was little in Wooster.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.700
How do you say it?

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.560
MEGAN JASPER: I think you're
supposed to say Wuster,

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.592
but we all say Woosta.

00:49:24.592 --> 00:49:25.800
AUDIENCE: I was, like, three.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.740
My dad called it Ustern.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.360
And so I when I looked for
it later in life, I was like,

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.050
U-S-T-E-R-N. This
place doesn't exist.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:37.540
So my question
is, I write songs.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.680
But I have a day job
and I have a family.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.280
So I'm not going to tour for the
next 10 years and hit the road.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.310
So years ago, I used
Taxi for placing a song

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.080
in the little spot
on a TV thing.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.080
Is that still viable?

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.870
Should I just focus
on YouTube videos?

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:57.640
What's the thing that someone
who's not trying to be

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.240
in a band and tour , but
rather just write songs?

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.260
What's a good avenue
for that these days?

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.134
MEGAN JASPER: That's an
interesting question.

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:06.260
I think that probably,
it's a matter

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.090
of finding good publishing.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:12.670
Because if you can write music
and send it to some publishing

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:17.410
companies, a really
great publishing company

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:21.010
will be able to work
with you and then

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:26.020
maybe even engage another artist
in performing those songs.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:31.170
And I think if you can find
a setup like that, that

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:32.670
seems like the thing to do.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:36.090
But I would also say
that if that's not

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:39.750
possible or achievable right
now for whatever reason,

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:43.490
I would just keep posting
shit and making it available.

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.340
And I don't mean "shit."

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:52.110
But what I mean is, I think when
you put your stuff out there,

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:55.932
people will access it.

00:50:55.932 --> 00:50:57.390
And that's the most
important thing

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.630
is just getting it up and out.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.980
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to get your take

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.380
on what the role
of record labels

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.920
might be a generation
or two from now.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.430
So my first real introduction
to them was from a movie.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:15.800
It was Ray Charles biopic.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.500
And I watched the movie
and it seemed so beautiful.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.730
And it took me back to a
time that may or may not

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:24.310
have existed in reality, but it
made for a beautiful impression

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.960
of what the equation between
an artist and a record label

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.650
might be like.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:31.120
And it was a really
close, tight bond.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.670
I don't know how
things are today

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:35.155
or how things might
be in the future,

00:51:35.155 --> 00:51:36.780
but could you add
some context to that?

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.770
MEGAN JASPER: Yes.

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:42.910
I love that question, because I
think what you were connecting

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:48.660
with there, that that bond
and the understanding of who

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.200
someone is as far
as their art goes

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.910
is, if you can put that into
a mission statement, that's

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:03.270
what every label's mission
statement should be.

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:08.200
Because what that is, is
understanding who an artist is

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.470
and understanding how
to get their music out

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:14.680
into the world in a way that
works for them and connects

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.710
people with that
music-- connects

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:22.190
with people who will
be moved by that music.

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:29.110
So ultimately, that is what a
record label will always be,

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:33.670
because you're not a label
without doing the A&amp;R.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.680
You're not a label without
finding the artists.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.470
It's probably the
most important thing.

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:41.990
Because then you have
something to market.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:43.650
You have something to sell.

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:46.570
You have something to stream.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:52.050
However it is that
people consume music,

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.270
you don't do anything
without the music.

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:59.150
So all of that other stuff
is the stuff that changes.

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:06.340
And how you sell music, how you
listen to music, how you first

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.230
hear a song, that stuff
is always going to change.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:15.010
But finding the artist that you
can work with and work really

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:19.580
well with, that is what
a label should always be.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.090
And then how it goes out into
the world-- that can evolve.

00:53:26.218 --> 00:53:27.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.080
Are there any misconceptions
about the music industry,

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.550
and what might some of
the biggest ones be?

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.270
MEGAN JASPER: That show
"Vinyl" is probably

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:38.050
really good at spotlighting it.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:42.540
So are there are a lot of drugs?

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.970
Sometimes.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:46.630
Is everyone breaking
rules and doing

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:48.090
shit they shouldn't be doing?

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.180
Sometimes.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.920
But not to that degree.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.120
I would say the
biggest misconception

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:01.290
is that it's just fun, like rock
and roll times all the time.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.400
And that's not really the case.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:12.100
So for example, if I know I'm
going to have a long day and I

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:16.760
have meetings with artists and
their managers most of the day

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:22.110
and I really care about how
those meetings are going to go,

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.420
the last thing I'm going to do
is go out drinking until 2:00

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:30.010
in the morning the night
before, because I can't.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.540
I mean, I have to pull
it together and do right

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:39.440
by the company I work
for and the artist.

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:44.630
So it's not like-- it's just
not Partyville constantly.

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:47.600
I mean, it would be nice
if there was a little more

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.180
Partyville sometimes.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.530
But I feel like I beat
myself up over that stuff.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.690
Like, I kind of
want to be on and I

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:59.330
want to bring my best
to whatever it is.

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:01.300
And my coworkers
feel the same way.

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.830
I mean, maybe they're
a little bit--

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.770
I hope they're a little bit
looser than I am about it.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:11.300
But I think that's the
biggest misconception.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:17.820
And maybe even going back
to the whole female thing,

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:22.490
I think the role
of the woman who

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:26.060
was the A&amp;R person in
that first episode,

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:32.610
it was so bogus to me, because
I guess in our world-- and not

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:35.050
just Sub-Pop, but
like-minded labels-- there

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:38.490
are a lot of women in
positions of power.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.690
And they're not
just sandwich girls

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:47.830
or-- it's a funny portrayal.

00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:51.250
But I'd say those
are the biggest ones.

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.820
It's not party
time all the time.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:58.139
It's usually like, fucking
suck it up and work well time,

00:55:58.139 --> 00:56:00.430
and then maybe you can have
a glass of wine afterwards.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.300
AUDIENCE: I was
excited to hear you

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.250
talk about the singles
club, because I

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:09.860
remember that I was a kid.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:13.930
And just this idea
that, like, I'm

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:17.920
committing to buy everything
that Sub-Pop puts out

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.260
for the year before-- like,
silencing-- before I've even

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.390
heard it.

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:27.840
And you talked about what
the role of labels are

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.060
and that it's about discovery
and developing artists.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.790
And as you were
talking about it,

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:37.390
I was kind of thinking back,
that's exactly what the singles

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:38.650
club kind of was.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:40.885
It was like that
and record stores

00:56:40.885 --> 00:56:43.760
was where I would
go to find stuff.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.130
And I think about the shift
that's happened since then.

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:51.660
Like lots of record stores
have closed and everything.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.370
And social is now a big part
of how people find things.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:57:00.185
And I just was curious to hear
your thoughts on how Sub-Pop

00:57:00.185 --> 00:57:03.380
has weathered that
shift, I guess,

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:07.470
where it's like, how are
people finding things?

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:10.780
All the work you guys are
doing to develop artists--

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.650
how is that being
understood by people?

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:20.170
MEGAN JASPER: Well,
I think we are

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:23.720
lucky that we've been a company
for as long as we have been,

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:28.720
because like you said, you
would buy a record without even

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.500
knowing what the
music sounded like.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:36.250
I think at some point, Matador
Records, Merge Records,

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:39.550
whatever it is, it
becomes an endorsement.

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:44.880
And so I think we are lucky
in that a lot of people

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.010
will come to our website and
wonder what we're putting out

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.460
or what's next.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.950
And I think that's
something that we're

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:55.120
able to offer an
artist that's unique,

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.810
because we've been
around long enough.

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.760
We still try in all the same
ways to get the bands out

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.080
there is as much as we're able.

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.820
But ultimately, I think
what it comes down

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.830
to is being able to serve as
an endorsement in the same way

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.810
that Pitchfork does.

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:19.300
You'll go to Pitchfork
and wonder what is best

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.110
new music or best new track.

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:26.440
And I think labels serve
that same purpose, sort of,

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.925
in acting as a filter.

00:58:27.925 --> 00:58:30.460
Like, there's so
much stuff out there,

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.890
but here's a means
to filter that stuff.

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:37.920
And then maybe I
can hear something

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.461
that I wouldn't have
heard otherwise.

00:58:42.416 --> 00:58:43.790
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you, Megan.

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.410
We're out of time, but thank you
so much for coming and speaking

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:46.910
with us.

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:49.260
MEGAN JASPER: Thank you for
tolerating me and having me.

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:53.210
[APPLAUSE]
