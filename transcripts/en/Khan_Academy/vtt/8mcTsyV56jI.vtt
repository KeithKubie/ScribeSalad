00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.036
- [Voiceover] So I have two numbers here.

00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:05.076
The top number I have
one, two, three 10's,

00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:07.866
and I have one, two,
three, four, five ones.

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:10.535
Three 10's five ones or 35.

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:13.566
The second number here I
have two 10's, one, two,

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.135
and I have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven one's.

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:19.100
Two tens and seven ones.

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:20.681
Now what I want to do is

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:22.366
I want to add all of these numbers.

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.300
Well, I want to add these
two numbers together.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.702
I want to add 35 + 27,

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:28.117
or another way of thinking about it,

00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:30.618
I want to add, I want to add all

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.600
of these blocks together,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.336
I want to add all of
these blocks together.

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.571
So, let's start, let's start in the

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.641
ones place right over here.

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:41.766
So I have five one's here.

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.366
I have seven ones here.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.333
So if I add five ones to seven ones

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.233
how many ones am I going to get?

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:48.599
I'm gonna get 12 ones.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.266
I'm gonna get one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:58.266
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, and 12.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.713
Now you might notice a problem here.

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:04.738
'Cause if I take 5 + 7 I can't write

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:07.401
the number 12 in just the ones place.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.785
I just need to have one digit.

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:10.433
I can't have two digits there.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.500
So what can we do?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.633
Well, what we could do is take 10

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.166
of these ones and group them into a 10

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.500
and put them into the 10's place.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.733
What am I talking about?

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.168
Well what we could do is,

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:29.168
we could take one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:36.667
six, seven, eight, nine, and 10.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.348
So we could take these 10 right over here

00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:44.348
and group them together
into one of these bars.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:45.705
So let's do that.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.399
So let's group them together
into one of these bars,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.501
and then stick that bar in the 10's place.

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.566
So all I'm doing here...

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:57.902
All I am doing here
is, give me one second.

00:01:57.902 --> 00:01:59.491
Let's see, alright, whenever I...

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:02.119
So all I'm doing is I'm
taking these 10 right here,

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:06.717
and I'm regrouping them
into the 10's place.

00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:08.901
Sometimes this is called carrying.

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.129
So instead of writing 10 one's

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.833
I'm gonna write it as one 10.

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:16.137
So instead of writing it as ten ones,

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:18.171
I'm going to write it as one 10.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.951
So what does that do for us?

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.201
Well now I only have two
ones in the ones place.

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:25.673
I only have two ones in the ones place,

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:29.202
but now I have one more
10 in the 10's place,

00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:32.274
and I have one more 10 in the 10's place.

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:34.034
Sometimes people call this carrying

00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:36.935
because you see 5 + 7 is 12.

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:38.600
You write the two in the ones place

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.210
and you write the one in the 10's place.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.300
Twelve is one, two.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.066
Let me make it very clear.

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:49.142
5 + 7 = 12,

00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:54.268
and all we did is we wrote the one here,

00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:56.158
we wrote that in the tens place.

00:02:56.158 --> 00:02:57.215
We wrote it up here so that's why it

00:02:57.216 --> 00:02:59.933
kind of looks like you are carrying it.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.266
You are putting it at a higher place,

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.867
but you're just writing
this in the 10's place.

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.632
Up here was just an easy place to do it,

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:10.705
but remember all we did,
all we did there is we said

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:13.125
"Look, we have five we have
seven that would be 12."

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.300
"We can't write a 12 in the ones place."

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.801
"So, let's take 10 of those
12 and regroup them as a 10"

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:22.201
and then we have the two left over here,

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:26.637
but an easy way to think about
it is 5 + 7 = 12, one, two.

00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:29.337
And now we can add the 10's place.

00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:32.833
We have one 10 plus
three 10's plus two 10's.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:34.101
Well what's that going to be?

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:35.256
Well that's going to be six 10's!

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.566
1 + 3 + 2 = 6.

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:38.909
So let's do that.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.933
So we have, whoops wow that was...

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:43.707
That's not what I wanted to do.

00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.170
Let me, that was kinda, alright.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.666
(laughs)

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:54.637
We have one, we have two,

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:59.935
we have three,

00:04:01.217 --> 00:04:06.217
and we have four, and we have...

00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:08.004
My computer is slowing down.

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:13.004
Five, and we have six, six 10's.

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.766
Six 10's and so what does that...

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:20.933
What does that leave us with?

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:25.099
One plus three plus two 10's
is going to be six 10's.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.800
35 + 27 = 62.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.800
35 plus 27 is six 10's and two one's, 62.
