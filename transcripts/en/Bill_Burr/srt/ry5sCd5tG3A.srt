1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,550
Here's a good one. Should I kick
my neighbor's ass? Uh, yes, yes.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,940
Generally speaking, yes. Yes. Uh,
hey, bill loved the podcast. No. Yeah,

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,610
that's east coast. Oh, okay.
Uh, that's why people bitch.

4
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:17,570
Where the fuck is a podcast? I need
some advice on what to do about the gut.

5
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:19,700
This guy lives in a few
houses down from me.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm a third year college student and
I live at home. My parents moved, uh,

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,750
to go live in the state above mine.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,160
I mean north and I currently reside, uh,

9
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,260
alone while they are
trying to sell the house.

10
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:35,930
A few months ago I was driving home,

11
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:38,450
coming back from a gym and while
I was driving in my neighborhood,

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,230
I saw this guy step in the middle of
the road, about 20 yards from my car.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,770
He was yelling something at me, but
I couldn't hear what he was saying.

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,490
I slowed down and stopped my car right
in front of him and he came to my window

15
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:53,840
and told me to get out. I was totally
confused and thought I'd run over.

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,480
I thought I ran over his
cat or something. Also,

17
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:58,880
I think he just moved in because
I never seen the dude in my life.

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,240
So I rolled down the window and
ass. What did you say? He goes,

19
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:04,430
I'm going to kick your fucking
ass. Get out of the car.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,650
This guy's probably in his forties and
asked to be around five 10 is that,

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,770
is this me? I'm 250 pounds. That's not me.

22
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:17,771
I'm 21 six three 200 I do crossfit and
I wrestle occasionally at another gym I

23
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:23,390
go to. So I get out of the car and I'm
standing there trying to figure it out.

24
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:26,570
What the Hell is going on? The
guy starts moving towards me,

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,210
so I take the initiative
and take a step towards him.

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,160
We ended up being an inch from each other
and he's trying to do some alpha male

27
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,340
shit by just staring at me. But
I have the height advantage,

28
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:38,750
so I'm looking down at him.

29
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,680
At least 10 seconds go
by before the guy goes.

30
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,100
How fast do you think you were
going back there? I say, I dunno,

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,500
probably around 30 the speed
limit. My neighborhood is 20,

32
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,620
and I know I wasn't going that
much over it. Then he goes,

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,090
I'm not going to have my children playing
in the yard if I know assholes like

34
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:02,770
you are driving like that in
the neighborhood after. Uh,

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,950
he said that I saw his wife and son were
a little off to the side of the road.

36
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,970
Once the word asshole left his
mouse, I was fucking pissed.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,780
I wanted to just tackle the Dick and put
him to sleep in front of his wife and

38
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:15,950
kid to teach them a lesson,

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,690
but I pussied out and just apologize to
them and said that I was really Sally,

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,280
sorry. And it wouldn't happen again.

41
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,900
The guy then gives me a fucking little
smirk and turns around and says while

42
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:30,670
walking away with his back, turn it
better not or you know what will happen.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,470
Ah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,710
You definitely should have kicked his
ass. You should have kicked his ass. Yeah.

45
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,210
What a fuck did you realize? What a
good do you realize what this kid did?

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,070
He's such a fucking gentleman.

47
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:47,870
He could have kicked the
fucking shit out of this guy.

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,660
He saw his wife and kid there. It
would've been a masculinity. Yeah.

49
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,010
His Dad is superman. He sits there. You
know what is? It's that little smirk.

50
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,970
Yeah, that fucking smart guy. But that
Khan steals from work. Yeah, I bet he,

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,450
sorry dude. That's the first time
I, I literally had to walk away.

52
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,200
You fucking cunt. Yeah.

53
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,780
He should have kicked that guy's
ass. But it's a good cause.

54
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,160
It's good that you didn't do it,

55
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,740
but because you weren't the
bigger person as they say.

56
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,630
But he definitely has it come in.

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,730
Then he writes snap to do that
shit. I wanted to explode.

58
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,860
I mean the guy totally disrespect me,

59
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,620
so I get in my car and drive
off end of the story wrong.

60
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,910
I couldn't get this fucking
guy out of my head. I t dude,

61
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:27,970
I can't get out of my head.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm going to actually fantasize
that I was there and he did that.

63
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,610
What I would want to do, I've already,
you know what I would fucking do?

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,420
I would wait till he was alone.
Don't do this shit. Don't do this,

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,440
but I know what you just want to get,
get the guy alone and be like, Hey,

66
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,170
what are you going to do now?
Huh? What are you going to do now?

67
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,930
Just get right in his fucking
grill and have him back down. Yeah.

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,600
Or I would almost just say
the guy say, hey listen man,

69
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,760
just call them over the
car and just say, listen,

70
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,090
I just wanted you to know the other day
that if I wanted to I could have fucking

71
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,400
stuffed you in my trunk.

72
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,870
Tied you up like a fucking pressel and
ass rates you in front of your fucking

73
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:11,170
wife. But I chose not to. Okay.

74
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,980
Cause I didn't want your son to know
what a little fucking f I can't say it.

75
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,090
Pussy. Yeah, he has for it. That
wouldn't have been homophobic either.

76
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,790
I wouldn't be me talking about gay
people. That's such a fucking pussy move.

77
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,880
Yeah. And if for some reason
but, but I'm putting up no,

78
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:35,350
then that's what you say. Maybe do
like Colombo to say. Listen man,

79
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,820
I got to ask you something cause I'm
six foot three, I crossfit. I wrestle.

80
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,260
Okay. And just looking at you. I
know I could tie into a pretzel.

81
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,040
I know I could do it if I want
to, but the confidence you had,

82
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,340
I just want to know what is
your background. You know,

83
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,350
cause you know I'm a real
competitive guy. You know,

84
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,360
if you've got some sort
of martial arts training,

85
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,950
you know I would love to
have you once we didn't.

86
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:59,740
You come down to the gym sometime
when your wife and kid aren't there.

87
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:03,550
So I don't have to feel guilty when I
fuck you up and close both of your eyes

88
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,100
with this one and his friend over here.

89
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,220
What does the rest of the thing
say? I don't even need to read it.

90
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,530
It's not a but it's not
over though. I know.

91
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,330
Because this is what's happening now.

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,080
This is what happens when you do
the right thing in life. Okay?

93
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,690
When you know you, it eats away
at you. You have to make peace.

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,520
You have to make peace and you've got to
tell yourself the lie that someday this

95
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,150
guy's going to get his. And you know
what? He doesn't guys like this.

96
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,270
Don't get theirs. Oh, that's
smart. I see this kid,

97
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,970
this kid really painted a fucking
picture. I can. This is driving me nuts.

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,670
He goes, I couldn't get
this guy out of my head.

99
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:45,640
A week went by and I was still
thinking about that asshole too.

100
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,470
I would think about this
guy. 20 years from now,

101
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,580
two weeks later I was driving home from
school and I see the guy rolling his

102
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,210
garbage can out to the curb.

103
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,180
I slow down to fucking under 20 and I
know this because I looked down at my

104
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,870
spit, Thomas pedometer. I
pretend to stare the guy down,

105
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:07,250
so I look at him and he looks
at me and yell, slowdown.

106
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,290
Wow. Now when he said
that I am fucking raging,

107
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,640
I wanted to stop my car and do some
ground and pound on his face. Yeah.

108
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,620
This kid knows what he's doing.

109
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,910
This isn't wrestling like
this kid's doing UFC shit,

110
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,270
but did I know I just drove off like a
fag the next day I talked to my friend

111
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:26,864
about it,

112
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,890
about what had happened and he said
that this guy said the same shit to him.

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,070
If he said it, he would have put
them on his ass. I know you do.

114
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,770
You know what I would've
done? He told me that, uh,

115
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,810
if he says he's going to kick your ass,

116
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,060
then that's a threat so
you can defend yourself.

117
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,170
Don't listen to your dumb friend.
He's saying you won't get arrested.

118
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,110
So a few months have passed and I'm still
thinking about this asshole every time

119
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:53,070
I drive by his house. Fast
forward, uh, two yesterday and,

120
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,040
um, I'm biking in my neighborhood.

121
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,830
Let's do an iHeart and I
hear a honk from behind me.

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,430
So I pull my bike over to the side of the
road and it's none other than the same

123
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:06,900
dude in his Ford F150 driving along and
he looks at me and gives me the middle

124
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,940
fucking finger. Wow.

125
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,990
Now granted I was in the middle of the
road and didn't hear the guy coming

126
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:16,590
because I was listening to music, but
still the middle finger. So I bike home,

127
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,440
take a shower and try to convince
myself to walk over to dude's house and

128
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,450
confront him. But after a
couple minutes of pacing,

129
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,740
I just decided to wait it out until the
asshole does one more thing. I mean,

130
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:29,160
I don't want to get arrested. So my
question is what the hell should I do?

131
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,350
I mean, every time I
drive by this guy's house,

132
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,950
now I want to fucking veer off the road
and ran my car into the middle of his

133
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:38,430
living room. Any advice would be good. A,

134
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:42,360
all of my friends think I should go over
there, but I want a second opinion. Um,

135
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,270
you can't do anything to this guy unless
he puts his hands on you unless he puts

136
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:51,100
his hands on you. This is
just one of these things,

137
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:56,050
but you can do to him what he's doing
to you. This guy has an insane temper.

138
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,990
So, uh, you know, I'm not advocating
legally, so you don't do this,

139
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:06,680
but like, um, I don't,

140
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,180
I don't what I would next time, you know,

141
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,510
if you see him out in the yard or
something, this is what you do.

142
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,130
I have a great idea. Do you have any
friends who are really good mechanically?

143
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,640
Um, why don't you take
your credit card out,

144
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,980
go down to the fucking
auto store or whatever.

145
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,150
I'll go online and buy like one of
those fucking train horns and have it

146
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,530
installed in your car and next
time you drive down the street,

147
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,190
just be sort of zigzagging down the
street just to get this guy to be fucking,

148
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,180
you know, getting all
like, Bro, what the fuck?

149
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,640
And the second he starts screaming,

150
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,410
you lay on that fucking horn as loud as
humanly possible and you blow out his

151
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:45,170
ear drums. That's what
I would, but then again,

152
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
then the no one do shit like this.

153
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,920
He would say that I have
permanent hearing damage.

154
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,690
You know what I think you should do?

155
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,010
Maybe because I'm a female and I'm
all about the cycle of revenge. Okay.

156
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,190
Psychological warfare. What
should you, what should he do?

157
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,930
I think when the husband is not
home, I don't know if how he,

158
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,000
if he knows his schedule,

159
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,010
whatever he needs to go over there when
the wife is at home and be like, listen,

160
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,490
you know, I'm so sorry about that time
that I was speeding. I really, you know,

161
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,350
but your, your husband seems really upset.

162
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,110
I'm really not trying to be like that.
I would never do anything like that.

163
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:16,710
And women are like, oh no, no, no.
Cause she knows her husband is a psycho.

164
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,380
Right. And like, I mean she could
turn around and be like, yeah,

165
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,310
you shouldn't do that either.

166
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,390
But I have a feeling she's not like that
and he can just go over and just make

167
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,750
nice and be like the sweet
kid that's helping out or oh,

168
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:31,280
do you need me to take the bowels
out? And then, but then the,

169
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:34,200
I feel like maybe that would fuck with
the husband and he's like sitting there

170
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,110
sipping tea with the wife
and Oh look who came over.

171
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:40,830
He just wanted to apologize in person.
And you know, I dunno. I Dunno.

172
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,420
There's there's, and then
fuck the wife. You No,

173
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,110
no, no. He should fuck his wife.

174
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,560
He should fucking play with
his kid in the backyard.

175
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,330
Like the toss the
football around with him.

176
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,510
Be More like rather he never had
nothing like just start keeping him in a

177
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,620
finger. Listen, this is the deal. All
you gotta do is just give him the finger,

178
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,590
give him the finger right back. Cause uh,

179
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,650
this guy thinks you're a bitch right
now. So all you got to do is, you know,

180
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,160
you can just yell back. Just say,
you know, just give them the finger,

181
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:16,540
yell back at him when he's in the
driveway. I would like swerve,

182
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,830
add him and then swerve back.
Just fuck with the guy. He's an,

183
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,950
I mean just do that once because the
next time you might have like a video

184
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:28,270
camera, but um, uh, I,

185
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,580
I just don't wanna get any, I
don't get any. You know what?

186
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,660
If I was in that situation, uh, dude,
you know what I would dope. Yeah.

187
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
Oh Monday morning quarterback.

188
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,900
Look while I was in that situation
with that other guy, right? Yeah.

189
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,040
At the last place we lived and I didn't
fuck with him cause he was an old guy.

190
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:46,910
I just didn't fuck with him.

191
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,060
And now we find out he has dementia
and all this shit. So I'm cite,

192
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,680
I never yelled at the guy, you know
what you do now. You know, what's,

193
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,320
what really diffuses angry guys like
that or it makes them even more angry.

194
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,330
It's just laugh at him. Just keep
laughing at him, laugh at him,

195
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:06,440
give him the finger and just keep
calling him tough guy. All right.

196
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,850
They're tough guy. Anything do
anything. You just keep calling them?

197
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:13,520
Anything that is remotely all
right there, Chuck Norris.

198
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:18,500
Anything you want to say to this guy
that will bait him into hitting you?

199
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,240
This is a really a fuck.

200
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:24,170
This is a great question and I don't
want to get in trouble if some shit goes

201
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:28,700
down so you shouldn't do
anything, sir. Wink, wink, wink.

202
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,040
Um, this guy's such a dick.
I, I, I always say, you know,

203
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,870
fucking with somebody
whose car is like a pussy.

204
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:39,880
Move with this guy is such a
dick and he has like such a, uh,

205
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,860
oh my God dude.

206
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:46,100
How many times you thought about throat
to choke slam and that guy ran into the

207
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:50,740
hood of your car repeatedly when
you said, I can step into my trunk.

208
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,790
Veggie like a Pretzel and ass
rape and your boy, nobody.

209
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,090
If you just said it really calmly,

210
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,180
if you set a comedy with
sort of a smile on your face,

211
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,460
you'll come off like a fucking
maniac. Yeah, that's true.

212
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,190
If you scream that at somebody,
you just sound like you're quoting,

213
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:06,220
like you know how Cogan or something.
Right? Let me tell you something, brother.

214
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,530
Come to Saturday. I'm going to
bet you in a pretzel asked for AP.
