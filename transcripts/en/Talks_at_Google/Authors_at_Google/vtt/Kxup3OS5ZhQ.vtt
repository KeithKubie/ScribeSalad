00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.430
&gt;&gt; SON: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for
coming out to Authors at Google. My name is

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.589
Eugene Son. And before we begin, I’d like
to extend a special thank you to everyone

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.950
who made this possible. A lot of work goes
into setting this up so I really appreciate

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.160
that. It is my pleasure to bring to Google
Dr. Tim Keller. For those of you who don’t

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.350
know his background, he was raised in Lehigh
Valley, Pennsylvania; educated at Bucknell

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:38.101
University, attended Gordon-Conwell and Westminster
Theological Seminary. In 1989, Dr. Keller

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:43.140
founded Redeemer Presbyterian Church located
in Manhattan. Today, he’s got a congregation

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.630
of over 5,000 people. He has also helped start
over a hundred other churches worldwide. Last

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.370
night, Dr. Keller was at UC Berkeley promoting
his new book, The Reason for God: Belief in

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.500
an Age of Skepticism. And he addresses a wide
audience whether they’d be agnostics, atheists,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.590
believers in mind, and he tackles some really
difficult issues such as: Why is there suffering

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.329
in this world? How can a loving god send people
to hell? How can there be one right religion

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.920
while all the others are wrong?” So with
that being said, I think we’re going to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.770
have a great conversation. We’re going to
be having a Q and A session afterwards. Please

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.520
use the mike to my left and we’ll be taking
questions from there. And without further

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:41.439
ado, I’d like to introduce Dr. Tim Keller.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Thank you. I’m going to stay

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.380
here. Thank you. Though I have not--thank
you, Eugene. I don’t have any idea why any

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.289
of you would know anything about my background.
Eugene said, if--for those of you who don’t

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.969
know my background, I think that had to be
all of you. I mean, why would anybody know

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:59.430
it? Even my children don’t really know it.
So I want to talk to you about the reason--the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.219
reasoning behind belief in God, or the reasoning
the leads to belief in God. I am not--I can’t

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:13.610
possibly cover it in say 25, 30 minutes. My
conscience is clear because there is the book.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.440
In other words, what I say to you here is
going to be sketchy. If anything I say really

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.230
engages you, I won’t be--I won’t feel
guilty because I can always say, read the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.610
rest of it in the book. I certainly can’t
really give good answers to this question

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.760
in a talk, but I think I--I think I addressed
it a lot better in the book were I had a little

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.921
bit more time. But the question is: What is
the reasoning that leads to belief in God?

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:42.250
And I'd like to deal with that in the three
headings: Why the reasons for God are important,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.380
how the reasons for God work, and what the
reasons for God are. Okay? First, why the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.450
reasons for God are important; why should
you even be here? In fact I don’t know why

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.920
you’re here, but I’ll tell you why you
ought to be here, okay? If you have a kind

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.260
of sound, firm skepticism, and you really
don’t believe in God, you really need to

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.230
know this, what I’m about to tell you, and
here’s the reason why: When I was your age--I’m

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.000
looking out there--when I was your age, which
is a long time ago, everybody knew that the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.760
more technologically advanced the society
got, the less religious they'd get. That’s

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.590
what everybody thought they knew. And the
more economically developed, the more educated

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.610
people got, the more religion was going to
sort of thin out and the idea of a god and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.060
truth and miracles was going to sort of die
out. Not--hardly anybody believes that anymore

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.960
because, really, that’s not what's happening.
Instead, robust, orthodox faith in God has

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.450
gotten stronger in the world. It has gotten
stronger in America. Secular thought has also

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.860
increased, so we have a more polarized society
now. But, you know, last week, the Pew Foundation

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.720
took out, sent out its latest survey of the
religious life of people in America and now

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.650
evangelical Pentecostals is largest single
category, bigger than mainline Protestants,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.240
bigger than Catholics. That would never--I
can’t imagine that 30 years ago. Meanwhile,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.700
in the rest of the world, to keep some things
in mind, Africa had gone from 9% to 55% Christian

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.379
in the last hundred years. Korea went from
about 1% to 40% Christian in the hundred years

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.159
while Korea was getting more technologically
advanced. The same thing has basically happened

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:31.639
for China. There are more Christians in China
now than there are on America, and this has

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.460
been happening even as science has advanced.
So the old idea that somehow orthodox religion

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.310
is sort of going to go away, no. It isn’t.
It’s going to be here, which means the only

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.169
way we’re going to get along is we got to
be able to get sympathetically into one other's

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.890
shoes. So if you don’t believe in God, you
need to--you need to try to understand why

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.699
anybody does or we're not going to be able
to work in a pluralistic society. You know,

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:07.979
the new atheist books, Mr. Dawkins, Mr. Hitchens
and company, when they say religion is bad

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.050
in those books, that’s not a new thesis.
A lot of people have been saying that for

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.470
a long time. What is kind of new about the
books is they don’t just say religion is

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:25.430
bad, they say respect for religion is bad.
And if you counsel one section of your population

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.169
to belittle and disdain and do nothing, you
know, shows no respect for the beliefs of

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.599
this group of people, beliefs that give them
great joy and meaning in life. If you counsel

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.620
one group of people to despise and do nothing
to try to understand this group of people,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.259
that is a recipe for social disaster if anybody
actually takes the advice. Now, if you are

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:52.259
a believer in God, you need to know the reasons
for God, and here’s the reasons why. Doubt.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:58.289
You’ve got doubts. Don’t tell me you don’t.
I know you may come from a church that says,

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:06.240
oh, no, doubt, we don't doubt, we believe.
Well, if you don’t deal with your own doubts

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.009
and say, okay, in light of this doubt, why
do I believe? You know, why do I believe Christianity?

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.169
Why do I believe in God, or whatever? If you
don’t let your doubts drive you to ask those

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.389
questions, your faith will never get strong.
Doubts, dealing with doubts honestly is the

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.449
best possible way to develop a faith that
can last in the face of anything. So you need

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.639
to look at the reasoning for God if you’re
a believer in God. You need to look at the

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.270
reasoning for God if you’re not a believer
in God. And, actually, if you--but most of

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.150
the people that I know in this country, at
least, really are kind of ambivalent. They--your

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.789
relationship with belief in God is a really
weird one. Sometimes, you do; sometimes, you

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.120
don’t. Sometimes, you do more; sometimes,
you do less. And you particularly need to

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:55.409
hear this. Second point, how do the reasons
for God work? Important. There are three basic

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:01.610
kinds of reasons that all people who believe
believe and for which all people who disbelieve

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.020
disbelieve. If you disbelieve in God or you
believe in God, it’s because of all three

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.080
of these kinds of reasons. The first kind
are intellectual reasons. In other words,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.729
you read the arguments for the existence of
God or you read the objections to God or Christianity,

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.050
we'll say--and I’m speaking as a Christian.
That’s why whenever I go into a particular

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.370
religion, I'm always going to think of Christianity
here. And if you think the arguments are compelling,

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.789
you believe. If you think the arguments don’t--aren’t
compelling, you don’t believe. So there’s

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:35.260
the intellectual; you might call reasoning
proper. Secondly, though, you have personal

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.240
reasons. Nobody believes in God or disbelieves
strictly for intellectual rational reasons.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.610
There’s always personal reasons. And here’s
what’s interesting. Some people have horrible

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.990
bad experiences, tragedies and difficulties,
and disappointments. And some people interpret

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:59.539
that as meaning I really need God in my life,
I need something to help me get through this.

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:03.400
And other people have the very same experiences
and they interpret this meaning, I don’t

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.009
need a god who lets stuff like this happen.
Other people get very successful. For example,

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:17.479
they come to work for Google and they’re
happy, and, like, the toilet seats are heated.

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:25.230
How would I know that? And--somebody told
me; I didn’t believe them. So you’re happy;

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:31.169
things are doing well in life. So some people
interpret success in life this way: They say,

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:35.630
this means I don’t really need God. And
other people interpret success in life as

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.919
saying, you know, I’m happy--I’m successful
and I’m still empty. So there’s always

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.970
interpreted experience, interpreted personal
experiences, a set of reasons why some people

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:51.240
believe in God or not, intellectual reasons
why some people believe in God or not; and,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.410
lastly, there’s social reasons. Now, there’s
a whole field of--the whole discipline called

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:03.430
the sociology of knowledge. And the sociology
of knowledge says that basically you tend

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.660
to find plausible, most plausible, the beliefs
of people that you want to be--you want them

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.220
to like you, or the people that you need and
people that you're dependent on, people who

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.590
are in the community you’re in or want to
be part of--their beliefs tend to be more

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.029
plausible than the beliefs of people who are
in communities you don’t like or aren’t

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:25.649
interested in and don’t want to be part
of. So, to a great degree, you believe what

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:30.410
you believe because of the social support,
and I think most of us have to be honest about

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.560
this. If you once believed in God and kind
of lost your belief, to some degree, that

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.589
happened because a lot of the people that
you wanted to like you were also being skeptical

00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:45.720
and sophisticated and making jokes about it.
Or if you move from belief, or pardon me,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.970
non-belief to robust belief in God, very often,
it’s because you’ve found a circle of

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.410
people that you really like and admire and
you can identify with and you’d like to

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:59.090
be liked, and they believed. But what you
can’t do is reduce belief or non-belief

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.650
to just one of those three, and people always
do it. It’s always all three. I'm going

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:10.350
to show you what I mean. Very often, secular,
non-believing people, non-believing in god,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:16.910
will say to me, "Yet, Christian minister,
you think you got the truth, you think Christianity

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:22.079
is the truth. If you were born in Madagascar,
you wouldn’t even be a Christian." Okay.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:29.300
So I sat down and I said, "What is this? What
is the point of this?" And here’s what he’s

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.529
saying: He’s saying, "My understanding of
God is based on rationality. I’ve thought

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:41.399
it out. But your belief is socially and culturally
constructed, totally. You’re only a Christian

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:45.990
because you were raised here, okay, not Madagascar."
But, see, what’s the comeback? The comeback

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.589
is--here’s a person that says, "I’m a
secular person who believes that religion

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:53.350
is, you know, all religions are relative,
and you’re this Christian. If you were born

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.730
in Madagascar, you wouldn’t be a Christian."
And the comeback is, yet, if you were born

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:02.509
in Madagascar, you wouldn’t be a secular
relativist. Does that mean that your position

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:09.610
is all socially constructed? "Oh, no, no."
Yes and no. To some degree, the reason he

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.911
doesn’t believe is because his belief was
somewhat, somehow socially supported but it’s

00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:22.019
not totally. It’s also reason. It’s all
three. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s disdainful.

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:27.670
It’s almost exploitative to say, "My position
is based only on reasoning and your position

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.490
is based on, you know, cultural and personal
issues." That’s not true. And by the way,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.139
if you’re a Christian, you must never think
that it’s all a matter of reason. If you’re

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:39.880
a Christian, you believe that the human being,
we as human beings are made in the image of

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.630
God, all of us, not just our reason, our emotion,
you know, our social aspect, our emotional

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.009
aspect, our intellectual aspect. We’re all
in the image of God, and all those things

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:55.420
have to play a role on belief. Now, lastly,
but this, you know, the main event. What are

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:01.660
the reasons for God? And I would say that
there’s a lot of ways of stacking this,

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:09.259
but I would like to suggest to you that, by
and large, reasoning ends with belief in God,

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:15.829
moves up a ladder, and I’m going to suggest
three rungs. Now, I’m not saying that everybody

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:20.980
actually who comes to believe in God moves
along the ladder in exactly these ways. But

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.540
I would say there’s a lot of ways of stacking
all of the things that happen. Here’s how

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.191
I’m going to do it. I think, at least, it's
a way of making sense of it. The first rung

00:12:28.191 --> 00:12:35.399
of the ladder is you come to see that disbelief
in God takes as much faith as belief in God.

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:39.500
That’s the first rung. It takes as much
faith to disbelieve in God as to believe.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:45.500
That’s the first rung. The second rung is
it takes more of a leap of faith, when you

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.089
come to see, it takes more of a leap of faith
in the dark to disbelieve in God than to believe

00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:55.690
in God. And the third rung of the ladder is
you come to realize that whereas you can reason

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.660
to a point of probability, it takes personal
commitment to get to certainty. And if you

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:06.360
move up those three rungs, you believe in
God. Let me show how that works. The first

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.829
rung--and, by the way, there’s a lot in
here so that’s why I feel like if anything

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:16.381
I’m saying intrigues you at all, I suggest
get the book. And I’m really saying that

00:13:16.381 --> 00:13:18.931
not as an author who's trying to sell books
but as a minister who’s trying to get a

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:26.329
message across. You can believe that or not.
You can be cynical or not. And I hope I mean

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:32.220
right. I mean, I hope that’s really what
I--I hope that’s my motive. I think it is.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.270
So if you can possibly get the book because
I have a feeling what I’m going to say in

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:43.009
the next 15 minutes is too short. Do so. Now,
the first rung is this: It takes more--it

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:49.160
takes as much faith, excuse me, to believe,
to disbelieve in God as to believe. How do

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.560
I back that up? Well, here’s how: All of
the arguments that purport to prove there

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.420
is no god fall flat. See, all the arguments
that you’ve ever heard that say, "There

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:07.290
can’t be a god or even Christianity can’t
be true," if any of those stood up, they need

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.449
to be say, "Christianity can’t be true.
God can’t be real." But if none of them

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:16.990
stand up, if there’s no way to prove there
is no God, and therefore, there is a god,

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.720
then to believe that there’s no God is an
act of faith. Are you following me? Let me

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.330
show you some of the arguments. Here are the
arguments that are usually brought up. They

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.370
say, "This is why there really couldn’t
be a god." The first one, the main one, is

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.570
the argument from evil and suffering. And
that argument goes like this: Look at all

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:42.899
the senseless, pointless evil in the world.
Okay? See it? Now, given that senseless, pointless

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:50.810
evil, there may be a god who’s good but
not powerful enough to stop it, or there may

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:57.620
be a god who is all powerful enough but not
good enough to want to stop it. But given

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.879
evil and suffering in the world, all that
pointless, senseless evil and suffering, there

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:05.490
can’t be an all-good and all-powerful god
or he would stop it; and, therefore, the all-good,

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:10.920
all-powerful traditional god in the Bible
can’t exist. David Hume, Discourses on Natural

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.980
Religion, 18th century. It doesn’t work.
There’s a guy named William Osteen who is

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.470
one of the leading philosophers today from
Syracuse University who recently wrote: The

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.689
effort to demonstrate that evil disproves
God is now acknowledge on almost all sides

00:15:27.689 --> 00:15:32.680
in philosophy as completely bankrupt. Now,
here’s what he means by this. And I shudder

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.089
to say this to you because if any of you actually
are going through some real suffering, it’s

00:15:37.089 --> 00:15:40.290
not a philosophical issue for you; it’s
a personal issue. But I would just hope that

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.829
you don’t see this as cold comfort. For
many people, it’s philosophical; and people

00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:49.210
say, "How could you believe in a god with
all these senseless, pointless evil?" Here’s

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.329
what the philosophers have been saying for
the last 20 years. This is the reason why

00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:56.529
there hasn’t been a major philosophical
work trying to disprove the existence of God

00:15:56.529 --> 00:16:01.540
on the basis of evil and suffering since 1982.
Because as William Osteen says, in the philosophical

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.209
world, it’s just not washing, and here’s
why: When you say there can’t be a god because

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:11.149
of all the senseless, pointless evil out there,
here’s the question: How do you know it’s

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:16.680
senseless? How do you know there’s no good
reason for it? The only answer is, "Well,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.959
I can’t think of any good reason." Oh, okay.
So here’s your premise. Because I can’t

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:26.329
think of any good reason why God would allow
evil and suffering to continue, therefore,

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:32.699
there can’t be any. No, why would that be?
And that’s the reason why if you’ve got

00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:37.350
a god big and powerful enough to be mad at
for evil and suffering, and at the very same

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.170
moment, you’ve got a god big and powerful
enough to have reasons for allowing it to

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.540
continue that you can’t think of. You can’t
have it both ways. And that’s the reason

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.959
why in the philosophical circles, the argument
that says, "We can disprove God with evil

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:53.040
and suffering has fallen flat." And, by the
way, if there’s anybody saying, "It’s

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:59.730
not a philosophical thing for me; it’s a
personal thing--I have this horrible stuff

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.410
in my life and that’s the reason why I can’t
believe in God"; but I told you a minute ago,

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.870
there are plenty of people who had everything
and had every bit as much suffering as you,

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:13.429
and they’ve let that turn them toward God.
So personal suffering, experiences of suffering,

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:17.100
the philosophical question of suffering doesn’t
disprove the existence of God. It doesn’t

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.270
work. Okay. Well, what about this? This is
what I would call the Hitchens’ argument

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.959
against the reality of God. I know he was
here at one point, right? And this argument

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:32.260
goes like this: If there really was a god,
how could his believers have done so much

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.530
evil in the history of the world? If there
really is a god, why is it that so much of

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:43.790
the violence and oppression and injustice
in history, why is it have been perpetrated

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:48.240
by the people who believe in God, in the name
of God? See, that’s the argument. But here’s

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.520
the problem with that argument. It’s a pretty
big one. There must be something in the human

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:02.559
heart that is so prone to violence and oppression
that it can actually twist any world view,

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:09.669
any philosophy, any state of belief which
regard to God into violence. So, for example,

00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:17.740
Buddhism and Shinto, out of that soil grew
the Japanese militarism of the World War II,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.160
out of Christian soil grows everything from
the Crusades in the 11th and 12th century

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:30.029
down to today, people shooting abortion doctors.
Out of Islam comes global terrorism. But out

00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:34.616
of atheism--is that the third time I've done
that or the second time? It’s going to be

00:18:34.616 --> 00:18:43.880
on the Internet.
Look at atheism, look at Stalin, look at Cambodia,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:54.630
look at the Khmer Rouge. There’s a guy named
Milosz, who’s the Polish--famous Polish

00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:00.730
poet, and he has a fascinating little essay
called, “The Discreet Charms of Nihilism.”

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:05.300
Now, there’s a title for you, The Discreet
Charms of Nihilism. And, in it, he pointed

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:11.020
something out. He says, “If you believe
there’s a god, it’s fairly easy to twist

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.570
that belief into violence because you can
say, 'I have the truth, you don’t. I’m

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.750
a better person, you are an inferior kind
of person.' But, he says--he says, “If you

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.990
don’t believe in God,” he says, “I’ve
seen that be a warrant for violence. I’ve

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:28.890
seen that be fruitful soil or I’ve seen
that twisted.” You know why? He says, “If

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.580
you’re an atheist and you can say if I can
get away with something in this life, I get

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:39.270
away with it.” If I can kill this people
over here and I can get away with it, there

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:44.020
is no Judgment Day, there is no punishment
in the after life." He said that, “I’ve

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:49.750
seen that.” Now, you know what that means?
I don’t want as a Christian, just because

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:55.510
some people have twisted Christianity into
a warrant for violence, I don’t want to

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:00.390
say to you, if you’re an Atheist, well,
look at what Czeslaw Milosz says. Look at

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.980
what he says. He says, “He has seen atheism
twisted into violence.” So what--you can

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.270
twist anything into violence, non-belief and
belief. And you know what this means, it’s

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:15.210
a tie. It’s not--it does not disapprove
God; it doesn’t just prove Atheism. I’m

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.551
not going to say, “Oh, atheism is stupid,
look at that, look at Stalin"; I don’t want

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.980
you to say, look at Christianity, it's stupid,
look at the Crusades.” Let’s just admit

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.740
it’s a tie. And let's admit it doesn’t
really argue against or for God. It certainly

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.710
doesn’t disprove God. Let me give you a
third--yeah, I have for third--a third argument

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:37.960
against the existence of God. Well, no, I’ll
give you--I'll give this one. A third argument

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:43.909
is not that you can’t--there can’t be
a god. There’s an argument I would call

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:48.410
you can’t know there’s a god. There’s
a lot of folks who would say, look, I don’t

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:58.840
know if there’s a god or not, but nobody
can know, nobody can know. Lesslie Newbigin

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.600
has a great passage in one of his books--he's
a British scholar--in which he says here’s

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.710
how agnostics likes to argue, they--they use
the illustration of the elephant and the blind

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.899
man. Have you heard that illustration? Here
are six blind men. They come upon an elephant.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:18.940
And everyone grabs the elephant at a different
place. And one blind man is holding on to

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:24.670
the trunk and says, “Oh, elephants are kind
of long and flexible.” And another guy has

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:31.010
hold of the leg and says, “That’s not
true at all. Elephants are kind of thick and

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:37.049
stiff and stumpy.” And the illustration
goes that every one of the blind men thinks

00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:41.880
they kind of know the whole elephant, but
every one on the blind men basically only,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.280
in a sense, can sense part of the truth and
nobody can sense the whole truth. And so,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.559
that’s like the religions of the world.
Every religion has a little bit of wisdom,

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:55.481
but the fact is nobody has the truth. Nobody
can see the whole picture. Nobody can say,

00:21:55.481 --> 00:22:01.350
“I know God truly.” And Lesslie Newbigin
has a great spot where he talks about--he

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.300
says it like this, he says, this is a quote,
“In the famous story of the blind men and

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.370
the elephant, so often quoted in the interest
of religious agnosticism, the real point of

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.660
the story is constantly overlooked. The story
is told from the point of view of someone

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:20.320
who is not blind, but can see what the blind
men are unable to grasp; that is the full

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:29.289
reality of the elephant. And only the one
who sees the whole elephant can know that

00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:32.880
all the blind men are blind.” Do you see
what he’s saying? The only way you could

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.330
know that all the blind men only sense part
of the elephant is if you think you’re not

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:42.070
blind. You'd only tell the story from the
standpoint of someone who is not blind. And

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.950
so, he comes back and he says, “What this
means then is that there is an appearance

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.090
of humility and a protestation that the truth
is much greater than anyone of us can grasp.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.510
But if this is used to invalidate all claims
to discern the truth, it is in fact an arrogant

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.610
claim with the kind of knowledge which is
superior that you have just said, no religion

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:06.980
has," you follow that? To say, I don’t know
which religion is true is an act of humility.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.590
To say, none of the religions have the truth.
No one can be sure there's a god is actually

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.110
to assume you have the kind of knowledge,
you just said no other person, no other religion

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:21.360
has; how dare you? See, it’s a kind of arrogant
thing to say nobody can know the truth because

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.690
it’s a universal truth claim. Nobody can
make universal truth claims. That is a universal

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:29.610
truth claim. Nobody can see the whole truth.
You couldn’t know that unless you think

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.539
you see the whole truth. And, therefore, you’re
doing the very thing you say religious people

00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:38.430
shouldn’t say. So does that disprove god
now? Does that even prove that you can’t

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:44.289
know God? Of course not, you undermine yourself.
But, lastly, the main thing I’ve seen people

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:49.789
say is say, look, there can’t be a god and
here’s what they say. Until you prove there’s

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:56.909
a god, until you show me rational, empirical
proof, I don’t have to believe in God. And,

00:23:56.909 --> 00:24:01.970
therefore, until you prove there’s a god,
there is no god. Well, here’s a problem,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:07.480
that’s a big leap for faith. You say, what
do you mean it's a big leap of faith? Sure,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.470
if you have a creator god, here’s a god
who created the universe, what makes you so

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:19.360
sure that this god who is not inside the universe,
I mean, he’s not on a being inside the universe,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.260
wholly inside; he's not like an island in
the Pacific. There’s no particular reason

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.779
why you should believe in some island in the
Pacific unless somebody proves it to you;

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:31.850
or a chemical compound, there's no reason
to believe this chemical compound exists unless

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:37.500
somebody proves it to you. But why should
you assume that God would actually be someone

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.600
or something so inside the world that He could
be provable? It may be right, and you may

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.769
be wrong. But you have to admit it, it's a
leap of faith. You're actually assuming something

00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:52.460
about the nature of God in order to say He
doesn’t exist. C.S. Lewis writes an interesting

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:58.840
article in 1961. Some of you might know that
the Russians were the first country to send

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:07.269
somebody into space, Yuri Gagarin. And he
came back and a few months later, the premier

00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:12.330
of Russia--Soviet Union Khrushchev was giving
a speech and talking about atheism and he

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.419
actually said, “We sent somebody to heaven,
and he came back and he said he didn’t see

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:23.220
God anywhere.” And C.S. Lewis wrote an article
that said interestingly enough, he said, “If

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.410
there is a god who created the world and created
us, you couldn’t--well, you don't relate

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:33.390
to God the way a person in a first storey
relates to a man in the second storey. Rather,

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:39.539
you would relate to God the way Hamlet relates
to Shakespeare.” See, if Hamlet wants to

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:43.680
prove there's a Shakespeare, he’s not going
to be able to do that in a lab nor is he going

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.120
to be able to find Shakespeare by going up
into the top of the, you know, the stage,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.080
you know. The only reason he knows anything
about Shakespeare is that Shakespeare writes

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:59.890
something about himself into the play. And
what would mean is if there is a creator god,

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:05.080
you probably--there should be evidence, but
the idea that you can’t believe in Him until

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.970
someone proves Him is actually an assumption
of faith leap about the existence of the nature

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:16.279
of God before you even are willing to admit,
you know, that He’s there. And besides that,

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:23.210
you can’t prove anything hardly, you know
that. Did you take Philosophy 101? I can’t

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.970
prove to you that I’m not a butterfly dreaming
I’m a man. And there are not--there are

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.870
no non-circular arguments for the proposition
that your memories work. The world might have

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.920
been here just five months or minutes ago,
it could have come into existence five minutes

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.500
ago and your memories think as far as back
to that, how can you prove otherwise? So the

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.320
philosophers know that you can’t prove anything.
And guess what? You can’t prove any of your

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.290
moral convictions. Human beings are valuable.
You know, people have rights. You can’t

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.810
prove that. Nope. That’s not self-evident.
It maybe is to all your friends, but it’s

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.080
not self-evident to all the people in the
world. It's not something you can prove. You

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.260
can only prove anything and yet you live your
life on the basis of that. So why should you

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.710
say to God, if you’re there, you prove yourself
to me or you have no response--I have no responsibility

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.830
to you. That may be true; it may not be true
but it’s a leap of faith. Now, here’s

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:16.659
where we've come, this is not only the first
rung of the ladder and you say, oh, my gosh.

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:21.520
Well, like I said, I’m pointing you to the
book. So I can’t give you everything that

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.400
I’d like to give you, but here’s where
we are. If you can’t prove that there is

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.670
no God, that means there may be a god and
if you in this room, any of you are living

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:36.289
as if there is no God, you need to admit that
that’s a risk, that that’s an act of faith,

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:40.980
that you’re taking your life into your hands,
right? And it's as much an act of faith a

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.470
personal commitment an act of faith as a person
who gives him or herself to God. Now, if you

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:52.390
don’t even see that, then you’re not on
the first rung of belief--of reasoning toward

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:57.200
belief in God. If you do see that even for
the first time, you’ve hit rung one. Rung

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.570
two, now, rung two, I’m going to be brief
about. And the reason I’m going to be brief

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:08.470
about is because it actually takes more time
to demonstrate than rung one. Rung two is

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:16.320
this: It takes more of a leap of faith to
disbelieve in God than to believe in God,

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.990
because God makes more sense of the things
you see out there in the world than if there

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:29.880
is no God. Let me give you only two examples,
only two. One of them is this. Okay. One of

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:35.960
them is the fine-tuning of the universe and
one of them is human rights, okay? Fine-tuning

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.990
of the universe, you probably heard about
this. There’s a man named Francis Collins

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.980
who's a real scientist; I’m not. And he
does a good job of talking about this and

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:51.049
the--the fine-tuning of the universe is the
fact that the fundamental regularities and

00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:55.409
constants of physics, the speed of light,
gravitational constants, strength and weakness

00:28:55.409 --> 00:29:01.809
of nuclear forces, all those things have to
be calibrated within a, you know, a millionth

00:29:01.809 --> 00:29:07.630
of a millionth of a millionth of a degree
and they all have to agree for organic life

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:14.370
to have grown and, therefore, it looks like
this world is perfectly chosen for our human

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:19.630
life. So what--the argument goes like this.
The argument is: What are the chances of this

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:25.919
happening by accident? Very, very--one in
a trillion that we just happen to be, so maybe

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:30.260
this is an evidence for the existence God.
Now, a guy like Richard Dawkins, very rightly

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:36.279
says, that is not proof and here’s the reason
it’s not proof. He says, "What if at the

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:41.500
Big Bang, there were a million parallel universes,
a billion, a trillion, you know, infinite

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:48.409
number of parallel universe all created at
once, and we just happen to be in the one.

00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:52.950
Okay, so what? Maybe it was a one in a trillionth
chance but here it is, we’re here. That

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:59.370
doesn’t prove God and he’s right. Except
there’s--Alvin Plantinga is a Christian

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:03.049
philosopher at Notre Dame that has a little
bit of a comeback that’s kind of funny.

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:08.289
He says imagine yourself at a poker game,
and you’re sitting around at the poker game,

00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:16.149
and one man, the man who’s dealing deals
himself 20 straight hands of four aces, 20

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:22.289
straight hands. Okay, now, on the last time,
he deals himself, four aces. Everybody gets

00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:29.730
up. And you’re just ready to pound him and
here’s what he says, "Look," he says. "I

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.720
know it looks suspicious, but what if there’s
an infinite succession of universes so that

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.840
for any possible distribution of possible
poker hands, there is a universe in which

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.730
the possibility is realized. We just happen
to find ourselves in one where I always deal

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:47.799
myself four aces without cheating. Couldn’t
that be the case? You can’t prove that I’m

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:55.159
cheating." And the answer is you're probably
going to slug him anyway because you would

00:30:55.159 --> 00:30:58.309
say, of course, you can’t prove it but what
are the chances? It’s not like, you know,

00:30:58.309 --> 00:31:04.890
nobody lives their life like that. In other
words, though the fine-tuning of the universe

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.750
does not prove the existence of God, if there
is a god, it makes sense. If there’s not

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.909
a god, it’s a long shot. It doesn’t prove
the existence of God. All it proves is if

00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:18.120
there is a god, what you see there makes more
sense. Let me give you only one other example,

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:24.500
only one, human Rights. I'll give you a good
example of this. Alan Dershowitz in his book

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:29.909
Shouting Fire has a chapter on where the human
rights come from, and he says there’s basically

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:41.059
four possibilities. Now human rights is the
belief that human beings are so worthwhile

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:48.070
that regardless of age, regardless of ethnicity,
regardless of gender, regardless of social

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.460
status, regardless of how much wealth you
have, every human being is of great worth

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.779
and has certain rights that can’t be exploited
or trampled upon. Now, the question comes:

00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:03.730
Why should we believe that? The first possibility,
Alan Dershowitz says, is that we believe that

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:07.919
God created human beings and therefore they’re
sacred. They’re made in the image of God,

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:11.270
et cetera. And Alan said--Alan Dershowitz
says but a lot of us don’t believe in God

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:18.419
so we don’t want to go there. Fine. Point
two. The second possibility is maybe we--we

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:25.059
find this in nature. If we look out in nature,
if we just look out nature, do we just see

00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:32.230
that somehow human beings, individuals are
valuable? "No," he says, because all you see

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:37.659
out there is the strong eating the weak. That's
how every one of you got here--called evolution.

00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:43.350
Annie Dillard who wrote Pilgrim at Tinker
Creek and won a Pulitzer Prize for it some

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:49.460
years ago was living by a creek bed in Virginia,
and she wanted to get close to nature but

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.269
the more she saw how nature was red and tooth
and claw, and the strong are eating the weak--she

00:32:54.269 --> 00:33:00.909
saw a water bug stinging a toad or a frog
and then suck out its brain and she saw this

00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:05.550
and she began to realize, "Wait a minute.
Everything about nature contradicts everything

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:10.149
I feel about what is right and wrong." And
she says, "Evolution loves death more than

00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:14.490
it loves you and me or anyone. I had thought
to live by the side of the creek in order

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.520
to shape my life to its free flow, but I seem
to have reached the point where I must draw

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:25.009
the line. I must part ways with the only world
I know. Look, Cock Robin may die the most

00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:30.029
gruesome of slow deaths and nature is no less
pleased. The sun comes up, the creek rolls

00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:34.309
on, the survivors still sing, but I cannot
feel that way about your death nor you about

00:33:34.309 --> 00:33:39.140
mine or either of us about the robins. We
value the individual supremely. Nature values

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.730
the individual not a wit. It looks as if I
might have to reject this creek life unless

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:51.070
I want to be utterly brutalized. Either this
world, nature, is a monster or I am a freak

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.480
because I believe that the strong should not
eat the weak but everything in nature says

00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.211
it should. Either this world is my mother,
my mother is a monster, or I myself is a freak.

00:34:00.211 --> 00:34:04.480
Let’s consider the former possibility, the
world is a monster. There’s not a people

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.940
in the world that behaves as bad as praying
mantises. But wait, you say, there’s no

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.520
right or wrong in nature. Right and wrong
is a human concept. Precisely, we are model

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.070
creatures in a universe that is running on
chance and death careening blindly from nowhere

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:24.030
to nowhere which somehow produced wonderful
us. This world runs on chance and death and

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.160
power, but I cherish life and the rights of
the weak versus the strong. So I crawled by

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.629
chance out of a sea of amino acids through
evolution and now I twirl around and shake

00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:38.580
my fist at that sea and I cry, 'Shame!' We
little blobs of soft tissue crawling around

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:43.520
on this one planet skin are right and the
whole universe is wrong. The world is a monster.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:50.800
Oh, maybe not, let’s consider the alternative.
Nature is fine. We are freaks. The frog that

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.929
the giant water bug sucked had a rush of feeling
for about a second before its brain turned

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.500
to broth. I however have been sapped by very
strong feelings about the incident almost

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:04.140
daily for years. All right, then, it’s our
emotions and values that already amiss. We

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:09.740
are freaks. The world is fine. Let us all
go have lobotomies to restore us to a natural

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.690
state. We can leave the library, then go back
to creek, lobotomize, and live on its banks

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:21.160
as untroubled as any muskrat or reed--you
first." Here’s what she's saying, "How could

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:27.220
you look at nature and say there’s something
wrong with it?" See, to believe in human rights

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:33.330
is to say everything else in nature is wrong,
everything, because that’s how you got here.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.210
The strong eats the weak and now you’re
saying, "No, it’s wrong." Why would it be

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:41.770
wrong? Unless you believe in God or a supernatural
standard by which to judge, how can you judge

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:48.730
that nature is unnatural? Where did you get
your idea by which you could say nature--so

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.270
you can’t go to nature. No, it’s not,
it’s not natural. The third possibility

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:58.869
is, okay, we formed human rights ourselves.
Legislative majorities create human rights.

00:35:58.869 --> 00:36:01.910
They’re not discovered. They’re not there.
Yeah, you’re right. Morality is something

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:08.640
we create. So we create it. We as a body of
a legislative majority, we decide that human

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.599
rights makes society work better and therefore
it’s more practical to believe in human

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:17.580
rights so we create human rights. And Dershowitz
says that will never work. You know why? What

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:23.300
we’re really saying is genocide is only
wrong because we say it is. And therefore

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:28.950
if 51 percent want to vote to take away the
rights of 49 percent and destroy them, nobody

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:34.220
can say, how dare you? Because you say genocide
is only wrong because we say so; now, most

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.450
of us don’t say it’s wrong. He says the
whole value of rights, he says a lawyer, he

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.610
says, the value of rights, is to say to the
majority, you have to honor the rights of

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:47.480
my client. Human rights are there. They’re
discovered. They can’t be created. Oh, okay,

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:53.740
now, wait, they don’t come from nature,
we don’t create them, they're there. He

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:57.701
says I don’t believe in God; so why do I
believe in human rights? And you know what

00:36:57.701 --> 00:37:02.000
he says in the end? They’re just there.
We don’t know where they come from, we don’t

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.569
know why they're there, they probably shouldn’t
be there; but they’re there. Now, what is

00:37:06.569 --> 00:37:10.430
he saying? Am I telling you that human rights
proves there is a god, no. All I’m trying

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:14.650
to say is this: If there is a god, human rights
makes sense. If there is no god, human rights

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.560
don’t make much sense. They don’t make
as much sense. You don’t even know where

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:24.790
they came from. What is this to say? Only
that belief in God makes more sense of life

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:29.910
than non-belief, right? Dershowitz is basically
saying that. I’ve been planning as just

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:35.050
to--and I could give you a long list. So here's
my question; I can’t prove God to you. I

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.440
can only show you thing after thing after
thing, issue after issue after issue, if there

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:44.040
is a god, it makes sense that that’s there.
If there is a god, the idea of justice and

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.119
injustice and genocide being wrong makes sense.
If there is no god, you're really just taking

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:53.460
a leap in the dark to say I don’t know why
it’s wrong, I just feel it’s wrong. It’s

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.210
a bigger leap in the dark to believe in human
rights if you don’t believe in God than

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:02.060
if you do. It’s a bigger leap in the dark
to say, somehow, love is significant, human

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:09.480
beings are valuable if there is no god than
if there is. So why are you doing it? Why

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:15.319
is it so hard to believe in God? Probably,
personal and social reasons, and maybe some

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:20.270
intellectual reasons. Now, this is the last
because I do want to take 15 minutes of questions.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:28.630
I just said that once you get through the
second rung, you're only to the place of probability.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:35.300
God is more likely to exist. And you say is
that as far as you can take me? Well, yes,

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:40.380
in a way. I better put this down. I’m sorry.
But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:46.060
certain. If I was falling off the cliff and
I saw a branch taking out of the side of the

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:51.120
cliff, let’s just say that branch is strong
enough to hold me up. Now, I’m about to

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.540
fall. If I don’t grab that branch, I’m
dead. If I look at that branch and I say,

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.390
“Oh, I don’t know if it’s going to save
me,” but if I grab it, I’m saved. If I

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.300
look at the branch and I say, “I know that
branch can save me,” but I don’t grab

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:11.349
it, I’m dead. You see, weak faith in a strong
object is infinitely better than strong faith

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:15.421
in a weak object because it’s the object
of your faith, not the strength of your faith

00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:20.880
that saves you. And if you get to the place
where you think God probably is there, now,

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.680
it’s time to make a personal commitment.
You know what, if you, one of you want to

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.910
come work for me, I could do all kinds of
rational background checks and everything

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.070
to try to figure out that you're probably
the right person for the job. But until I

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:37.870
commit to you, until I bite, until I invest
in you, until I actually hire you, which is

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:43.329
always a risk, I can’t know. But if I personally
commit to you, in a year or so, I can know

00:39:43.329 --> 00:39:47.650
perfectly well, same thing with Jesus, same
thing with God. At a certain point, you come

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:52.460
to probability and then you have to commit.
Do you remember how--and here’s a great

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.619
thing about Christianity, mind if I put in
a plug for my own religion? I’ve been talking

00:39:55.619 --> 00:40:00.470
about God in general but I’m a minister;
can I do that? You know, it’s my job. Remember

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:05.440
how I said C.S. Lewis said that if there is
a god, the only way you’d know about him

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.330
is since he's like Shakespeare, he would have
to write some information about himself into

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:13.440
the play? You know, you can go beyond that
if you’re an author. Any of you ever see

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:21.640
the Peter Wimsey novels or ever see the--they
were put on BBC? Dorothy Sayers was one of

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.470
the first women to ever graduate from Oxford
and she was a detective novelist and she wrote

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:32.210
a series of novels. Peter Wimsey was this
aristocratic detective and he solved mysteries.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:39.089
And halfway through the series, a woman shows
up named Harriett Vane. And Harriet Vane was

00:40:39.089 --> 00:40:43.980
one of the first women who ever graduated
from Oxford and she was a writer of detective

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:49.210
novels and she falls in love with Peter Wimsey
and marries him. Do you know who Harriet Vane

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:56.480
is? See, what happened was Dorothy Sayers
fell in love with Peter Wimsey. She created

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:04.180
him, she created the whole world that he was
in and she also saw he was horribly lonely,

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:09.470
and she wanted to get into that world and
save him. And guess what? She did. She wrote

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:14.670
herself in and she married him and they lived
happily ever after. Now, you know what the

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:19.400
gospel is, every other religion says God is
up here and you have believe in him but only

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.920
in Christianity, he says, God wrote himself
into the play. It’s really moving to say,

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.170
oh, Dorothy Sayers put herself into the world
she created and she fell in love with her

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:33.880
key character and that’s exactly what God
has done, that’s what the gospel is. And,

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:40.520
therefore, if personal commitment is the key
to certainty, Christianity has a leg up because

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.140
you’ve got a watertight, not a watertight
argument, you a watertight person, Jesus Christ,

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.520
against him in the end, I don’t think there
can be a good argument. Now, what I’m going

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:54.190
to do is walk over here, without knocking
anything over and then everybody who wants

00:41:54.190 --> 00:42:00.069
to ask me questions for the next 15, 20 minutes
or so, just come up there and, oh, I’m sorry,

00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:05.520
I'll move this a little bit. Am I still in
the line? Okay, thank you. So thank you for

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.870
listening. Can this hold me up? I’m a big
guy. Okay. Hi.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:16.270
&gt;&gt; Hi. I want to thank you very much for being
here today. It’s a fascinating talk. I actually

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:20.309
have a hundred questions and it would not
be fair for me to ask them so that means I

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:22.510
have to go get my hands in the book.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: So you’re just going to give

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:27.540
me, what, 50?
&gt;&gt; I’m just going to give you one. The argument

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:35.050
from evil and suffering is interesting to
me because you say, well, maybe God is permitting

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.901
it and we just can’t understand why.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Right.

00:42:37.901 --> 00:42:46.100
&gt;&gt; Well, that may be true but it seems to
me that if that’s true, then I don’t understand

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:52.241
how you can come to any conclusions about
what God would do or wouldn’t do based on

00:42:52.241 --> 00:43:00.579
his properties. If God is all good and all
powerful and still lets babies burn to death

00:43:00.579 --> 00:43:02.530
in fires...
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Uh-hmm.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:09.930
&gt;&gt; Then, maybe he's all good and all powerful
and chooses not to save us or chooses not

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:15.859
to love us or one specific thing you said
is that, for atheists, they're making a leap

00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:19.260
of faith, they’re taking--they’re risking
something. They’re taking their life in

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:26.760
their hands. Well, that’s not just based
on a belief in God but a belief in how atheists

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:34.280
should act if there’s a god, the consequences
for atheists. If he’s going to let babies

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.220
burn in fires, then maybe he’s going to
let atheists prosper, go to heaven and be

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.270
healthy.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: But, see, so by--it sounds like

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:48.250
you are assuming then that if babies burn
in fires--actually, what you’re doing is

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:54.089
you’re trying to go back and say, there
can’t be any way that a loving God could

00:43:54.089 --> 00:43:57.839
let a baby burn in fire.
&gt;&gt; No, I'm not saying that. I’m saying if

00:43:57.839 --> 00:44:03.069
we conclude that a loving, omnipotent God
can let babies burn in fire, then we could

00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:09.470
conclude that he can let any horrible thing
happen or any good thing happen and therefore

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:14.050
assuming, for instance, that atheists are
going to have to pay in some way, that’s

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:19.119
the assumption about hat God will do. But
we already know that we can’t understand

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:23.890
why God does things and therefore we can't
understand what he would do and what he wouldn’t

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:32.020
do in any situation.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: The difference between--listen,

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.740
when the Bible says, thou shall not kill,
we shouldn’t be sitting around saying, well,

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:43.960
what we don’t know what God's will is. There
it is. When it comes to guessing why he let

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.890
certain things happen, that is a completely
different category and you really shouldn’t

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:53.130
put the two together. Say, for example, how
do you know that the baby, if the person grew

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.980
up would have become an evil person and this
is his way of just getting the baby out and

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.170
staying in heaven forever. You don’t know
that.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:02.390
&gt;&gt; And how do you know that the atheist wouldn’t
be a better person, a particular atheist wouldn’t

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:08.720
be a better person for being an atheist and
God wishes him to be an atheist for it?

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:14.600
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Why don’t you say--I just said,
there’s a difference between what the word--what

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.910
the Bible says. So the Bible would say...
&gt;&gt; You’ve made an enormous leap.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.970
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Well, yeah, because I didn’t
get there. I just talked about God.

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:24.260
&gt;&gt; Faith in God.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Yes, you’re right. You’re right.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.270
You’re right. That’s another talk.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:31.230
&gt;&gt; KELLER: So you’re perfectly right in
saying, until you, until you, Tim Keller,

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:37.040
until you can show me that I need to take
the Bible seriously, it’s tough for me to

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.700
completely swallow what you just said about
evil and suffering. Okay. So I have to go

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.400
there, and I won’t partly because, unless
you...

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.210
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: No, we just don’t have enough

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:52.190
time. But, you see, the point is, there’s
nothing, for example, in the Bible about why

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:56.080
God would let somebody die or child die. There’s
a lot of stuff in the Bible saying you have

00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:01.490
responsibility to respond to me; I’m your
creator. So that’s--however, you’re absolutely

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:05.880
right about the fact that I didn’t establish
that so I can’t leverage it. But, good point.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.400
Come on.
&gt;&gt; Hi, could it be that the derivation of

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.089
basic human rights comes from our ability
to see perspective and take the role of another

00:46:16.089 --> 00:46:18.990
person and, maybe, that is just a good evolutionary
strategy?

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.680
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Right. What you’re saying is,
then, human rights just helps you pass your

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.559
genetic code on. It’s basically a form of
selfishness. In other words, you're saying

00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:37.740
that, that--the trouble with saying that everything
comes from evolution, that my--that the feeling

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:45.630
that it’s wrong to exploit somebody basically
helps me pass my genetic material on, if that’s

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:50.500
all you want to say human rights is, I would
say then, why can’t I get away with it?

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.250
In other words, I guess I would say, that
doesn’t tell me that human rights are really

00:46:55.250 --> 00:47:00.099
there. What that tells me is why I feel that
they’re there. See, I think Dershowitz--see,

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:04.650
Dershowitz actually deals with that a little
bit. He says, if you say the reason--so many

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:08.630
of us, and most people don’t believe in
human rights, okay? But the reason so many

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:14.100
of us here believe in human rights is because
it’s our next stage of evolution and we

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:18.920
feel that they’re there. But that only tells
me why I feel that they’re not--that they

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:24.650
are there. So I wouldn’t say your argument
goes far enough. Okay? Thanks. I think I did

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:30.720
a lot better with him than you so. You have
a very good point, anyway. I understand what

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.651
you’re saying and I hope I’m not making
a short rift of these big deals but I don’t

00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:38.901
have too much time. Yes, go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Dr. Keller, first, I wanted to thank you

00:47:38.901 --> 00:47:41.729
for joining us today. One of the many interesting
points...

00:47:41.729 --> 00:47:43.530
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Who’s that?
&gt;&gt; This is Cornelius.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.839
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Cornelius?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:44.839 --> 00:47:48.109
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Cool.
&gt;&gt; One of the many interesting points you

00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:53.319
made had to do with the increasing prevalence
of orthodox religions in our society. And

00:47:53.319 --> 00:47:59.380
I was wondering, I read an essay by an economist
named Lawrence Anacone. He talks about why

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:04.290
strict churches are strong, you know, basically,
that he feels that the social advantages of

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:09.589
a strict church become increasingly, you know,
desirable as the society becomes more wealthy

00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:14.280
and educated. I was wondering if you had any
comments on that.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.290
&gt;&gt; KELLER: That sounds a little bit like--no,
I don’t know. I haven’t read that. It

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:24.702
sounds a little bit like a sociologist named
Dean Kelley back in the early ‘70s. He wrote

00:48:24.702 --> 00:48:29.400
a book called “Why Conservative Churches
Are Growing?” He said the same thing. And,

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:35.090
you know, as a Christian believer, I would
say that can only be partly right, but I could

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:43.130
say that, to some degree, you’ll find those
kinds of churches are pretty attractive when

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:47.710
the society is very mobile, and there’s
like no community. And it kind of creates--it’s

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:51.930
automatic community in a place where no one
knows anyone. But the fact is that Christianity

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:59.520
grows all over the place. I mean, the--you
know, Christianity grew explosively in China,

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.819
in the rural areas, in the last 50 years where
there was no mobility, there was tremendous

00:49:03.819 --> 00:49:09.790
community and, yet, it’s the same kind of
crunchy, robust, orthodox, conservative religion

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:13.880
that's grown there as it’s growing in our
exurbs right now. So if somebody wants to

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.500
say, one of the reasons why people go to those
churches is it creates community as the world’s

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.730
becoming, as their societies are becoming
more--there’s more detachment and people

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:28.400
feel there’s no community, I agree. But
you can’t reduce the growth of Christianity

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:34.200
to that, that’s all. And thank you for bringing
Cornelius up. You’re welcome. He's a sweetheart.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.691
Hi.
&gt;&gt; Hi, I have a comment and a question.

00:49:37.691 --> 00:49:40.730
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Sure.
&gt;&gt; My comment is, I think you’ve misunderstood

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:44.920
the anthropic principle which characterizes
there’s a multitude of universes and we

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.521
just happen to be in one with fine-tuned constants.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Okay.

00:49:47.521 --> 00:49:52.420
&gt;&gt; The problem is that fine-tuned constants
are required for our existence. And the poker

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:57.740
game analogy falls down because 20 hands of
four aces in a row are not a requirement to

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:03.160
have an observer there to witness the cards
being dealt. An equivalent to the poker game

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:08.140
analogy would be to say, well, we discovered
this nebula in a distant galaxy that happens

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.330
to make the exact shape of the Ten Commandments
written in ancient Hebrew. If you showed me

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:17.570
such a nebula, I would be immediately convinced
that Christianity or Judaism, at least, was

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:23.900
true. But the existence of that nebula does
not predicate my existence and that’s why

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:29.809
that would convince me so...
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Yeah. Listen, I’m not completely

00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:35.040
convinced about what you just said and I think
some of it is subjective. If most--mainly

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.770
I said, and what you said, we'll probably
leave it at that. I mean, it was--I thought,

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:47.320
I mean I read Dawkins pretty closely, and
I thought Dawkins said that we would be in

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.280
the only universe that actually is the right
universe for our existence.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.089
&gt;&gt; Right, because we can’t exist in the
other universes.

00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:56.920
&gt;&gt; KELLER: But he’s still saying--right--but
he’s still saying that--yes, I see what

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.140
you mean, that we just happen to be in this
universe and would have to be...

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.700
&gt;&gt; Well, it’s not so much that we happen
to be. It's that the universe that allows

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:06.020
for observers has observers and so...
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Well, you would say, it just happens

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.710
that there's one universe that grows human
life though. You would agree with that?

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.599
&gt;&gt; That’s true.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Well, that’s the point of the

00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:18.730
poker game.
&gt;&gt; It still is different; but I'll be running

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:19.730
my question because we could argue about it
forever.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:20.850
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Okay.
&gt;&gt; My question is: If God is the only basis

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:25.809
for human rights, then why is it that, at
least, in many parts of the world, we’ve

00:51:25.809 --> 00:51:31.690
seen a trend toward increasing secularism
and increasing human rights at the same time?

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.869
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Well, there’s--read Nicholas
Wolterstorff’s new book, “Justice, Rights

00:51:34.869 --> 00:51:40.309
and Wrong.” It’s brand new. It’s a hard
book. He’s a philosopher from Yale. It’s

00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:45.160
Princeton University Press and he says that
there’s both an enlightenment basis for

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.890
human rights and a Christian one.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:51.829
&gt;&gt; KELLER: And he would say, one of the reasons
why--the enlightenment view of human rights

00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:58.809
is the individual is the main unit. Individual
rights--the individual happiness is more important

00:51:58.809 --> 00:52:05.160
than the community whereas the classic, most
cultures, is that community is more important

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:12.940
than the individual. The idea of human rights
according to Wolterstorff grew out of Christian

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:17.730
roots but it also can grow out of enlightenment
roots. But it’s pretty tough to see it growing

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:21.329
out of some other religions. So it’s in
there...

00:52:21.329 --> 00:52:23.400
&gt;&gt; Okay. But if it grows out of enlightenment
roots then...

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.420
&gt;&gt; KELLER: As well as--yes.
&gt;&gt; As well as Christian but if both lead to

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.510
human rights, then we don’t need Christianity
or...

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:34.530
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Oh, no, listen--I was never--wait,
oh wait. I’m glad you said this because

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:39.200
I want to make this clear. I’m not saying
you got to believe in God to be moral or to

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.610
have human rights. I would say it’s a bigger
leap. All I’m trying to say is it makes

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:47.450
more sense of the thing you believe in which
is human rights, that there be a god than

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:51.619
not. That’s all I’m trying to say. So
that--then you’re sort of confronting--I’m

00:52:51.619 --> 00:52:55.340
kind of trying to confront you to say, well,
what’s the big problem with God if so many

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:59.480
of the things you believe in fit in with,
well, belief in God. That’s all. But you’re

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.150
absolutely right. Certainly, I don't want
anybody to think ever you got to believe in

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:07.510
God in order to be a champion of human rights.
And, actually, history will show you that

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:14.000
it was basically Christians and the agnostics
that together came up with the idea of the

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.520
United States Constitution in which church
and state was separate and a big emphasis

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.960
on the individual rights. It was a confluence
of those two groups so we’re able to get

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.430
together and agree that we wanted America
the way it is. Great question. I hope I did

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:31.740
them justice. Yes?
&gt;&gt; I have a hundred of questions as well.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:36.349
But, first, I want to tell you something that
you may not know. I’ve been to many talks

00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:41.270
in this room and I’ve never seen it half
as full. Once I saw it almost half as full

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:47.340
and that was when Violet Blue, the sex blogger,
came to talk about sex.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:54:00.250
&gt;&gt; KELLER: You know, I think I am really flattered.
Well,

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:05.670
you know, I’m an agnostic about this really.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, the second question, I’m not

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.270
sure it's a question, but the second question,
you talked about this literary example where

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:13.810
the writer writes herself into the story.
I wonder if you’re familiar with the work

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:19.870
of Dave Sim who he has this kind of graphic
novel series called the Cerebus. And a lot

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:23.190
of things…
&gt;&gt; KELLER: I’ve heard of him.

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:28.170
&gt;&gt; So a lot of things about that comic book,
a lot of people would find morally reprehensible

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:32.490
but it’s a lot of--it's very interesting
in a lot of ways and he has a whole series

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:38.390
where he has a conversation as himself as
the author talking to his main characters.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:42.990
I find that very interesting.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: You know, Tolkien, J. R. R. Tolkien

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:49.430
who was a devout Catholic really felt that
the reason, a big reason why artists do need--he

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:54.849
called it subcreation. The reason why artists
have this, this almost compulsion to create

00:54:54.849 --> 00:55:01.000
is because it’s part--it's part of where
we came from which is from God, who is a creator

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.309
god. And so, then he created all different
worlds and people in them as it were and even

00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:11.030
putting yourself into them, there are--there’s
a kind of pragmatic mind that thinks that’s

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:15.329
all really weird. But from a Christian point
of view, it’s exactly what God is all about.

00:55:15.329 --> 00:55:19.960
So it’s a good thing. So thank you for your
kind words. And you know what? Can I take

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.280
another couple? I remember I was going to
cut this off at 2:25 but I’ll cut it off

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:30.930
at 2:30. God, Lord. Okay. Whoever, whoever,
whoever is pulling the strings. Yes, go ahead.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:34.100
&gt;&gt; Hello. So I have another question about
the human rights.

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.980
&gt;&gt; KELLER: All right. I’m sorry. Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Okay. That’s all right. So you made a

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.869
point where human rights doesn’t really--isn’t
really observed in nature and stuff like that.

00:55:42.869 --> 00:55:45.180
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Right.
&gt;&gt; So, you know, I was a little confused about

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:50.109
that because the example you gave talked about
like, you know, an animal of one species attacking

00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:56.039
an animal of another species, right, where
as human--human rights, you’re talking about

00:55:56.039 --> 00:56:00.619
humans, right, so like the same species. And,
you know, there are multiple animals that

00:56:00.619 --> 00:56:03.609
they watch out for others of the same species
so it’s…

00:56:03.609 --> 00:56:08.410
&gt;&gt; KELLER: But now, by the way, probably,
I don’t know what I’m talking about here,

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:13.170
so... There are certainly plenty of places
where the weak animal in the pack, if they’re

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:18.809
going to slow down the pack down, they just
kill it or they just leave it behind in a

00:56:18.809 --> 00:56:22.691
way the humans would never do because they
realize it would--see, because--well, see,

00:56:22.691 --> 00:56:29.349
the point is they would keep--that one being,
that one weak one is jeopardizing the life

00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:37.049
of the entire pack. So you would figure evolution
would favor people who let the weak die because

00:56:37.049 --> 00:56:43.549
that’s the way that the pack is going to
survive. They do what? They have to leave

00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:46.880
it behind otherwise everybody dies.
&gt;&gt; People under stress of immediate death

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.102
do that a lot.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Yeah, and I would say it’s because

00:56:49.102 --> 00:56:52.779
evolution has probably put that into us.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:56:52.779 --> 00:56:55.240
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Right. And that’s the reason.
So I don’t know that it would be fair to

00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:02.450
say that--no, I really think Annie Dillard's
book, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, is really pretty,

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:06.950
pretty amazing. And I think she would--she
would not just say it’s the water bug killing

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:08.180
the frog.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:13.480
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Okay. Good. Okay. Yes, one more.
&gt;&gt; Hi, there. First of all, I’m honored

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.760
to be the last question and thank you very
much for coming. It completely grew. I’ve

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.180
worked here for two and a half years and I’ve
never seen the room this full.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:23.250
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Well, you know, me and Violet.
&gt;&gt; So…

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:26.960
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Yeah, we know how to draw a crowd
so...

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:34.250
&gt;&gt; So your last--my argument against religion
is sort of emotional so it’s not fair to

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.809
ask you to respond to it.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Go ahead. Yeah, sure.

00:57:36.809 --> 00:57:39.660
&gt;&gt; But I would like you to comment on it because
I heard it repeated amongst my colleagues

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.880
several times.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Sure. Sure. Yeah.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:47.030
&gt;&gt; To me, it feels kind of arbitrary to choose
between so many different religions. For example,

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:51.370
I have no problem with the argument that there
is a god or there isn’t a god. I personally

00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:55.750
don’t feel either way. I just kind of don’t
care about the question because it doesn’t

00:57:55.750 --> 00:58:00.590
seem to affect me. And when people say there’s
a god, I don’t have a problem with it. What

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:06.359
I do have a problem with is when people say,
“Oh, by the way, God wrote a book and this

00:58:06.359 --> 00:58:12.290
book that he wrote, even though it contradicts
with all the other books, is correct to the

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:16.880
exclusion of others.” And I know that I’ve
heard a lot of Christians say that, well,

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:22.319
Christianity kind of has a leg up on the other
religions because in this religion, God actually

00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:25.680
came down and told us that, you know, he exists,
right?

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.369
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Yeah. I kind of alluded to it,
you know.

00:58:28.369 --> 00:58:33.750
&gt;&gt; Surprisingly enough, there is another religion
where this is true as well. I’m actually

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:39.640
God. And if you don’t kneel down before
me and worship me, you’re going to go to

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.720
hell. And, also, my hell is actually worse
than the Christian hell. It’s a lot worse.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:51.170
There’s maggots and snakes, and in-laws
and everything. So, and, obviously, you probably

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:58.170
aren’t going to worship me which is unfortunate
because I kind of need the money. But why

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:01.980
not?
&gt;&gt; KELLER: Well, the right answer is you probably

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:07.990
could have me back to talk about Christianity
because I realized that it’s just natural

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:13.970
for, you know, the first questioner there,
you know, obviously, showed me that--you know,

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:17.880
I was sneaking certain Christian presupposition
into some of my statements without being able

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:23.430
to--without justifying them because nobody
really is a generic believer in God. I mean,

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:28.190
you’re almost always--there are all these
different human traditions. There’s Christianity,

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:32.380
Islam, eastern, western have really somewhat
different views of God and I’m coming from

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:37.400
a Christian point of view and I definitely
have slipped a few things in there that I

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.420
didn’t work, I didn’t justify. And if
you want to be back and just do a half hour

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:46.940
on that, I could. However, my snarky answer,
I mean, after all, this is Google and let’s

00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:52.680
do it this way. My snarky answer is if you
were--if you died on the cross after living

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:58.230
a life in which everybody is amazed at the
quality of it and then, afterwards, hundreds

00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:04.650
of people see you, you know, with a nail prints
in 500 at a time, repeatedly over 40 days,

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:09.089
well, that’s different, then people might
start to say, you know, people who didn’t

01:00:09.089 --> 01:00:12.300
believe are believing. They come and they
see you, they put the nail--their fingers

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.280
to the nail prints. That’s a different situation
and that’s really what you have with Christianity.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.960
&gt;&gt; That did actually happen to me in Antarctica.
You probably didn’t hear about it. I can’t

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.210
provide you any rational evidence for it,
but it did happen.

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.650
&gt;&gt; KELLER: But Christian would never say that.
They would say, “Here’s the eye witness

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:33.190
accounts. Here’s the 500 people.” 1st
Corinthians 15, Paul wrote, this is 15 years

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:37.920
after Jesus' death and resurrection, he says,
“There’s still--500 people saw Jesus at

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.950
once, one of his appearances.” And he says,
“Most of them are still alive. Go ahead

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:45.760
and talk to them.” But you’re not doing
that. So what you’re saying is I can’t

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.369
give you any witnesses. Paul says, I don’t
want you to believe in Christianity unless

01:00:49.369 --> 01:00:51.980
you go and talk to these people. They're there.
And you’re not able to provide the same

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.650
kind of warrant.
&gt;&gt; My friend, Brian, over there saw it happened.

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:59.970
He could probably tell you about it.
&gt;&gt; KELLER: At best, I would say well done

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.210
and, with that, I'll close. Well done. Thank
you for the questions.
