00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Dave] So for question 3, the question is which of the following sequences

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of statements leaves the value the variable x refers to

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the same as it was before running the statements?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You should assume that before the code runs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
both a and x refer to integer values.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We don't know what they are. They could be any integer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And the question is after the code runs, does x have the same value it had

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
before that code ran?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So here are the choices.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There are 5 different sequences of statements,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and you should check the box for each sequence where x

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
has the same value after executing those statements

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
as it did at the beginning, no matter what value x had at the beginning

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
as long as it was some number.
