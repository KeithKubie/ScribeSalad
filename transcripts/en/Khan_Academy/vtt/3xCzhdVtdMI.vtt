00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
We've talked a lot about demand.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.130
So now let's talk
about supply, and we'll

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.455
use grapes as this example.

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:09.490
We'll pretend to be grape
farmers of some sort.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.410
So I will start by
introducing you--

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.850
and maybe I'll do it in purple
in honor of the grapes--

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.140
to the law of supply, which
like the law of demand,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.730
makes a lot of intuitive sense.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.324
If we hold all else equal--
in the next few videos,

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:24.740
we'll talk about
what happens when

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.448
we change some of
those things that we're

00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:28.920
going to hold equal right
now-- but if you hold all else

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.360
equal and the only
thing that you're doing

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.750
is you're changing price,
then the law of supply

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.740
says that if the price
goes up-- I'll just say p

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.260
for price-- if
the price goes up,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110
then the supply-- now,
let me be careful--

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.050
the quantity supplied goes up.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.040
And then you can imagine,
if the price goes down,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.900
the quantity supplied goes down.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.700
And you might
already notice that I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.540
was careful to say
quantity supplied.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.230
And it's just like
we saw with demand.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.900
When we talk about
demand going up or down,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.410
we're talking about the entire
price-quantity relationship

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.520
shifting.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.790
When we talk about a
particular quantity demanded,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.039
we say quantity demanded.

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.080
We don't just say demand.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.820
This is the exact
same thing for supply.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.778
When we're talking about
a particular quantity,

00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:23.540
we'll be careful
to say quantity.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.320
If we talk about
supply increasing,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.970
we're talking about the entire
relationship shifting either up

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.340
or down.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.770
So let's just make
sure that this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.180
makes intuitive sense for us.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300
And I think it probably does.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.330
Let's think about
ourselves as grape farmers.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.620
And I'll make a little supply
schedule right over here.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.420
So Grape Supply Schedule, which
is really just a table showing

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.690
the relationship
between, all else

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.310
equal, the price and
the quantity supplied.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.900
So let's label some
scenarios over here,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.950
just like we did with
the demand schedule.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.810
Scenarios.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.300
And then let's put
our Price over here.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.960
This will be in price per pound,
the per pound price of grapes.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.290
And then this is the quantity
produced over the time period.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.620
And whenever we do any of these
supply or demand schedules,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.560
we're talking over a
particular time period.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.840
It could be per day,
it could be per month,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.130
it could be per year.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.870
But that's the only way
to make some sense of, OK,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.430
what is the quantity
per day going

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.930
to be produced if
that's the price?

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.560
So if we didn't say
per day, we don't

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.940
know what we're
really talking about.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.070
Quantity Supplied.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.650
 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.800
And so let's just
say Scenario A,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.830
if the price per pound
of grapes is $0.50--

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.800
if it's $0.50 per
pound-- actually,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.160
let me just do round numbers,
but you get the idea.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.820
If the price per pound is
$1, let's just say for us,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.710
we consider that to be
a relatively low price.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.340
And so we'll only kind
of do the easiest land,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.420
our most fertile land, where
it's easy to produce grapes.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.689
And maybe the fertile--
and cheap land.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.980
So no one else wants to use
that land for other things.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.810
It's only good for
growing grapes.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.360
And so we will provide--
so this is price per pound.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.190
 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.570
And in that situation,
we can produce

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.762
1,000 pounds in this year.

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:28.220
And I've never been
a grape farmer,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.470
so I actually don't know if
that's a reasonable amount

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.470
or not, but I'll just go
with it, 1,000 pounds.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.410
Now, let's take
Scenario B. Let's

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.070
say the price goes up to $2.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.600
Well now, not only
would we produce

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.950
what we were producing
before, but we might now

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.810
want to maybe buy
some more land, land

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.770
that might have had other
uses, land that's maybe not

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.410
as productive for grapes.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.070
But we would, because now
we can get more for grapes.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:02.660
And so maybe now we are willing
to produce 2,000 pounds.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.580
And we can keep going.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.300
The same dynamics
keep happening.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.220
So let's say the price-- if
the price were $3 per pound,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.590
now we do want to produce more.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.010
Maybe we're even willing to work
a little harder or plant things

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.209
closer to each
other, or maybe I'll

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.530
get even more land involved
than I would have otherwise used

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.800
for other crops.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.400
And so then I'm going
to produce 2,500 pounds.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.300
And I'll do one more scenario.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.820
Let's say Scenario D, the
price goes to $4 a pound.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.320
Same dynamic, I will stop
planting other crops,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.670
use them now for grapes, because
grape prices are so high.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.330
And so I will
produce 2,750 pounds.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.970
And so we can draw
a supply curve

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.030
just like we have
drawn demand curves.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.920
And it's the same
exact convention,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.860
which I'm not a fan of, putting
price on the vertical axis.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.780
Because as you see, we
tend to talk about price

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.080
as the independent variable.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.510
We don't always talk
about it that way.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.040
And in most of math
and science, you

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.540
put the independent variable
on the horizontal axis.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.330
But the convention
in economics is

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.400
to put it on the vertical axis.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.960
So price on the vertical axis.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.635
So then this is really
Price per pound.

00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:22.860
 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.630
And then in the
horizontal axis, Quantity

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.510
Produced, or-- let
me just write it.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.381
Quantity Produced, I'll
say in the next year.

00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:35.380
We're assuming all of
this is for the next year,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.160
so next year.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.510
And it's in thousands
of pounds, so I'll

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.310
put it in thousands of pounds.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.260
And so let's see, we go
all the way from 1,000

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.520
to close to 3,000.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.750
So let's say this
is 1,000, that's

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.380
1 for 1,000, that's
2,000, and that is 3,000.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.310
And then the price goes
all the way up to 4.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.630
So it's 1, 2, 3, and then 4.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.760
So we can just
plot these points.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.140
These are specific points
on the supply curve.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.720
So at $1, we would supply 1,000
pounds, at $1, 1,000 pounds.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.470
That's Scenario A.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.940
At $2, we would supply
2,000 pounds, $2,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.610
we'd supply 2,000 pounds.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:31.180
That's scenario B. At $3, we'd
supply 2,500 pounds, $3-- oh,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.690
sorry.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.360
Now, when we look up-- See, now
notice, I get my axes confused.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.700
This is Price.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.040
This isn't, when we
talk about it this way,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.260
that we're viewing the
thing that's changing.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.470
Although, you don't always
have to do it that way.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.940
So at one $1, 1,000
pounds. $1, 1,000 pounds.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.740
$2, 2,000 pounds.
$2, 2,000 pounds.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.272
$3-- this isn't $3, this is $3.

00:06:54.272 --> 00:06:57.210
$3, 2,500 pounds.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.290
So right about there.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.900
That's about 2,500.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.750
But I want to do it
in that blue color,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.550
so we don't get confused.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.030
So $3, 2,500 pounds.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.290
That's about right.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.910
So this is Scenario C.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.080
And then Scenario
D, at $4-- actually,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.820
let me be a little
bit clearer with that,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.120
because we're getting close.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.980
So this is 2,500 pounds,
gets us right over here.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:28.860
This is Scenario C. And then
Scenario D at $4, 2,750.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.920
So 2,750 is like
right over there.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.130
So that is $4.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.940
That is Scenario D.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.010
And if we connect
them, they should all

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.160
be on our supply curve.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.670
So they will all be-- it will
look something like that.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.790
And there's some
minimum price we

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.480
would need to supply
some grapes at all.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.980
We wouldn't give
them away for free.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.750
So maybe that's something--
that minimum price is over here,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.250
that just even gets
started producing grapes.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.850
So this right over here
is what our supply curve

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.630
would look like.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.900
Now remember, the only
thing we're varying here

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.460
is the price.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.060
So if the price were to
change, all else equal,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.785
we would move along
this curve here.

00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:13.160
Now, in the next
few videos, I'll

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.100
talk about all those other
things we've been holding equal

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.980
and what they would do at any
given price point to this curve

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.139
or, in general, what they
would do to the curve.

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:23.639
