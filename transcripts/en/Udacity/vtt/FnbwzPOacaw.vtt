00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.482
So, notice, this case, we were only able to write an expression. Now, I have the

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:09.131
same problem but if added the sentence, the result is negative 18. Before we

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:13.691
knew that the end result would be negative 18, we could only have an expression.

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:18.109
But now that I have this extra piece of information, I can set this equal to

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.940
negative 18. Now, we have an equation. We have an expression on the left and a

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:27.705
number on the right. Now, you can use this equation to figure out the value of

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:31.717
a. Try and find a and put your answer in the box. Good luck.
