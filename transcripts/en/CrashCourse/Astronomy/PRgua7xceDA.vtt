00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.970
We humans of planet Earth benefit from a great
coincidence. It’s a coincidence of time,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.720
and of space. And of math.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.630
The coincidence is this: the Sun is about
400 times wider than the Moon, and it’s

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.320
also on average about 400 times farther away
than the Moon.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.110
The apparent size of an object in the sky
depends on how big it is and how far away

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.940
it is... so these numbers being equal means
the Sun and the Moon appear to be about the

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.450
same size in the sky.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.840
And that’s where another interesting thing
comes in: Sometimes, the Moon passes directly

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.120
between the Earth and the Sun. It doesn’t happen all
that often, but when it does, you get magic.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.300
Or even better: You get SCIENCE.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.960
You get an eclipse.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.620
An eclipse is a generic term in astronomy
for when one object passes into the shadow

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.100
of another object, darkening or blocking it.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.989
A solar eclipse is when the Moon blocks the
Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth, and a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.180
lunar eclipse is when the Earth blocks the
Sun, casting a shadow on the Moon.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.000
But how do they work?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.250
Well, the Moon orbits the Earth once per month,
and the Earth orbits the Sun once per year.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.030
If the Moon’s orbit were perfectly aligned
with the Earth’s, essentially sharing the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.110
same plane, we’d get a solar eclipse every
new Moon and a lunar eclipse every full Moon!

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.650
But we don’t. That’s because the Moon’s
orbit is tilted with respect to Earth’s,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.200
by about 5°.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.540
What that means is that, at new Moon, the
Moon can be as much as 5° away from the Sun,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.000
passing “above” or “below” the Sun
in the sky, thereby missing it, from our perspective.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.939
But sometimes the Moon is in the right place
at the right time, and at new Moon, it lies

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.119
perfectly in line between the Sun and the
Earth. And when that happens, we get a solar

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.820
eclipse. This geometry happens at least twice per
year, and sometimes as much as five times per year.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.780
What’s happening physically in space is
that the Moon is casting a long shadow. Usually

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.680
that shadow misses the Earth, but during an eclipse
the Moon’s shadow falls on the Earth’s surface.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.950
In fact, there are two shadows from the Moon,
one inside the other. One is a narrow cone,

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.220
tapering to a point away from the Moon. If
you’re anywhere physically inside this cone,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.880
the Moon appears big enough to completely
block the Sun. That means this shadow is very

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.520
dark, and we call it the umbra (which is Latin
for – you guessed it – “shadow”).

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.160
Outside of this deep umbral shadow is a wider
conical region where, if you’re in it, the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.920
Sun is only partially blocked; you can still
see some of the Sun past the Moon. You’re

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.980
getting less light, and so you’re technically
shadowed, but it’s not quite as dark as

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.160
the umbra. This region is called the “penumbra”; “pen”
in this case for Latin meaning “almost,” or “nearly.”

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.020
When the umbra touches the Earth, we get a total solar
eclipse. But what does that look like from the ground?

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.540
You don’t get a total eclipse right away.
First, the edge of the Moon slips in front

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.260
of the Sun, and we see a little dip in the
Sun’s limb, its edge as seen from Earth

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.880
(that’s the start of the penumbra sweeping
over you).

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.530
As the Moon slowly moves, that dip grows,
becoming a bite. The Sun becomes a thick crescent,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.590
then a thin one.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.500
As the Sun becomes an ever-thinner crescent,
the sky begins to darken. Then, finally, the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.510
Moon’s black disk completely covers the
Sun — the umbra sweeps over your location.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.170
And at that moment, totality begins.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.170
You might think that this just means the sky
gets dark, and it’s like night outside for

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.480
a while. But a total eclipse is far more than
that. And that’s because of the Sun’s corona.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.940
As I’ll cover in more detail in a future
episode, the corona is the sun’s atmosphere,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.060
an ethereally thin envelope of gas that stretches from
the Sun’s surface into space for millions of kilometers.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.700
It’s really faint, and therefore usually
completely overwhelmed by the intensely bright

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:42.629
light from the Sun.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.319
But when the Moon blocks the Sun’s face,
the corona becomes visible. It surrounds the

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.110
Sun, filaments and tendrils extending into
the sky, an incredibly beautiful sight. I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.409
know many people who have said it’s the
most spectacular thing they have ever seen.

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.009
And there’s more. The Moon’s edge isn’t
smooth — there are craters and other depressions.

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:06.440
Craters right at the Moon’s edge allow sunlight
to stream past. We see these as bright patches

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.250
around the eclipsed Sun, which are called
Baily’s Beads - because they were first

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.370
described by English astronomer Francis Baily
in 1836!

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.199
Because the Moon and Sun are very nearly the
same apparent size, totality is brief.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.909
The longest it can last is only about seven
or eight minutes. That’s how long it takes

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:27.210
the umbra to move over one spot on the Earth.
When totality ends, and the Moon starts to

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.009
move off of the Sun’s face, for a moment
just a single spot of the Sun is unblocked,

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.719
glowing fiercely on one side of the Moon.
Sometimes you can get a circle of light around

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:40.270
the Moon’s surface, and together with the
bright spot it looks like a celestial wedding

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.010
ring. In fact, this is called the Diamond
Ring effect.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.300
Then, inexorably, the Moon pulls away from
the Sun, and the order of events is reversed.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.839
The umbra is gone, but you’re still in the
penumbral shadow. The Sun shows a thin crescent,

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.409
then a thick one, then a dip in its side…
and then it’s all over.

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.619
The umbral shadow of the Moon is pretty small
where it hits the Earth, so a total eclipse

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:03.909
is a local event. If you’re too far north
and south, you don’t get a total eclipse,

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.029
you only get a partial one. Which is still
cool, but lacks the mystique of a total eclipse.

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:13.400
Remember too that the Moon’s orbit around
the Earth is an ellipse. That means sometimes

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.639
it’s closer to the Earth, and sometimes
farther.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.330
If a solar eclipse happens when the Moon is
at the far end of its orbit, it can actually

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.259
be smaller than the Sun in the sky. It doesn’t
block the entire face of the Sun, and it leaves

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.889
a ring of light around the black circle of
the Moon.

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.589
This technical name for this shape is annulus,
so this event is called an annular eclipse.

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:36.029
A lot of people think if you look at a total
solar eclipse you can go permanently and completely

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:42.149
blind. That’s really not true. But, some parts of
eclipse-watching are more dangerous than others.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:46.419
I mean, obviously it’s not a good idea to
stand there and stare at the sun. Looking

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.990
at even the uneclipsed Sun for more than a
moment is painful, and that pain is the result

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.450
of the damage that solar radiation is doing
to your retinas. So I don’t recommend it

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.100
— Duh.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.249
But when viewing an eclipse, the real concern
is right after totality ends. During totality

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.360
it’s dark, so your pupils have dilated to
let more light in. But then there’s the

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.879
flash of sunlight when the Moon moves off, and
that’s intense enough to damage your retinas.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.429
That’s why astronomers recommend extreme
caution when viewing an eclipse; because that

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:16.149
flash can catch you by surprise.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:20.580
When viewing the Sun, don’t just stand there
and stare at it; you should always have eye

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.360
protection. And make sure you have safety-approved
filters; don’t try the the home-made tricks

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.119
you might have heard of -- like looking through
an old CD or DVD, or using old-style camera

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:31.080
film as a filter.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.119
These can let through too much infrared and
ultraviolet light, and again can dilate your

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:37.369
pupils, actually making things worse.

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:41.490
Lots of companies make inexpensive filters
that are great for Sun-spotting; we have links

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.779
in dooblydoo for more information on eye safety.

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:48.139
Now, you don’t have to worry about hurting
your eyes at all when viewing a lunar eclipse.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.429
Because, in that case, it’s the Earth that
blocks the Sun, and the Earth’s shadow falls

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:54.349
on the Moon. So go nuts.

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.099
But one big difference between the two kinds
of eclipses is who can see them.

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:03.379
A solar eclipse is localized to one spot on
the Earth, or really a swath along the ground

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.469
as the Moon’s umbral shadow sweeps across
the Earth’s surface.

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:10.669
But a lunar eclipse is when the Moon moves
into Earth’s shadow, so anyone on Earth

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.439
facing the Moon can see a lunar eclipse. This
is why I’ve seen dozens of lunar eclipses

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:20.599
but never a total solar one. I’ve never
been at the right place at the right time.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.580
Not that I’m bitter.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.900
The Earth has umbral and penumbral shadows,
too. When the Moon first enters the Earth’s

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.909
penumbra, the dimming is so slight you hardly
notice it. But as the Moon moves deeper into

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:34.349
the penumbra, it starts to darken. Sometimes
it changes color, turning a deep orange or

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:35.289
blood red.

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.569
That’s because the Earth is starting to
block the sunlight heading toward the moon,

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:42.440
and the only light that gets through is coming
through the thickest part of our atmosphere.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.020
This blocks blue and green light, leaving
only red to come through.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.100
That’s why the Moon and Sun look red to
us when they’re on the horizon, rising and

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.099
setting, too. When you look upon the red eclipsed
Moon, you’re seeing the light from all the

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:59.999
sunrises and sunsets in the world hitting
the Moon and reflecting back to us.

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:04.339
Finally, the Moon starts to enter the Earth’s
umbra, and the real eclipse begins. At first

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:08.369
it looks like a bite is taken out of it — that
curving arc is the shadow of the edge of the

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:12.689
Earth! The Moon moves deeper and deeper into
the shadow until it’s completely darkened.

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:16.089
The Earth is bigger than the Moon, so the
Earth’s umbra is much wider; while a solar

00:08:16.089 --> 00:08:20.639
eclipse is over in minutes, a total lunar
eclipse can last nearly two hours. I once

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:24.849
saw a lunar eclipse so deep that it took me
a minute to find the Moon in the sky!

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:28.719
There’s not a lot of new science you can
do with a lunar eclipse. But if you know a

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:33.219
little geometry, you can use the size and
shape of the Earth’s shadow on the Moon

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:35.539
to get the relative sizes of the Earth and
Moon.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.480
Ancient Greeks did just this, and got a number
that wasn’t too far off. They also knew

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.399
how big the Earth was using other methods,
and so they had a decent estimate for the

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.980
size of the Moon…nearly 2000 years before
the invention of the telescope!

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.100
They also knew the shape of the Earth’s
shadow was always a circle, which only makes

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.680
sense if the Earth were a sphere. If the Earth
were flat, it would sometimes cast a thin

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.360
shadow, but it never does. Pretty clever,
those ancient Greeks.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.930
One final note. Because of tides from the
Earth — which we’ll learn more about in

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.389
detail in a later episode — the Moon is
slowly moving away from the Earth, by about

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:11.449
4 centimeters a year.

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:16.740
As it recedes, it’s slowly getting smaller
in the sky. This means that, eventually, it

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.750
will be too far away to completely cover the
Sun, and we won’t get any more total eclipses.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.580
Doing the rough math, that will be in about a billion
years. Better watch eclipses while you can.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.399
Today you learned that a solar eclipse is
when the Moon blocks the Sun so its shadow

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.780
falls on the Earth, and a lunar eclipse is
when the Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.380
We don’t get them every two weeks because
the Moon’s orbit is tilted. And if you’re

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.890
clever, you can use lunar eclipses to figure
out how big the Earth and Moon are.
