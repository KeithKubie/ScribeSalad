This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Audible.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.000
Call if you must bad rhyming a disease.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
It gives men happiness, or leaves them at
ease.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.080
But why do we rhyme my fellow DNewsers?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.230
It's in your brain!

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.110
The cells and users!

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.410
Hey guys, Trace here, thanks for tuning in
today for some DNews.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.070
Monday was International Limerick Day, celebrating
the birthday of British writer Edward Lear,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.449
who popularized limericks in the mid-19th
century in his work, "A Book of Nonsense."

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.599
Rhymes are fun, son!

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.570
But rhyme is a lot more than just finishing
sentences with similar words.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.109
That is for the birds.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.550
There's alliteration and assonance.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.399
There's consonance and syllabic rhyme...

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.809
And more!

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.129
Rhyming has as much to do with the rhythm
of speech and language as it does with the

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.780
systematic use of certain vowels or consonants.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.239
Rhyme is common in Arabic and English -- parts
of the Koran and the Bible rhyme -- and the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.469
earliest example of rhyme is from the 10th
century in China.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.620
Because Japanese has so few sounds in their
language, their poetry is based on double

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.860
meanings and wordplay, while in China they
use the breadth of their tonal language to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.920
create a musical pattern.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.740
For humans rhyme is processed in language,
but also music.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.789
A study in Memory and Cognition found adults
who SANG while learning a new language picked

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.159
it up MUCH faster.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.350
A study in Infant Behavior and Development
asked pregnant women to read "The Cat in the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.549
Hat" aloud every day of their third trimester.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.340
After birth, newborns responded when they
heard the words from "The Cat in the Hat"

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.340
again!

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.340
Humans love rhyme time!

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.719
As regular DNews viewers will know, MUSIC
has a HUGE influence on the human brain, with

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.840
rhyme connected deeply with our expression
of music.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.299
We've been built with an understanding of
music, and though related, rhyme is a little

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.299
different.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.899
Using various brain scanners, researchers
at Stanford found Beta and Gamma brain waves

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.830
correlate or sync up while subjects listened
to music.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.490
When listening to rhythm and rhyme we naturally
try to predict where the next will fall.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.710
Separately, a study published in the journal
Nature pointed an fMRI at the brains of men

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.180
and women to see how they processed rhyming
differently.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.101
When brains heard regular language, they lit
up all over, but when they heard rhyme, it

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.770
was sublime.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.790
The fMRI showed activity in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex -- part of the executive

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.310
function and language processing.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.180
Interestingly, while women use BOTH sides
of their brain to process rhyme, men only

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.320
use the left side...

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.210
So TL;DR: WHY do we like rhyming?

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.300
Well, a study in Evolutionary Psychology puts
it like this: Men will to dress to impress,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.100
with both attire and language.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.690
Men have a penchant for becoming linguistically
loquacious when presented with an affable

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.880
member of their preferred procreative coital
captivation.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.580
One way to show wit is with words.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.300
Nothing preempts a pithy partner -- according
to the study, people would reach into their

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.070
vocabulary and pull out those rare, larger,
more complex words to show off their mental

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.680
fitness, and prove themselves worthy partners.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.510
If you recall, women use more of their brain
to process rhyme, so perhaps these are related?

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.020
Poetry is the language of love.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.420
Pity the perturbed peabrain, for their prose
cannot proliferate a predilection for their...

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.470
you know what I mean.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.490
Write your favorite rhymes in the comments
below, lyrics, raps, poems, you name it.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.440

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.920

"And Ae Fond Kiss," and you can find his and
