to me that it's a means whereby gay
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240
to me that it's a means whereby gay

that would decrease promiscuity which is
a public health problem although

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010
a public health problem although

the problem is is that it does seem to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
the problem is is that it does seem to
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580
the problem is is that it does seem to
me to be part of a wedge and it isn't
