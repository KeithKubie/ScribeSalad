New Shhhh-Nacks let you hide
 the shame eating you do to

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:57.023
fill the void left by
 such things as your
 parents, your dad,

00:00:57.056 --> 00:01:01.594
your mom, both your parents,
 your bottomless sad love life,

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:04.731
your less than great
hair, and all magazines.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:10.503

silent so are the chips.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.645
- [Narrator] If a chip
 falls in your stomach

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:22.682
and there's no one there to
 hear it, are you really sad?

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.553
New Shhh-nacks, when you're
 trying to feed a hunger

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.590
you can't let anyone know
about because you're humiliated

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.392
by basic human desires.

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:36.562
