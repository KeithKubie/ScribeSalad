[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:09.420
ARJITA SETHI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.505
Welcome back to "Public
Speaking Pro Tips"

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:14.990
with Speechless presented
by Google Developers.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.640
We help people turn the
mundane into memorable.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.390
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Challenges into insights.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.534
ARJITA SETHI: And presentations
into performances.

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:23.950
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Today we're going

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.580
to help you merge your
profession with your passion.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.270
ARJITA SETHI: And the way we do
that is with an exercise called

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.007
vennspiration.

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:32.840
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Vennspiration is visualized

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.640
with a Venn diagram intersecting
your talk topic with something

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.340
you love doing outside of work.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.410
ARJITA SETHI: And what
merges is a new way

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.990
to give your talk more energy
as well as making it more

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.457
universal for your audience.

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:47.040
CLAIRE SLATTERY: So
let's demonstrate.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.760
Arjita, first let's
have you tell me

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.260
about a project
you've worked on.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.610
We'll time box this
for 30 seconds.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.790
ARJITA SETHI: OK, I
was a physiotherapist.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.390
And as part of my job, I worked
as an antidoping official

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.230
at the Commonwealth
Games and ensured

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.990
that all the athletes
were not cheating and not

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.690
using any harmful substances.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.297
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
OK, now let's have

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:12.630
you talk about something
you're passionate about outside

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.570
of work.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.487
ARJITA SETHI: Well, does
it matter what it is?

00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:17.319
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Not
really, as long as it's

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.670
something that you love doing
and it's something active.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.842
ARJITA SETHI: OK, I guess
I'll talk about teaching.

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:22.800
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Great.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.710
30 seconds on the clock,
ready when you are.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.120
ARJITA SETHI: Well,
I love teaching.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.590
It's one of the most
innate desires of my life.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.740
Because every time I teach
something and the students

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.820
sit with me and there is
a sparkle in their eyes,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.490
it helps me understand
that I contributed

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700
to the growth of that person.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.192
And I love it.

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:46.150
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Great.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.370
Did you notice
anything different

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.350
between the two talks?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.360
ARJITA SETHI: Well,
it was more fun

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.920
to share my passion with you.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.310
And I felt like the
subject matter was easier

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.030
to talk about.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.530
CLAIRE SLATTERY: I
could sense that.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.100
I felt like when you described
the brightness in those kids'

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.760
eyes, I could feel you
be brighter as well.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.830
And that's actually what
happens to most people

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.100
when they get more excited
to talk about themselves

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.722
and their interests outside of
work than their actual jobs.

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:09.180
ARJITA SETHI: And
this is a problem

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.780
since most people
have to talk at work

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.330
in front of fellow
employees and clients

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.664
about business and not pleasure.

00:02:15.664 --> 00:02:18.246
CLAIRE SLATTERY: So that's why
you should combine the two when

00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:19.080
you get the chance.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.770
It breathes new
life into your talk

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.200
and makes it easier for
audiences to relate.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.110
ARJITA SETHI: OK,
so what do I do now?

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.770
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
First, start by saying

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.100
physiotherapy is like teaching.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.670
And from there, make
connections between the two.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.150
You'll be surprised at how
much they have in common.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.110
ARJITA SETHI: OK.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.850
CLAIRE SLATTERY: One
minute on the clock.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.490
Go.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.110
ARJITA SETHI:
Well, physiotherapy

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.170
is like teaching because
every patient is just

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.350
like a new student.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.930
Just like you assess
a patient, that's

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.330
when we assess students to
see the level of the learning.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.870
And the treatment protocol that
you build for every patient

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.892
is similar to the syllabus
for every student.

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:01.350
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
How did that feel?

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.891
ARJITA SETHI: ARJITA
SETHI: Honestly,

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.830
that felt really good.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.650
I never thought to
connect the two topics,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.499
but I can see how this would
be very valuable as a speaker.

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.540
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Exactly.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.170
Using similes and analogies
are really powerful.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.820
For example--

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.520
ARJITA SETHI: This deadline
is approaching as fast

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.810
as a bullet train.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.860
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Exactly.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.980
I could picture the train, and
that helps drive home the point

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.880
because metaphors are visual.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.980
They help make something
complicated easier

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.530
for an audience to
imagine and understand.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.840
And now, you know it only
takes a couple minutes total

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.060
to see where it can lead.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.570
You can pair any talk
with any passion or hobby

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.122
for endless combinations.

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:41.080
ARJITA SETHI: It's like
playing a slot machine.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.288
CLAIRE SLATTERY: I like that.

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.180
Vennspiration is like
playing a slot machine.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.620
I see what you did there.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.995
ARJITA SETHI: I'm
a fast learner.

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:49.080
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And I'm
sure you are as well.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.070
Now it's your turn.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.187
Go ahead and make your
own vennspiration video.

00:03:52.187 --> 00:03:53.770
ARJITA SETHI: Take
your video and post

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.054
it to social with the
hashtag #DevelopYourVoice.

00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:59.220
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And remember,
