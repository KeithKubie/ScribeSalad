00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.750
- [Instructor] You can view this diagram

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.730
as an org chart of the government

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.700
of the United States, and what we have

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.750
highlighted in this blue-green color,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.920
that is the executive branch,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.970
the things that fall under
the executive branch.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.500
And you can't even see everything,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.710
a lot of it falls off of the screen.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.500
When you see something like this

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.652
with roughly 2.6 million people,

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:22.750
part of that executive branch,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.600
part of the government's bureaucracy,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.270
and with the president at the top

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.690
of the executive branch,
you might get the idea

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.110
that the president is quite powerful.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.180
And you would be correct.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.135
The president has a powerful role,

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.760
but there're some factors about how

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.380
the executive branch is structured

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.110
and its size that might keep the president

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.720
from being quite as powerful

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.620
as you might first believe.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.520
First of all, managing 2.6 million people

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.520
is no easy task.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.180
Ask anyone who even has to manage

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.210
an organization of 20 or 30 people,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.990
much less 2,000 people or 200,000 people,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.430
it can get quite difficult.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.570
You have to manage through
many layers of management.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.840
The other interesting thing

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.200
that makes the president's role

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.550
in the executive branch different

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.701
than, say, the CEO of a corporation,

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:12.650
is that yes, the president can make

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.840
many appointments, in fact, the president

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.820
can make several thousand appointments

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.370
and most of those appointments

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.870
sit atop the various departments.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.280
But most of the bureaucracy,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.300
the federal bureaucracy,
most of this 2.6 million,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.560
they are not appointed by the president.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.470
Those are professionals in their field,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.110
they are part of the civil service system.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.940
So, as they make various judgements

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.690
and interpret laws in certain ways

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.800
and execute the machinery
of the bureaucracy,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.560
they might not be completely in lockstep

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.490
with the goals of the president,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.930
the goals that the president has

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.550
for their administration.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.620
Related to that, the senior appointments,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.950
especially the cabinet secretaries,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.070
those serve at the
pleasure of the president.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.920
If the president becomes
unhappy with them,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.000
if the president finds
that they're disloyal

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.520
in some way, the president

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.040
can choose to have them leave,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.790
essentially fire them,
although in the news

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.260
you'll sometimes see as the president

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.300
accepts their resignation.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.030
But as you get further
down the bureaucracy,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.100
the president does not have that control.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.270
The Supreme Court has
ruled that for officers

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.380
the president can fire them.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.910
But as you go down into
the regular ranking file,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.580
the majority of this 2.6 million people,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.140
the president can't
fire them without cause.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.240
The president can't fire them just because

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.930
they don't like those employees

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.520
or they feel that those employees

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.070
don't completely agree with the president.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.400
It has to be for a just cause.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.430
This is why you'll see that some parts

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.740
of the executive branch, say,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.630
from the Department of Justice,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.290
they might have investigations

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.370
into things that the president

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.960
does not want them to investigate into.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.600
Often times they will
investigate the president.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.770
This happened during the
Nixon administration,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.670
part of the Watergate investigations.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.180
This happened under the
Clinton administration.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.190
This is happening at
the time of this video

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.140
as part of the Trump administration,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.010
the Mueller investigation.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.670
And the president can't just willy-nilly

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.787
fire folks if they say,

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:07.280
"Hey, why are you
looking into my matters?"

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.740
because of this principle.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.850
So they can't fire just anyone

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.060
within the executive branch.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.220
Now, what leverage does the president have

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.330
to maybe exert more control

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.840
than the things that
I have just described?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.480
Well, of course, I've mentioned

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.130
the appointments that
the president can make,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.750
and this could number

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.720
in the several thousands of appointments.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.170
I've seen estimates as high as 4,000

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.880
appointments that the president can make.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.603
They can fire, the
president can fire officers.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.320
So these would be the senior
political appointments,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.200
things like the cabinet secretaries,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.130
the people at the head

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.110
of these various departments.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.320
But even that could have

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.070
some significant political consequences.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.450
The president could try to shift

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.970
responsibilities from one part

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.520
of the bureaucracy to another,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.130
or shift budget from one part

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.990
of the bureaucracy to another.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.130
But this is also not so easy,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.350
'cause once again it's a large

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.180
and complex bureaucracy.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.280
The president would have to do it

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.020
through many layers of management.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.180
And at the end of the
day things like budget,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.990
which department gets how much money,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.670
this is, at the end of the day,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.740
something that the Congress will decide

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.370
as once again part of the separation

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.040
of powers that we've talked about

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.840
in multiple videos.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.350
Another thing that the
president can try to do,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.470
and we've talked about
this in other videos,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.850
are the idea of executive orders.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.800
Executive orders often times can

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.480
be a president trying to clarify

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.770
how a law should be interpreted,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.500
how it should be executed upon

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.550
by the bureaucracy, if the president feels

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.850
that its bureaucracy is
not interpreting laws

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.400
in the way that meets
the president's goals.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.770
So I will leave you there.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.580
The president clearly the most powerful

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.610
office in the United States,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.900
on top of a 2.6 million person bureaucracy

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.730
that's part of the executive branch.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.910
But the president is not a king,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.387
the president is not a
chief executive officer

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:12.650
of a for-profit company
where they can have

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.110
a lot more control.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.260
They're limited by just

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.310
the inertia of the bureaucracy.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.580
They're limited by the ability

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.790
to hire and fire people.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.100
They're limited by the complexity

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.110
of the bureaucracy.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.520
But they do have some
tools at their disposal,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.350
where they can try to shape the direction

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.100
and the goals of these

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.413
2.6 million federal employees.
