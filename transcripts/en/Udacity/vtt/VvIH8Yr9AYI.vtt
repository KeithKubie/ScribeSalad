00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.070
The fundamental design goal of the internet

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.360
was multiplexed utilization of existing interconnected networks.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.850
There are two important aspects to this

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.490
goal. One is multiplexing or sharing. So one

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.910
of the fundamental challenges that the internet

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.670
technologies needed to solve was the shared

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.310
use of a single communications channel. The

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.840
second major part of this fundamental goal is

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.200
the interconnection of existing networks. These

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.080
two subproblems had two very important solutions.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.060
Statistical multiplexing or packet switching was

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.330
invented to solve the sharing problem. And,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.170
the narrow waist was designed to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.470
solve the problem of interconnecting networks. Let's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.520
talk about each of these now. In turn. We'll first talk about packet switching
