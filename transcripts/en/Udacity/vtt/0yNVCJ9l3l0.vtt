00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, let's think through this a bit.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.500
So, first of all, at each single branch, we have  four possible choices.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.000
So we can take this branch, this branch, this branch, or this branch.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So we have four choices, a total of n/3 times.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So that's 4  4, times on and on, times 4, a total of n/3 times.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now I had you pull out to the nth power here, so let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So this is really 4^1/3 to the nth power, and that is approximately 1.587 to the nth power.
