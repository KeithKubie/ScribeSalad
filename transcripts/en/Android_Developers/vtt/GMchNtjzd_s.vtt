NIKLAS JANSEN: Why was
audio so important?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.460
I'd like to understand why audio
is so important for Blinkist

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.450
is first, you have to understand
commuting and traffic jams.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.520
So this is the car
version of a traffic jam.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.270
Because we're in New
York, I thought maybe

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.870
we'd also look at the human
version of a traffic jam.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.060
Maybe let's do a quick
Q&amp;A. Who of you commutes

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.680
more than 30 minutes per day?

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:27.920
Like most people.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.711
What are you doing?

00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.850
Are you consuming content
when you're commuting?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.150
Who is listening to
audio when they commute?

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.220
Other question--
like five years ago,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.557
did you listen to audio
when you were commuting?

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:42.140
So that's very
interesting, because we

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.590
started as a text-only company,
just producing text content.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.930
And we started speaking
to a lot of customers.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.800
So text worked well.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.440
We kept growing, but
not crazy growth.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.935
So we started talking to
customers to understand,

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:55.310
are we missing
something in order

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.190
to really convert more
people to subscription

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.965
or to retain those
subscribers for longer?

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:02.090
So we started talking to
a lot of people in the US,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.048
because the US is naturally
our biggest market.

00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:05.880
We are a German,
Berlin-based company,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.540
but US was our biggest
market from day one.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.260
And what we realized is that a
lot of our customers and users

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.896
would tell us that,
hey, I like what you do,

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:16.520
but I don't have time
to read Blinkist.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.561
I already have-- I'm
reading "The New York Times"

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.480
or "The Wall Street Journal."

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.160
I don't have time
to read Blinkist.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.250
But actually, I'm commuting
every day 30 minutes,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.625
an hour, like two hours,
and I would have time

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:29.500
to listen to content.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.458
I would really love to
learn something new when

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.822
I commute in my car or in the
subway, but there's no product

00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:36.530
or there's no offering
which really helps

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.030
me to learn something new.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.570
And this clear insight really
struck with us, saying,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.415
oh, look.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:43.040
There's a need.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.248
People want to learn something
new when they commute,

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.936
but there's not a real good
chance for them to do that,

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:49.310
because there's
not a real option

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.160
for them to acquire
new knowledge when

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.682
basically yes, they say
their hands are busy

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:55.640
but their mind is free.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.280
So you can't really read,
because you're moving.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.200
You could listen, but there
is no option for that.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.650
So what we did is we
talked a lot about that.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.690
So having this clear
insight, nobody

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.120
would say, well, go off
and try something out

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.300
and just build a product
and see if it works.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.190
Back at this point, we
were maybe 15 people,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.990
so it felt like a very big
decision for us to say, OK,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.806
we're going to start
producing audio content.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:20.180
We're going to
change the product

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.000
from a text-only product
to an audio product.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.460
And as it is with
these big decisions,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.730
we kept pushing off this
decision for a while.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.325
At some point, we were sitting
in a room-- six, seven people--

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:33.200
and we talked about the
topic of audio again.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.420
And at this time, growth
had slowed down a little bit

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.710
in terms of new subscribers.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.850
And we said, OK.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.550
It felt like, OK,
it's now or never.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.501
Either we try audio
now or we will never

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.750
have a chance to try it again.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.590
So we were sitting in this room
discussing the topic of audio

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.419
again.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.960
And I don't know
really what changed,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.430
but suddenly everyone's super
excited saying, yeah, let's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.930
try it.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.050
Let's just do it.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.760
So we went off and said,
OK, let's try audio.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.700
Let's make a plan.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520
But what's very
important is that we

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.560
tried to do this in a
very structured way.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.515
So we basically
set two principles,

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:06.770
or we created a framework
for us that said first,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.570
let's be very clear
about our goals

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.220
and expectations of audio.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.990
And second, let's
make it very easy

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.190
for us to get out of it if
our expectations are not met.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.000
So what the first
one means is let's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.340
be very clear about what
we expect from audio.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.290
It's we said, OK,
first, it's going

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.510
to increase the usability
of the product, which

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.950
means more people are likely
to convert to Blinkist,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.239
because there's now room.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.030
There is a time when
they can use Blinkist,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.220
and therefore, they would
convert to the product.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.310
Second, we thought with
audio, the perceived value

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.590
of the product might be
higher, so we could actually

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.770
charge more for Blinkist
than we could charge before.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.130
In terms of make
it easy to get out,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.420
we said to ourselves, OK,
instead of investing a million

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.260
to that, building a new
team, hiring people,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.510
let's do a different approach.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.510
Let's find a couple of
people within the company

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.150
that are super excited and
passionate about audio.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.620
Let's give them a little bit--

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.750
just create an outline
of what we need in order

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.515
to go to the market
with an audio product,

00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:03.140
and then let's give
them full autonomy.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.970
Let them run and
figure something out,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.136
and what they will build
over three or four months,

00:04:07.136 --> 00:04:09.260
we're going to launch, and
then see if audio works.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.230
So what we did--

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.530
we had just five people
across the company.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.050
One person from content,
one person from marketing,

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.620
one person from tech,
all excited about audio.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.769
They were musicians or
podcast aficionados back then.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.050
And we said, OK, here
is a small budget.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.630
We need 50 audio
versions to launch that.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.030
We need an audio
player on the app.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.350
You have like three months.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.980
Try it out.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.910
And they just
like-- because they

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.780
were so passionate
and motivated,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.390
and excited about it, you
didn't need to motivate them.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.940
They were just basically working
like crazy for three months

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.520
because they really wanted to
move forward with the audio.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.430
And this is really how
we could set up audio

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.760
to test for audio
without any new hires,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.690
still with a company
of 15 people,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.500
and really basically creating
a second product-- a product

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.240
we didn't have before.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.865
So end of 2014, we
finally launched audio,

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:58.240
and this is just three months
after we made the decision.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.670
So the decision we
kept pushing off

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.150
for nearly a year, because it
felt like such a big project

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.280
and such a big commitment.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.700
In the end, we were able to make
it happen within three months.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.990
And as George said, this
launch changed the trajectory

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.120
of the business and of
the company completely,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.219
and I think it's the main
driver for the revenue growth

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.760
we have seen in the
last three years.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.620
It grew revenue, or it was
important for the business

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.160
side for two reasons.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.790
Or it was so important because
it increased the lifetime

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.340
value of our customers
tremendously,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.986
and this mostly for two reasons.

00:05:34.986 --> 00:05:36.860
The first one, and this
is an old screenshot,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.100
but what you can see, we
introduced a new subscription

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.960
tier called Premium.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.930
We were not as smart
as the guys at Tinder,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.846
so we didn't pay too
much attention on naming.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.450
We just said we had
Plus and Premium.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.951
That sounds really cool.

00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:50.450
If I had to make
the decision again,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.500
I probably would
do it differently.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.880
Maybe something like Gold and--

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.890
So you still are number one.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.874
We are trying, but
maybe next year.

00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:01.790
But what is important?

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.420
We said OK.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.445
As I said, we wanted
to increase price,

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:07.490
so we created a new
price tier, which

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.200
was way higher than
the initial price tier,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.080
so it was more than
50% more expensive

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.252
than the initial price
that we had before.

00:06:14.252 --> 00:06:16.460
And what's also important
is we also raised the price

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.760
for the non-audio price, too.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.890
So just to make this clear,
Premium includes audio.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.355
Plus didn't include audio.

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.730
And we also had
a Premium feature

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.300
connect to Evernote
and [INAUDIBLE] person.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.950
So we increased the price
so the price for Premium

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.620
was 50% higher than
the initial price,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.870
and we also increased the price
for the Plus subscription,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.770
which didn't change at all.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.395
It was the same
subscription as before,

00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:41.020
but we felt like now the product
has a higher perceived value,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.750
so we increased that
price too, which

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.740
just was really important for us
in terms of increasing lifetime

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.700
value.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.460
Maybe a note on pricing and
how we arrived at these price

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.240
points is pretty--

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.480
there's no magic behind it.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.860
We basically just looked
at comparable products

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.380
like Headspace back
then and note, oh, they

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.645
charge around $80 per year.

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:05.040
And we were charging
$40 at this time,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.860
so we were basically
under-priced

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.120
compared to other products.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.970
So let's just do $80 as
well, because what we learned

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.850
is that pricing
is often relative.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.990
It's very hard for
you to say OK, I'm

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.410
willing to pay this amount of
money for this type of value

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.850
I'm getting from this product.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.450
But what people are very
good at is comparing.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.420
So they say, oh, I pay
$10 for Netflix per month

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.530
and I get unlimited movies and
series, which is $120 per year.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.520
So I'll pay $80 for
Blinkist, where I get maybe

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.070
unlimited book summaries
and text and audio.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.672
That sounds like a fair deal.

00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:43.130
So this is how we
got to the price,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.200
by just looking at what
our peers are charging

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.060
and go with this price
point, because this

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.930
is what people would expect.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.290
So that's the first point
why it really helped

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.530
increase the lifetime value.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.530
The second point, and
it's very obvious as well,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.696
is just increased retention.

00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:57.470
Because audio created
a new way for people

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.630
to consume content
at times where there

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.280
was no competition back then.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.380
So people who used
audio sticked around

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.360
for longer, and
therefore, renewals

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.120
increased, and therefore,
lifetime value increased.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.359
Today, audio is really at the
center of the whole company

00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:15.150
and of the product.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.550
So we have the
audio product, which

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.130
is the main way how people
consume content today

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.270
at Blinkist.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.380
We launched podcasts.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.320
We have one really well-working
podcast called "Simplify"

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.540
with more than a couple
of million of downloads

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.670
where we talk to book
authors about their life

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.720
and about their books.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.647
We also have actions
for Google Assistant.

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:35.980
I think this is how it's called.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.480
Right?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.530
I don't call it Skills.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.799
That would be another company.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.583
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.250
Just the way we
think about audio--

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.460
audio is really the center
of all products we build now,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.070
and audio is also
a big, big topic

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.220
for innovation at Blinkist.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.970
So in the Blinkist style--

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.240
so that's the story of
how we got to audio.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.660
How we started, and I tried
to distill the key messages

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.702
from this talk, and what
we are doing at Blinkist

00:09:02.702 --> 00:09:04.743
is we are distilling the
key insights from books.

00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:07.290
I tried to distill the key
insights from this talk.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.040
And the key message of
this presentation is--

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.012
and excuse me for this
very long sentence,

00:09:13.012 --> 00:09:14.970
but you might know that
Germans like long words

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.030
and long sentences.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.720
I have to read it
because it's so long.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.570
But it is, "User-centric
product innovation can help you

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.390
to unlock value by expanding
your value proposition."

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.980
Laura, you should have one.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.537
Maybe four.

00:09:27.037 --> 00:09:27.930
But this is like--

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.013
what I mean by that is I
think it's very important

00:09:30.013 --> 00:09:32.160
when you think about
building new products

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.489
and try to do innovation that
you focus on your customers.

00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:37.530
Listen to your customers.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.090
Try to understand
their problems.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.920
Try to find needs that
are not served yet,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.230
rather than approaching
this from a business side.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.450
Saying oh yeah, it would
be cool if we had that.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.950
And then try to
build that, and then

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.210
try to charge more for that.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.910
That won't work.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.784
But if you really try
to understand customers

00:09:50.784 --> 00:09:53.430
and what they are facing,
what problems they have

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.960
and what you can
solve, then this

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.360
is a good opportunity
to introduce this.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.720
And also increase prices,
which then unlocks value

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.696
for your company and
for the business.

00:10:05.696 --> 00:10:08.070
The first one-- the Blink
number one of this presentation

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.380
is, the "impact is hard
to estimate beforehand."

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.750
So as you see for
audio, we pushed it off.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.370
Then we said, OK, we'd do it.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.690
We didn't know if it's
going to work out or not.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.840
So what we knew is there
is a need for audio,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.214
but we didn't know
if Blinkist is

00:10:20.214 --> 00:10:23.670
the right product and the right
solution to serve this need.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.220
So you could discuss
this for years.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:26.780
We did.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.900
Or just try it.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.450
And I think it's important
that you do research,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.556
but I believe strongly
in that at some point,

00:10:32.556 --> 00:10:33.930
you have to trust
your intuition,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.940
or listen to your
gut saying OK, you

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.447
have to collect a lot of data.

00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:39.780
Look at that, but then you
have to make a decision based

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.180
on that.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.596
So what we do at
Blinkist, we call

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:43.830
this data-driven
intuition, which basically

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.190
means we collect data, but the
data won't give you the answer.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.830
You have to still make a
leap of faith at some point,

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.050
because you will never
have perfect data to make

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.850
a decision.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.470
And sometimes, timing.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.910
Often, timing is
super important.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.120
So one thing when
it comes to audio

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.840
at Blinkist, what
is important is

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.980
when you look at when
we launched audio,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.960
it's end of November 2014, so we
were working for three months.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.400
So we started in September
more or less, working on audio.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.100
In October 2014, the Serial
podcast was launched,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.140
and Serial podcast,
in hindsight,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.590
is probably the podcast
that opened up audio again

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.110
for a whole generation or
for basically everyone.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.789
And that's very
interesting, because we

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:25.830
didn't create this trend.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.422
But we were basically
at the same time,

00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:29.880
maybe arriving at
the same insight,

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.422
or just there at the right time.

00:11:31.422 --> 00:11:33.005
Because suddenly,
audio was the thing,

00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:34.980
and everyone was looking
for audio products.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.563
Without Serial, I'm not sure if
Blinkist audio would have been

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.120
that successful, to be honest.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.894
But you don't know before and
you just have to try that.

00:11:42.894 --> 00:11:44.310
So timing, obviously
is important.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.870
But without trying,
you will never

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.300
be able to capitalize on trends.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.992
The second key insight here
is "Start to learn by doing."

00:11:54.992 --> 00:11:56.200
"Keep the down side covered."

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.110
So I think what we try to
avoid is just building business

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.730
plans just creating these Excel
sheets and then say yes or no.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.920
But say OK, there
is ideas we have.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.570
Let's test it.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.660
But let's test it so that we
have the down side covered.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.280
We don't invest
in the whole team.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.350
We build a lean experiment
with what we think

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.780
is needed to validate that,
and then we run with that,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.640
and then we see if we want
to double down on it or not.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.110
And I think for us,
this squad that we used,

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.520
assembled of these five
people, was really crucial

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.950
for the success of the project,
because these people were

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.950
passionate about it.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.190
So we didn't need to
motivate them, saying hey,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.148
you're working on this.

00:12:31.148 --> 00:12:33.070
Now please can you come
and make it happen?

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.020
They made it happen because
they wanted to make it happen,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.311
and they spent all the time
doing research about audio.

00:12:37.311 --> 00:12:39.632
They spent all the time
going into the details

00:12:39.632 --> 00:12:41.590
to find a really, really
good audio experience.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.040
They spent all the time
on figuring out, fixing

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.510
all the bugs in
the audio player,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.520
so we had a really good
product for a first version,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.770
but still in a very lean way.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.800
The third insight is,
"When it comes to pricing,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.430
users often create their
own pricing analogies

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.180
for your product."

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.990
So as I said before, you can be
very scientific about pricing.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.039
This might work.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:03.580
I don't know.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.330
We never tried it.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.860
For us what worked is
just looking at the market

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.060
and finding comparables,
because this is what,

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.890
in our experience, people will
mostly make pricing decisions

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:13.390
based on.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.390
They will look what other
products are charging.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.670
They know, based on that,
they will make a decision

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.786
if your product is
cheap or expensive.

00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:23.035
Of course, if you're in a
market where basically there

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:26.030
is no comparable product, then
you're in a very good position,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.070
but if you're in
entertainment, education,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.320
there are comparable products.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.046
And the default
comparable product

00:13:31.046 --> 00:13:33.170
for everything that has to
do with content, I feel,

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.921
is either Spotify or
Netflix, because this

00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:37.128
is what people will always
compare you to in the end.

00:13:37.128 --> 00:13:39.102
Because they know what
value they get there,

00:13:39.102 --> 00:13:40.810
and if you try to be
much more expensive,

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.690
then either you need
something very, very exclusive

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.890
or a very, very small market
niche where people say,

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.800
OK, I need this
for my profession

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.770
and I'm paying for
whatever is needed.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.160
Or you try to stick
within the frame what

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.920
other companies are charging.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.980
The last insight.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.800
Blink number four is,
"Be ready to fail."

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.452
Even the best ideas can fail.

00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:04.160
So as I said, we didn't
know if audio was

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.827
going to be successful or not.

00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:07.910
For us, it was successful.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.710
But of course, you can fail.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.170
And we had another
big experiment.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.780
We believed strongly in
community at Blinkist.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.080
We talked to customers
again, and we

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.740
thought we heard
them telling us,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.910
hey, it would be cool if you
could have sharing features

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.416
and I could comment and I
could share within Blinkist.

00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:28.040
And we thought cool, because the
business is very interested in

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.780
that too, so if we had a viral
growth component at Blinkist,

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.780
we might grow faster and
we don't have to invest

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.522
that much money marketing.

00:14:34.522 --> 00:14:36.980
So I think in hindsight, it
was more like the business side

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.350
speaking and us just
hearing something we

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.120
wanted to hear about community.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.350
We launched it.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.140
We worked six months on this
and it was probably the worst

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.095
feature we ever launched.

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.470
Probably because
we didn't really

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.803
pay attention to our customers,
but more to the business

00:14:50.803 --> 00:14:52.730
interest, and it
failed spectacularly.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.580
So that can happen, and I think
just you can learn from that

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.780
and try to do it
better next time.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.230
What's very important, as
I said, be ready to fail.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.170
Therefore, start small.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.150
Don't bet the whole
company on one idea,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.160
but just find a way
to do it in a way

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.800
that you can always exit
easily without making

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.690
it too hard to get out of it.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.190
Thanks.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.940
