00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
something like three weeks but he
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.670
something like three weeks but he
continued to make videos and the only

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
continued to make videos and the only
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010
continued to make videos and the only
reason that his channels monetization

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020

and that strike got removed was
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.420
and that strike got removed was
essentially because he made a video

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
essentially because he made a video
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.069

what's up with this and because of his

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
what's up with this and because of his
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479
what's up with this and because of his
large numbers on his channel the outcry

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
large numbers on his channel the outcry
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160
large numbers on his channel the outcry
was loud enough for YouTube to hear and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
was loud enough for YouTube to hear and
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.140
was loud enough for YouTube to hear and
fix the problem so there are two

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
fix the problem so there are two
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430
fix the problem so there are two
problems there

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
problems there
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.360
problems there
for in my mind for one obviously the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370
for in my mind for one obviously the
 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.280
for in my mind for one obviously the
problem is there's these unwarranted

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
problem is there's these unwarranted
 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.590
problem is there's these unwarranted
claims and strikes going around the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600
claims and strikes going around the
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.360
claims and strikes going around the
other problem is that YouTube only

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
other problem is that YouTube only
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.360
other problem is that YouTube only
changed and helped fix these issues for

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
changed and helped fix these issues for
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.130
changed and helped fix these issues for
both of those channels because they were

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
both of those channels because they were
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.130
both of those channels because they were
big enough to make a public outcry and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
big enough to make a public outcry and
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.880
big enough to make a public outcry and
that's the worst situation in my mind

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
that's the worst situation in my mind
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920
that's the worst situation in my mind
because there's tons of smaller channels

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930
because there's tons of smaller channels
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.710

problem who have gotten their channels
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.550
problem who have gotten their channels
