00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.950
In the last video we learned--
or at least I showed you, I

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.580
don't know if you've learned it
yet, but we'll learn it in

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:05.890
this video.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.010
But we learned that the force
on a moving charge from a

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.020
magnetic field, and it's a
vector quantity, is equal to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.320
the charge-- on the moving
charge-- times the cross

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.260
product of the velocity of the
charge and the magnetic field.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.720
And we use this to show you that
the units of a magnetic

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.880
field-- this is not a beta, it's
a B-- but the units of a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.300
magnetic field are the tesla--
which is abbreviated with a

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.380
capital T-- and that
is equal to newton

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.000
seconds per coulomb meters.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.520
So let's see if we can apply
that to an actual problem.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.525
So let's say that I have a
magnetic field, and let's say

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:55.630
it's popping out
of the screen.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.440
I'm making this up on the
fly, so I hope the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.960
numbers turn out.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.860
It's inspired by a problem that
I read in Barron's AP

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.380
calculus book.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.710
So if I want to draw a bunch of
vectors or a vector field

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.400
that's popping out of the
screen, I could just do the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.300
top of the arrowheads.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.580
I'll draw them in magenta.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.230
So let's say I have
a vector field.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.810
So you can imagine
a bunch of arrows

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.420
popping out of the screen.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.600
I'll just draw a couple of them
just so you get the sense

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.790
that it's a field.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.050
It pervades the space.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.390
These are a bunch of
arrows popping out.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.320
And the field is popping out.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.650
And the magnitude of the field,
let's say it is, I

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.170
don't know, let's say
it is 0.5 teslas.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.530
Let's say I have some proton
that comes speeding along.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.130
And it's speeding along at a
velocity-- so the velocity of

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.350
the proton is equal to
6 times 10 to the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.960
seventh meters per second.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.590
And that is actually about 1/5
of the velocity or 1/5 of the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.340
speed of light.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.060
So we're pretty much in the
relativistic realm, but we

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180
won't go too much into
relativity because then the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.910
mass of the proton increases,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.250
We just assume that the mass
hasn't increased significantly

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.020
at this point.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.970
So we have this proton going at
a 1/5 of the speed of light

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.040
and it's crossing through
this magnetic field.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.340
So the first question is what is
the magnitude and direction

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.980
of the force on this proton
from this magnetic field?

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.280
Well, let's figure out the
magnitude first. So how can we

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.320
figure out the magnitude?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.100
Well, first of all, what is
the charge on a proton?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.170
Well, we don't know it right
now, but my calculator has

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.710
that stored in it.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.970
And if you have a TI graphing
calculator, your calculator

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.300
would also have it
stored in it.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.330
So let's just write that down
as a variable right now.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.520
So the magnitude of the force on
the particle is going to be

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.110
equal to the charge of a
proton-- I'll call it Q sub

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.740
p-- times the magnitude of the
velocity, 6 times 10 to the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.150
seventh meters per second.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.070
We're using all the
right units.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.560
If this was centimeters
we'd probably want to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.020
convert it to meters.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.970
6 times 10 to the seventh
meters per second.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.040
And then times the magnitude of
the magnetic field, which

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.590
is 0.5 soon. teslas-- I didn't
have to write the units there,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.200
but I'll do it there--
times sine of the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.510
angle between them.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.480
I'll write that down
right now.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.770
But let me ask you a question.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.650
If the magnetic field is
pointing straight out of the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.760
screen-- and you're going to
have to do a little bit of

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.320
three-dimensional visualization
now-- and this

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.000
particle is moving in the plane
of the field, what is

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.950
the angle between them?

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.280
If you visualize it in three
dimensions, they're actually

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.410
orthogonal to each other.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.590
They're at right angles
to each other.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.280
Because these vectors are
popping out of the screen.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.630
They are perpendicular to the
plane that defines the screen,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.459
while this proton is moving
within this plane.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.050
So the angle between them, if
you can visualize it in three

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.530
dimensions, is 90 degrees.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.470
Or they're perfectly
perpendicular.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.660
And when things are perfectly
perpendicular, what is the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.040
sine of 90 degrees?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.040
Or the sine of pi over 2?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.330
Either way, if you want
to deal in radians.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.680
Well, it's just equal to 1.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.690
The whole-- hopefully--
intuition you got about the

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.990
cross product is we only want to
multiply the components of

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.580
the two vectors that are
perpendicular to each other.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.110
And that's why we have
the sine of theta.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.310
But if the entire vectors are
perpendicular to each other,

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.130
then we just multiply the
magnitude of the vector.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.910
Or if you even forget to do
that, you say, oh well,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.930
they're perpendicular.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.900
They're at 90 degree angles.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.870
Sine of 90 degrees?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.470
Well, that's just 1.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.300
So this is just 1.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.900
So the magnitude of the force
is actually pretty easy to

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.990
calculate, if we know the
charge on a proton.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.410
And let's see if we can figure
out the charge on a proton.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.490
Let me get the trusty
TI-85 out.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.780
Let me clear there,
just so you can

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.460
appreciate the TI-85 store.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.400
If you press second and
constant-- that's second and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.330
then the number 4.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.950
They have a little constant
above it.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.840
You get their constant
functions.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.590
Or their values.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.590
And you say the built-in--
I care about the built-in

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.900
functions, so let me press F1.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.780
And they have a bunch of-- you
know, this is Avogadro's

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.760
number, they have a bunch of
interesting-- this is the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.320
charge of an electron.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.540
Which is actually the
same thing as

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.420
the charge of a proton.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.670
So let's use that.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.380
Electrons-- just remember--
electrons and protons have

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.210
offsetting charges.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.380
One's positive and
one's negative.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.050
It's just that a proton
is more massive.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.880
That's how they're different.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.020
And of course, it's positive.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.270
Let's just confirm that that's
the charge of an electron.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.690
But that's also the charge
of a proton.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.830
And actually, this positive
value is the

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.240
exact charge of a proton.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.670
They should have maybe put a
negative number here, but all

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.180
we care about is the value.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.920
So let's use that again.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.040
The charge of an electron-- and
it is positive, so that's

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.280
the same thing as the charge for
a proton-- times 6 times

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.290
10 to the seventh-- 6 E 7, you
just press that EE button on

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.790
your calculator-- times
0.5 teslas.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.440
Make sure all your units are
in teslas, meters, and

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.380
coulombs, and then your result
will be in newtons.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:49.630
And you get 4.8 times 10 to
the negative 12 newtons.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.950
Let me write that down.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:07:03.150
So the magnitude of this force
is equal to 4.8 times 10 to

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.610
the minus 12 newtons.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.950
So that's the magnitude.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.760
Now what is the direction?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.440
What is the direction
of this force?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.750
Well, this you is where we break
out-- we put our pens

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.480
down if we're right handed, and
we use our right hand rule

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.950
to figure out the direction.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.820
So what do we have to do?

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.460
So when you take something
crossed something, the first

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.880
thing in the cross product is
your index finger on your

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.000
right hand.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.315
And then the second thing is
your middle finger pointed at

00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:35.570
a right angle with your
index finger.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.930
Let's see if I can do this.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.100
So I want my index finger
on my right hand to

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.930
point to the right.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.070
But I want my middle finger
to point upwards.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.780
Let me see if I can
pull that off.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.220
So my right hand is going to
look something like this.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.470
And my hand is brown.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.260
So my right hand is going to
look something like this.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.780
My index finger is pointing in
the direction of the velocity

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.990
vector, while my middle finger
is pointing the direction of

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.720
the magnetic field.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.030
So my index finger is going to
point straight up, so all you

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.510
see is the tip of it.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:23.860
And then my other fingers are
just going to go like that.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.710
And then my thumb is
going to do what?

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.850
My thumb is going-- this is the
heel of my thumb-- and so

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.770
my thumb is going to be at a
right angle to both of them.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.470
So my thumb points
down like this.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.909
This is often the
hardest part.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.390
Just making sure you get your
hand visualization right with

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.970
the cross product.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.680
So just as a review, this
is the direction of v.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.990
This is the direction of
the magnetic field.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.670
It's popping out.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.830
And so if I arrange my right
hand like that, my thumb

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.330
points down.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.560
So this is the direction
of the force.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.860
So as this particle moves to the
right with some velocity,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.120
there's actually going to
be a downward force.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.950
Downward on this plane.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.110
So the force is going to
move in this direction.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.730
So what's going to happen?

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.900
Well, what happens-- if you
remember a little bit about

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.620
your circular motion and your
centripetal acceleration and

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.620
all that-- what happens when you
have a force perpendicular

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.060
to velocity?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.720
Well, think about it.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.490
If you have a force here and the
velocity is like that, if

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.550
the particles-- it'll
be deflected a

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.460
little bit to the right.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.820
And then since the force
is always going to be

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.030
perpendicular to the velocity
vector, the force is going to

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.080
charge like that.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.420
So the particle is actually
going to go in a circle.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.750
As long as it's in the magnetic
field, the force

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.120
applied to the particle by the
magnetic field is going to be

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.300
perpendicular to the velocity
of the particle.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.150
So the velocity of the
particle-- so it's going to

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.660
actually be like a centripetal
force on the particle.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.530
So the particle is going
to go into a circle.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.150
And in the next video we'll
actually figure out the radius

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.140
of that circle.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.500
And just one thing I want
to let you think about.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:13.370
It's kind of weird or spooky
to me that the force on a

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.660
moving particle-- it doesn't
matter about

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.710
the particle's mass.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.500
It just matters the particle's
velocity and charge.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.840
So it's kind of a strange
phenomenon that the faster you

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.600
move through a magnetic field--
or at least if you're

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.850
charged, if you're a charged
particle-- the faster you move

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.560
through a magnetic field, the
more force that magnetic field

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.230
is going to apply to you.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.950
It seems a little bit, you know,
how does that magnetic

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.420
field know how fast
you're moving?

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.030
But anyway, I'll leave
you with that.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.530
In the next video we'll
explore this magnetic

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.560
phenomenon a little bit deeper.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.810
