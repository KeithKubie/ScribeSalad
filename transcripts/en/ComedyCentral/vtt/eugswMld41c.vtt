&gt;&gt; WHEN WE GET TO FOR THE WIN, I
JUST WANNA REMIND YOU ABOUT

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:25.112
SLAVERY.

HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT?

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:36.390
RON! IT'S NOT MY FAULT! IT WAS
THE 1800s, I WAS DRUNK AND

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:39.860
EVERYONE WAS DOING IT.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.862
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:45.933

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Chris: SAD NEWS:

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:04.818
BASEBALL LEGEND YOGI BERRA
PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF 90.

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:08.055
YOGI WAS A HALL OF FAME CATCHER
WHO ALSO SERVED IN WORLD WAR II,

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:11.592
BUT HE BECAME BEST KNOWN FOR HIS
UNINTENTIONALLY HILARIOUS QUOTES

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.028
KNOWN AS YOGI-ISMS, SUCH AS
"IT'S LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.598
AGAIN," "A NICKEL AIN'T WORTH A
DIME ANYMORE," AND "WHEN YOU

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.700
COME TO A FORK IN THE ROAD,
TAKE IT."

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:23.003
SO AS A TRIBUTE TO THIS AMERICAN
ICON, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.373
UP WITH ONE OF HIS LESS FAMOUS
QUOTATIONS.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.674
WE WILL HAVE OUR COMEDIANS'
ANSWERS AND NAME A WINNER

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:27.774
WHEN WE COME BACK ON @MIDNIGHT.
