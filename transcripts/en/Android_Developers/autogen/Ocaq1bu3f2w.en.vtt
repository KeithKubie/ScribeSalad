00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.820
 the staff are navy grandson developed 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.769
 because the android team 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.940
 I'm here today for a design by 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 talk about a very important subject 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.660
 that you have to keep in mind when it comes to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.570
 design your android app 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.240
 be you a design where a seller ok 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.740
 which are the independent density pixels 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.779
 but what is this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.849
 even the android devices they 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.880
 have different pixel density 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.030
 we measure this in points by 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 adopt sprint and prevention of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 ipi 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.489
 or how close the pixels are 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 one of the others there an example has four 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.190
 pictures to the letter in different né dp isso 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 one can realize that the more 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.469
 ipi 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 the image gets better that I have more 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.699
 pixels dots forming this 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.800
 closest to each other and to the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.640
 picture looks better 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.739
 ok but how does she always stay a bit right? 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 the android devices screens us 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.810
 were grouped into logical groups t 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.939
 Good thing we call density 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.409
 pixel logic or logical English 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.030
 pixel teeth 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.310
 in this case the people of some inclusive 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.100
 the friendly games we'll see on the table and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.950
 I have for example 130 dp es 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.869
 We call it MDP and that's the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.810
 density ratio that you will use 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.030
 basis for calculating the remaining cities 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 size of your images eg the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.920
 people have there for example 240v saucers that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.189
 the friendly name known as hpi and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 The scale is one and a half times the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.299
 remembering people must have seen 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.950
 this neighbor name already these names and mdp i 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.530
 is prince where you are a project 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.740
 android and will find the folder of the drug the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.450
 mdp ii trace for example is there and will have 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.899
 the images you are going to use to 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 every logical group of this good continues I 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.450
 I have 320 that we call x hpi 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 is twice an image of ipi and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.829
 density of 480 that the xx hpi or 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.170
 three times the mdp scale is then 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.360
 this way you can plan with 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.129
 give them your image in the best way 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.050
 It's just to explain a little better. 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.680
 contextualize you how this is done 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.739
 call 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.260
 is not pixel or abbreviated 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.930
 as dp or ipi you can find 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.750
 a place is a pixel virtual drive 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.459
 equivalent to 1 and its physical on a screen 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.430
 of hundreds of fish 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.959
 remembering that I already said the word 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.040
 low density for you to make your 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.109
 Accounts are there and it is resized 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.769
 proportionately to larger screens or 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 minors 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.700
 There we go because there is a tablet and 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.090
 a phone for example where I want 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.280
 for 200 dp is and wants to know how much 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.950
 pixel worry on this screen for 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.319
 example 200 pixels in May ipi because 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.639
 because it is the base density as it had 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.430
 said then 1 dp 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.980
 it's worth a pixel the ipi scene on wikipedia 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.680
 I have a phone where I have 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.829
 400 pixels why because a screen xh dp 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.980
 where the scale is twice the size of the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.900
 mp is only to have a notion the tip of a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.239
 human finger has dropped an average of 50 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.310
 dps so it is very important to remember 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.139
 In addition to designing a button an 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.090
 application is otherwise from here 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.370
 little will have been looking there where 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.209
 will hit the app so you have 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.060
 this in mind 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.620
 Ok folks and summon eyepiece button 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.359
 little button is big 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.870
 well come on the first thing, remembering 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.269
 a pixel exception of fish is a dp in 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.489
 santa cecilia dp this is for you then 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.340
 make the rule of three there we will put more 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.400
 basic 2 pixels 320 ipi 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.159
 It's good exercise so I have to 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.049
 nexus 7 in the new version is where I have 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.079
 a 7 inch screen 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:53.489
 she is of resolution x hp are remembering 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:57.479
 is twice the resolution of the MDP 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.729
 good and in pixel she has 1920 by 1,200 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:02.569
 people calculator made the bill 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:09.299
 Head is good, come on, the answer is 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:10.680
 960 for 610 thousand do not go right because he has 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.840
 beat the proportion so you do not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.639
 be concerned about positioning that 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.799
 in this end in that place you do not work 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.680
 always with this virtual resolution that 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.900
 it will be is a veil for all 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.510
 Good resolutions 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.460
 and the point is talking to the image 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.510
 It's good and in case you have a business. 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.560
 called the corner 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.800
 independent pixels objects like sp 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.860
 will also start from the base of mdp itabom 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.400
 and it is equivalent to 1 dp né 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.810
 to 100% of the source in scale, reminding 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.000
 that the user for reasons of 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.590
 accessibility and can resize 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.240
 global source 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.920
 so careful not only design who is 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.990
 you raise the text to reality 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.360
 it is not that, it has a function of its own 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.250
 android with sensitivity and you 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.790
 will work with sp 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.940
 Well, do not forget that, good. We close. 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.130
 and if that part of that part of those tips 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.390
 Let's have a look, first time at 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.970
 specify the layouts in de peta 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.300
 images and layout always using dp and no 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.700
 case of image clip gené in all 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.400
 Sizes are good all the resolutions to 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.170
 You should know this better than 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.200
 entered is that you have a targeting 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.730
 square plus the image is dangerous including 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.290
 losing image quality is very 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.870
 important that you avoid the 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.210
 resizing by creating images of the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.680
 correct sizes good and with us already 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.310
 had previous vadim photo 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.590
 do not forget personal texts in sp 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.020
 So it's good now with these tips and 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.900
 understanding well what are ipi souls 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.820
 ipi also you have all the basis for 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.310
 make a layout that works on any 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.390
 screen any size and projects 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.910
 way too easy 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.300
 It's good to see you up against 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.300
 more
