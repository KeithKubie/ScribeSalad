Anthony Caravella

00:00:27.174 --> 00:00:28.605
and Travis Hayes.

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:31.986
You probably don't recognize their faces.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.634
Together, they served 89 years
for murders that they didn't commit;

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:41.108
murders that they falsely confessed
to committing when they were teenagers.

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:43.774
I'm a forensic developmental psychologist,

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:45.804
and I study these types of cases.

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:48.253
As a researcher,

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:49.448
a professor

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:50.781
and a new parent,

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:55.702
my goal is to conduct scientific research
that helps us understand

00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:58.954
how kids function in a legal system
that was designed for adults.

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:01.246
In March of 2006,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.563
police interrogated Brendan Dassey,

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:07.507
a 16-year-old high school student
with an IQ around 70,

00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:10.476
putting him in the range
of intellectual disability.

00:01:10.927 --> 00:01:15.080
So here's just a brief snippet
of his four-hour interrogation.

00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:16.924
(Video) Police 1: Brendan, be honest.

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:20.284
I told you before that's the only thing
that's going to help you here.

00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:22.058
We already know what happened, OK?

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.152
Police 2: If we don't get honesty here --

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.402
I'm your friend right now,

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:29.689
but I've got to believe in you,

00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:31.184
and if I don't believe in you,

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:32.784
I can't go to bat for you.

00:01:33.587 --> 00:01:35.050
OK? You're nodding.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.293
Tell us what happened.

00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:38.663
P1: Your mom said you'd be honest with us.

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:41.770
P2: And she's behind you 100 percent
no matter what happens here.

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:44.806
P1: That's what she said,
because she thinks you know more, too.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.148
P2: We're in your corner.

00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:50.938
P1: We already know what happened,
now tell us exactly. Don't lie.

00:01:51.843 --> 00:01:55.093
Lindsay Malloy: They told Brendan
that honesty would "set him free,"

00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:58.024
but they were completely
convinced of his guilt at that point.

00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:00.413
So by honesty, they meant a confession,

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:03.982
and his confession would definitely not
end up setting him free.

00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:06.747
They eventually got
a confession from Brendan

00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:08.352
that didn't really make sense,

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:10.970
didn't match much of the physical
evidence of the crime

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:13.415
and is widely believed to be false.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.453
Still, it was enough to convict Brendan
and sentence him to life in prison

00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:20.207
for murder and sexual assault in 2007.

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:23.622
There was no physical evidence
against Brendan at all.

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:26.108
It was nothing more than his own words

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:28.837
that sent him to prison
for nearly a decade,

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:31.838
until a judge overturned his conviction
just a few months ago.

00:02:33.484 --> 00:02:38.073
The Dassey case is unique because
it made its way into a Netflix series,

00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:39.461
called "Making a Murderer,"

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:41.426
which I'm sure many of you saw,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.191
and if you haven't,
you should definitely watch it.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:46.446
The Dassey case is also unique

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.380
because it led to such
intense public outrage.

00:02:49.404 --> 00:02:52.409
People were very angry about
how Brendan was questioned,

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:56.448
and many assumed that his interrogation
had to have been illegal.

00:02:57.134 --> 00:02:58.500
It wasn't illegal.

00:02:58.524 --> 00:03:00.622
As someone who's a researcher in this area

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:03.487
and is familiar with police
interrogation training manuals,

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:05.748
I wasn't really surprised by what I saw.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.669
The fact is, Dassey's interrogation itself
is actually not all that unique,

00:03:10.693 --> 00:03:13.451
and to be honest with you,
I've seen worse.

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:17.399
So I understand the public
outcry about injustice

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:20.034
in Brendan Dassey's individual case.

00:03:20.058 --> 00:03:24.593
But let's not forget that approximately
one million or so of his peers

00:03:24.617 --> 00:03:26.920
are arrested every year
in the United States

00:03:26.944 --> 00:03:30.411
and may be subjected to similar
interrogation techniques,

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:34.143
techniques that we know increase
the risk for false confession.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.108
And I know many people are going
to struggle with that term,

00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:39.315
"false confession,"

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:43.060
and with believing that false
confessions actually occur.

00:03:43.084 --> 00:03:44.253
And I get that.

00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:47.812
It's very shocking and counterintuitive:

00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:52.765
Why would someone confess
and even give gruesome details

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.065
about a horrifying crime
like rape or murder

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.980
if they hadn't actually done it?

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.488
It makes no sense.

00:04:00.393 --> 00:04:02.516
And the fact is, we can never
know precisely

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.464
how often false confessions occur.

00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:08.925
But what we do know is that false
confessions or admissions were present

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.260
in approximately 25 percent
of wrongful convictions

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:15.297
of people later exonerated
by DNA evidence.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.017
Turns out, they were innocent.

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:20.827
These cases are crystal clear
because we have the DNA.

00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:22.901
So they didn't do the crime,

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:26.106
and yet one-quarter of them
confessed to it anyway.

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:30.030
And at this point,
from countless research studies,

00:04:30.054 --> 00:04:33.380
we have a pretty good sense
of why people falsely confess,

00:04:33.404 --> 00:04:34.858
and why some people,

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:36.483
like Brendan Dassey,

00:04:36.507 --> 00:04:38.892
are at greater risk for doing so.

00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:45.106
We know that youth are especially
vulnerable to providing false confessions.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.328
In one study of exonerations, for example,

00:04:48.352 --> 00:04:50.746
only eight percent of adults
had falsely confessed,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.098
but 42 percent of juveniles had done so.

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:58.193
Of course, if we're just looking
at wrongful convictions and exonerations,

00:04:58.217 --> 00:05:00.152
we're only getting part of the story.

00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:05.188
Left out, for instance, are the many cases
that are resolved by guilty pleas,

00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:06.362
not trials.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.685
From TV and news headlines,

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:11.805
you may think that trials are the norm
in our legal system,

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:15.415
but the reality is that 97 percent
of legal cases in the US

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.044
are resolved by pleas, not trials.

00:05:18.396 --> 00:05:20.021
Ninety-seven percent.

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:24.678
Also left out will be confessions
to more minor types of crimes

00:05:24.702 --> 00:05:26.926
that don't typically involve DNA evidence

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.272
and aren't usually reviewed
or appealed following a conviction.

00:05:31.087 --> 00:05:32.276
So for this reason,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.506
many refer to the false confessions
we actually do know about

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.045
as the tip of a much larger iceberg.

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:43.532
In our research, we found alarming rates
of false confession among teenagers.

00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:48.019
We interviewed almost 200
incarcerated 14-to-17-year-olds,

00:05:48.043 --> 00:05:49.819
and 17 percent of them reported

00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:52.674
that they'd made at least
one false confession to police.

00:05:54.427 --> 00:05:56.784
What's also shocking to most is that,

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.121
in interrogations in the US,

00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:02.468
police are allowed to interrogate
juveniles just like adults.

00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.040
So they can lie to them --

00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:08.472
blatant lies like, "We have
your fingerprints,

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:09.665
we have your DNA;

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.654
your friend is down the hall
saying that this was all your idea."

00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:17.971
Lying to suspects is banned
in the UK, for example,

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:19.534
but legal here in the US,

00:06:19.558 --> 00:06:22.646
even with intellectually impaired teens
like Brendan Dassey.

00:06:24.077 --> 00:06:27.260
In our research, most of the incarcerated
teens that we interviewed

00:06:27.284 --> 00:06:30.215
reported experiencing
high-pressure police interrogations

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.264
without lawyers or parents present.

00:06:33.407 --> 00:06:36.941
More than 80 percent described
having been threatened by the police,

00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:40.476
including with the possibility
of being raped or killed in jail

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.052
or being tried as an adult.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.542
These maximization strategies are designed

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:48.408
to make suspects feel
like denials are pointless

00:06:48.432 --> 00:06:50.604
and confession is the only option.

00:06:51.182 --> 00:06:54.784
So you may have heard of playing
the role of "good cop/bad cop," right?

00:06:54.808 --> 00:06:56.123
Well, this is bad cop.

00:06:56.813 --> 00:07:01.982
Juveniles are more suggestible
and susceptible to social influence,

00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:05.406
like the intense pressure
accusations and suggestions

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.154
coming from authority
figures in interrogations.

00:07:09.468 --> 00:07:12.119
More than 70 percent
of the teens in our study said

00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:14.298
that the police had tried
to "befriend" them

00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:18.175
or indicate a desire to help them out
during the interrogation.

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:21.655
These are referred to
as "minimization strategies,"

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:25.725
and they're designed to convey
sympathy and understanding to the suspect,

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.839
and they imply that a confession
will result in more lenient treatment.

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:33.899
So in the classic
good-cop-bad-cop oversimplification

00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:35.272
of police interrogations,

00:07:35.296 --> 00:07:36.622
this is "good cop."

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:40.323
(Video) P1: Honesty here, Brendan,
is the thing that's going to help you, OK?

00:07:40.347 --> 00:07:41.529
No matter what you did,

00:07:41.553 --> 00:07:43.971
we can work through that, OK?

00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:45.292
We can't make any promises,

00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:48.884
but we'll stand behind you
no matter what you did, OK?

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:53.114
LM: "No matter what you did,
we can work through that."

00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:55.377
Hints of leniency like you
just saw with Brendan

00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:58.111
are especially powerful among adolescents,

00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:02.388
in part because they evaluate reward
and risk differently than adults do.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.334
Confessing brings an immediate reward
to the suspect, right?

00:08:06.358 --> 00:08:09.335
Now the stressful, unpleasant
interrogation is over.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:13.199
So confessing may seem like
the best option to most teens,

00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:17.403
who are less focused on that long-term
risk of conviction and punishment

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:18.583
down the road

00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:20.276
as a result of that confession.

00:08:20.956 --> 00:08:23.838
I think we can all agree
that thoughtful, long-term planning

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:26.651
is not a strength of most
teenagers that we know.

00:08:27.454 --> 00:08:29.975
And by and large,
the legal system seems to get

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:33.646
that young victims and witnesses
should be treated differently than adults.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.725
But when it comes to young suspects,
it's like the kid gloves come off.

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:41.576
And treating juveniles as though
they're adults in interrogations

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.758
is a problem,

00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:44.039
because literally hundreds

00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:46.123
of psychological
and neuroscientific studies

00:08:46.147 --> 00:08:48.767
tell us that juveniles
do not think like adults,

00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:50.637
they do not behave like adults,

00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:52.926
and they're not built like adults.

00:08:53.837 --> 00:08:56.577
Adolescent brains are different
from adult brains --

00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:57.928
even anatomically.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.575
So there are important changes happening

00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:04.201
in the structure and function
of the brain during adolescence,

00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:07.237
especially in the prefrontal cortex
and the limbic system,

00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:11.631
and these are areas that are crucial
for things like self-control,

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:13.005
decision-making,

00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:15.336
emotion processing and regulation

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.102
and sensitivity to reward and risk,

00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:21.689
all of which can affect how you function
in a stressful circumstance,

00:09:21.713 --> 00:09:23.287
like a police interrogation.

00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:26.199
We need to educate law enforcement,

00:09:26.223 --> 00:09:28.595
attorneys, judges and jurors

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:30.744
on juveniles' developmental limitations

00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:33.721
and how they can play out
in a high-stakes interrogation.

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:36.736
In one national survey of police officers,

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.802
75 percent of them actually requested
specialized training

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:41.999
in how to talk to children
and adolescents --

00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:43.696
most of them had had none.

00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:48.797
We also need to consider having special
protections in place for juveniles.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:53.101
In his 91-page decision to overturn
Dassey's conviction earlier this year,

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:56.634
the judge made a big deal about the fact
that Dassey had no parent

00:09:56.658 --> 00:09:57.809
or other allied adult

00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:59.736
in the interrogation room with him.

00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:04.471
So here's a clip of Brendan talking
to his mom after he confessed,

00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:06.772
when it was obviously
far too late for him.

00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:09.805
(Video) Mom: What do you mean?

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:12.190
Brendan: Like, if his story
is, like, different,

00:10:12.214 --> 00:10:14.072
like I never did nothing or something.

00:10:15.913 --> 00:10:17.063
M: Did you?

00:10:19.762 --> 00:10:20.918
Huh?

00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:22.126
B: Not really.

00:10:22.696 --> 00:10:24.392
M: What do you mean, "Not really"?

00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:26.271
B: They got into my head.

00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:29.571
LM: So he sums it up pretty
beautifully there:

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:30.974
"They got into my head."

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:34.152
We don't know if the outcome
would have been different for Brendan

00:10:34.176 --> 00:10:36.819
if his mom had been
in the interrogation room with him.

00:10:36.843 --> 00:10:38.369
But it's certainly possible.

00:10:38.954 --> 00:10:42.392
In our research, only seven percent
of incarcerated teens,

00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:45.166
most of whom had had numerous
encounters with police,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.187
had ever had a parent or attorney
in the room with them

00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:50.300
when they were questioned as a suspect.

00:10:50.324 --> 00:10:54.285
Few had ever asked for a parent
or attorney to be present.

00:10:55.647 --> 00:10:57.946
And you see this
in lower-stake situations, too.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.108
We did a mock interrogation
experiment in our lab here at FIU --

00:11:02.132 --> 00:11:04.476
with parent permission
for all minors, of course,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.055
and all the appropriate ethical approvals.

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:11.673
We falsely accused teens and adults
of cheating on a study task --

00:11:11.697 --> 00:11:13.332
an academic dishonesty offense --

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:16.477
that we told them was as serious
as cheating in a class.

00:11:17.374 --> 00:11:19.907
In reality, participants
had witnessed a peer cheat,

00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:22.345
someone who was actually part
of our research team

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:24.621
and was allegedly on academic probation.

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:27.314
And we gave everyone a tough choice:

00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:30.300
you can lose your extra credit
for participating in the study

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:31.721
or accuse your peer,

00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:35.573
who will probably be expelled
because of his academic probation status.

00:11:35.597 --> 00:11:39.078
Of course, in reality, none of these
consequences would have panned out,

00:11:39.102 --> 00:11:41.834
and we fully debriefed
all of the participants afterward.

00:11:41.858 --> 00:11:45.874
But most teenagers --
59 percent of them --

00:11:45.898 --> 00:11:47.455
signed the confession statement,

00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:49.782
falsely taking responsibility
for the cheating.

00:11:50.617 --> 00:11:53.075
Only three teens out of 74,

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:54.599
or about four percent of them,

00:11:54.623 --> 00:11:57.953
asked to talk to a parent
when we accused them of cheating,

00:11:57.977 --> 00:11:59.905
despite the fact that for most of them,

00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:03.286
their parent was literally sitting
in the next room during the study.

00:12:04.806 --> 00:12:07.037
Of course, cheating is far from murder,

00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.213
and I know that.

00:12:08.237 --> 00:12:13.674
But it's interesting that so many teens,
significantly more teens than adults,

00:12:13.698 --> 00:12:16.881
signed the confession
saying that they cheated.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.886
They hadn't cheated,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.455
but they signed this form anyway
saying that they had,

00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:24.413
rarely attempting to involve
a parent in the situation.

00:12:25.671 --> 00:12:27.708
Other studies tell the same story.

00:12:27.732 --> 00:12:30.566
Over 90 percent of juveniles
waive their Miranda rights

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.914
and submit to police questioning
without lawyers or parents present.

00:12:34.815 --> 00:12:38.641
In England and Wales, interrogations
of juveniles must be conducted

00:12:38.665 --> 00:12:40.703
in the presence of an "appropriate adult,"

00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:42.929
like a parent, guardian or social worker.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.798
And this isn't something
youth have to ask for --

00:12:45.822 --> 00:12:48.498
which is great, because research
shows that they won't --

00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:49.779
it's automatic.

00:12:51.332 --> 00:12:54.676
Now, having an appropriate adult
safeguard for juveniles here in the US

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.302
would not be a cure-all for improving
police questioning of youth.

00:12:59.035 --> 00:13:03.044
Unfortunately, parents often lack
the knowledge and legal sophistication

00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:05.169
to appropriately advise their children.

00:13:05.677 --> 00:13:08.813
You can just look at the case
of the Central Park Five:

00:13:08.837 --> 00:13:13.965
five teenagers who falsely confessed
to a brutal gang rape in 1989,

00:13:13.989 --> 00:13:15.994
with their parents by their sides.

00:13:16.986 --> 00:13:19.220
And it took over a decade
to clear their names.

00:13:19.971 --> 00:13:22.950
So the appropriate adult
really should be an attorney

00:13:22.974 --> 00:13:24.887
or perhaps a trained child advocate.

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:30.362
Overturning Dassey's conviction, the judge
pointed out that there's no federal law

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:33.297
requiring that the police
even inform a juvenile's parent

00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:35.165
that the juvenile is being questioned

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:38.217
or honor that juvenile's request
to have a parent in the room.

00:13:39.613 --> 00:13:42.481
So if you think about all
of this together for a second:

00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:46.482
as a country, we've decided
that juveniles cannot be trusted

00:13:46.506 --> 00:13:48.063
with things like voting,

00:13:48.087 --> 00:13:49.535
buying cigarettes,

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:51.305
attending an R-rated movie

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:52.686
or driving,

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.006
but they can make the judgment call
to waive their Miranda rights,

00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.678
rights that we know from research,
most teens don't understand or appreciate.

00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:04.546
And parents in the room: depending
on the state that you live in,

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.808
your child can potentially waive
these rights without your knowledge

00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:09.953
and without consulting any adult first.

00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:14.927
Now, no one -- and certainly not
me -- wants to prevent police

00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:17.212
from doing the very important
investigative work

00:14:17.236 --> 00:14:19.143
that they do every day.

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:23.478
But we need to make sure that they have
appropriate training for talking to youth.

00:14:23.502 --> 00:14:25.707
As a parent and as a researcher,

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.293
I think we can do better.

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:31.713
I think we can take steps to prevent
another Brendan Dassey,

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:34.982
while still getting the crucial
information that we need

00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:36.162
from children and teens

00:14:36.186 --> 00:14:37.459
to solve crimes.

00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:39.096
Thank you.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.148
(Applause)
