00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.390
Now let's do something
pretty interesting.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.973
And this will, to some degree,
be one of the easiest functions

00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:07.340
to find the Maclaurin
series representation of.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.740
But let's try to
approximate e to the x.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.106
f of x is equal to e to the x.

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:14.480
And what makes
this really simple

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.850
is, when you take the
derivative-- and this is,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.720
frankly, one of the amazing
things about the number e--

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.270
is that when you take the
derivative of e to the x,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.050
you get e to the x.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.590
So this is equal
to f prime of x.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.880
This is equal to f, the
second derivative of x.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.570
This is equal to the
third derivative of x.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.810
This is equal to the
n-th derivative of x.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.980
It's always equal to e to the x.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.780
That's kind of the
first mind blowing thing

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.270
about the number e.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.390
It's just, you could keep
taking its derivative.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.180
The slope at any
point on that curve

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.410
is the same as the value of
that point on that curve.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.800
That's kind of crazy.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800
Anyway, with that said,
let's take its Maclaurin

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.680
representation.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220
So we have to find f
of 0, f prime of 0,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.525
the second derivative at 0.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:01:01.230
Well, when you take e to the 0,
e to the 0 is just equal to 1.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.680
And so this is going
to be equal to f of 0.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.040
This is going to be
equal to f prime of 0.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.410
It's going to be equal to any of
the derivatives evaluated at 0.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.410
The n-th derivative
evaluated at 0.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.120
And that's why it makes
applying the Maclaurin series

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.600
formula fairly straightforward.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.670
If I wanted to
approximate e to the x

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.330
using a Maclaurin series--
so e to the x-- and I'll

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.910
put a little
approximately over here.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.360
And we'll get closer and
closer to the real e to the x

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.490
as we keep adding
more and more terms.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.980
And especially if we had an
infinite number of terms,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.480
it would look like
this. f of 0--

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.160
let me do it in-- what colors
did I use for cosine and sine?

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.550
So I used pink and I used green.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.280
So let me use a
non-pink, non-green.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.930
I'll use the yellow here.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.710
So f of 0 is 1 plus f prime
of 0 times x. f prime of 0

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.790
is also 1.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.900
So plus x plus, this
is also 1, so it's

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.040
going to be x squared
over 2 factorial.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.373
So plus x squared
over 2 factorial.

00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:07.956
All of these things
are going to be 1.

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:11.530
This is 1, this is 1, when
we're talking about e to the x.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.820
So you go to the third term.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.950
This is 1.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.180
You just have x to the
third over 3 factorial.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.809
Plus x to the third
over 3 factorial.

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.350
And I think you see
the pattern here.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.950
We just keep adding terms.
x to the fourth over 4

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.510
factorial plus x
to the fifth over 5

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.220
factorial plus x to the
sixth over 6 factorial.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.300
And something pretty neat
is starting to emerge.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.270
Is that e to x, 1-- this is just
really cool-- that e to the x

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.960
can be approximated by
1 plus x plus x squared

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.620
over 2 factorial plus x to
the third over 3 factorial.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.470
Once again, e to
the x is starting

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.160
to look like a
pretty cool thing.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.570
This also leads to other
interesting results.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.560
That if you wanted
to approximate e,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.820
you just evaluate this
at x is equal to 1.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.260
So if you wanted to
approximate e, you'd say

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.900
e is approximate to-- well,
e is e to the first power.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.400
And that's going
to be approximately

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.280
equal to this polynomial
evaluated at 1.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.750
If x is 1 here, we
make x 1 over here.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.010
So it'll be 1 plus 1.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.220
So it'll be 1 plus 1
plus 1 over 2 factorial,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.570
plus 1 over 3 factorial,
plus 1 over 4 factorial.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.700
So on and so forth, all
the way into infinity.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.640
And you could also view this
as 1 over 1 factorial as well.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.280
1 over 1 factorial.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.770
But what's really cool is this
is another really neat way

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.870
to represent e.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.940
It shows that e once again shows
up in this kind of neat thing.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.660
It's kind of 2 plus
1/2, plus 1/6, plus--

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.070
if you just keep doing this,
you get close to the number e.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.820
But that by itself isn't
the only fascinating thing.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.090
If we look back at our
Maclaurin representations

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.020
of these other
functions, cosine of x--

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.140
let me copy and
paste cosine of x.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.450
So cosine of x right up here.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.290
So let me do my best to copy
and paste the whole thing.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.220
So copy and paste.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.769
Copy and paste.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.510
So that is cosine of x.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.050
And let's do the same
thing for the sine

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.260
of x that we did last video.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.485
So the sine of x.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.930
Let me copy and paste that.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.526
Copy, and then
let me paste that.

00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:40.260
Edit, paste.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.690
So do we see any relationship
between these approximations?

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.927
So before, you probably
would have guessed maybe

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:50.010
there's some relationship
between cosine and sine,

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.180
but what about e to the x?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.980
And what you see
here is that cosine

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.360
of x looks a lot like
this term plus this term,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.910
although we would want to put
a negative out front here.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.210
So it's a negative version
of this term right here,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.960
plus this term right here,
plus a negative version

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.640
of this term right over here.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.830
And sine of x looks
just like this term

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.490
plus a negative version of
this term, plus this term,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.750
plus a negative version
of the next term.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.570
So if we could somehow
reconcile the negatives

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.390
in some interesting
way, it looks

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.210
like e to the x is
somehow-- or at least

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.980
its polynomial representation
of e to the x--

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.360
is somehow related
to a combination

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.090
of the polynomial
representations of cosine

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.120
of x and sine of x.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.874
So this is starting to get
really, really, really cool.

00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:48.040
We're starting to see a
connection between something

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.290
related to compound interest or
a function whose derivative is

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.600
always equal to that function.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.070
And these things that
come out of the unit

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.700
circle in oscillatory motion
and all of those things, there

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.956
starts to seem some type of
pure connectedness there.

00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:02.580
But I'll leave you
there in that video.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.080
And in the next
video, I'll show you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.480
how we can actually
reconcile these three

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.790
fascinating functions.
