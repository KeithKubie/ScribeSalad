1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,360
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,040
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,520
February 5th,
2018 what's going on?

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:15,330
How,
how are you doing?

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,870
I'm actually doing pretty
good after a super bowl loss.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,230
Congratulations to the Philadelphia
Eagles winning their first super bowl

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,910
championship bubble.
The first one,

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,280
first one's the best one.
Um,

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,580
if my team hadn't lost,

10
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,960
I would have gone online or something
like that just to watch grown men crying

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,050
in Philadelphia over sports,

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,490
which is one of my favorite things ever.
Um,

13
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,400
I remember when the Patriots won their
first one. I was actually at the game,

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,720
haven't gone previously to when we
lost the fucking bread five Bruh.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,390
Let me took off his helmet
and ran down the field.

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,020
Yeah,

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,140
I bet it's age and cried on that play.
We're going to make so much money.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,830
Look at him. He's so adorable. Um,

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,890
have you seen a picture of
his Dick Lately? No. Um, I
just remember when when we,

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,600
uh, kicked that field goal and we won
and I've got to say we, by the way,

21
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:20,660
people go, oh, well you
will know the field. Yeah,

22
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:24,470
well I get shit when my team loses.
All right.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,950
Whenever your team wins, people
go, um, you weren't playing,

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,930
but if your team loses, then they
gon fuck you guys. You guys lost,

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,810
so suck a dick. All
right. We lost just today.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,210
Anyways. Um, yeah,

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,930
I remember when we kicked a field goal
to win the fucking thing and everybody by

28
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,300
, but he tackled each other. And I got
up, there was this guy just standing.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,810
They was just standing
like tears in his eyes.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,150
Like he was going to fucking start crying.

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,110
And my eyes met his and he was looking
at me. It's a weird, to this day,

32
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,480
it's still wear this moment
that I've had with another male.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,620
I could see if we were at a fucking
funeral of Jesus Christ, you know, man,

34
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:11,120
the fuck up. And I also remember,
um, if I was in Philadelphia,

35
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:13,070
I would want to hear from that guy.

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,960
One of my favorite things this year
and the football season was when, um,

37
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,870
dad,

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,380
when Carson Wentz went down and that
eagles fan called in the radio station and

39
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:28,070
started breaking down crying to the point,
he freaked out the radio host,

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,361
he called up,

41
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:31,550
he was like sort of complaining
that all of a sudden he's just like,

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,520
when's it going to help happen?

43
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,783
No

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,820
fucking radio is, it's going like
buddy, buddy, you're crying for hours.

45
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,390
It was great.
It was just fucking great.

46
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,310
So I would love to hear that guys follow
up colleagues probably crying even more.

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,153
So

48
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,550
I really wish when I finally saw the
eagles win the Superbowl, that they,

49
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,830
they weren't playing my team so I could
have enjoyed it more because is something

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,400
as a sports fan that I really
enjoy because there's only two,

51
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,940
two fan bases that I just wish,
wish eternal misery on.

52
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,100
And that's the Yankees because I have
to the same way they do it with red sox

53
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:15,640
fans and the Montreal Canadians. Other
than that, you know, if you, I, you know,

54
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,470
I wouldn't ever wish that, you know, a
fan base never got to fill a championship.

55
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:25,360
So congratulations to you guys.
All right. Now having said that,

56
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,210
um,

57
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,210
I've had the dead Don Henley Song in my
head this whole morning just thinking

58
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,540
about the game because there's always
that fucking devastating shock when your

59
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,620
team loses.

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,120
And the song I woke up hearing
today for whatever reason,

61
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:48,121
was don Henley's last worthless evening
and I was walking around the kitchen.

62
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,380
I was just singing.

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,420
That was the worst Farc in
defense that I've ever seen do.

64
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,210
That was the, you know, it was an exciting
game, but if you really look at it,

65
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,440
that was arguably the ugliest
fucking Superbowl I've ever seen.

66
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,390
It was like both teams were
in a fucking prevent defense.

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,020
The entire game.
That was a fucking Superbowl people.

68
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:18,310
There was two punts the
entire game and no socks,

69
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,730
unless you call the call
'em count the Brady fumble,

70
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:25,390
which I don't know how that works if you
slapped a ball out and then you tackle

71
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:30,190
the quarterback if that's
considered a sac. Um,

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,950
I heard them kind of alluding saying
this was the first sack of the game.

73
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:37,540
I was at a Superbowl party, which I
usually don't do, but I got a kid now. Um,

74
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,170
and I went actually,
you know,

75
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,720
I had a good time as a bunch
of kids running around,

76
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:45,190
throwing balls and all that stuff and
I was being the lunatic sitting in the

77
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,850
other room by myself trying to watch
the game or whatever. But, uh, anyways,

78
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,650
you know what's great about having a kid,

79
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,270
you don't have to watch the halftime show.

80
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,060
I would put her in the
stroller and go for a walk.

81
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,750
So I don't even know
who played the halftime.

82
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,690
I just kept walking by the front door
and I kept hearing music and one of the

83
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:04,870
music ended. I came back in and then
somebody goes, hey, great timing.

84
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,300
Great timing is like, Hey, you
know, I've watched a few of these,

85
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,040
watched a good 40 of them. Um, anyways,

86
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,370
I've never seen like the defense
was so fucking bad in that game.

87
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,000
It was literally like, how did either
one of these teams even make it here?

88
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,980
I don't know if it was the
weird match up or what. I mean,

89
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,070
I don't know anything about the fucking
eagles considering I thought that

90
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,530
fucking Sproles guy was still playing.
Uh,

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,210
but I did call it with the running game.

92
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,000
I just didn't know was that fucking do
that you got from the dolphins, whatever.

93
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,270
Right. But I knew that that was
going to be a problem. Um, yeah.

94
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,510
I don't know what the fuck
happened to the eagles,

95
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,790
but I will tell you the
New England patriots,

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,580
the game this season where I
went like, oh boy, oh Jesus.

97
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,620
We went in at this year was when we
played the Pittsburgh Steelers and we went

98
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,500
down,
we went down and we scored.

99
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,670
The fucking game was over. There wasn't
enough time left even with big Ben.

100
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,760
And then we gave up a 90 yard screen pass.

101
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,140
And the only reason why we won that game
was because of that stupid fucking is

102
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:19,361
it a catch isn't a catch that when he
catches the ball here and he turns and

103
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,020
starts running with the ball,

104
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,950
we don't know if he has possession
as he possesses the ball.

105
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,080
And reaches over the fucking goal line.
I the,

106
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:33,081
my number one thing I want
them to fix in football is,

107
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,280
is that fucking rule.
Um,

108
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,680
I don't remember there
really being a huge,

109
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,300
is it a catch isn't an a catch controversy
before they fucked with that rule.

110
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,680
So every once in awhile,
you know,

111
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:50,681
you try to make the game
less controversial and you
do dumb shit like that.

112
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,920
Or even the Tuck rule, man, it was
fucking stupid. That was a fumble.

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,270
It's the stupid as well. He
tucked it in. I don't know,

114
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,300
but I don't know the rule book the
way they do it. It's fucking dumb.

115
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,930
And all you rate a France who are jumping
up and down because of patriots fans

116
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:05,990
said that that was a fumble.

117
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,430
Go watch the fucking roughing the passer
call that you guys got back with old

118
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,870
Kenny stable and Ray Hamilton jumping in
the fucking air that gave you a goddamn

119
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,200
Superbowl.
Okay,

120
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,200
so why don't you take off your fucking
rocky horror picture show scary rate of

121
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:23,450
costume and shove it up your
ass. All right. And sorry.

122
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,290
Still a little upset that my team lost
tack and fucking Raiders fans who are

123
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,940
about to become the most
profitable fucking franchise. Um,

124
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,880
in the moderate and NFL era era.
The second they go to Las Vegas,

125
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,060
they're going to do so well in Las Vegas.

126
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,900
This is my prediction that I'm going to
say the rams who will eventually moved

127
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:45,620
to Reno or Laughlin Nevada or some shit.
Right.

128
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,150
So anyways,
getting to the game,

129
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,180
that was the ugliest fucking
game collectively of team
defense I've ever seen in

130
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,690
my fucking life. I don't remember
seeing a punter the whole game.

131
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,890
I haven't looked at the stats, you
know, cause my team lost. So you know,

132
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,110
you go on fucking radio silence,

133
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,180
I'm not going on social media cause not
one eagle fan talk to any fucking shit.

134
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,510
And I already looked at my feed last
thing, so he was like, good fuck it,

135
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,650
don't all this shit. It's like where was
that before the game when you're green,

136
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,260
knees were fucking shaken.
Um,

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,590
I think there was two punts,

138
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,300
no sacks other than I guess that Brady
thing that they count that as a sec.

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
Okay. If you told me before
the fucking game started,

140
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,400
I'll just say,
cause I don't know what happened.

141
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:42,200
I'll say the eagles punted once and the
fucking patriots Panto wants you just

142
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:43,280
told me.
All right,

143
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,050
you're not going to sack nick foals once
and the eagles are only gonna punt once

144
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,120
and you'll have one turnover. I'd be like,
oh boy. Oh, this is going to be ugly.

145
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:56,040
We're going to get the living
shit kicked out of us. And I bet

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,850
if you told Eagle, I mean, what
the fuck? What the fuck happened?

147
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,010
Or the eagles difference.

148
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,543
Hmm.

149
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,130
I thought they were going to kill us.

150
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:06,620
I was like teaches this fucking
team looks like those giant teams.

151
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:09,440
So they've got that great front for,
they've got to fucking running game.

152
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,370
They're going to fucking make Brady move
and we're going to Google.

153
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,380
You'd be frustrated at punting and all
of that shit and then they're gonna have

154
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:21,670
the running game chewing up the fucking
clock. Um, it was still a great game.

155
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,960
Uh, and I know there's a bunch of Patriot
fans whining about that trick play.

156
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,230
Who by the way Chris Collins worth
just couldn't get over that play golf.

157
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,720
They kept going back towards this guy
[inaudible] I caught him clay. So,

158
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,530
well history, it's like you mean the one
the patriots just ran five minutes ago.

159
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,700
You see that at least five times a
fucking year in the NFL regular season.

160
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:48,180
It wasn't like this unique trick play.
And if you watch college football,

161
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,890
you see it about 40 times a year.

162
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:54,891
It's just the standard fucking play now
I guess illegal formation is if there's,

163
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,390
you need six guys on the line and the
eagles had five and there was one guy cut

164
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,240
hair back. So I dunno if you want
to say that's illegal formation.

165
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,820
I'll tell you this with the
defense played yesterday and they,

166
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,420
if they actually called that the eagles
would have scored in the next fucking

167
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:16,620
play. Alright. That'd be one thing.
If we were actually stopping them,

168
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,570
I would actually look at that and be
like, well wait a minute. Blah blah blah,

169
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:22,350
blah blah. You know, my buddy
said something funny. He goes,

170
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,020
you don't have to Patriots scored on
that and we actually won the game.

171
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,340
They would be calling it a formation
gate for the next three fucking years,

172
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:32,100
which is hilarious. We probably would've
lost a draft pick because of that play,

173
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:36,200
but there's no fucking way,
um,

174
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,320
on any level I would ever take that
victory away from the eagles state.

175
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,880
They totally, they won the
fucking Cape. I write that in a B.

176
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,020
This is how bad the difference was.
Even on the last play of the fucking game,

177
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,610
they still had to give the eagles fan
base of fucking heart attack when they

178
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:58,910
batted the ball all around in me that
there was like three patriots that had a

179
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:02,790
shot at the balls as it was
like hanging in the air. Um,

180
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,330
just a really a weird,
weird fucking game. But, um,

181
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,330
I can say this, I am really happy for, uh,

182
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,070
for eagles fans and the city of
Philadelphia and I know that I,

183
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,160
I will always be sort of connected to
that city as if I fucking hate them.

184
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,670
I don't, I never did. It
was just, I had a bad show.

185
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:26,690
I was in Philly and I went after the
shit that you loved. But I, I really,

186
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,190
the only time I ever really hated a
Philadelphia team was when the Celtics and

187
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,160
sixers had that great rivalry. But
other than that, you know what I mean?

188
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,850
We're in the AFC. You're in the
NFC. We were in the Adams Division.

189
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,110
You are in the Patrick's division.

190
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,690
I actually used to like
the flyers back in the 80s,

191
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,360
because I liked fights and
I remember rooting for them.

192
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:47,780
I think they played Edmonton,
I forget who they played,

193
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:50,180
but they were going to lose the game.
And out of nowhere,

194
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,100
Ron Hextall had an absolute shit fit
and for, I've never seen a goalie

195
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,820
do this.

196
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,260
Just skated out of the crease and
started fighting somebody just completely

197
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,610
spazzed out, ran out,
skated out, I should say.

198
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,530
Um, but after awhile I
couldn't become a flyer.

199
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,590
I couldn't stay a flyers fan because
they reminded me of how I was living my

200
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:18,460
life where it's like, well, this worked
fucking 30 years ago. Let me, uh,

201
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,710
let me keep trying it.
Every year. You know,

202
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,130
they kept trying to beat their way to
the cup cause at one and s because at one

203
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,210
I'm a cup at 74,

204
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,830
75 and then they continued to do
it well into the two thousands.

205
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,230
Um, so anyways, what else did,
I made a couple of notes here.

206
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,950
Uh, I think that was it.
I think that was it. Um,

207
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,850
anyways, but this one, it doesn't hurt
the way those giants one's heart. Um,

208
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,730
this one is just a, this one
just kind of sucks, but anyways,

209
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,350
congratulations.
That's fucking great.

210
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,720
So now the Philadelphia
Eagles in the last 10 years,

211
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,960
the Philadelphia team at the city of
Philadelphia has won a world series and

212
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:09,040
they won a Superbowl. So now they
need the flyers. It's 76 is to win,

213
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,820
which I don't know how the fuck that's
going to happen. So, um, anyways,

214
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,420
there you go. There's my
Superbowl chatter. Once again,

215
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:21,370
congratulations to the eagles
fans and, uh, you know,

216
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,990
patriots, feds, he has his, here's the
positive that you can take from it.

217
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,210
All right.
The team 100% over achieved this year.

218
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,480
All right.
Not Having Edelman the whole year,

219
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,370
haven't Gronk concussed and Brandon
hooks, cooks, I should say hooks.

220
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,760
Brandon cooks essentially
knocking himself out of the game.

221
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:46,810
I've never seen anybody do something
like that. When he peeled back,

222
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,170
I literally yelled,
what the fuck is he doing?

223
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,150
I've never seen a guy peel back with the
ball and be looking the wrong way and

224
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,770
get himself knocked out of the game.

225
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,170
They should have been like
Benny Hill music playing.

226
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,060
I don't know what the f I think he
was so surprised he was that open.

227
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,040
He didn't know what to do with the,
he is like,

228
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,490
he had his own public park to himself.
Um,

229
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,180
anyways, he, here's, here's your, uh, as
patriots fans, how you can get past this.

230
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,200
Um, just be happy, you know, every, every
time the Patriots win the Super Bowl,

231
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:22,510
you know, when you really
think about it, you know,

232
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,140
have you ever gotten a ring yourself?
You don't get a ring.

233
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,150
All you have to do is now go out and
buy a championship tee shirt and get a

234
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:34,240
subscription to sports illustrated.
So it's nice, you know,

235
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,850
to avoid that expense. Um, anyways,

236
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,560
so there you go.
And now the worst feeling ever,

237
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,720
almost as bad as your team
losing the fucking super bowl is,

238
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,650
uh, the football season is
officially over. No College,

239
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,000
no pro, no Canadian, no nothing.

240
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,440
MMM [inaudible].
Whatever you got march madness coming up.

241
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:06,980
Formula One starts next month or whatever.
But um,

242
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,740
anyways, congratulations on the
Patriots on a great season. And, uh,

243
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,460
once again,
congratulations to the [inaudible],

244
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,410
you're super bowl champion
Philadelphia fucking eagles, man.

245
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:22,760
Who would have ever thought, um, now wait
a minute, let's go around the league.

246
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,220
So who's left?
We all know that Cleveland browns

247
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,210
and they certainly didn't take a
step towards wanting one this year,

248
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,510
but you never know. Sure. They
got a bunch of draft picks.

249
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,830
Let's go run a league patriots. Obviously
if one giants, obviously if one jets,

250
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,890
one Superbowl, three eagles,

251
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,600
if one Pittsburghers one ravens have one,
Washington is one,

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,530
the Carolina Panthers. Oh, in too,

253
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:51,420
uh,

254
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,490
Tennessee titans

255
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
lost to the rams and one of the great
super bowls of all time. All right.

256
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,610
And they never wanted us to Houston
Oilers. They didn't want an AFL title.

257
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:07,170
I believe the first year
Jacksonville Jag was never one.

258
00:16:07,171 --> 00:16:12,130
So there's, there's three
teams that have never won. MMM.

259
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,840
And the brown sets for,

260
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,643
yeah.

261
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,580
Bengals never one. That's five lions.
Never one. That's six. Dolphins have one.

262
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,730
Tampa Bay's one. Atlanta never
one. That's seven. I'll shut this.

263
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,490
A lot of teams left.
New Orleans is one.

264
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:31,860
Yeah.

265
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,510
Okay. All right. Moving on up. And
Minnesota Neville one bears have won.

266
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,330
Yeah.

267
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,080
Kansas city chiefs one. So
go for cowboys. Have one.

268
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:46,400
Houston Texans have never one
has nine Broncos have one.

269
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,950
Arizona cardinals.
Never one.

270
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:53,420
That's 10 San Diego challenges.
Never one.

271
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:54,111
Jesus Christ.

272
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,780
This is really saying about how
many dynasties has been in football.

273
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,770
Yeah.

274
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,540
The rams never won.

275
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,340
Fuck raid is if one 49 is of one Seattle
of one I probably missed a team or two

276
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,430
there. So 12 teams,
seven one 20 teams have,

277
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:15,930
yeah.

278
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,630
Well I guess you know something.
If when the Patriots,

279
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,780
we say the Steelers have
one six patriots at one five

280
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,390
49 is one five and cowboys have one
five that's 21 of the 52 Superbowls.

281
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,570
Right. They're spread out against
with just four fucking teams.

282
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,800
Giants got four.
So that's 24 packers have four,

283
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,090
that's 28.

284
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,100
So that's one for like six
teams of one 28 of them. Well,

285
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:46,360
I guess it kind of makes sense then.

286
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,670
So I guess there's really no
shame at this point, you know,

287
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,690
having never won a fucking Superbowl and
considering like a lot of those teams I

288
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:58,790
mentioned, we're expansion teams like
the panthers, Texans and fucking Jag was,

289
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,600
um, all right, you go and now the
goddamn season out the window.

290
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:08,550
And I have to be honest with
you, uh, I am really fearful,

291
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,900
you know,

292
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,900
with Tom Brady going to be turning
41 here that it might be a long,

293
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,050
long time before we ever
get back to another one. Uh,

294
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,010
if we don't get back next year
because, uh, I'll never forget,

295
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,550
you know, everybody talks
about Dan Marino who, uh,

296
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,730
undeservingly gets all this shit for
having never won a Superbowl. I mean,

297
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,690
the game had passed his coach by,
he never had a running game.

298
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,090
He never had a defense.
He still did. What he did.

299
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:42,510
Was he supposed to tackle people too
and come up with the fucking game plan.

300
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,200
The man would literally throw per 6,000
yards a season if the rules of pass

301
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,740
coverage where the way they they are.
All right.

302
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,460
Now that guy went to a super
bowl in his second year,

303
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:58,461
I believe in 1984 not only did the
dolphins never get back during his career,

304
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,000
they've never been back period since then.

305
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,240
So that was 34 fucking years ago.

306
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,330
Dan Marino was 23 years old.
He's now 57

307
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,270
that's how fucking nuts this is.

308
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:18,140
So I'm telling you right now
when Brady and Belichick leave,

309
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,753
mmm.

310
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,750
You know,
I'm going to be 50 years old.

311
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,130
If we go through what the dolphins
go through, I will be 84 years old,

312
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,510
still waiting for them to get back.

313
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:32,480
So I don't take any of this for granted
because there's a lot of patriot people

314
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,870
hate the pages. Go you guys, you must
have thought he would be exciting anymore.

315
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,630
It's like, no dude, it's
fucking unbelievable.

316
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,930
I'm trying to enjoy every second
of it cause I always think, okay,

317
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,560
this is the last time we're getting back.
Thank God we won.

318
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,390
This is the last time we
were getting back off. Fuck,

319
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:51,170
we lost this is the last
time. Oh, we lost again.

320
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,400
Oh we won. We won again. Now
we've fucking lie. Yeah, I dunno.

321
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,350
I Dunno. It's fucking, uh, you know, and
for all you Patriot haters out there,

322
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
I mean you're really supposed
birds. He said it best. He goes,

323
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:05,330
it's like you're literally watching
something you be probably never going to

324
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:09,980
fucking see again that level of dominance.
But, um, I do understand, you know,

325
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:14,960
if you love you fucking team and
I'll let shit, but uh, anyways, I uh,

326
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,840
we had definite,
I don't know where we are on the run.

327
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,850
We're definitely in the final 10% of it.

328
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,190
And I don't know if that was
the last tip that we shall see.

329
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,400
We shall definitely see. But you
know, here's the thing, if they,

330
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,060
if they never get back again in 34 years,
so they do either way,

331
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,730
I'll be sitting there watching
cause I have nothing better.

332
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,550
Um, okay. What is that
20 minutes in? All right,

333
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:44,420
let's read a little bit of
fucking advertising, shall we?

334
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,880
Shall we all right.
And don't

335
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,430
talk about how every man looks
better in a suit. I'll tell ya,

336
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,150
I don't think I've ever been. So star
struck is when I see Tom Brady in a suit.

337
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,583
You know what I made

338
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,020
here and just all the perfect places are
Indochino is the largest custom apparel

339

company.

They make suits and shirts made to your
exact measurements for a great fit. Yes.

341
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,320
So after you get measured,

342
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:14,770
stop fucking eating stupid or try
to remember exactly what you ate.

343
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,970

Burton.

433
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,670
Look who just came in.

434
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,840
The one thing that can put my smile
on my face after a super bowl loss.

435
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,210
My wife and my beautiful daughter,

436
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,710
she insisted on coming in.
Okay, come on in. You know what?

437
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,790
I don't know what happened last yesterday
and that Superbowl. I can't explain.

438
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,020
They should've been Benny Hill music
playing during that game. Can you give us,

439
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,100
are your breakdown honey bunch?
What happened?

440
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,730
Pushing the microphone away. You don't
even want to talk about you so devastated.

441
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:52,530
That's cause you're spoiled
because this, hi. Hi.

442
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,573
Hi.

443
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,600
The Patriots won the Superbowl every
year of your life until this year.

444
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,280
That's right. She's one years old.
They've already been there twice. Oh,

445
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,720
it all she knew was winning.
Sorry.

446
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,740
Sorry that you had to learn
this ugly lesson. Oh my God.

447
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:16,380
If they showed nick foals wife, one
more frigging time. I get it. Isn't it?

448
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,780
Unbelievable.
I guess I have to say as a redhead,

449
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,750
the way blonde people get treated, I
swear to God, if she was a Brunette,

450
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,580
maybe they would've panned past her face
to some fat eagles fan eaten a cheese

451
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:32,530
steak. Are you going to say anything?
He just thrown your hands up.

452
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,480
Is it weird that I have head phones
on and a microphone here can say hi.

453
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,420
You say Mama? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

454
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,980
She speechless after that loss,
right? There you go. There's a Mama.

455
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:52,840
Can you say hi? Can you
say hi buddy? You can wave.

456
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,030
Hi. Hey, who played the halftime show
yesterday? Justin Timberlake. Oh,

457
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,190
it was Justin Timberlake. Oh
Shit. I should have watched that.

458
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,680
I was pushing her up and
down the driveway, having a
grand old time. All right.

459
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,880
Hi. All right, let's stop. Stop
trying to show off here. Let me,

460
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,510
let me finish my podcast here.
All right. Come on. Say Bye. Bye.

461
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,830
David showed a quarterback's wife
that much since, um, Kurt Warner,

462
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,130
you know,
although she was a Brunette,

463
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,850
so there goes that theory.
All right.

464
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,920
They're stupid. Pompom hat on. You're
in an indoor stadium. All right, Bill,

465
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:35,770
don't be a better douche. All right, I
want congratulations to Nick Phil's wife.

466
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,930
Um, I was hoping that the Patriots
were gonna kick the shit out of the,

467
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,100
just so I could have seen

468
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,700
the sports headlines, you know, and if,

469
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,990
if nick falls through like
three interceptions, they
would've said Nick folded,

470
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,350
but it didn't happen.
Um, alright. Formula One,

471
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,040
let's get to the questions here to see.
Oh No,

472
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,440
I gotta tell you about
my show in Reno. So, uh,

473
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:01,600
I wanna thank everybody
that came out in Reno,

474
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,280
even the dose that tried to interrupt
my show and have a youtube moment. Um,

475
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,600
I, I fucking love that city,
man. I had such a great time.

476
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:15,100
I went up there and I worked my buddy
Rick Dalea, who we started out together,

477
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,600
um,
way back in Boston in 1992.

478
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:22,750
I think he may be started like a month
before we tried to figure out who started

479
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:26,210
before, but I always
remembered seeing him and, um,

480
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,370
you know, seeing a friend, you know,
Jesus Christ and we were, were,

481
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,710
I've known him for 26 years.

482
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,210
I've actually known him longer
than the age where you're at,

483
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,950
when we met each other.
So it was, you know,

484
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:41,980
just all the stories were coming
out and when he brought me up,

485
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:45,010
the actually made a reference to
this fucking hell Gig that we did.

486
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,540
Nick's comedy stop where I started.
Um,

487
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,293
they,

488
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,990
I remember that was such a big
deal to work at that comedy clubs,

489
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,470
just a legendary place. It
was the house that, you know,

490
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:03,980
Steve Sweeney and Don Gavin and
all those guys built. And um,

491
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,830
we were both, you know, no name
comics, just pass being open.

492
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:12,550
Mike hers had started hosting and like,
you know,

493
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:15,830
outside rooms like Dick Doroty
rooms and all of that and um,

494
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,670
read Rita from,

495
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,970
Nick's called us up to do a private gig
for Nick's comedy stop and I couldn't

496
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:28,870
believe it. I was like, oh my God,
things are finally starting to happen.

497
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,010
And you know, mean to Leah found out, you
know, we were working with each other,

498
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,150
which should've been a red flag
right there going like you,

499
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:41,530
they called you to all my God,
they believe in us. Right.

500
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,060
That should have been a fucking red flag
right there because both of us should

501
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:48,880
have been opening for somebody who
knew what the fuck they were doing.

502
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:51,670
But instead we show up.

503
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,880
It was the fishermen's faced
in the north end of Boston,

504
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,670
which is the Italian section,
or at least it was back in the day.

505
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,450
I don't know what, what goes on
there now. Everything, the prices,

506
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:06,100
they just driven every, every, any, any
sort of like culture has been removed,

507
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,180
which is why I like
going to be so-called B,

508
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,870
c and d level cities because there's
still that unique vibe there.

509
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,670
Um, you'll go there and see stuff that
you don't see in every other fucking city.

510
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,380
Um, you know, the same 10 fucking
corporate chains in whatever, um,

511
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,670
everybody walking around with their
Instagram look on their face, you know?

512
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,140
Um, so anyways, we show up
to this cake. It's outside,

513
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,190
literally in the fucking streets.
They tell this story last week,

514
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:37,024
I can't remember.

515
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,550
And it was like a fucking band on stage
when I'm on hits your eye like at a

516
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,440
pizza pie that so high.
Right.

517
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,800
And all the Italians and sitting there
singing and you're really just see,

518
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,830
feel this great sense of family,
tradition and culture.

519
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,200
And now you've got these two pasty faced,
you know,

520
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,080
at least Rick was half Italian.
You know, I'm fucking German,

521
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:04,100
Irish just standing there with
my fucking fire engine, red hair.

522
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,750
So dalea goes on,
nobody has any idea what's like,

523
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,800
it's fucking guys I got now we've got a
little comedy Babababa [inaudible] and

524
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,290
people like, what the, what the
fuck is this guy talking about?

525
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,850
And then delete it goes on stage.

526
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,060
Okay.

527
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,990
Trying to smile through probably
the biggest panic of his life.

528
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,230
And I remember wanting to laugh at him,

529
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:29,830
but I couldn't because I knew I had to
go on next or whatever he was feeling I

530
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:33,550
was about to feel. But at least
for me it was going to be worse.

531
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,150
Cause we, at least before he went
on stage, he had fucking hope. Like,

532
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:41,690
well maybe this'll be good.
But when I saw Rick go on stage,

533
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,270
I had confirmation that this
was not going to be good.

534
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,610
And I just remember him just fucking
interrupting this great fucking party,

535
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,670
which is so many of the
early standup gigs, you know,

536
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,760
just interrupting something that everyone
was totally enjoying and they really

537
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:56,331
don't need you.

538
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:58,880
And then they don't know that you're
coming up there and then you go up there

539
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,290
and they're like,
what the fuck is this?

540
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,723
MMM.

541
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,610
All I remember was when I went on stage
bombing and just looking up and seeing

542
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,950
all these old Italian ladies
like hanging out the window,

543
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:12,520
just looking down at us like,
like, what the fuck is this?

544
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:20,230
And just afterwards, I forget,
we probably walked out of there.

545
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:23,920
There's no subway stop or
he walked over to our cars.

546
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,383
MMM.

547
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,040
I don't even remember what, anyway, it
was great to work with him. But, um,

548
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,920
I was in the middle of my set having a
great time and I do this bit where I make

549
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:39,280
fun of the troops a little bit, you know
what I mean? And it's not even, you know,

550
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:42,040
it's not even fucking remotely,
it's like a fucking hilarious bit.

551
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,060
The first time I did it, I did it at
a VFW to make sure that, you know,

552
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:48,580
the way I was doing it,
I did in front of the troops,

553
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:50,050
they were all fucking die in laughing.

554
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:52,800
I mean those guys say that lost their
legs over there and shit and they was

555
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:56,620
still laughing. They love the
fucking bit. So I do the bit there,

556
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,821
you know,

557
00:34:57,821 --> 00:35:01,480
and I've moved on from the bit and at
this point I'm making fun of Isis and all

558
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:05,740
of a sudden this, this guy walks all
the way up from the back of the room.

559
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,260
And fortunately the chairs were like,

560
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,920
where he couldn't get all the way up
to the front. He starts yelling at me,

561
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:16,390
pointing at the stage, go
hah, show some fucking spat.

562
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,780
It's what he started seeing. I'm trying
to have his fucking youtube moment,

563
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,470
you know what I mean?
And I was like, what?

564
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,770
Show some respect for
what he's going to know.

565
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,030
So in one of those fucking things like,
yeah,

566
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:34,520
I love the military is just so fucking
off limits now that who support the truth

567
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,000
you,

568
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,390
you just have to constantly be blowing
the military that you can't even make fun

569
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:43,110
of somebody in the Navy who all he
does is swab the fucking decks and it's

570
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:46,170
getting a standing ovation walking
through the fucking airport.

571
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,590
I've done that fucking pit
in front of so many troops.

572
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:50,700
They've all found it funny.
It's fun.

573
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,100
You know this fat fuck.
Oh my God,

574
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,720
I went off on that guy show.

575
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,080
So why don't you show some fucking
respect and lose some weight.

576
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:05,670
You fat cunt for your fellow Americans
for every time you get the middle seat on

577
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:09,030
a flight and you fat fucking
man tit spill into the other.

578
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,800
But I'm so fucking sick.

579
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,900
I'm so fucking sick of everybody being
so Goddamn fucking offended at comedy

580
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:21,390
shows and just making the
whole moment about themselves.

581
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,580
You fucking mouth breathing chimp,
Jesus fucking Christ.

582
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,630
If you can't fucking

583
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,390
see through the fucking whatever that
fucking expressionists see the forest

584
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,780
through the fucking trees with all of
this shit. I just can't fucking help you.

585
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:41,280
And considering all the shit that
I had said up until that point,

586
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,080
I didn't show any remote respect
for anything. Every fucking subject.

587
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:50,490
That's what kills me.
I blamed women,

588
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,330
perceptual harassment.
That's how I started my fucking show.

589
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,823
Where was the risk?

590
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,570
Where we're the fuck was he
during that one fat fucking cunt?

591
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh my God.
I was so fucking mad at that guy.

592
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,870
I hated that security escorted amount.

593
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,470
I appreciated that they did
that thinking that I wanted to,

594
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,020
I wanted to talk to that guy for
the rest of the fucking show.

595
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,800
Walks all the fuck way up.
You know,

596
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:20,940
he was waiting for his Oprah round of
applause when I told him to go fuck

597
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:24,000
himself. Everybody left. I
can't believe that. You know,

598
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,290
that's the classic thing at like a
comedy show that usually ends up on the

599
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:32,370
fucking Internet. Um,
you know what I mean?

600
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:37,290
That self righteous fucking Douche bag.
You know what I mean?

601
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:42,291
Where everything else that I set up to
that point was so fucking ridiculous and

602
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:46,590
absurd. And then that's the
one that you're going to
take fucking seriously. Like,

603
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:50,930
what kind of a fucking moron. And
so saints, he's gay guys like,

604
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,780
did you really think I'm anti
my own country? You dumb fuck.

605
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,860
And when you guys come out to my
show, when you see the bit, okay,

606
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,820
it's so fucking pedestrian.
It's ridiculous.

607
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,370
I want to even know when I did
the fucking bit at the Vfw,

608
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,950
the troops came up to me and say,
can't we say that to each other?

609
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,190
But this fucking guy had to fucking, you
know, take his hair out of his ponytail,

610
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,640
tossing it around and come and have as
big fucking head, Roland moment. Ah,

611
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,420
fucking kill yourself.
I hope you fucking have a heart attack.

612
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,110
You fat fucking cunt.
You when it was was,

613
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:30,240
if he didn't like the bit than heckle me,

614
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,610
the fact that he came up there
and he's like pointing at me,

615
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:36,430
yelling at me like he's like,
I'm his kidneys fucking dad.

616
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,470
Anyways. Anyways, let me, let me just
fucking plow that, that other than that,

617
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:46,000
the Gig in Reno was fucking awesome.

618
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,600
And I got to be telling you that that
was actually more upsetting to me than

619
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,640
watching my team fucking
lose the Superbowl.

620
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,260
Um, all right. Anyways, here we go. Let's
get into the questions here for this week.

621
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,080
The Formula One,
oh by the way,

622
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,060
or Billy's getting in is continuing
with his getting in fucking great shape,

623
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:12,040
man. Um, I've made it,
my goal is, you know,

624
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,590
turning 50 in June,
you know,

625
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,920
two years of doing stand up comedy
and trying to get a positive out of a

626
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,830
negative five people showed up.
What do I do here?

627
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,580
Do I give in to the fact that this five
people or do I make those five people,

628
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:28,330
which they brought another 50. You know
what I mean? You get when you fucking,

629
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,210
I dunno,
when you're in this fucking business,

630
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:33,130
the greatest thing about this business,

631
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,110
unless you knew somebody
when you got into it,

632
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:38,890
most people get into it and they don't
know anybody and they have no idea what

633
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:43,060
to do. Um, and they're standing out
in the street in broad daylight,

634
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:48,040
in the Italian section of
Boston eating your Red Dick.

635
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,040
I mean, if you don't figure
out a positive mindset, uh,

636
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,930
you're really not gonna, you're not gonna
fucking, you're not going to survive.

637
00:39:55,931 --> 00:40:00,040
So I'm turning 50, which, uh, I used
to take was going to be devastating.

638
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:05,041
I'm actually really excited to try to get
myself in the best shape I've been in,

639
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,890
in by about 20 years. So, um,

640
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,350
I'm trying to get down to my,
uh,

641
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,340
basically the way I was at when a,

642
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,170
in the shape I was in when I started.

643
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:20,140
Now I'm obviously gonna fall
short because no matter what I do,

644
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:24,610
I'm still fucking about 30 years older.
But, uh, that's not what it's about.

645
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:28,270
It's about going for it. And
I'll still, you know, so anyways,

646
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:31,300
I have a weight that I want to
get into my fucking shoulder.

647
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,560
The rotator cuff feels great.
Um,

648
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:40,590
and I finally have been able to get a
regimen between all the information that

649
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:45,340
I've gotten over the last year.
Um,

650
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,900
and I've put together a
program that that is, is,

651
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:52,000
is really fucking working for me.
And I have to tell you,

652
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:53,050
you know what I did the other day,

653
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,710
other than taking my beautiful
daughter to the park on the swing,

654
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:58,270
which I think I'm going to do again today,

655
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:03,190
it's my favorite thing ever is
she was on the swing and um,

656
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,350
I was able, you know, once I
got the swing going, cause I'm,

657
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,980
I can finally lift my right arm over my
head. I been able to take my shirt off,

658
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,570
um, with both, I've had to
take it up with my left hand.

659
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,780
I'm able to take my shirt off with,

660
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:21,220
with both hands in like
over a year and a half,

661
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:24,220
which is really fucked up my
closing bit. Everybody, you know,

662
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,820
cause I really tried to get
sexy in the end, you know, um,

663
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,770
I was actually able to reach up and
hold onto like the bar above the,

664
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,580
and I made sure I didn't put any
weight on the arm all the way.

665
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:41,540
It was obviously my feet were still on
the ground and I just gave it a little

666
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,560
bit of a fucking stretch. And it was
just this tightness but not pain.

667
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,090
Cause what happens,
I found anybody else go into this shit is,

668
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,680
is when you have an injury like that,
you get into this PR protective,

669
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,980
like, um, the way you hold yourself.

670
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,290
And it's fucking crazy man.

671
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:05,150
Like having that put my hand
above my head for over a year,

672
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,040
like I can't physically do it anymore
because those tendons don't get stretched

673
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:13,520
than all this fucking Shit just, I dunno,
grows over it or whatever. They just,

674
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,430
it's weird.
It feels like it doesn't feel like pain.

675
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:19,100
It's like there's a doorstop
and I just see, or a governor,

676
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,340
I just can't go any further. So, um,

677
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,770
after doing all these other exercises,
I end with that and it feels tremendous.

678
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,960
It was funny, I was doing that
while watching the Superbowl.

679
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,480
Then one of these others, patriots
fans was laughing at me like, dude,

680
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:35,480
you're really getting into this game.
And I was like, no, no, sorry man.

681
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:40,370
I'm just fucking working
out my, uh, shoulder. Um,

682
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,770
so anyways, uh, I hope that helps anybody
out there that has set that, that issue.

683
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,810
So I'll actually be able to work out.

684
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:51,680
But the great thing is I've discovered
bands working out with bands,

685
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,720
um, you know, in a door jam and all that,

686
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,010
which is really going
to help me on the road.

687
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,530
And I think I'm done with the
weightlifting for a long time.

688
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,040
That's kind of what got me into this
year's of weightlifting and not doing

689
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,510
enough back exercises.

690
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,650
And the front part of my body was way
stronger than the back and it pulled my

691
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:13,760
shoulders forward and one of them
came up and then I, you know,

692
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:17,080
was bench pressing and just the bones,
I don't know that,

693
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:22,081
that the rotator cuff tendon just rubbed
on it and got inflamed and then I was

694
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,870
just fucked. And it's really
something that if I, if I,

695
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:30,020
if it ever happens again, I'll be able
to get out of it and like, you know,

696
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,230
six to eight weeks by just didn't
know what to do. I thought, oh,

697
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:37,580
this will work itself out. And then
they just became all fucking glued up.

698
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,620
So anyways.
Um,

699
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,100
and have you ever gone through anything
just remotely physical like that to

700
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:47,000
finally just be able to fucking take
your shirt off a brush your teeth,

701
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,530
you know what I mean?

702
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,900
Or put the shaving cream on my
head when I go to shave my head.

703
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:54,950
I always had to put it in
the left hand, you know? Um,

704
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,940
I'm fucking mess. All right, here
we go. Formula One, everybody a,

705
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:04,180
they had Billy the red face con.

706
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,280
I've been a longtime listener for about
10 years now and the podcast has always

707
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:13,610
been a great break from the
drudgery of everyday life,

708
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,250
especially back in my university, the
university days. Okay. I'm done blowing,

709
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,810
you know. Anyways, my grandfather,

710
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,340
father and I are all car lovers.
That's great.

711
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,340
I remember falling Formula One
closely as a kid when shock villa,

712
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,950
new and Michael Back

713
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,830
in 1997.
I'm so pissed.

714
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:39,060
I miss that because everybody tells me I
miss the great days of Formula One. Uh,

715
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,150
listening to you get into Formula One
had me thinking of getting back into it

716
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:43,830
myself.
With that in mind.

717
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:48,510
I decided to buy myself an early birthday
present and bought tickets for the

718
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,810
Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona for
this upcoming season for my old man.

719
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:55,710
And I do, that's the shit I'm
trying to go to two races a year,

720
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:58,560
so I'm trying to figure
out what I'm going to do.

721
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:03,590
It's either going to be Mexico City in
Brazil or if I do some tour dates over in

722
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:07,920
Europe, I'll just book
end and with the race, um,

723
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:13,560
we shall see. Obviously Mexico
City is deceivingly far away from,

724
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,491
uh,
la.

725
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:19,350
Like I always picture that it's just
south of Los Angeles cause you know,

726
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:23,040
you just go south and you're in
fucking Tijuana. Let me look that up.

727
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,070
Where the fuck is it? Ah, you know what?
I got to hold the microphone here. Can I,

728
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,610
can I do this? Do I have this ability? Uh,

729
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,760
here we go.
North

730
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,220
America.

731
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,560
I see a map.

732
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,860
Here we go. Come on. Come on.

733
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:51,760
Slow Internet. All right, clicking on it.

734
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:53,261
Oh yeah,

735
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:57,340
it's like south of like fucking Houston
or New Mexico or something like that,

736
00:45:57,341 --> 00:45:58,174
right?

737
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,113
Yeah.

738
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,040
All right. Where do we go? There's
Australia with the fuck am I all right?

739
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:08,360
Zooming in. I really
should've hit pause. Oh yeah.

740
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:11,090
Mexico City is like south of San Antonio,

741
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,510
so it's like flying all
the way to San Antonio.

742
00:46:14,511 --> 00:46:17,780
It's like basically flying all the way
across in and all the way south again for

743
00:46:17,781 --> 00:46:20,390
almost the same distance.
It's probably, yeah,

744
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,590
the equivalent of flying to like Tampa
or something like that. But then Brazil,

745
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,000
if I go to Brazil,
I mean that's all the way you always,

746
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:31,520
I used to think of when New York,
when my buddies used to go to Brazil,

747
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:36,020
that they were flying due south and the
two south actually would get you into

748
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:40,760
like Peru on the western
side of South America. Um,

749
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,990
I would love to go down there too.
Um,

750
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:48,940
yeah,
maybe I'll do that.

751
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:51,400
And then other would actually be done
with all the races on this side of the

752
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:55,600
world. Uh, who knows? That's such
a cool thing that you're doing,

753
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,430
doing that with your dad though.
Anyways, uh, plowing ahead. Um,

754
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,830
I know you like the Air India team. I
also liked the uh, Williams Martini team.

755
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:09,250
I just liked the colors and I don't
want to pick a perennial powerhouse like

756
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:13,540
Mercedes or Ferrari. So my question is,
which team race or did you enjoy watching?

757
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:18,541
Most by father and I are going to pick
a team to root for during the upcoming

758
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,850
season to make our father son
weekend a little more fun. Thanks.

759
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:25,300
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,

760
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:26,890
yeah,

761
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,660
who did I like? I actually, uh,
Daniel Ricardo is probably, you know,

762
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,780
the closest to a Louis Hamilton.

763
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,750
And I would also say I
really liked, uh, uh,

764
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,610
cheese. I'm so new to the
sport and I haven't thought
of the name of that guy. Uh,

765
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,460
oh, I know in, in his teammate there,
his teammate was a fucking maniac.

766
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:51,670
Hold on a second. I've got to make sure
nobody switched on a team. Let's see.

767
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:56,860
Red Bull racing team, that
kid who's like 20 years old.

768
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,983
Yeah.

769
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,920
Uh, drivers. Here we go and
keep my seat. He switched teams.

770
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,920
Max for staffing was really fun to watch.
Um,

771
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,400
I would say out of the youngest of the
young drivers, he's probably the best.

772
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,480
Um,
I don't know if he's still on the team.

773
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:21,481
These guys seem to jump around like free
agents and then it's all about getting

774
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,910
on the Ferrari and the
Mercedes team, which, you know,

775
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,440
two seasons in is getting a little boring.
So I would like to see somebody else,

776
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,880
uh, when you know, so, uh,

777
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,790
I at Max for staff and I guess that's,
that's what I would say.

778
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,630
I would say that and I'm, I'm,
that's such a great thing to do.

779
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,820
I'd never been to Spain. That's amazing.
I am going to be doing a Gig, I believe,

780
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,920
to celebrate my 50th birthday. I believe
it's coming together over in Europe.

781
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,320
Uh,
I'm going to go,

782
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,570
I think I might be doing a gig
somewhere in England and then,

783
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,070
uh,
um,

784
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,620
be with my lovely wife and beautiful
daughter and maybe we're going to go to

785
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:06,490
France again. I'll try to polish
up and some of my French, but I'm,

786
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:08,920
if there's any races over there,
you know what, you've inspired me.

787
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:12,070
I'm going to talk to my, the guy who
books me today and I'll be like, we gotta,

788
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:16,360
we gotta figure out, you know what
Formula One race is going on over there.

789
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:20,320
Cause I gotta add that 50th birthday and
go to a formula one race over in Europe.

790
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:24,190
Man, that will be sick. Um,
right. More Formula One's shit.

791
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:25,870
Formula One grid girls.

792
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:31,240
Hey Billion Wallace and big
fan from Glasgow, Scotland,

793
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,250
uh, Formula One just announced
that they're getting rid
of the grid girls because

794
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:40,990
they feel this custom does not
resonate with our brand values.

795
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,540
And clearly is it odd with the
modern day social societal norms?

796
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,240
Same things has happened with the darts
and it's looking likely for boxing and

797
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:58,710
UFC in the future.
Are these probably,

798
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,840
are these probably ugly feminists
doing nice looking girls

799
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,780
out of a job or are they doing
the right thing? All right.

800
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:10,550
I don't know what the fuck I kind
of know what you're trying to say.

801
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:14,210
What are your thoughts? Cheers and
go fuck yourself. You can't, um,

802
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:20,270
yeah, that's just all,
you know, lip service,

803
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,750
no pun intended. It's just
bullshit. You know what I mean?

804
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,820
And you know,
I think it's all bullshit.

805
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,170
Here's the deal to say this custom does
not resonate as to say it's clearly,

806
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:37,470
is it odd with modern day
social norms? It isn't. It's a,

807
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,720
it's 100% at odds with
with the public horseshit.

808
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:45,720
Yeah.

809
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,140
Political correctness,
which all political correctness really is,

810
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:54,070
is being phony.
You know what I mean?

811
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,000
It's just it just denying
what you're really feeling,

812
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,860
denying what you really want to say,

813
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:02,140
denying what's you're
really fucking thinking.

814
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:07,330
That's why comedians seem so fucking
outrageous. They always say, Oh,

815
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:10,450
you're saying the things that people take,
but I'm afraid to say it.

816
00:51:10,451 --> 00:51:12,450
They're not afraid to say it.
They say it in their cars.

817
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,370
They say with their friends, they
say, and at home, you know I'm not,

818
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:17,560
I'm not talking about being
a racist fucking moron.

819
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,733
All right.

820
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:26,610
They're basically trying to say that
men do not enjoy looking at beautiful

821
00:51:27,491 --> 00:51:28,324
women.

822
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,610
This is against the societal norm that
people do not gravitate towards beauty,

823
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:37,270
both male and female.
Like if you're a good looking guy,

824
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,520
you're not going to have your pick of
the litter. When it comes to women. Yeah.

825
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,540
And vice versa.
Like if you're a beautiful woman that's,

826
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:46,100
you're not going to have to fucking,

827
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,030
you know what I mean? The, I mean, you
could look at it and like a negative way.

828
00:51:51,031 --> 00:51:55,110
I always thought that because it was
outside of this country that I always

829
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,630
thought that they had a better
way of presenting beautiful women.

830
00:51:57,631 --> 00:52:00,330
That it wasn't just like that
Hooters vibe that we have here.

831
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,160
Does it look this tick by tick
between those knockers, you know,

832
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,190
the ugly way that we fucking do
everything over here, you know?

833
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:09,923
MMM.

834
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:10,951
I just,

835
00:52:10,951 --> 00:52:15,951
I think what that is is they probably
got enough crap from these women's groups

836
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:20,760
and they just don't need
the headache. So, um,

837
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:26,130
and I also feel that a lot of, you
know, when they say the, you know,

838
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:28,740
you're exploiting women and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

839
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,870
I think there's a lot of truth in that.
I don't think it's,

840
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:35,220
it's that way with this. I
think that's adds, you know,

841
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,200
what are they doing? What exactly are
they doing? Are they fucking, you know,

842
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:41,663
twerking and all that shit.

843
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:46,740
It's just a beautiful woman walking around
with a ring card. That's it. You know,

844
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,690
getting attention in a very safe fucking
way. I mean, what is the fucking problem?

845
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,630
You know? And I do know that, you know,

846
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:59,631
the way a guys can't handle a good looking
guys fucking Jack down at the end of

847
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:03,820
the bar, you know, a better looking.

848
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:08,080
The guy was fucked a good food
[inaudible] to go fight him. You know,

849
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,520
women do the same.
The

850
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:12,110
thing with the better looking woman
that comes walking into the bar,

851
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:14,690
they fucking hate him. That's, that's it.

852
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,770
So I think it's pretty fucking childish.
However,

853
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,490
Formula One is on ESPN and you know,

854
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,850
ESPN used to be great but now
they kind of ruin everything.

855
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:30,960
So I'm going to blame them. They are,
they obviously with too fucking stupid

856
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,210
to keep well boxed in who was,
was phenomenal at his job.

857
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,620
Um, I dunno. So yeah,

858
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,980
I think that's all the whole
thing is it's fucking dumb.

859
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,760
And eventually there's
going to be a backlash.

860
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,440
God forbid there's a beautiful
woman walking around on
stage God for fucking bed

861
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,710
and guys are like excited by it,
like you know,

862
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,280
in fucking whistle in a little bit.
Who gives a fucking, who cares?

863
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,223
You know what I mean?

864
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:04,110
This is my problem with feminism is that
all the corrections are made for them,

865
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,910
which is really kind of putting it out
there as if that women don't need to

866
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:13,590
adjust their fucking behavior in any
ways when it comes to men, you know,

867
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,830
and feminists get to speak in these
unbelievable like broad, no pun intended,

868
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,120
blanket fucking statements, but
guys cannot. You know what I mean?

869
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,320
I'll speak in some blanket
fucking terms for men. Hey,

870
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,150
how about sharing your own fucking money?

871
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,610
How about you buy around
every once in awhile?

872
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,670
I bet when you go through
a fucking divorce,

873
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,580
you try to do something fair and try and
instead of trying to take every fucking

874
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:43,170
last dying you possibly can,
you greedy cunts. Oh right,

875
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:47,340
we're moving on to the next one. No,
they don't need to adjust that at all.

876
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,820
They don't need to adjust any of
their fucking behavior whatsoever.

877
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:55,170
They don't do anything wrong whatsoever.
I tell you right now,

878
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:59,700
if women died that much sooner than men,

879
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,350
you don't think that
there would be a study.

880
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,630
You don't think that
there'll be a fucking ribbon.

881
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,830
You don't think some way that they would
blame men on some level that women die

882
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:12,630
that much earlier than, than, than men.
If it was that fucking way, I don't know.

883
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,600
I think that that's why guys are so funny
is because nobody gives a shit about

884
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:18,590
us. They really don't. You know
what I mean? They just don't.

885
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,490
Anything that happens to
a guy's [inaudible] songs,

886
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,260
all I have to be a subsidy
him. Right. That's it.

887
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:28,410
That's the level of support we
have for one another. Um, alright.

888
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:32,760
Deported father dear Billy Justice.
Uh,

889
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,610
two and a half years ago,
my father was deported to Mexico.

890
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,210
He had been in the US
since 1978 since he was 13.

891
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:43,170
My family struggled without him
financially and emotionally.

892
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:47,970
It's been very rough. I must've been
brutal. He's healthy and not dead,

893
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,440
but he can't be with us. Yeah. That's
got to go, man. It's fucking brutal.

894
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,950
It's been very frustrating and
words can't describe it. Uh,

895
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:59,370
I'm getting married in a few weeks and
he wasn't able to be at the wedding

896
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:00,330
everyday.

897
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:04,890
I see people criticized Trump and can
agree with their reasons for doing so.

898
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,070
But my father was deported under Obama.

899
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,260
My family knows three other people
who are also deported under Obama.

900
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,920
My white friends think they're good
people because they liked Obama but never

901
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:24,130
looked to see what was happening. Um,
they didn't care then, but they care now.

902
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:28,510
It makes me feel very mad because
it feels insincere and lazy.

903
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:33,490
As a white man who seems fairly
progressive, can you tell me why this is?

904
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:38,800
What would you suggest? I say to
them, it's an emotional thing for me.

905
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:42,310
So it's hard to choose the right words.
Congrats on your child.

906
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:46,660
I have two nieces and it's really the
greatest thing to watch them grow. Uh,

907
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,670
thank you. Um, what can you say to them?
I, it depends on how open minded they are.

908
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,970
Um,
people who are really into politics,

909
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,920
which means they 100% watch CNN
or Fox News all fucking day,

910
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:03,820
as if they're getting some sort
of fair and on bias newsfeed.

911
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:07,330
You really can't say anything to
either one of them. Uh, I mean,

912
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:12,010
there are a lot like sports
fans where, uh, I try to see,

913
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:16,580
you know, I try to, the
best I can to see Bo's,

914
00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:19,750
like I could legitimately be happy
for eagles fans. You know what I mean?

915
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,450
I can legitimately look at
fucking Derek Jeter and say,

916
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:27,451
that guy's fucking great and I can set
aside my hatred of the Yankees are my

917
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:32,230
wanting for my team to beat
the eagles yesterday. But,

918
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:36,100
um, you know, it took me
a long time to get there.

919
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:42,780
Um, so I dunno, I mean, no one,

920
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,490
the way I was wired, I would just
walk right up to him. Bj, you know,

921
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:48,910
just so you know, you're fucking
angel there. Obama, you know,

922
00:57:48,911 --> 00:57:52,420
who for some reason gets
no shit whatsoever. I mean,

923
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:54,130
it probably doesn't hurt that he went,

924
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,630
that his presidency was between
two of the fucking, yeah.

925
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,390
Two of the biggest fucking dip
shits I've ever seen is fucking,

926
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,060
did I say dip shy? And so that, cause,
trying to think over the fucking word,

927
00:58:06,061 --> 00:58:08,250
I could sing and not be
too fucking offensive,

928
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,460
but think that I'm a fucking
lefty here. 100%. Which you know,

929
00:58:11,461 --> 00:58:16,020
most of the times I am, but I mean, yeah,
keep full. We Shantay and forgive me,

930
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,580
hey, you're not getting full. We again,

931
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,090
when after that and then this guy
who fucking tweets all the time,

932
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,790
and then before that you had a guy shoving
cigars in his fucking people's twats

933
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,590
I made, I'll tell, you know,

934
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:34,690
it's been really rough since the first
George Bush who actually had the,

935
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:41,330
you know, well we, we, we,

936
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,250
we pushed Saddam out of Kuwait,

937
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,570
didn't go into fucking Iraq and was,
was,

938
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,600
was strong enough to push back against
the fucking corporations. Say, hey look,

939
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:53,220
this is not what we were doing over here.

940
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,930
We accomplished our mission and we're
going home. That's it. You know?

941
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,630
So it's been a long fucking time.
So I think that there's a, uh,

942
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:04,420
yeah,

943
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,000
does the thing with Obama, at
least he wasn't Bush or Trump, uh,

944
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,330
kind of thing so that people
have a hard time seeing them.

945
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:15,800
And I think he gets handled with kid's
gloves in the media, you know what I mean?

946
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:17,480
They, they, you know, every image of him,

947
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:21,200
he's like kayaking or fucking play
in highly and all of this shit,

948
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:26,000
like the joke I was doing in my act like
it looks like an erectile dysfunction

949
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,420
ad and they're really
kind of ignoring that,

950
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:31,940
that guy for all the hope
that he said and everything.

951
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:35,960
And I know that that job is,
you know, well, I don't know,

952
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:39,560
like literally no, but I, I understand
that it's an incredibly difficult job.

953
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:43,190
And they always say, if you can
get one thing done, which he did,

954
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:46,850
he did get Obamacare through.
So I guess it was,

955
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,690
uh, and achievement.
But I have to tell you,

956
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:55,990
as someone who does lean left to watch
him go on tour now was $70 million a tour

957
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:02,420
dates to go talk to a bunch of
fucking bankers and corporations,

958
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,860
you know, and all of that. And,
and just, I dunno, it just,

959
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,890
it's as far as the way I read that,

960
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:12,740
that's just those corporations
washing their bribe money.

961
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,550
Like we got you in office,
you did what we wanted you to do.

962
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,960
Now come talk to us for an hour and
we'll give you a nice six figure paycheck

963
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,550
and we'll all do it.

964
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:25,910
And then you can be worth over a hundred
million dollars like the Clintons,

965
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:27,290
like the bushes and all,
like,

966
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,460
it's so fucked up that none of them get
called out on that. It's like the bushes,

967
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,050
the Clintons,
the Obamas.

968
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:38,230
It's like you guys dedicated your life
to public service and the presidency is

969
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:44,630
the highest paying job, which now is
like a half a million dollars a year.

970
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:49,040
If you do two terms,
you're going to grow stops.

971
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,490
You're going, what does that 500
times fucking eight. What is that?

972
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:57,120
That's 4 million bucks.
And somehow they, they,

973
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,000
they all,

974
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,360
they're buying giant houses and they
all end up being worth nine figures.

975
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:09,830
Um, and everybody just looks the
other fucking way. I Dunno. So

976
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:13,480
I maybe,

977
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,810
maybe there's someone within your group
that is understanding enough and can see

978
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:20,540
both sides of that.
You know,

979
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:24,920
like if I said what I just
said about Obama to a Trump
person, they will be like,

980
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,360
they would be going fucking bananas.

981
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,560
But then if I even remotely suggested
that Trump seemed a little emotionally

982
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:38,561
unstable and that it's really doing the
country a disservice to be tweeting in

983
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,830
arguing with people on social media,
like a seventh grade girl.

984
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:47,750
I don't even fucking respond to people
on Twitter when it comes to occasionally

985
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:51,500
I do. But this is supposed to
be the leader of the free world,

986
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:57,770
trying to get a Trump supporter to admit
to how pathetic and embarrassing that

987
01:01:57,771 --> 01:02:00,980
is. I mean, that's just kind of
the world that we're in right now.

988
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,400
But maybe one of those Obama
supporters. Maybe you could, um,

989
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:10,520
you know, I dunno. But then also
we live in such a fucked up world.

990
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,510
I'm going to believe that you're actually
Mexican and you wrote this and that.

991
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:17,780
You're not some white person that wrote
this shit because they hate Obama.

992
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:22,770
I have no fucking idea. You never
know. There's no way for me to vet. So,

993
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,010
um, if what you just said was
true, uh, that is horrific.

994
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,250
And I understand what you're saying,
uh,

995
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,190
about Obama because, you know, I,

996
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,820
I think the best thing he had was he
could deliver a speech better than Bush or

997
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:39,930
Trump, but a, at the end of the
day, I even know the, you know,

998
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:43,350
the needle kind of lean more
left when he was in office.

999
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:47,420
Did the ship stayed on course,
if you know what I'm saying. Um,

1000
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,760
and that what I'm wearing right now,

1001
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:54,170
I want that guy from Reno to come walking
into my fucking Romeo heck shows the

1002
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,090
respect. Alright. Boyfriend's best friend,

1003
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,070
a dear Billy boy lady here.
Oh,

1004
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,720
here comes some red shoe diaries.
Shit,

1005
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,230
I been seeing slash dating my best friend

1006
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,360
for almost a year now. And we love
listening to your podcast together.

1007
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:16,380
It's almost, it's absolute. It's
going absolutely fucking wonderful.

1008
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:20,280
Except the one thing,
oh,

1009
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,140
well this the one and a
completely different direction.

1010
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:25,230
I thought you to say you ended up banging
your fucking boyfriend's best friend.

1011
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,110
All right. Okay. Um,

1012
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:32,550
it's going absolutely fucking wonderful
except for one thing is best friends

1013
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:37,551
sent him pictures of naked slash f slash
half naked girls from Instagram to him.

1014
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:44,850
Uh, we recently became long distance,
so I'm not sure of the frequency still,

1015
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:48,390
but before I moved away,
he did it almost daily.

1016
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,010
My issue is one,

1017
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:55,350
his best friend girlfriends complain to
me about it instead of taking it up with

1018
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:58,630
him
and I tell her,

1019
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,120
I tell her to just talk
to him way, way, way.

1020
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:04,630
I don't think there's too
many fucking pronouns in here.

1021
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:09,500
I don't know who the fuck
you talking about. Oh,

1022
01:04:09,501 --> 01:04:10,760
his best friend's girlfriend.

1023
01:04:10,761 --> 01:04:14,960
So the girlfriend of the guy sending
the pictures complains to me about it

1024
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,150
instead of taking it up with him
and I tell her to just talk to him.

1025
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,260
And number two.

1026
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,440
It's actually hard to take that advice
because I don't want him to think I'm

1027
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:28,430
trying to control his life.

1028
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:32,960
Some of these pictures are actually girls
that they know and not just pictures

1029
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:37,190
from the chive or the code of man.
I don't even know what that is.

1030
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,271
My question is,

1031
01:04:38,271 --> 01:04:43,040
do I have the right to be heard
about out about this? Well,

1032
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:47,450
are you heard about this?
Yes. I'm going to say yes.

1033
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,740
Are you a free person? Yes. As much as
they'll let you be. So I would say, yes,

1034
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:54,350
you do. If so, how do I
bring this up to them?

1035
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:58,730
I've lost over 30 pounds over the course
of us seeing one another and frankly

1036
01:04:58,731 --> 01:05:02,300
thought it, it would stop, but it hasn't.

1037
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:03,790
Yeah,

1038
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,550
that's not why I lost the weight,
by the way. Did it for myself.

1039
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,720
Okay, well that was weird. The,

1040
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:13,750
I thought Dobbs sent you were stressing
out or thanks for the advice and kindly

1041
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,870
go fuck yourself. Ah, well
that's great. First of all,

1042
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,400
you got yourself in great shape.
You know,

1043
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:21,500
it was getting a standing ovation
right now you're, you're fucking vital.

1044
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:26,140
Saw your major organs are loving you as
we live in a world now where everybody's

1045
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:29,920
a hero, including overweight
people. You know what I mean?

1046
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,280
I'm telling you right now, uh, if your
finals were standing in an airport,

1047
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:36,550
you got off a plane that they would
not be giving you a fucking round of

1048
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:37,384
applause.

1049
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,110
I'm staying in shape is the greatest
fucking thing you could ever do for

1050
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,000
yourself and you fucking deserve it.
All right?

1051
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,710
And fucking stop playing the
victim and do something about it.

1052
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,590
And Mit to the fact that you're the
one with the hand shoving that fucking

1053
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:55,030
cupcake down your fucking throat. I'm
sorry, I'm getting off track here. Um,

1054
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,930
I would actually, I absolutely bring it
up with them. That's completely fucked up.

1055
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:03,100
If that bothers you, you should
say something and that, um,

1056
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:04,080
that other,

1057
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,080
the guys sending the
photos as being completely
disrespectful to you and you and

1058
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:10,354
your boyfriend.

1059
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,340
Okay.

1060
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,340
You know, he's happy in a relationship.
Why the fuck is he doing this shit?

1061
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,210
Maybe he's jealous. Maybe
he's a moron. I have no idea.

1062
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:21,630
I would absolutely bring it up to him
and just say it the way he said it. Like,

1063
01:06:21,631 --> 01:06:24,090
you know, this is something that's
bothered me for a long time.

1064
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:26,893
MMM.

1065
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,660
I, you know, this is so weird.

1066
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:33,310
I actually think if you
don't get emotional but you
don't like cry and do the

1067
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:36,820
woman thing, which literally freaks most
guys out. Or maybe I'm super imposing.

1068
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:40,000
Most guys with the way I feel
like when a woman starts crying,

1069
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:44,830
I just started thinking like, oh
Jesus Christ, here we go. Is it now?

1070
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:46,720
How do I,
how do I argue my side now?

1071
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,870
When you as an adult or actually
crying about this right now?

1072
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:53,403
MMM.

1073
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:57,130
Then I'm a pushover. Okay. Cause anytime
my daughter cries, that's it. I'm done.

1074
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:01,150
And my wife's just rolls, rolls their eyes
at me just like she's not even crying.

1075
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:04,180
She's whining bill. And I'm like, I
night boy, fuck am I supposed to do?

1076
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,313
MMM.

1077
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,360
I would just matter of factly just say,
you know, that really hurts me. And um,

1078
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,270
but I didn't want to bring it up to you
cause I didn't want to seem like a Nag.

1079
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:18,720
But I'm just letting you know that that
really bothers me and I don't think it's

1080
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:20,490
right.
And just imagine

1081
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,890
if we turn the tables and
one of my girlfriends was
sending me pictures of guys

1082
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:31,450
with their dicks out every day.
Like how would that make you feel?

1083
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,470
Okay.
I'm not saying you have to stop doing it.

1084
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,240
I'm just telling you that it bothers me.

1085
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:41,480
Just put it on that and let him make the
fucking decision rather than comment.

1086
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:46,450
Cause I can say it. Tell you as a
typical fucking guy, if you come out

1087
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:50,510
talk to you.
Yeah.

1088
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,660
All the guys singing it was like,
oh my God, Oh my God, how to fuck.

1089
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,590
I mean I understand that
women are more emotional,

1090
01:08:00,591 --> 01:08:04,970
but when you fucking do that and a lot
of ways it's not fair to the guy because

1091
01:08:04,971 --> 01:08:09,971
there's no way you can argue with another
adult that is literally breaking down

1092
01:08:10,281 --> 01:08:11,114
crying.

1093
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:12,380
Okay.

1094
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,070
Okay. I've been in relationships
and I've seen crying,

1095
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:21,590
you know, talking to me about
something to this level crying.

1096
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:22,700
And I'm thinking in my head like,

1097
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:25,400
I haven't seen people crying
like this at a funeral.

1098
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:31,510
So it really takes away your ability
to argue your side if you have a side.

1099
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:35,570
And that causes resentment,
you know,

1100
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,810
not to mention the fact that women
can cry on cue. I swear to God,

1101
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:43,811
I feel like some of the time it's
a money manipulation tactics,

1102
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:48,650
but if you are able to just
just say it and just say,

1103
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:51,230
I don't want to be a Nag. And I'm not
saying that he has to stop doing it,

1104
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:53,150
I'm just letting you know
that it really bothers me.

1105
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,720
And then if it was going the other way
and I was getting Dick pics sent to me

1106
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,240
every day,
I don't think that you'd be too thrilled.

1107
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,020
And then just let them deal
with that and they'd be like,

1108
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:06,290
I'm not going to say anything else about
it. I'm just letting you know. All right.

1109
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:08,630
And then let him fucking deal
with it and see what he does.

1110
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:12,920
That would be my advice. All right.
Girlfriend has higher sex drive than me.

1111
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,240
Um, all right, dear Billy. Fuck nuts.

1112
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:21,440
That reminds me of that classic Louis Ck
joke to me at a time when he was dating

1113
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:25,850
a Nymphomaniac and she,
and she kept going,

1114
01:09:25,851 --> 01:09:28,820
let's do it again. Let's
do it again. And it goes,

1115
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:32,840
and she was really just backing
into me and it really fucking hurt.

1116
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,660
And I wanted to say,
Hey,

1117
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:40,610
can you stop banging back into me
before your rip my Dick off you fucking

1118
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:45,110
psycho. But instead I
said, hey, take it easy.

1119
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,450
Uh, all right. Girlfriend has higher sex
drive than me. All right, dear Billy.

1120
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,090
Fuck nuts.

1121
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:57,200
I started dating an old girlfriend from
high school after 10 years of being

1122
01:09:57,201 --> 01:10:00,650
apart. Oh. Like, well, when
Harry met Sally, right?

1123
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:05,690
I'm now 26 and she's 27. We've been
going steady for about seven months.

1124
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:08,420
I love you. You separate. Go and
stay in the skies like an old soul.

1125
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:13,610
And everything has been great up until
around Christmas where the problem began.

1126
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,550
To give you some background,
I work from seven in the morning.

1127
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,730
Uh, she doesn't go to work until five
in the afternoon and gets out at one.

1128
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,300
Oh,
you got to work at seven in the morning.

1129
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:29,900
He didn't tell me when you stopped
though. Um, she doesn't drive,

1130
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,760
so I have to pick her up every night.

1131
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:35,150
He only day we have off together
is every other Saturday.

1132
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:37,610
By the time we get back to my place,

1133
01:10:37,611 --> 01:10:41,780
I'm completely exhausted and pretty much
falling asleep while she's wide awake

1134
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:45,860
and usually wants to have sex. Recently
my sex drive has plummeted. Yeah,

1135
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:46,790
but you're not getting any sleep.

1136
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,970
It's gonna and I can tell
you that having a kid now,

1137
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:54,290
and that's totally true to
sex in your relationship.

1138
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:58,790
It just takes such a backseat. You
kid goes to sleep and it's like, hey,

1139
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:03,791
we could hook up or we could get
like 50 minutes of sleep and sleep.

1140
01:11:04,581 --> 01:11:08,900
At that point it's like gold. Um, anyways,

1141
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,360
um,
recently my sex drive has plummeted.

1142
01:11:11,361 --> 01:11:14,340
Not because I don't find her attractive
or because I don't care about her,

1143
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,750
but I'm just drained of energy.

1144
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:20,460
After working 50 hours a week with
maybe four hours of sleep every night,

1145
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,630
and after about five months
of sex every other night,

1146
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:29,700
it starts to feel like a chore. Sometimes
I've been turning her down lately. Uh,

1147
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:32,730
this has caused a lot of arguments
and fights in the past two months.

1148
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:34,620
That's probably because
she doesn't know why.

1149
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,953
You know,

1150
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:41,250
guys, you know, generally speaking,
our horn dogs in any, you know,

1151
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,330
you could be in the middle of
the fucking having chemo in the,

1152
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,860
in your girl be hey, you all,
you fucking do it, you know,

1153
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:51,690
banging or where you stand up with
that fucking dripping your arm. Um,

1154
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,200
I feel like she doesn't respect my desire
to get some rest and I've suggested

1155
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:58,860
sex in the morning, but at that
point she's already pissed at me.

1156
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,310
Okay.

1157
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,080
All right.
Well if you communicated it

1158
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,913
and

1159
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:09,590
she's still not willing to work with you,
then she's kind of being immature here.

1160
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:10,370
Uh,

1161
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:14,450
she seems to think I don't care about her
and that when I tried to suggest maybe

1162
01:12:14,451 --> 01:12:17,120
sex a certain amount a week,
like three of four,

1163
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,690
she gets mad at me and that she
always wants tasked to initiate it.

1164
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:26,150
Uh, I've been trying to be more consistent
with being sexually available and more

1165
01:12:26,151 --> 01:12:27,020
affectionate lately.

1166
01:12:27,021 --> 01:12:30,920
Like visiting her on lunch break and
getting her small glyphs like flowers to

1167
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:33,320
show that I care. But the
problem is still here. Yeah.

1168
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,900
Cause this is all you're not communicating

1169
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,150
when we do actually have sex.

1170
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:42,960
Sometimes it's just boring for me because
I'm not in the mood or I really don't

1171
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:46,050
have the energy to do anything but
lay there. I really love this girl.

1172
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:47,850
I don't want to lose it
due to something like this.

1173
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:51,660
Do you have any advice for my problem
and when we, when we come back,

1174
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,200
you bald ginger ball bag.
Um, I would say this,

1175
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:59,540
you guys need to sit down
and have a talk and just say,

1176
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,200
just say everything you just said to me.

1177
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,610
This is the problem with
most relationships is people
in it say the things that

1178
01:13:05,611 --> 01:13:10,140
they should be saying to each other to
other people and then they expect the

1179
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:11,580
other person to be a mind reader.

1180
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:14,280
She has no idea that you
know how tired you are.

1181
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,400
Just tell her and just tell her that
you love her and that you're afraid that

1182
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:19,830
you've, that you're going to lose
her and all of that type of stuff.

1183
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,680
Okay.

1184
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:26,540
And just say the reason why I'm doing it
not been in the mood is not because you,

1185
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:30,290
it's because I'm fucking exhausted.
I'm like a Zombie.

1186
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,310
I'm getting four hours of sleep and um,

1187
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:38,000
and just tell her that it hurts you,
that you're hurting her.

1188
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:43,001
So I really needed to clear the air and
just sit down and clear the fucking air.

1189
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:48,260
All right. That's what the fuck I
would do. Okay. That's the podcast.

1190
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:53,060
Once again, congratulations
to your super bowl champion,

1191
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,290
Philadelphia Eagles.
Um,

1192
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,060
yeah,

1193
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,490
like I said, you know, I hope you guys
know all the, all these, you know,

1194
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:02,640
I had one bad fucking show in Philly
and everybody thinks I hate the fucking

1195
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:03,210
city.

1196
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:08,210
I actually loved the city other than the
fact you have 58 one ways going to the

1197
01:14:08,551 --> 01:14:12,160
left before there's one go into the right

1198
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,580
and then another 58 going left and
then 60 going right after that.

1199
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:19,170
It makes no fucking sense.
Other than that, yeah.

1200
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,540
I really don't have a beef with you.
Um, and a lot of times, you know,

1201
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,930
I wish that show happened in North
Carolina because I would've just stood on

1202
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:30,430
stage making fun of them for
losing the civil war and a,

1203
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:33,090
the fucking Charlotte
bobcat's in a hornets at all.

1204
01:14:33,091 --> 01:14:35,800
I would just make fun of all that,
losing their fucking team and all of that.

1205
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:39,490
That's what I would've done.
I just happened to be, I
was actually in New Jersey.

1206
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,760
That's the funny thing about all of
that. Um, all right. That's the podcast.

1207
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:47,770
Go fuck yourselves. Um, I
will check in on you on a,

1208
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:49,880
what is it? Thursday. All right. See you.
