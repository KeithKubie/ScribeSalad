00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:04.150
MALE SPEAKER: I'm honored to
introduce Tom Jacobs and John

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.750
Del Vecchio, who will be
presenting their book, "What's

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.490
Behind the Numbers." I know
these guys as analysts in the

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.030
Motley Fool service of
financial analysis.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.640
I have made and saved
substantial money by following

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.770
their advice.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.620
So I cannot fail to recommend
that you guys do the same.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.320
John?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.570
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Thank you.

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:37.060
TOM JACOBS: Our book title
should be pretty obvious.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.260
And then, this is who we are.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.000
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: I'm
John Del Vecchio.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.750
I'm a chartered financial
analyst.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.070
I had the pleasure of working
with Howard Schilit who is a

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.480
famed forensic accountant, and
very famous for finding

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.570
fraudulent companies that
are publicly traded.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.290
I worked for David Tice who is
the manager of the Prudent

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.650
Bear Fund which is the largest
mutual fund in the space

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.870
that's short stocks, which
is betting against them.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.170
I'm the co-manager and the
co-founder of the Active Bear

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.450
ETF, which is the largest
actively-traded equity ETF in

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.950
the market right now.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.870
I work for the Motley Fool under
the Alpha Brand which is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.350
a newsletter that's long and
short at the same time.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.580
It's kind of a hedge fund.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.740
And according to Tom, I'm
a snappy dresser.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.280
I don't write this stuff,
I just read it.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.660
TOM JACOBS: If it weren't
for John and my

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.390
non-business partner.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.730
I wouldn't even know
what to do.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.970
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Be all dapper
in an Armani suit.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.890
TOM JACOBS: I have a 2000 Men's
Warehouse suit that I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.710
got that's 14 years
old, 13 years old.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.570
John wouldn't let me
go out with that.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.580
Former lawyer.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.980
Graduate of Cornell
and the University

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.160
of Chicago Law School.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.130
The reason I mention that is not
to show off pedigrees, but

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.840
more to show you that
pedigrees are

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.590
irrelevant in investing.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.700
All you need to do is math.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.320
You don't need calculus, which
is good since that was where I

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.950
kind of ended my math career.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.890
And some of the allegedly most
pedigreed smart people don't

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.580
do well in investing.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.360
I think the life of experience
and learning from mistakes is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.530
more valuable.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.389
However, that's very valuable
when you get in front of a

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.810
room of lawyers who are
really, really,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.230
really a tough crowd.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.190
My father got me investing
at 12.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.840
He said, here's $100,
buy something.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.800
I bought Ford instead of
Wrigley, big mistake.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.690
I've been a high school teacher
in Venezuela and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.360
Kenya, all around, a lawyer and
entrepreneur, and today

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.650
I'm a portfolio manager of
Motley Fool Special Ops.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.470
What John will talk about
is what he does.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.090
What I talk about
is what I do.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.530
And we both believe that
together, this is the way to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.670
deal with risk.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.000
We're primarily risk managers.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.670
We wrote this because we watched
and lived through

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.670
painful losses through
2000, 2002.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.400
John saw this coming and it
wasn't so painful for him.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.220
For me, it was extraordinarily
painful on the long side and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.150
it turned me to value
investing.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.630
And we all know about the zeal
of the newly converted.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.100
I embraced value with the zeal
of the newly converted.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.260
And catastrophic losses in '08
'09, which really set back the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.090
investing clock for
many people.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.950
And the older that they are, or
were at the time, the more

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.220
difficult it's been.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.550
We would like this not to happen
to them or to you.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.090
Three parts today, what doesn't
work, what works, and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.760
then John will give his current
market view, which is

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.060
that there are clouds ahead.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.230
What doesn't work?

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.470
Dollar-cost averaging is
familiar to most of you.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.280
Google has a 401k plan,
I assume, being a very

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.070
forward-thinking company.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.630
And so if you participate in
every paycheck, money comes

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.670
out and you direct its
investment in options that the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.220
401k provider offers.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.280
Primarily mutual funds?

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.620
You can't buy individual
stocks?

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.330
AUDIENCE: Yes, you can.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.500
TOM JACOBS: You can.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.830
AUDIENCE: It's [? Vanguard. ?]

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.700
TOM JACOBS: Good.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.430
Excellent.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.089
Excellent, so you can
get into trouble.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.890
No, but I mean, that's a very
good option, particularly for

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.540
people who spend a lot of
time working on this.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.790
The problem with dollar-cost
averaging is that what happens

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.250
is that people stop making their
payroll deductions or

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.770
they move them to cash, and they
lose the benefits of the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.460
automatic averaging
that you get.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.990
The problem with investing for
many people, even in indexes,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.740
is that you inadvertently market
time unless you're

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.690
doing it mechanically every
single pay period, averaging

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.790
out your purchase
price, right?

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.710
The problem is that it
requires discipline.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.780
There was a great study that
Morningstar did where they

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.270
looked at the returns of CGM
focus funds Ken Heebner, who

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.180
Peter Lynch called one
of the greatest

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.620
investors of all time.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.410
Heebner's had incredible
results, but has high

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.050
volatility, right?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.210
Up and down high beta
to the averages.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.560
Morningstar found that while
Heebner did extraordinarily

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.440
well, his investors did not.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.300
They would sell after a bad year
and then they would buy

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.710
after a good year, selling
low and buying high.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.080
This actually is what
most people do.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.780
The other thing that dollar-cost
averaging requires

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.480
is a steady income cycle.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.510
And I had the pleasure of
speaking the other night to a

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.050
group of people, a number of
whom had been laid off by HP,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.120
and they were actually--

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.520
I shouldn't say this--
they were actually

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.720
very happy to be gone.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.085
But they had--

00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:46.360
they were--

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.760
and they had a lot of money.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.290
They got big lump sums
of payouts and so on.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.640
And they said, well, Tom I can't
dollar-cost average.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.790
What do I do?

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.020
So it just doesn't
fit most people.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.040
And psychologically, we know
from behavioral finance, this

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.000
is very difficult for people.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.160
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: This is one
of my favorite charts.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.630
It's about asset allocation
and why it doesn't work.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.900
This is the American Association
of Individual

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.050
Investors, which is most of
us in the room here today.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.030
This shows the three time
periods of the highest cash

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.590
position and the lowest cash
position and then today.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.310
And we'll get more into the
market view at the end of the

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.040
presentation.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.290
But I wanted to highlight
the extremes that occur.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:30.260
The highest cash position ever
was in March of 2009 at 45%.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.570
If you remember, that's the
exact low of the market.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.980
So, at this point in time,
everybody was slashing their

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.310
wrists and running under hot
water when they should have

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.060
been buying stock.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.670
And they had 14% bonds and
just 41% in equities.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.060
And now we've been in a massive
44 month move off the

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.610
bottom where equities have
well more than doubled.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.360
And if you've picked individual
stocks, in many

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.680
cases they're up
1,000% or more.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.010
The lowest cash position of all
time was March of 1998.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.000
And for those you old enough to
remember the internet boom

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.700
that ultimately crashed, that
was right around the time when

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.410
it was getting into--

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.430
TOM JACOBS: Oh, I
remember that.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.430
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah, that
was pretty painful.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.910
So everyone was fully invested
here at this time frame.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.480
74% was held in stocks and
just 15% in bonds.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.550
Today, we are at 18.8% cash.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.250
And there's a notion that
there's a lot of cash on the

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.320
sidelines in the marketplace,
and that's going to drive the

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.780
stock market higher.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.940
I would argue that that's
not going to occur.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.570
You have to remember that
this was during a

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.160
once-in-a-generation bubble
period that occurs about once

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.810
every 25 years.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.320
It takes a long time to work off
of that until someone is

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.540
stupid enough to create
the next big bubble.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.170
And we're at 18.8 and this was
11, so if you cut it in half,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.290
maybe there's 4% more that
could go into equities.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.970
But we also see a lot
more into bonds.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.670
15% bonds here and there's
21% bonds here.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.890
Why is that?

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.590
It's because demographics
have changed.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.880
The investors in 1998 have
gotten a lot older.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.660
It's 14 years later.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.420
My mother, for instance,
was a baby boomer.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.290
Her highest earning years
were from 1980 to 1999.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.720
She worked for Bristol-Myers
Squibb.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.220
She had a 401k plan, no college
education, she had

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.710
stock options, cash bonuses,
health care.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.840
Most of that stuff has
gone away now.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.080
She was fortunate enough to
retire in 1999, and kind of

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.200
rode off into the sunset.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.960
But for the most part, that's
not really happening today for

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.660
a lot of people.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.950
So I would argue that this
cash position is probably

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.930
about as low as it's going to
get, maybe just a couple

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.120
percent lower.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.130
And that's why you need to be
defensive in your portfolio.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.530
But these individual investors
are usually horrible at

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.150
allocating capital, and that's
really been the case over the

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.850
last 30 or 40 years.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.100
TOM JACOBS: And even the
big asset allocators--

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.170
brokers who have their clients
in programs where they'll have

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.460
more options, precious metals
and so on, 2008 killed it.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.420
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: And we'll
get into that as well.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.420
Active investment managers
who are quote unquote

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.430
"professionals" are just
as bad as individuals.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.447
And I'll show you an
even worse chart

00:09:01.447 --> 00:09:02.347
when we get to that.

00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:03.720
TOM JACOBS: Right.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.890
What investors want is safety.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.020
They want to buy and forget,
and they want inflation

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.960
protection.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.840
What they get is volatility,
which scares them into selling

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.550
low and buying high.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.650
They buy, forget, and then they
lose, and inflation is

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.500
beyond their control.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.280
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Today's
winners are tomorrow's losers.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.800
So growth loses over time.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.400
And the stocks from
one generation--

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.750
their leaders are generally not
the leaders of the next.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.190
So imagine that we are here in
1979 and I told you that we

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.550
were talking about Eastman
Kodak, and Polaroid, and

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.440
companies like that that were
Nifty Fifty stocks.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.260
And I said, in 30 years they're
either going to be

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.990
bankrupt or bailed out
by the government,

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.280
or cut their dividends.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.310
That would sound like blasphemy,
but that's exactly

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.800
what happened.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.720
Roll forward to the
internet boom.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.940
You've got Microsoft, Intel,
Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard,

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.050
those were kind of the big
horsemen of the internet and

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.420
the PC cycle.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.740
That's pretty much been dead
money for the last 14 years.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.700
So if you're a wealth adviser,
and you've got your clients in

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.260
those stocks, you probably
got fired.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.730
The bull leaders lose 80% in
the next cycle, that's

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.080
research by William O'Neil.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.450
He's the publisher of
"Investor's Business Daily,"

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.220
and has been investing in stocks
for about 50 years.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.280
And so you can't just buy a
stock and forget about it.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.120
Times change, the environment
changes, the economy changes,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.710
technology changes, and so
buying for the long term is

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.810
actually very dangerous, unless
you're just buying an

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.620
index fund and holding that
over a time period.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.190
So what we're going to tell you
to do, or show you how to

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.292
do, is avoid the losers before
they become a big torpedo in

00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:39.640
your portfolio.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.460
TOM JACOBS: Peter Lynch--

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.200
whatever respect we may
have for his books--

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.040
did a great deal of damage with
the "buy what you know,"

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.900
"buy and hold" because he was
operating in the biggest bull

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.930
market that we've ever known
and probably will ever know

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.420
when admittedly, he had very
good results, but he had the

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.340
wind at this back.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.500
I would be really surprised if
we ever see another bull

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.520
market of the length that
we had during--

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.280
what, '82 to--

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.300
JOHN DEL VECCHIO:
1982 to 2001.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.560
Well, we could argue
about that.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:11.920
TOM JACOBS: Right, we
could argue about

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.610
that, or until today.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.980
Now what I'd like to point out
here is that inflation

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.730
protection is entirely
an accident of birth.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.270
Typically we have high inflation
in war time,

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.120
followed by high deflation
as the stimulus

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.120
is taken out after.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.530
And this is--

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.160
World War I was an
example of this.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.170
World War II, where we ended up
with 90% marginal highest

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.580
tax rate because we needed to
fund the war and then printed

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.700
money to do it.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.910
Now, what we got from the
Bush administration--

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.840
and this is not political,
it's just a fact--

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.270
was guns and butter.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.360
And as you all remember from
Econ 101, if you have both,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.900
eventually you'll
have inflation.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.670
Under Lyndon Johnson, we had
guns and butter, and

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.330
eventually that led
to inflation.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.260
I mean, the idea was, give
people benefits at the same

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.240
time that you fund the war,
it's fiscal policy that

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.810
usually leads to inflation.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.780
So for example, in the 1970s--

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.800
when you add in inflation and so
on-- the average annual S&amp;P

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.535
500 return, the real return--

00:12:21.535 --> 00:12:22.800
what do I mean there?

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.030
All right, let's just say it was
negative every year for 10

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.980
years, all right?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.160
And so, if you just happened to
be in that high inflation

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.330
period, and that really got bad
in '81 and '82, it was an

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.060
absolutely lost decade.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:44.500
For example, from 1968 to
1982, the Dow was flat.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.140
Absolutely flat.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.850
So I said, OK, it
wasn't so bad.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.260
Maybe I got some dividends.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.840
But the purchasing power--

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.290
we argue over this--
dropped 50%.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.900
John says he's seen higher.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.310
So most people don't think
about inflation.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.330
They don't think about real
returns, they think about

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.290
nominal returns.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.480
A little known fact is that if
you had been able to keep your

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.860
money after the crash of '29--
and of course the problem was

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.470
most people couldn't, right--

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.990
you lose your job, you have
to spend your savings.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:16.730
But actually, the purchasing
power of the money was back in

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.590
seven years, by 1936.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.940
And what we hear all the time is
it the averages didn't come

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.710
back until the early '40s for
the S&amp;P, and the early '50s

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.270
for the Dow.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.210
But that's nominal.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:34.220
In real returns, you had the
same purchasing power by 1936.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.280
And also in the 2000s, you can
see a combination of inflation

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.130
and stock market return,
another lost decade.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.030
With inflation, it's just
when you're born.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:49.190
Stocks do not protect against
inflation, maybe if you had 40

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.400
years, 30 years.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.900
But most of us have a 20 to
25 year investing life.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.920
Kids, the mortgage,
the underwater--

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.210
OK.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.885
John.

00:14:00.885 --> 00:14:04.230
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: So one of my
favorite charts and studies is

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.820
called the capitalism
distribution.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.650
A lot of people think that
over time, stocks go up.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.180
But as I just mentioned that,
if you invested in Eastman

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.450
Kodak in the late '70s you'd
be bankrupt right now.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.940
So most companies in capitalism

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.010
actually fail, right?

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.640
You have one winner and
lots of losers.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.030
There's one Walmart and there's
40 regional retailers

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.870
they don't exist anymore because
Walmart has better

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.780
technology, distribution, better
ability to negotiate

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.450
with suppliers, and whatnot.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.690
The Blackstar Funds did a really
interesting study that

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.240
showed that individual stock
returns from 1983 to 2007--

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.950
which was really the largest
secular bull market in

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.590
history, and certainly all
of our lifetimes--

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.975
most of the stocks were
actually losers.

00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:46.690
I'll show you this.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.990
So this is the actual
distribution.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.780
64% of the stocks had a lower
total return than the index

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.230
during this time frame.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.440
The index was up 900% and
accounts for 98% of the

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.830
liquidity of the US
market, so that's

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.690
basically all of the market.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.780
About 34% of the
stocks actually

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.940
declined in absolute terms.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.700
25% of the stocks accounted
for 100% of the market's

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.410
gains, and about one out
of five actually

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.000
went down 75% or more.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.940
So just a very small fraction,
about 6%, dramatically

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.940
out-performed the index.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.100
So if you're picking individual
stocks, it's pretty

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.020
much about four to one against
you by even finding a company

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.820
that over full cycle is going
to beat the index.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.090
So again, if you're dollar-cost
averaging every

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.350
month and using the Vanguard
options, it's probably better

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.580
to do the index fund than to
pick individual stocks.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.230
The odds are just against you.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.260
And these are the statistics
that I just referenced.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.690
TOM JACOBS: I can't believe
you memorized those.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.440
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Well,
I've been saying this

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.740
speech a long time.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.080
TOM JACOBS: So the odds are
against investing success.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.920
So what do you do?

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.440
Well, you need to avoid
the big loser.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.190
Avoiding a big loser is more
important to your returns than

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.110
getting a big winner.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.800
If you lose 50%, you've got to
make 100% just to get back to

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.810
where you were.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.880
So most people wake up every day
in the investment business

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.210
and they like to go find
the stock that's

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.500
going to go up 300%.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.990
That's what gets them excited.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.260
As a short seller, and a
forensic accountant, I like to

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.170
find the company that's
going to go down 30%.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.150
Where did that come from?

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.620
Well, Tom and I were both born
in upstate New York It's

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.350
cloudy about 400 days a
year in Syracuse, so--

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.350
TOM JACOBS: In Rochester.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.026
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: That's where
you get that mentality.

00:16:21.026 --> 00:16:23.260
Is that you, Tom?

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.790
Focus not on the winners, but
on what you can lose.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.530
So, if you lose less, you
end up with more.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.800
I think it was Warren Buffett
that said, rule number one is

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.976
don't lose, rule number two is
don't forget rule number one.

00:16:34.976 --> 00:16:36.995
TOM JACOBS: One thing to say
about that though, of course,

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:39.770
is he's talking about never
have a loss on a stock.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.850
He's talking on a portfolio
basis, don't lose capital

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.020
permanently.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:51.300
And if you're 58 years old and
it's 2008 and you're off 38%,

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:58.440
40%, 45% the clock has reset so
much, that you are pretty

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.770
much looking at a permanent
capital loss in terms of your

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.785
retirement.

00:17:01.785 --> 00:17:03.720
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: I think we
said in the book that you're

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.300
drinking Natural Light instead
of Dom Perignon, or

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.210
something like that.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.230
TOM JACOBS: That
was your line.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.650
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: If it was
funny, it was my line.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:17.079
TOM JACOBS: I can't afford
Dom Perignon, he can.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.369
So here's what we're
here to do.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:22.089
We've told you everything that
can go wrong and why stuff

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:22.740
doesn't work.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.950
And behavioral finance really
was the breakthrough in this,

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.840
when Richard Thaler met Daniel
Kahneman, the 2002 Nobelist in

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.430
economics--

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.790
who is, by the way, a
sociologist in economics-- and

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.730
some of you may have read his
most recent book, I bet.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.110
Thaler was an economist.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.860
I actually knew him when he was
getting his Ph.D. at the

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.440
University of Rochester, and I
always dropped that name even

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.890
though I met him twice, to bask
in his reflecting glory.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.310
He then went on to great
fame and fortune.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.460
He was doing research one day
and he found out that this

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.180
sociologist was doing exactly
what he was doing, which was

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.970
trying to find out why the
Chicago School of reactionary

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.610
conservative economics
was wrong.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.300
That we don't do rational
things, that we do mental

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.800
accounting, that we find
$20 on the floor--

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.150
well, that was then-- we find
$100 on the floor and we go,

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.490
all right, dinner, drinking,
whatever is the vice.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.410
And they have pretty much
displaced, and this is the

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.720
dominant economic theory, and
it's one of the reasons why

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.960
what we're going to
talk about works.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.360
People don't behave
rationally.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.660
You get emotional.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.530
People don't dollar-cost average
with discipline.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.640
They change jobs, they
change options.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.070
And the same with asset
allocation.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.220
They become afraid, they
act emotionally.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.280
So what we're not going to do is
just scare you and tell you

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.440
how bad everything is, because
we've learned that people

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.010
don't behave rationally.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.680
Rather, it's how to take
advantage of that, and so

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.500
we'll show you where you're
going to die so

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.490
you don't go there.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.350
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: So what I
do professionally is I'm a

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.830
forensic accountant, which is
two fancy words for reading

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.165
numbers and finding companies
that are using accounting in

00:19:07.165 --> 00:19:08.700
an aggressive fashion to mask a

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.430
deterioration in their business.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.100
Every company has a
bump in the road.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.980
So no company has just a
straight trajectory in growth.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.790
We all experience negative
cycles, where maybe it's

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.100
related to the economy, or
a competitor comes in, or

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.290
whatever the case may be.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.830
So the question is, is
management open and

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.260
honest about it--

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.800
I'm talking about to Wall
Street, not just the

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.900
employees--

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.200
or do they cover it up.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.260
There's a lot of levers that
management or a CFO can pull

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.710
to mask a deterioration
in their business.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.070
Most of us are optimistic about
the trajectory of our

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.420
business and we think it's a
short term bump in the road.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.040
Unfortunately, the world doesn't
really work that way.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.860
And what turns into a one
quarter bump in the road

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.760
sometimes is a major secular
decline, such as like at

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.440
Hewlett-Packard for instance,
which we're seeing today.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.000
So the number one predictor
is revenue related.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.430
And I'm going to get into
exactly how to identify that.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:04.350
And then on Tom's side, it's
buy valuable assets for 50

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.630
cents on the dollar and have a
catalyst that's actually going

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.020
to be realized, so that value
will be realized.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.440
So avoid the blowups--

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.715
that's not my picture.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.040
So the four top earnings quality
predictors, one is so

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.740
aggressive revenue
recognition.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.030
The second is aggressive
inventory management.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.900
In a company like this, you
don't really have inventory,

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.510
but certainly for older type
businesses, inventory can be a

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.070
key component of demand.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.453
Cash flow warnings, and serial
acquisitions which we'll get

00:20:33.453 --> 00:20:34.005
into all this.

00:20:34.005 --> 00:20:36.582
TOM JACOBS: Hewlett-Packard.

00:20:36.582 --> 00:20:38.990
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: So Wall Street
wants earnings, and

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.090
they want revenues.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.590
And so it's all about the
bottom line number.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.440
One of the great things that
Google does, actually, is they

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.880
don't give Wall Street
guidance.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.840
And so that means the analysts
actually have to do work.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.890
They can't just plug it into
a model and come out with a

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.480
number that management gave
them, which works in your

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.470
favor if you're going to exceed
the expectations that

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.410
are out there.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.270
But it's all driven
by expectations

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.510
for revenue and earnings.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.880
So management's going to do
whatever it takes, by and

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.520
large, to keep the stock price
up, keep the stock options up,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.220
protect their own job,
make everybody happy.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.680
It's all driven by
expectations.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.570
If you think about an income
statement, you have revenue on

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.470
the top and net income
on the bottom.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.660
So the earnings that a company
reports are the least

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.980
important line item that
they ever talk about.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.100
And why is that?

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.220
Because between revenue and net
income, you have-- this

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.130
pointer probably doesn't work
very well-- but you have lots

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.440
of line items that management
can utilize to derive whatever

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.670
net income they want.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.840
So revenue is the
most important.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.390
To the extent that I have
concerns about a company,

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.080
they're in direct proportion
to where they reside on the

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.460
income statement.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.430
In an extreme case, if the
revenue for a company were

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.730
fictitious, which may be the
case with Autonomy, that

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.850
Hewlett Packard acquired--

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.080
we're really going to rag on

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.100
Hewlett-Packard today, I think--

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.120
then the entire financial model
would be fictitious.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.140
So why does it matter what the
earnings are if the revenue is

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.730
not even real?

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.550
So when you're analyzing a
company, you want to look from

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.930
the top down.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.190
The net income number is the
first line item on the

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.080
operating cash flow statement,
so when you analyze cash flow,

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.570
if the net income happens to be
manipulated, then cash flow

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.000
quality's probably
low as well.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.880
But the vertical depiction of
an income statement really

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.800
kind of helps show the way that
we think about things.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.820
So revenue related issues,
stuffing the channel.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.280
Stuffing the channel is a way
of borrowing from the future

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.950
and pulling into the present.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.570
So let's say it's September 28th
and there's two days to

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.550
go in the quarter.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.390
And we'll pick on another
company, Oracle.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.760
So Larry Ellison gets on a plane
and he flies all over

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.520
the place and he says, look, I
know you're in the pipeline

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.140
for December, but if you sign
the contract today I'm going

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.740
to give you 360 days to pay and
I'm going to give you 35%

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.090
off the list price.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.230
And you say, wow,
that's great.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.640
I got 360 days to pay.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.370
That helps my cash flow.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.210
I'm paying less off
the list price,

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.510
that improves my margins.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.760
It certainly saves on other
expenses as well.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.550
So all I care about is that it
gets implemented when you say

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.510
it's going to, and it
works out great.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.460
The problem is, now I've stolen
you from December, and

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.425
I've pulled you into
September.

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:16.710
So now I've got to go to you and
say, I know you're in the

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.220
March quarter of next year, but
if you come on in, we'll

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.140
give you a big deal.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.870
So you're kind of a mouse
on a treadmill.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:24.970
Eventually, you run out--

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.210
TOM JACOBS: What it's really
like is, you borrow money--

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.250
I mean additional to that-- is
you borrow money from the

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.370
local loan shark at a high rate,
and then he wants his

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.080
money, so you go to the next
loan shark at a higher rate,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.930
and eventually you're dead,
because that's how they take

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.440
care of you.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.560
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Eventually
you get both legs broken.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.860
So it works until
it's doesn't.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.350
An example of a company that I
wrote a research report on and

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.360
subsequently shorted--

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.900
actually it was the largest
short position ever in the

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.425
history of our fund,
AsiaInfo-Linkage--

00:23:52.425 --> 00:23:53.445
TOM JACOBS: Holdings.

00:23:53.445 --> 00:23:56.030
JOHN DEL VECCHIO:
AsiaInfo-Linkage.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.845
Tom wrote this stuff.

00:23:56.845 --> 00:23:58.085
TOM JACOBS: It's always
my fault.

00:23:58.085 --> 00:24:00.630
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: But basically
they're a telecom

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.260
provider in China and they have
what's called percentage

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.850
of completion accounting, which
means that they provide

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.290
software to a customer and then
they go implement it and

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.130
they get to decide--

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.600
management gets to decide how
much of that project is

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.280
actually done in a
given quarter.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.880
So they estimate not only
the revenue, but also

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.970
the margin on it.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.850
So you only know the
total revenue at

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.010
the end of a project.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.810
If it's a $100 million deal, or
it's a $100 million deal.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.770
The problem is, if I want to be
aggressive, I can recognize

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.100
90 million of it in one quarter
and then the other 10

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.110
million over let's say
three more quarters.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.340
So you can front load the
revenue recognition.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.130
Well, this is the only company
in the history of my career--

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.220
and I've probably looked
at 1,000 companies--

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.180
that over 100% of their growth
was coming from percentage of

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.990
completion accounting,
which is just--

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.860
I'm not a math whiz like you
guys, but I know enough with a

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.050
four function calculator that
you can't have over 100%

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.380
growth come from that factor.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.530
And then you slap on top of it,
it's a Chinese company and

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.030
they have some question marks
with respect to their

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.010
corporate governance.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.310
And put two and two together and
then this is what happens.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.670
Stock price implodes.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.720
This black line's about where
we got into it, 21.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.580
It ended the year just
under nine bucks.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.550
Day sales outstanding
is what I just

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.540
explained with Larry Ellison.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.710
It gives you big terms.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:17.600
This is Deckers.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.740
What Deckers did was--
they make Ugg boots,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.940
the sheepskin boots--

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.120
they extended payment terms to
their customers, basically

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.780
incentivize them to go take on a
bunch of inventory that they

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.370
didn't need in order to get it
off of Deckers balance sheet

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.365
and the stock, which
went from being a

00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:36.120
growth darling, imploded.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.340
Another one of our big short
positions earlier this year.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.190
Aggressive inventory
management.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.950
Companies have raw materials,
work in

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.260
process, finished goods.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.060
Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters--

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.040
which was up big today on the
announcement of a new chief

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.410
executive officer--

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.130
has huge inventory issues, where
they've been building up

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.730
the coffee machines and the
actual K-Cups themselves.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.480
If changing a CEO would really
help a company, then

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.000
Hewlett-Packard would be
in better shape than

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
they are right now.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.780
So we see that Green Mountain
has also imploded.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.220
It's up a little
bit from here.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.560
But we actually think that
they're going to have to

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.510
write-down the acquisitions that
they made recently, as

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.800
well as potentially write
off some of that K-Cup

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.410
inventories.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.510
These are K-Cups, by the way.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.150
I don't know if you guys
use them here.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.380
But these are stockpiling up at
your local Albertson's, so

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.340
if you want a discount, you can
just go over there and get

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.790
them at 50% off.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.490
Cash flow warnings.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.990
If the receivables and the
inventories and the payables

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.430
are all moving in the wrong
direction, it can show you

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.740
that the cash flow is actually
not coming into the business.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.060
So revenue and earnings are
important, but cash actually

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.580
coming in is important.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.380
You guys like to get paid
in cash, not K-Cups.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.620
TOM JACOBS: Just one second,
on that, John.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.000
Familiar with Rambus, which is
a Silicon Valley company?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.920
I thought maybe.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.020
For years, everybody thought
they had this great IP and

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.665
they were going to win all these
cases and that they had

00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:03.300
all this cash flow and so on.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.340
And actually, there was a period
of five years where the

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.090
only operating cash flow that
they produced was from adding

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.190
back stocked-based
compensation.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:14.260
So actually, they weren't an
IP company, they were an

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.500
options giving company.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.505
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Until that ran
out, as we know, and then

00:27:19.505 --> 00:27:22.170
the stock price imploded.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.350
WMS Industries is a company
that makes slot

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.950
machines in Las Vegas.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.890
And they were offering huge
incentives to their customers

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:34.630
to take on inventory in
order to get it off of

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.150
WMS's balance sheet.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.870
They did a lot of that
channel stuffing.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.450
It was reflected in the
cash flow statement.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.650
And this was actually the first
stock I recommended to

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.250
the Motley Fool when I came
back to the company.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.620
At about $39, it went to 48,
everybody screamed and yelled

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.800
at me, and now it's at 20.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.420
And, by the way, when I
recommend these to go down,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.150
that's what I'm recommending--
to go down, not up.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.110
Serial acquisitions.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.090
Oh, Hewlett-Packard.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.402
Have we talked about
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:05.100
TOM JACOBS: Gosh, I forgot
that company somehow.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.510
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: When a
company's really going

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.850
sideways, they make a
lot of acquisitions.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.120
It covers up weak cash flow.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.920
You can stuff a lot of stuff
on the balance sheet--

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.690
expenses.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.270
So you can basically understate
your expenses and

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.020
overstate your profits
by moving it on

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.080
to the balance sheet.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.950
You can assign a lot of the
value of something to

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.210
goodwill, like a company
like Autonomy, which is

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.730
potentially a fraud.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.720
Palm, for instance, which was a
big write-down, about a $1.2

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.480
billion write-down.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.650
I think they wrote down
$9 billion of EDS.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.370
So a total disaster.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.850
Cisco Systems has been a heavy
acquirer for years.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.110
They used to do it under the old
rules, called pooling of

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.890
interests, which is when you
merge two companies together.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.300
That no longer exists.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.470
Everything is what's called
purchase accounting.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.620
So that has the ability to
really obscure the financial

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.100
statements.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.380
So you want to look at companies
and whether or not

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.770
they're making serial
acquisitions.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.740
They really get hammered in bear
markets when access to

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.540
capital gets shut off and you
can no longer finance it with

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.570
debt, or your equity is worth
a lot less because the stock

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.980
market is going down.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.910
And now we're up to Tom and
buying on the fire sale.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.060
Oh.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.200
He's asking what happens when
the company goes public--

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200
so on their initial public
offering, and they're flush

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.670
with cash, and then they
make acquisitions.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.330
It actually still obscures the
financial statements, because

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.620
the way the purchase accounting
works is from the

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.160
day they make the acquisition
forward, it's two combined

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.650
companies, not ever
looking back.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.390
So if I have $100 in revenue and
you have $10 in revenue, I

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.250
can make it look like
10% growth, even

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.870
though nothing changed.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.920
Under poolings of interest,
which is what Cisco, when they

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.880
were really growing, was doing,
it actually made the

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.410
company look like they were
combined entities all the way

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.210
back into history.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.570
So even if I'm flush with cash,
I can still obscure the

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.020
revenue growth, I can obscure
my cash flow.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.980
I can do all kinds of
shenanigans on the balance

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.390
sheet to move expenses off
there, to create all kinds of

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.130
goodwill that doesn't
really exist.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.270
And all that's just leading to
is big write-downs in the

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.310
future, and ultimately
that's reflected in

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.970
a poor stock price.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.140
It doesn't really hit you until
like a bear market, when

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.500
you can't make the next big
acquisition, because the

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.990
equity markets or the debt
markets aren't available to

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.230
finance it.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.030
TOM JACOBS: Think about
it as each time you

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.440
have another child.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.480
You're a different company.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.080
Your expenses are different.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.060
You can't compare what it was
like last year, when you only

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.190
had six kids.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.110
Now you have seven,
or one and two.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.000
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: I've never
thought about it

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.090
that way, but OK.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.360
TOM JACOBS: No.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.990
But you see, so your budget--

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.810
if you're doing year-over-year
budgeting, it's

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.890
not apples to apples.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.190
So what a Hewlett-Packard does
is they just keep buying every

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.250
year, buying every year, so
you can never see what the

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.660
family is really doing.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.080
They're like Bach's family.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.510
What'd he have, 23 kids?

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.260
All right.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.600
You can move to the
side now, John.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.670
Just kidding.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.520
I've talked about behavioral
finance already, and how that

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.580
changed the viewpoint.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.850
Of course, Benjamin Graham
didn't need to know behavioral

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.070
finance in the '30s after his
brother-in-law had to bail him

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.630
out after the market crash.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.660
Nothing worse than that, right--
having to depend on

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.880
your brother-in-law.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.380
And then he resolved never to
lose money again, invented

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.620
Modern Value Investing, taught
Buffett at Columbia, gave him

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:23.460
his only A+, gave him
his first job.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.190
And then Buffet went on to very
great things, of course,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.366
and Graham continued
his adultery.

00:31:30.366 --> 00:31:32.410
OK.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.300
This is very simple, and there's
so many books written

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.920
on value investing.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.860
It's one of the reasons
I'm last.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.110
And very few, on this.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.750
And ours, of course, is the best
because we don't give you

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.360
a college textbook.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.330
We pick the top predictors that
John has seen over time.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:55.990
I do all that work before I even
get to the value side.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.860
I don't even look at a stock
until I've done the Earnings

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.340
Quality Analysis.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.610
This is Graham's Mr. Market.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:08.090
This is your business partner
who, when everything is great,

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.500
wants to pay you any price for
your half of the business.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.320
That's when you want to sell.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.370
This is Mr. Market when
everything's awful, and things

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.290
are going to get worse, and
never going to get any better,

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.910
and please take my shares for
whatever price you want.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.140
This is when you get to buy
dollars for pennies and then

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.280
sell them for more than
they're worth.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.140
Tweedy, Browne did a study
of many decades--

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.430
50 studies they looked at
of what actually works.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.510
They found five characteristics.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.480
And I'll go through
each of these.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.150
The first is you want
to buy an asset for

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.390
less than it's worth.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.890
And this happens because
of emotional markets.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.210
You get the chance.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.720
Efficient Markets Theory, that
many of us learned in finance

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.000
or MBA school, is
just no longer--

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.100
these poor Chicago Nobelists are
now reduced to writing in

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.400
The Economist ad hominem attacks
on the behavioral

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.080
finance people because
they can't

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.330
think of anything [? of ?]

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.660
[? facts ?] to refute it with.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.890
It was very sad to see Lucas,
a great, great mind, writing

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.225
in the back of The Economist
and addressing no facts.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.550
I like tangibles.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.140
I like things I can
hold on to because

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.070
they're easier to value.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.060
It does not mean they
lose value.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:29.140
A building with cash flows, gold
in the ground, silver in

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.270
the ground, oil, gas.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.230
I like things I can taste,
touch, feel, smell.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.180
I don't own Google.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.020
If I did own a tech stock--

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.020
whatever that means, anymore--
if I owned one with

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.480
intellectual property, this
is the one I would own.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.810
And that's not just because
I'm trying to suck up.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:48.500
But--

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.820
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: He's
good at that.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.475
TOM JACOBS: But I have
this friend.

00:33:53.475 --> 00:33:55.230
I've known him since
we were 16.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.780
And he's always been just
this incredible genius.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.090
He talks like this.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.300
And probably there are a few at
Google who are like this--

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.410
very smart people that kind
of talk like this.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:08.449
And he is now a muckety-muck
professor at Case Western.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:12.409
Senior, just got a great
job, basically

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:13.280
given all this money.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.980
Make this the best engineering
school in the country.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.730
They got a huge amount
of money.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:22.489
And as I was telling Alex at
lunch, I went to see him, we

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:23.909
had a friend's reunion
in August.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.570
And he told me, Tom, I just want
to explain why you need

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.030
an Android phone.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.659
OK?

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.380
I just want to explain to you
why Google is great and Apple

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.270
is now as evil as Microsoft.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.870
And he showed me the amount of
data he is processing all

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.150
around the world all day long.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:44.460
He's testing solar panels,
it's all amazing.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.860
Free Google software.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.429
He is using something
probably some of you

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.770
made, and it's free.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.780
And he could not do his
job without it.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.080
So all these companies that
he's testing whether these

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.550
solar panels will really
last 20 years or

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.440
not, free Google software.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.230
That's all it took.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.430
I was done.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.410
I can't value a Facebook.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.090
I don't know if it will
become like Myspace.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.890
I think the advertising
model is a great one.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.340
I was just never very
good at intangibles.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.550
Tangibles, they have prices.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.600
They're quoted every day.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.340
Commodities.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.456
Rents for commercial
buildings.

00:35:27.456 --> 00:35:28.230
All right.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.860
I think I've beaten that
horse to death.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.240
Low multiple of cash flow.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.650
Now, Tweedy, Browne used P/E,
and that's because for decades

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.060
and decades and decades, the
price to earnings ratio was

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.940
all you had.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.310
In fact, it was only in the late
1960s that companies were

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.680
required to report the cash
flow statement at all.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.610
Value investors love the balance
sheet and the cash

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.340
flow statement.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.270
And part of the reason, as John
has demonstrated, the

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.320
income statement is not the only
one, but a large place

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.460
where the shenanigans--

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.210
or chicanery, as we say--

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:00.230
take place.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:04.310
So I'm looking for low
enterprise value or market cap

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.180
to free cash flow.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.670
How much actual cash is the
company throwing out?

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.100
Now, it can be a trap.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.200
Bridgepoint Education is one
of these not for profit

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.100
education companies and selling,
basically, for a

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.270
dollar more than net cash per
share on its balance sheet.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.550
You'd think it would be
something I would love-- buy a

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.710
cheap asset.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:25.970
But it's intangible.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:26.870
It's not buildings.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.080
It's whatever brand they have
that can get students to get

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.640
government loans, to pay for
courses, and maybe not get

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.850
jobs because the industry is
very much in its infancy.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.960
So you would think
someone like me

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.040
would buy it down here--

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.370
price, of course, is not a
reflection of valuation, but

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.840
in this case, it's very
close to net cash.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.500
I'm buying an asset for
a very low price.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.490
I have cash protection.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:56.530
But I really don't know what th
asset is worth, so I can't

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.680
say am I getting it for 50
cents on the dollar?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.010
That's called a value trap,
where value investors will get

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:07.810
all excited about it and
nothing happens.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.790
Why do we care about low
price to assets and low

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.610
price to cash flow?

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.700
If it gets low enough, and the
business is at least steady

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.570
state, someone will buy you.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:21.820
Guaranteed.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.840
Or someone will come in and
say, you're running your

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.630
business terribly, it's
reflected in your valuation.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.310
I'll buy up a lot
of your stock.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:35.770
Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, and
some other names that are not

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.160
household names.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.770
They'll buy up a lot of stock
and agitate for you to spin

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.680
off a business.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.880
Berkshire Hathaway gets what's
called a conglomerate discount

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.490
because we know he will never
sell off businesses.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:53.120
If he did spin off businesses
and you owned Berkshire today,

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.660
your stocks all together,
after he spun off the

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.760
businesses in the public
markets, would be worth more.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.200
So we say it's a conglomerate
discount when you don't think

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.360
they're going to spin
off businesses.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.370
You're never going
to realize that.

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:08.610
So [? activist ?]

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.010
shareholders will come in and
try to create value through

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.420
catalysts to realize value,
such as spinoffs and

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.630
mergers and so on.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.870
By the way, everybody thinks
that their merger is going to

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.120
be like Lake Wobegon.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.320
85% of them don't add
shareholder value.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.880
15% do, according to a study
at Harvard, but everybody

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.080
thinks their acquisition
will be above average.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.900
Share repurchases.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.090
Tweedy, Browne looks at insider
buying in their five

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.950
points of what works
in investing.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.990
I would say that most insiders
of companies are no better

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:48.000
investors than the average
investor-- a lot of them.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.270
Now, they do know stuff.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:52.560
They do know that things are
coming down the pike, but, of

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.960
course, they're prevented for
acting on a lot of information

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.590
in certain legal
circumstances.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.170
So I prefer to see share
[INAUDIBLE] purchases that are

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.650
bought when the valuation
is cheap.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.980
When I would buy the stock
because it's selling for a

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.780
discount to assets, that's when
I want the company buying

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.710
back stock.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:16.230
I want them buying back stock
when that investment--

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.440
when the stock value is so much
below its real worth due

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.650
emotion, due to the Mr. market
we saw, fear that that's a

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.080
better investment.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.100
Buying back to the stock
at a discount.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.880
It's like me or you buying the
stock at a discount than

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.490
wasting it on acquisitions
that destroy value.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.210
I've never owned Berkshire
Hathaway.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.620
I would today, because they now
have an absolute policy.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:48.090
They buy back stock whenever
it's 110% of book value,

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.760
shareholder equity, or less.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.890
Automatic.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.410
Down to where their cash
is $20 billion.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.610
They have a lot more
than $20 billion.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.600
So that that's like a support
under the stock.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.830
Every time it gets to a certain
low value, they whoosh

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.110
in, they buy it.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.210
It's protection.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.830
The fourth point is a large
decline in stock price due to

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:10.900
emotional reaction.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.830
That's because stock prices tend
to revert to the mean,

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:17.280
which is why paying up for a
hypergrowth stock almost

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.490
always ends up in paying.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.870
What goes up must come down.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.570
What goes down comes back up.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.996
Now, obviously, not in
the case of Google.

00:40:29.996 --> 00:40:31.214
All right.

00:40:31.214 --> 00:40:32.840
AUDIENCE: But I'm guessing
in the case of Apple, so.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.130
TOM JACOBS: Yeah.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:33.710
But in the case of
Apple, right?

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.410
Now, I apologize in advance
for choosing the

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.710
Macondo in the Gulf.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:46.416
It's obviously a horrible
tragedy for the people on it,

00:40:46.416 --> 00:40:49.200
for people who depended
on the Gulf, for the

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.640
environment of the Gulf.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.440
However, I think that by
choosing something like this,

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.750
something so extreme, it's
useful to make a point.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:02.990
So I apologize in advance for
saying you could make money in

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.140
this kind of environment.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.920
But I think that it shows
you that in far lesser

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.090
circumstances, you
can, as well.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:15.140
So this is an emotional event
that will cause assets to sell

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.480
at less than their real
value because

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.110
everybody throws it out.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.370
They're scared to
death, right?

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:27.080
So that blue arrow is
Ensco, a driller--

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.475
an oil rig owner and driller.

00:41:28.475 --> 00:41:30.600
They rent themselves out,
these big, huge

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.760
semi-submersible and drill
3,000, 12,000, 10,000 feet

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.940
below the ocean for oil.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.220
And which--

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:37.580
oh, gosh.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.820
I'm sort of in your way.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.480
And which produce
where the oil's

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.890
coming from today, really.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.160
So Macondo happens.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.090
Transocean's Deep Horizon
rig blows up.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.830
All the drillers go down,
every single one.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.520
BP crashes, Transocean
crashes--

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.510
all the drillers you
can imagine.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:05.760
Which, of course, at the
particular moment, being in

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.120
front of you, I can't
summon up.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.340
But I know what I did.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.900
That weekend, I went home and
I looked at all the drillers

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.780
and I said, this is a time to
look for a company that has

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.910
little to no exposure to the
Gulf, has an excellent safety

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:24.190
record, but yet has been
hit like all of them--

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.980
has a great balance sheet.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.860
And Ensco was the
one I picked.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.960
Eventually, you had reversion
to the mean.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.400
When the fear was over, I
happened to sell not at the

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.440
top-- you never buy at the
bottom or sell at the top--

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.660
but we made some good money for
special ops members at the

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.620
Motley Fool.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.800
I think that others
did better.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.610
If you bought BP, it may
have done better.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.200
If you bought Transocean, you
definitely did better.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.570
But why didn't I buy it?

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:59.530
Because I couldn't value the
asset because the liability

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:00.580
was unknown.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.210
We didn't know how much
they were going to end

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.750
up having to pay.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.020
It was a big unknown.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.690
With Ensco, I can see
the contracts.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.000
They have them on their
site-- where all the

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.330
rigs are and so on.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.070
All right.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.620
Small market cap is
a key element.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.680
Small companies, there's less
information about them.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.900
So if you do the work,
you can uncover gems.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.220
However, they tend to be more
volatile because they have

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.360
less volume.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.660
So here's one of my favorites,
because it was a success.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.080
We all had failures, but this
one has worked out well.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.670
But just a little bit
of volume there--

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:35.890
that's what I guess [? they ?]

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.560
[? call ?] gapping up.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.870
It just zoomed up when the
Mexican Tax Authorities gave

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:45.070
them a favorable ruling on
treatment of silver taxation,

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.670
giving them another $20
to $40 million a year.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:51.050
When you're a $200 million
market cap company, $20 to $40

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:53.045
million is a lot of dough.

00:43:53.045 --> 00:43:56.800
However, it's been
very volatile--

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.030
overreacted, now, coming
back down.

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.050
So what happens, though, is that
the more money you have,

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.140
the fewer small caps
you can buy.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:05.400
Buffett--

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.670
it was $43 billion in cash.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.970
Do you think the $240 million
Primero Mining matters to him?

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.390
It doesn't even--

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.730
cliche alert--

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.690
move the needle.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.080
So, as all these guys--

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.120
the great Yale University
endowment manager, David

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.660
Swensen, and many say, size
is the enemy of returns.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.190
It decreases the universe
of stocks you can buy.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.460
If small caps provide the best
returns over time, provided

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.740
you apply all of the strategies
I'm pointing out

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.240
from Tweedy, Browne, you
all end up like rats

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.820
in a large cap cage.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.410
All these big companies--

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:41.940
they're looking at
the same ones.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.570
They're trying to find if
your $1, undervalued,

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.060
or Microsoft, $2--

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.590
it's all the same companies.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:54.420
And it's really hard to
make money that way.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.160
So what do you do?

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.300
The more money you have--

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.110
which would be a nice problem
for a lot of us, to have a

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.100
billion or something--

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.480
you look for activists,
you look for

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.240
catalysts, and large caps.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.490
These will be people like Ackman
at JC Penney, who has

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:12.000
control of General Growth
Properties, which he was

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.260
scooping up at $0.50
which is $19.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.720
Carl Icahn is now doing
this in natural gas

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.010
at Chesapeake Energy.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:24.260
I'm a big natural
gas contrarian.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.030
And, of course, in this, to
succeed, you have to be

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.980
contrarian.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.170
Now, whether that will play
out, I don't know.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:32.940
And then other catalysts
that unlock value.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.980
They can happen with big
companies, but it takes

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.270
somebody to get in there,
get on the board,

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.560
and make stuff happen.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:45.130
That summarizes that section,
and if we still have time,

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.230
John will give a--

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.268
[?

00:45:46.268 --> 00:45:46.573
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: I think
we're good ?]

00:45:46.573 --> 00:45:47.260
for five minutes.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.585
TOM JACOBS: --view of
market conditions.

00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:51.640
We'll have a couple funny slides
at the end and we'll

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.370
take questions.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.860
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.620
As a short sale, I'll try not
to be too depressive about

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.970
where we're about to head into,
but I'll do my best to

00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:59.280
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.420
TOM JACOBS: We are from
Rochester and

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.500
Syracuse, we said.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.800
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: So we'll try
to end on a positive note.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.110
As I mentioned earlier,
average investors or

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:10.310
individual investors are not
very good at asset allocating.

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:12.480
Well, neither are professional
investors.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.260
And it's probably going to be
hard to see with this pointer,

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.190
so I'm just going to
use my fingers.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.570
And this, again, is the low in
2009, and their average equity

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.170
allocation was about
0% stocks.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.090
So they're telling you not to
own any stocks at the exact

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.620
crisis low.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.960
This was when the US debt got
downgraded by Standard &amp;

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.700
Poor's and everybody was jumping
out of buildings--

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.200
this was about September,
October, 2011.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.260
TOM JACOBS: Well,
not everybody.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.900
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: I wasn't.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.540
0% equities.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.140
And then in March of this
year, they were at 75%

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.780
equities, which generally, when
they get that aggressive

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.000
on the bullish side, the average
returns are negative

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.590
7.7%, and that's right before
the market had a

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:55.650
reasonable pull back.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.280
So right now, active investment

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.720
managers are fully invested.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.110
So that's a contrary
indicator.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.470
TOM JACOBS: As contrarian as the
individuals that we saw.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:06.980
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Right.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.220
This is what's called the
Shiller P/E. This is like the

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:13.160
long-term smooth price to
earnings ratio on the market.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.020
It's at, essentially, 24.

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.955
A bull market's never started
when the Shiller

00:47:16.955 --> 00:47:18.560
P/E has been 24.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.805
This has an implied negative
return of about 2% annualized

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:23.840
to where it is right now.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.820
In my opinion, the
E is overstated--

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.790
TOM JACOBS: John, and negative
2% annualized, like,

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:29.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.935
like 10 years out, or?

00:47:30.935 --> 00:47:31.190
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: No.

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.620
Over the next 12 months.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.200
TOM JACOBS: Oh, OK.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.920
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: And so,
in my opinion, the E is

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.650
overstated--

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.890
that's the earnings-- because
profit margins are at all-time

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:40.770
highs in the United States, and
they're mean reverting.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.380
So, for instance, if you guys
had a profitable project,

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.050
chances are some sort of
competition will come in and

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.440
at least try to squeeze that
down a little bit.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.970
In the case of corporate profits
across the United

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.690
States of America, they're
at unsustainable highs.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:59.200
So if profit margins mean
revert, like they've always

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.530
done since the history of
the world, then the E

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.410
is going to go down.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.290
If price stays the same, then
the P/E ratio [? will get ?]

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:05.565
[? higher. ?]

00:48:05.565 --> 00:48:07.240
TOM JACOBS: So, John, so
we're looking more

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.920
at this than that.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.780
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.630
This is the volume
of the market.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:16.420
Stocks--

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.410
most people like to
think that they're

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:18.460
investors for the long-term.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.410
The average stock is held for 21
seconds today, to put that

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:23.110
in perspective.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.040
A lot of that's driven by
machines, of course--

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.770
computerized trading.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:30.820
But stocks are just like
milk or gas or clothes.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.570
They're a commodity,
like anything else.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:34.670
Supply and demand drives
the price.

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:38.230
So this is the secular bull
market from 1982 all the way

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.940
up to 2000, 2001, before
the internet debacle.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.260
If you notice, volume basically
trended with it.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.840
It was going up as the stock
market was going up.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.850
What you have now, though, is
the stock market's going up

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:53.420
and the volume is actually
going down.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.820
And what didn't exist back here,
even in 2000, is what's

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.380
called high frequency trading.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.600
These are these computer
machines that

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.240
just trade very rapidly.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.560
In the last five years, the
volume of high frequency

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.980
trading is up about 700%,
but the profits are down

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.300
to about one sixth.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.340
So they're squeezing
less and less lemon

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.200
juice out of the lemon.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.990
If you were to remove
that, then, there's

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.590
nobody in the market.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.400
There's really no buyers right
now, other than maybe Ben

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.990
Bernanke and the government.

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.195
But if we were to have
a reasonable--

00:49:24.195 --> 00:49:25.240
TOM JACOBS: No politics.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.480
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: If we were
to have a reasonable

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.380
correction--

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.290
say 15%--

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:30.400
there's really nobody
underneath

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.440
here to support prices.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.460
I went to the New York Stock
Exchange on the floor about

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.100
two years ago, and I was shocked
to see that there's

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.030
nobody around anymore.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.670
They're basically reading the
New York Post and playing

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:41.420
cards on their iPads.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.800
And what, in the old days,
happened was there was a

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.720
specialist, someone who's
responsible for a stock, and

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.230
that person's job was, if that
stock was crashing, to step in

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:52.730
and buy it and to protect the
integrity of the markets and

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:53.910
the shareholders.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.000
But that's no longer
really the case.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.550
So this is a very dangerous
trend, and this applies about

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.120
2% positive returns right now,
where we are, annualized.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.730
This is the scariest chart of
all, but I said I was going to

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.950
end on a good note.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:14.570
This is what happens in
secular bear markets.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:17.230
Secular bear markets are
long-term bear markets, like

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.980
what happened from
2000 to today.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.600
The stock market's flat.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.790
A secular bull market
is from '82 to 2000.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.330
And then within those big
picture markets, you have

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:29.200
cyclical bears and cyclical
bulls that last maybe three or

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.090
four years.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.820
The average duration
of a cyclical

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.260
bull market's 39 months.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:37.950
This is going back decades to
the start of maybe 1900s.

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:40.240
We're now 44 months into it.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.210
So the next cyclical bear within
a secular bear is going

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.360
to be nasty.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.740
That's where you're going to
want to put a little bit of

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.610
cash in a can somewhere
in the backyard.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.990
Because here's what
happened during--

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.860
this is the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:54.520
TOM JACOBS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.570
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: These are the
best companies in America.

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:58.750
These are the ones--
aside from Google.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:01.480
These are the ones that have
solid cash flows, they're

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.836
multinational, they probably
generate more than 50% of

00:51:03.836 --> 00:51:05.580
their revenues outside
the country.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.860
They can pay dividends,
yada, yada, yada.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.610
These aren't companies
that are one

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:11.650
product, one trick ponies.

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:15.260
So the cyclical bear markets
within the secular bear are

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:20.630
negative 29.7, negative
31.5, negative 53.8,

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.780
and negative 16.8.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.870
So if those are the best
companies, the best position,

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:27.210
or the best balance sheets, what
do you think is going to

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:29.160
happen to all the companies
underneath that that don't

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.650
have the financial stability
that the best ones do?

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.910
Well, on average, according to
William O'Neil, they go down

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.220
about two times the
average index.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.640
So on a 31% decline here, you
could see a lot of small caps

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.710
go down 65%, 70%.

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.190
But since I said I would end
on a good note, other than

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:48.050
buying Google stock,
what can you do?

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.260
You could buy dividend growers
and initiators.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:54.700
Since 1972, they've gone
up by 9.5% annually.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.290
The S&amp;P 500 on an
equal weighted

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:58.010
basis, has gone up 7%.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.150
And for all you math whizzes out
there, you know that 2.5%

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:04.230
compounded annually over 40
years is a big difference in

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.290
how much money you're going to
end up at the end of the day.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:09.610
All dividend payers are
about 8.7%, and then

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:10.650
here's the one to avoid.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:16.020
The non-dividend payers, in
the S&amp;P 500, have grown at

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:21.480
1.5% compounded annually
over the last 40 years.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.790
So that's not even the
rate of inflation.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.950
So if you want some protection,
you could buy a

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:28.290
short fund, like what I do.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:31.030
You could go into Tom's domain,
which is small cap

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:34.540
value, or you could pay
attention to dividends and buy

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.090
a large cap dividend company--
the Johnson &amp; Johnson's are

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:38.720
still going to be making
Band-Aids when you

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.490
and I are long gone.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.520
TOM JACOBS: And which is 5%
dividend right now, which is

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:42.610
unheard of, for them.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:42.820
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.114
Huge yields.

00:52:45.114 --> 00:52:46.710
So, Tom, you finish
it up here.

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.870
TOM JACOBS: All right.

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:49.250
So I'll take it out,
as they say.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.370
So we obviously think that
a long-short portfolio

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.530
is the way to go.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:57.430
Use earning quality analysis to
avoid sell or short stocks

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:02.190
that have the top predictors
of poor performance ahead.

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:05.950
And then we buy stocks offering
value with catalysts.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:09.310
When we talked about small and
how small gets hit in these

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:13.120
situations, that's also when
you keep buying, right?

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.020
There's a lot of volatility
with small.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.840
It doesn't mean they're bad, you
just have to have a longer

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.720
time frame, and when your shorts
come in, you take those

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.360
profits and put them
into the things

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.660
that have been hammered.

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:28.080
The idea is you'll
go from this--

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.140
you can all see the book's
upside down, right?

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:34.850
To this.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:38.760
And then perhaps you'll even be
in a position to where it's

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:43.990
sunset in La Brea in LA,
you'll see this.

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:45.240
Thank you very much.

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:53.050
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: That is our
billboard, by the way, by the

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:54.200
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:54.400
[INAUDIBLE].

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:54.640
TOM JACOBS: Yeah.

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.005
That's not like a Photoshop.

00:53:56.005 --> 00:53:58.870
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: It's not
superimposed Photoshop.

00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:59.660
TOM JACOBS: Questions?

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.064
Do we have time?

00:54:01.064 --> 00:54:02.190
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: I guess so.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:03.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.630
So I know you haven't said
anything about HP--

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:06.540
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.440
Never heard of it.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.215
AUDIENCE: And you also
recommend not

00:54:09.215 --> 00:54:12.210
buying large cap stocks.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.260
And HP's not--

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.530
at least not yet--

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:14.682
a large cap.

00:54:14.682 --> 00:54:15.450
But I was wondering--

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:16.620
TOM JACOBS: Oh, it's
a large cap.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:16.887
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:54:16.887 --> 00:54:17.958
I know.

00:54:17.958 --> 00:54:18.925
TOM JACOBS: Oh, you're kidding.

00:54:18.925 --> 00:54:19.000
Sorry.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:19.940
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Seemed
to be a small cap.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:21.400
small cap.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.240
So the question is, as value
investors, is that a good

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.300
investment now in '11?

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.160
TOM JACOBS: What,
Hewlett-Packard?

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:27.990
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: No.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.790
I wouldn't buy it with
counterfeit money.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.898
TOM JACOBS: No.

00:54:30.898 --> 00:54:32.450
And the reason for
that is simple.

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:33.910
The balance sheet is terrible.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:36.730
So when you're looking
at value--

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:37.840
and I don't know.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.700
What do they have?

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:39.890
Tangible, intangible.

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:42.020
They have massive
amounts of debt.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.620
In fact, I write this section
in the book, after John said

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.530
write Hewlett-Packard.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.820
Massive amounts of debt, and
they're still paying a

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.610
dividend and buying back shares,
and they're writing

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:54.180
down the value of acquisitions
all the time.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.420
This is not a value stock.

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.210
Alex, you were saying that it
was written that all these top

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:02.620
value guys have been killed
in this stock.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.170
I agree with John.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.400
I wouldn't touch it.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.150
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: They do
a lot of what's called

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:06.450
recurring, non-recurring
charges, so they take a charge

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:09.290
every quarter, but it's
non-recurring, but then it

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:10.930
happens over and over again.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:13.010
I would wait until all that's
been flushed out and they've

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.080
pretty much written everything
off their balance sheet.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.920
And then once they've thrown in
the kitchen sink, then you

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.240
could sit back, analyze it, and
look and see if they have

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.710
assets that are worth more
than whatever the

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.890
[? shared asset is. ?]

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:25.140
TOM JACOBS: Right now, you
just don't know what

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.480
really is going on.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.250
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: It's kind
of hard to decipher.

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:27.510
TOM JACOBS: All right.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:32.220
She asked what asset classes
are attractive today.

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.165
Gold, she said, was
at a high price.

00:55:34.165 --> 00:55:36.400
The stock's at a high price.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.820
And I'm sure John
has something--

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:38.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
high price.

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:39.700
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah,
I'm actually a

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.400
pretty big gold bull.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.150
I've been a gold bull for the
most part of the secular bull

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:47.710
market in gold, and generally,
the secular bear markets in

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:50.530
stocks-- like that second to
last chart that I showed--

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:53.530
they don't end until gold is
about one to one or two to one

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:55.330
on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.390
So that means either the Dow's
going to 5,000 and gold's

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:01.540
going to 2,500, or if the
Dow stays at 10,000,

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.200
gold's going to 5,000.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.230
And to put that in perspective,
it started at 34

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:09.090
to 1 in 2000, 2001 when gold
started to take off.

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:09.930
So I think gold has a--

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.650
TOM JACOBS: 32 what to--

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:13.420
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: The Dow Jones
Industrial Average--

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:13.810
TOM JACOBS: Was 34 times gold?

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.100
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: --was 34
times the price of gold.

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.150
And now it's about
eight to one.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.120
But eventually, that spread
will narrow before you get

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.630
into the next bull
market in stocks.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:24.390
I'm still bullish on gold.

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:27.880
In terms of yield, that's a
tricky one, because we've been

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.130
in a 30-year bull market
for bonds as well.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.270
I believe it's the first time
that bonds have outperformed

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:36.000
stocks over a 30-year period.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.650
I like some certain
high yield bonds.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.090
There's a fund that
we know of--

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:41.350
TOM JACOBS: Oh, we love it.

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.650
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: [INAUDIBLE]
called HYLD.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.120
It's the Peritus High
Yield Fund.

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.470
TOM JACOBS: That's
the ticker, HYLD.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:46.810
That's not a recommendation.

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:47.770
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: That's not a
recommendation, but they're

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:50.910
very good at picking certain
high yield bonds.

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.800
Otherwise, it's very tough to
find yield in a zero interest

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.510
rate environment [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:55.430
TOM JACOBS: John, if
I could just add.

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:56.000
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Absolutely.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.410
TOM JACOBS: Part of the reason
that we also are very

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:03.020
interested in HYLD is that
it's led by a guy who's a

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:05.500
value investor in bonds.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:09.830
And one of the things I didn't
pick on was jockeys.

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.940
If you know someone does
something really well in an

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.280
area you don't know anything
about, and the person has done

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.550
it over and over and over and
succeeded every time, that

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:20.120
jockey can ride any
horse and win.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:24.790
And Tim Gramatovich at HYLD is
a value investor in bonds.

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:28.380
I know squat about investing
in bonds.

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.370
And he is really, really
good at it.

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:33.210
And he started with
Michael Milken.

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:37.300
He sat at the feet
of the masters.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.738
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yes, sir.

00:57:38.738 --> 00:57:41.845
AUDIENCE: So, nice
presentation.

00:57:41.845 --> 00:57:45.140
But, to me, it was very
much a fairy tale.

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:50.600
The science, 70 years of
financial economics show

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:54.490
there's zero evidence that you
can pick stocks, zero evidence

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.642
you can time market.

00:57:57.642 --> 00:58:04.590
And you mentioned that
behavioral economics is the

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:07.130
trend that's taken effect.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:08.780
But really.

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.630
That's not the truth.

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:14.545
90% of economists still believe
that behavioral

00:58:14.545 --> 00:58:15.875
economics is just--

00:58:15.875 --> 00:58:16.190
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:19.150
TOM JACOBS: So you would say
that because 90% of people

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.785
believe something, it's right?

00:58:20.785 --> 00:58:22.270
AUDIENCE: No, I'm saying the
science does not support this.

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.645
TOM JACOBS: No, and, actually,
I would disagree entirely.

00:58:25.645 --> 00:58:27.486
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: That's OK.

00:58:27.486 --> 00:58:28.430
AUDIENCE: And then
things like--

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.433
TOM JACOBS: So that's a
statement, actually.

00:58:31.433 --> 00:58:32.295
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:32.295 --> 00:58:35.230
And then one thing that I saw
missing throughout the whole

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:40.670
thing is that, finance 101,
there's no free lunch.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:41.970
You didn't mention the risk.

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:47.250
If value stocks have higher
historical expected returns,

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:50.100
it's because they're riskier
throughout riskier times.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:55.000
Because when crisis hits,
because when everything's

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.840
going down, they go down more.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.250
When you lose your job, your
investment's also down.

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:02.000
So that's why.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.090
Because you're taking
higher risk for

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:05.220
higher expected return.

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.860
It's not like, OK, I'm investing
in this thing and

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.355
I'm making more money
than others.

00:59:10.355 --> 00:59:11.640
TOM JACOBS: So what's
your question?

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.120
AUDIENCE: So I'm saying that all
these points were missing.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:15.880
So--

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.580
TOM JACOBS: No.

00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.070
What is missing, really?

00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:23.630
I think you might be making
two fundamental mistakes.

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:27.110
One, that all the studies
show you can't

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.110
outperform the market.

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:32.820
I think that's a statement
that is just wrong.

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:36.700
Because there are studies that
do show that you can.

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:40.380
And when Tweedy, Browne set
out to do it, they read

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.330
everything, absolutely
everything--

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:45.010
every academic paper they could
get their hands on.

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:48.890
And what you do is you wait
until the market throws

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:52.220
something out, and if it's not
crazy, then you wait for it to

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.780
revert to the mean.

00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:58.490
If value investing didn't
work, David Swensen--

00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.400
I mean, everybody
says Buffett.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.630
And everybody goes,
well, Buffett

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.150
had an unusual situation.

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:07.540
I can name you 30, 40, 50, 60
managers, 100 managers who

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.050
have done this.

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:11.870
Buffett's famous paper
in 1984 at Columbia,

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:13.270
he talks about this.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:16.550
Now, when you say 90% of the
economists think something, I

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.860
generally think, well, it's
probably because they're

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.340
graduate students, in order to
get a job, have to do what

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.520
they say or they won't
get recommended.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.700
And we all know that in fields
like psychology and

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.470
psychiatry, where cognitive
behavioral therapy is all the

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:34.060
rage, you can't get a job if you
do EMDR, which is now the

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.770
standard of care in the
military for PTSD.

01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:41.430
So the world moves according
to what your particular

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.620
investment is.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.740
If you're a Nobel economist,
you're not going

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.060
to say I was wrong.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.700
But there must have been a
reason that a sociologist in

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.440
2002 was awarded this in
behavioral finance.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.490
I would just say that we can
argue about this strongly, and

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:00.420
there are obviously many
points of view.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.890
But I just can't accept that all
studies show that nobody--

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:05.640
blah, blah, blah.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.750
I just-- that's [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.400
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.633
We could argue about it
all day, so we'll go

01:01:08.633 --> 01:01:09.350
on to another question.

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.930
But I'll just say that I
started my career as a

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:13.870
quantitative analyst, working
with high powered computers

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:16.530
back then, and the market--

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.990
which is generally viewed as the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:20.795
market cap weighted,
so that in and

01:01:20.795 --> 01:01:21.860
of itself is a strategy.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.800
They just decided, which, right
now, is Apple, would be

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.140
number one.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.110
That's the 31st percentile of
all strategies in terms of

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:32.170
performance from 1929 to 2007.

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:35.340
So there's billions and billions
of dollars that have

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.390
been made and are actually
managed on these quantitative

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:41.000
strategies that show that 69%
of the strategies that we

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.970
created actually outperform
the market.

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:44.860
So it's done in historical
testing and it's

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.920
done in real time.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.280
Beyond that, I don't
really know--

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.230
I mean, we could sit here and
kind of slice it a million

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:52.870
different ways, so I'm just
going to go based on my

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:53.530
experience.

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:53.860
But.

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.860
Yes sir.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.080
AUDIENCE: I just want to see if
I got your point correctly.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.970
So you started with saying that
protect yourself from the

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.201
losers and [INAUDIBLE] by
looking at the sheets, right?

01:02:07.201 --> 01:02:08.610
And then--

01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:10.590
TOM JACOBS: Protect yourself
from losers and what?

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:12.290
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: By looking at
the financial statements.

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:12.965
TOM JACOBS: Yes, right.

01:02:12.965 --> 01:02:13.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.463
TOM JACOBS: Right, yes.

01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:17.320
AUDIENCE: And then you said at
the end that [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.575
is going to go down and
there's going to be

01:02:19.575 --> 01:02:20.940
[INAUDIBLE] losers.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.220
Isn't it a big opportunity
to make money?

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.250
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:24.910
Yeah, absolutely.

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:28.150
I'm a short seller, so that's
a big opportunity.

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:32.160
In 2008, which was the largest
crisis of our lifetimes, we

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:32.810
did very well.

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:36.380
We do very well in 2001
and 2002, as well.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.000
But in a normal cycle, like 2004
to 2007, the market still

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.860
went up every year, but there
were pretty big opportunities

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.390
to find companies that were
going to blow up or

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:50.060
under-perform because the
volatility was very low and,

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.700
in general, expectations were
very high for the market.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.050
Since 2009, the market's either
been straight up or

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.850
straight down because of the
central bank interventions

01:02:58.850 --> 01:02:59.860
that are occurring.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.092
If we get back to a more
normalized environment some

01:03:02.092 --> 01:03:05.570
day, then paying attention to
these warning signs is going

01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.646
to be really crucial, even
in an up market, as well.

01:03:08.646 --> 01:03:09.120
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.320
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
over 60% of stocks

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.287
under-perform the index.

01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:17.626
So does that then mean if you
[INAUDIBLE] the index

01:03:17.626 --> 01:03:20.011
[INAUDIBLE] individual stocks
have a better chance to

01:03:20.011 --> 01:03:20.490
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.230
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: That's
a great question.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.560
TOM JACOBS: What was
the question, then?

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.280
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: So she asked
that nearly two thirds of the

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.970
companies actually under-perform
the index, so

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.310
why not [? be low on ?]
the index in

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:29.820
short individual companies?

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.600
That's exactly how we ran a
hedge fund for three years

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.990
before we launched our ETF.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:37.930
We went [? low on ?] the index
and short our stocks.

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:39.450
I can't tell you what the
returns are, because I'm not

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:43.200
allowed to, but it is a
very viable strategy.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.840
If you can pick individual
companies that are going to

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.560
fall by the wayside even when
the general trend of the

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.490
market is up, then you can
capture the spread between the

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.220
two and you've offset some of
the risk of just being short

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.170
or just being long.

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.612
Yeah?

01:03:54.612 --> 01:03:56.090
AUDIENCE: So [? you wouldn't ?]
consider in

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:56.960
the [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.400
additional margin cost for the
[? short ?] positions?

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:04.830
TOM JACOBS: She asked, does
this also include the fact

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:08.075
that you're paying interest to
the broker who's lending you

01:04:08.075 --> 01:04:10.850
the money for you to buy on
margin when you're short?

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:12.930
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: The best, or
maybe the only way for an

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:14.080
individual investor to do it is

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.750
through interactive brokers.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:18.180
They're the only ones that
really have enough inventory

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.770
of short positions available
to allow you to pursue that

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:25.800
kind of strategy, and they're
also the cheapest provider in

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.660
the marketplace, so the cost of
shorting most stocks, which

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.920
is general collateral, is
about 40 basis points.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.140
That's what it would cost to--

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.100
AUDIENCE: IB, right?

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.450
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: IB, yeah.

01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:38.820
You can't do it through Schwab,
for instance, because

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.620
they don't offer enough
inventory of shares to be able

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.220
to short them.

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.790
It's just not their
business model.

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:47.500
Yes?

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.290
Well, we'll get him first
and then [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:55.030
AUDIENCE: I just have a quick
question about short selling.

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.310
And this might be wrong, but
it's been my experience that

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.605
short movements oftentimes
happen quite rapidly, whereas

01:04:59.605 --> 01:05:01.922
long movements happen
over time.

01:05:01.922 --> 01:05:03.960
They can also happen rapidly,
but just in aggregate, they

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.060
[? happen ?] over time.

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.750
So as someone who can't be
involved in trading stocks

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:11.550
every day for eight hours a day,
or analyzing for eight

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.100
hours a day, what sort of
strategy might I have to

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.445
actually do short sales?

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.380
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Well, you
could buy an ETF that has

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.530
individual short positions, but
this isn't a commercial.

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:22.330
TOM JACOBS: Oh, John's
not promoting--

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:23.100
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.370
You're right, though, because
people run for the exits

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:26.870
really fast, generally.

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:30.020
But there also are those kind
of secular declines.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:34.120
I'll give you one that we
shorted, Research in Motion,

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.690
which we probably shorted
somewhere in the 50s or 60s,

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:38.620
and now it's in the
low single digits.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.580
We got out of it way too early--
probably around $18,

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.690
is a rough guess--

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:45.250
but that's just been a long--

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.920
there's been a couple huge moves
down, but it's also been

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.580
kind of a long slope down.

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.840
And I believe it's Chapter 7 of
the book, we give you some

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.240
technical tools that you don't
have to watch intraday that

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.400
give you some warning signs to
show you that the stock is

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.970
already starting to break down
and could signal maybe now's

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.010
the time to get in there.

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.540
I don't think what you need
to be doing is looking at

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.650
intraday quotes and really
trying to time it on a real

01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:10.390
short-term basis.

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:11.930
In fact, I don't even have
a quote machine.

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:14.750
I don't look at quotes at all
except for end-of-day quotes,

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.230
but never intraday.

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:20.020
So I think that when you have
a chance to peruse the book,

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.670
you'll see some strategies in
there that will allow you to

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:26.690
take a little bit of a longer
time frame and still be able

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:28.830
to pursue that approach.

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:29.640
You had a question, yes.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.740
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
with bigger large cap stocks

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.060
[INAUDIBLE].

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.650
I think most of the S&amp;P 500
are paying dividend.

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:40.140
You have a threshold and then
you have to pay 2%--

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.200
TOM JACOBS: So this was a
question talking about large

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.130
cap dividend payers.

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:45.990
Is there a threshold
for the yield?

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.170
Is that what you're saying?

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:50.560
I would like to just address
that one of the issues,

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.170
unfortunately, with dividend
payers is that

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:56.200
it's not just yield.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.800
Unfortunately, you really have
to look at what percentage of

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.530
revenues, free cash flow, and
income is getting paid out.

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:04.450
Because the last thing
you want is the

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.290
dividend to get cut.

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.530
For example, Shippers.

01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:09.470
They have good times.

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:11.640
They pay 11% out, 12%.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.010
That looks really great.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:15.770
But Shippers, they pay
everything out as dividends

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.490
when times are good, and then
they cut it when it's down.

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:20.900
And it happens over and
over and over again.

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.230
So as a rule of thumb, you don't
want a company that's

01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:27.610
paying out more than 50% of free
cash flow or net income.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.640
So you do have to
actually look.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.950
The other thing is, if they're
growing, it's more likely that

01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:35.330
they will be able to increase
the dividend.

01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:35.750
Fair enough?

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:36.480
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: Yeah.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.320
I was just offering that up as a
solution other than shorting

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.790
the market if we're getting
into another

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:41.940
cyclical bear market.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.970
TOM JACOBS: That
is [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:44.280
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: But if you
look at-- and I believe this

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.860
goes through 2010--

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:49.650
from 1980ish, when Apple went
public, and compared it to

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.330
Philip Morris, which is pretty
much a sleepy cigarette

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:56.130
business that had multi-business
units.

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:57.470
Apple stock is up--

01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.840
I'm making up the numbers now
because I don't have it in

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.710
front of me, but it's up like,
say, 7,500% or 10,000%, and

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:05.210
Philip Morris, with those
dividends and reinvested

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:07.350
dividends is up 20,000%.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:11.080
In other words, the dividend
is a real key component to

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.360
long-term growth in
your portfolio.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.780
And so you should at least think
about them when you're

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.439
going out there and picking
individual stocks.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:20.010
TOM JACOBS: And i think that the
point also is protecting

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:22.910
yourself if we're going
to have a large drop.

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.460
I don't think it's like,
suddenly we're talking about

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:30.275
the long side of the portfolio
conforming to the points that

01:08:30.275 --> 01:08:31.529
I made from the study.

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:37.279
It's something you might
consider facing the kind of

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.609
long-term, possibly negative
annualized returns that the

01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:43.130
market is telling
us we'll have.

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:48.410
Now, to be fair to your question
in another way, the

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:52.630
answer easily is dollar-cost
averaging discipline.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:54.149
That's really the response.

01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:56.810
Because otherwise,
what do you do?

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:59.939
But that gets us back to
whether you can do it.

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:01.390
Some of you can do this.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:03.710
I know people that can do that
in their discipline.

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.120
But what I didn't want to do at
the beginning was to have

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.450
any doubt that the academic
studies show most

01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:14.460
people can't do that.

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.010
And that's where the
opportunities come in.

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:18.930
But if you can do that,
you can do that

01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:21.060
and go home, basically.

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.430
But it's got to be consistent.

01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.444
[?

01:09:22.444 --> 01:09:22.529
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: We've got ?]

01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:22.750
[? a-- ?]

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:23.700
[? Tom. ?]

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.359
AUDIENCE: So you're alluding
to the fact that you think

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:29.000
we're going to have another
one of these March, 2009

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.750
drops, and one thing you could
do is just say, well, I'm

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.420
going to go to cash in my
portfolio and wait for that to

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.600
happen, and then I'll buy
at the bottom and--

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.380
TOM JACOBS: Well, but you
never know when that's--

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.714
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:40.714 --> 01:09:43.959
But one of the concerns that I
have with that is if you put

01:09:43.959 --> 01:09:46.890
everything in cash, what happens
if all of a sudden the

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.290
dollar's worthless?

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.399
Do the attorneys decide that
the [INAUDIBLE] going to

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:51.770
become the world currency?

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.420
Your cash isn't
[? going to work ?] anymore.

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.436
It's just inflation drives
the cash of [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:56.436 --> 01:09:57.740
until [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.110
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: That the
kind of adverse move will

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:00.040
probably happen fast.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.440
First of all, it is
going to happen.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.560
You're going to have
panics and crashes.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.150
I don't know when it's
going to happen.

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:07.260
It could be the next year or
the year after, but you're

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:10.010
getting into an aged bull
market, was kind of my point.

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.160
You're beyond sort of
the normal duration.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.520
The dollar will probably rally
in that environment, and the

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.750
reason why is that outside of
the United States, there's a

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:21.890
lot of short dollar trades that
are on by hedge funds,

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:22.340
for instance.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.480
They've been using the dollar
as the funding currency for

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.800
their highly levered bets
because the interest rates on

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.030
the dollar are essentially
zero.

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:31.870
So it's not costing them
much, if anything, to

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:32.960
put that trade on.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.040
So when the market tanks, they
have to meet redemptions,

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.090
because people are yanking
money out of their funds.

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:40.990
When they meet redemptions,
what do they have to do?

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.310
They have to raise cash.

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.960
How do they raise cash?

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.730
They unwind their
short position.

01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:45.850
Where are they most short?

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:46.740
The dollar.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.070
So the dollar actually spikes.

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:50.100
So if you look in 2008,
during a crisis, the

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.500
dollar actually spiked.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.800
The dollar actually spiked
when the US debt got

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.800
downgraded last year.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.790
Why?

01:10:56.790 --> 01:11:00.070
Because people got nervous,
and every time they get

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.040
nervous, where do they go?

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.580
They go to the United States
and they repatriated their

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.320
short positions.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.500
That won't always be the case.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.660
I think you've got
a valid point

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.490
about the Chinese currency.

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.060
And then, actually, the Chinese
have removed, I

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.210
believe, 10% or 13% of their
treasury holdings this year,

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:17.220
so they're clearly shifting
away from that.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.780
So the only reason why the
United States gets away with

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:22.071
everything that it can do
politically and we can get in

01:11:22.071 --> 01:11:23.790
all this stuff is because
it has the reserve

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:25.040
currency in the world.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.290
So as long as that's still the
case, I think you're OK with

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:27.940
going to cash.

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.755
When that's no longer the
case, then yeah, you

01:11:29.755 --> 01:11:32.390
absolutely need to find
something else.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:35.250
But go back to March
of '09 when 45% of

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.560
the AAII was in cash.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.010
Would you have the gumption to
be able to go in there just

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.540
and just buy stock?

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.850
I mean, that's what you
have to ask yourself.

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:44.950
Only you can answer
that question.

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:47.550
TOM JACOBS: Well, and here's
how I dealt with it.

01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.520
Because I'm valuing stocks all
the time according to cash

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:57.870
flow, according to net asset
value, after learning in 2000,

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:00.620
2002, when this started
happening in 2008, and I know

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:04.160
that small caps get hammered,
but they also bounce back

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.290
faster and higher.

01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:08.820
Because when you sell and you're
liquid, it has more

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.350
effect on the stock price.

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:11.740
So [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:14.840
watching the portfolio go down
and down and down, and what I

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.490
do is I sell the higher valued
stuff, the higher

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:21.070
ratios, and buy lower.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:24.550
And you just keep doing until
there's nothing left that's

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:26.670
more attractive, and you say,
well, I'm taking losses.

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:27.590
I'm taking losses.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:29.280
Well, it was my rollover IRA.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.510
But nevertheless, the studies
would show that the returns

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.000
from this outpace the
tax consequences.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.400
It got to the point where
it was March 2009.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.660
I had no idea it
was the bottom.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.710
Nobody knows.

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:45.600
John actually has a pretty good
record with market timing

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.210
in certain situations,
but down to the day?

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:48.570
No.

01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:49.640
Nobody has a clue.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.200
I, in March 2009, had
nothing more to buy.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.610
Everything I knew was
a buyout candidate.

01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:00.280
And I just said, OK.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.660
Some day this is going to
revert to the mean.

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:08.690
And so I was down a bunch in
2008 and up 70% in 2009.

01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:11.390
But this is the volatility
issue.

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:13.410
It's why you can make
money in small cap.

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:15.140
Because people say to
me, well, Tom, I

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.740
didn't have any money.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:17.850
Well, you always have money.

01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:21.310
You just have to know what you
own, and then you switch out

01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:24.850
of the less attractive, more
highly valued to the least

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:27.360
until there's nowhere
more to go.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.720
Now, if you have the short side,
of course, the short

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.440
side is making you profits
that you can reinvest.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.920
And so this is a very hard
concept to explain, and also

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.010
it's not something you
can just do in

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:42.110
10 minutes on Saturday.

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:43.360
We'll admit that.

01:13:45.651 --> 01:13:46.670
MALE SPEAKER: Last
question, please.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:47.225
JOHN DEL VECCHIO:
Last question.

01:13:47.225 --> 01:13:47.490
Yeah.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:48.454
Go ahead.

01:13:48.454 --> 01:13:51.127
AUDIENCE: So does the real
estate market have the same

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.010
kind of cycle as the
stock market?

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:54.240
TOM JACOBS: Residential
or commercial?

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.480
She's asking about the real
estate market, does it have

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.060
cycles like the stock market?

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.190
AUDIENCE: Maybe residential.

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.750
Because I kind of feel
like housing is

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.225
starting to pick up.

01:14:02.225 --> 01:14:05.340
A lot of the stock market
has been higher and

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.010
higher for a while.

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:09.000
TOM JACOBS: The thing is, I
would never buy residential

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.390
homebuilder, ever.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.950
And that probably means
there's a lot of

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:14.520
money I won't make.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.250
Because real estate is only
worth the net present value of

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.690
the cash flows from it.

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:23.070
So really, your house is only
worth what you could rent it

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:25.770
for, discounted to today.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:28.080
Well, how are you going to--

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:28.940
it's so crazy.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.130
You've got to know the
difference between one street

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:36.200
in Palo Alto and one street in
Sunnyvale and I can't do that.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.060
Now, with commercial real
estate, particularly with real

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:44.790
estate investment trusts, if
you know the capitalization

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:46.630
rate-- sorry for the jargon--

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:51.290
that the CEO was paying, if you
can see the prices being

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:55.880
paid, you can get an idea of
the value of that building

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.746
versus the cash that
it throws off.

01:14:58.746 --> 01:14:59.980
I'll give you an example.

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.360
There's a Southern California
guy named Stuart Tanz who buys

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.530
strip malls.

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:10.620
He doesn't buy fancy Fashion
Valley in Irvine--

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.220
what's it called?

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.910
Fashion Island or something.

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:17.130
The big fancy mall
down in Irvine.

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:20.800
He goes to these neighborhood
strip malls anchored by a

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:26.105
supermarket, where there's no
competition, and somebody gave

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:30.130
him $400 million and
said, OK, Stuart.

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:32.790
Go out and buy these
in the crash.

01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:35.250
And he knew all the players
because he's been doing this

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:36.550
for 40 years.

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:39.610
So all these people
were underwater.

01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:40.420
They call him up.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.270
These things aren't
even advertised.

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:46.930
And he's taking them for the
note that they owe the bank.

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:49.300
They just want to hand
over the keys.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:53.430
And it's pretty hard to lose
money when you invest at that

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:57.940
point, because people in
neighborhoods, which don't

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.730
have other shopping options,
are going to go to the

01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:01.820
supermarket.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.710
He fixes the parking lot, puts
some trees up, puts a new coat

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:08.840
of paint on, has escalator
[? rents, ?] fills up the

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.260
empty spaces with anything.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:17.720
I mean, not just nail salons
or tattoo parlors.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.040
Just to make a little
joke there.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.050
But I can see the cash flows
from that, and I can see the

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:25.240
distressed real estate.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.110
That's one of my favorite,
favorite areas because I can

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:29.090
value the cash flows.

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:32.380
Residential, it's just too--

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.870
local, local, local.

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:35.370
JOHN DEL VECCHIO: All right.

01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:36.230
Well, thank you very much.

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:36.300
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.070
TOM JACOBS: And we'll sign
the books, by the way.

01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:41.070
Anyone who wants us to.

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:42.320
Thank you.
