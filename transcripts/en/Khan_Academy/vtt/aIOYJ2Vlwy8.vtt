00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:01.951
- [David] Hello grammarians, hello Eman.

00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:03.126
- [Eman] Hello.

00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:04.186
- [David] Today we're going to be talking

00:00:04.186 --> 00:00:07.952
about four sets of
frequently confused words.

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:12.119
The one that I want to begin
with is advice and advise.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.077
How do we keep these two words straight?

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:15.910
Well, first of all,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.972
advice with a 'c' is a noun

00:00:18.972 --> 00:00:21.722
and advise with an 's' is a verb.

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.497
These are really easy to screw up

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:25.942
because they look very similar

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:29.627
and you'd think that they have
approximately the same sound,

00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:33.081
but the 'c' is advice actually ends up

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:35.704
having a sss sound, an 's',

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:38.465
and the 's' in advise ends up

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.748
having a zzz sound, a 'z' sound.

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:43.928
Let's use these both in a sentence.

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:46.930
Bertram gives terrible advice.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.907
Mopewa advised us not to
surf on a full stomach.

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:52.852
So the word advice, the noun,

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.486
contains another noun, the word vice,

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:57.423
which is kinda like a,
it's a type of clamp

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:01.006
usually tightened by
means of a metal screw

00:01:05.913 --> 00:01:08.937
and you turn it with a handle.

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:11.356
In my context, in my experience,

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:12.764
I've used it in woodworking projects

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:14.647
to keep pieces of wood still.

00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:19.226
You want to clamp something
while it's being glued together.

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:20.622
You've got two pieces of wood,

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.125
let's say this little piece of red wood

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.309
and this little piece of blue wood.

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:28.027
You want to glue them together,

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:29.562
hold them still with a vice.

00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:32.528
If you remember that a vice is noun,

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:35.778
you can remember that advice is a noun.

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:39.029
And when you advise someone, yes,

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.553
you are giving them advice,

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:43.911
but this is the verb form.

00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:45.836
- [Eman] Now we have two other words

00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:48.140
that sound the same,
but are very different.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.074
We have aloud and allowed.

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:52.757
Now, they are both adjectives,

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:56.022
but they have different
spellings and different meanings.

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:58.167
Let's start with the first aloud,

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.522
which is spelled A-L-O-U-D.

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:03.359
Note that it has the word loud in it,

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.025
which can help us remember

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:09.192
that this word talks about
something being spoken loudly.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.430
Let's use that in a sentence.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.180
Ginny muttered aloud.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.691
- [David] So when we say aloud A-L-O-U-D

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.567
we mean it is audible, it can be heard.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:24.319
It contains that word, aloud.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.152
Cool.

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:26.388
What's this next one?

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:28.338
- [Eman] Allowed with two 'l's.

00:02:28.338 --> 00:02:30.883
And a good way to
remember this is to think

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:34.300
about the word legal, which has two 'l's.

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:36.765
If something is legal,

00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.025
it is also allowed, or permissible.

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:42.465
Let's think of an example.

00:02:42.465 --> 00:02:45.899
Oliver allowed no peppers in his soup.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.231
- [David] Very allergic.

00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:49.529
- [Eman] He's very allergic, yes.

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.726
Similarly, you might be
allowed to drive at 60 mph

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:57.256
because it is legal to
drive at that speed.

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:58.715
- [David] Sweet.

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:01.215
Let's move on to our next set.

00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:05.117
Over here we have break and brake.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.795
These are both nouns and verbs, right?

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:12.657
To break something is to crack it in half

00:03:12.657 --> 00:03:16.740
or to split or just to
ruin or destroy something,

00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:22.498
but it also refers to the
results of a crack or a split.

00:03:22.498 --> 00:03:25.661
Like you could say the break in a vase.

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.313
Whereas brake, also a noun and a verb,

00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:30.980
refers to slowing stuff down.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.595
So to slow down or the
mechanism that does the slowing.

00:03:34.595 --> 00:03:37.669
We have here both a verb form

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.049
and we have here the verb
form and the noun form.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.520
- [Eman] How do you remember
the difference between them?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.629
- [David] Let's take it
from the decision point.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.527
I'm writing a sentence and
I'm trying to figure out

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:50.032
which one I want to use.

00:03:50.032 --> 00:03:54.199
Let's just imagine we've got
this un-word, brak, here.

00:03:56.654 --> 00:04:01.455
Now, if I want to use the
break and destroy sense,

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:04.634
in order to do that I just
have to break the word in half

00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:08.238
and put that 'e' right in the middle.

00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:11.663
I broke the word in half, I put
the 'e' right in the center,

00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:14.038
and that means that I've cracked the word.

00:04:14.038 --> 00:04:17.790
But let's say I've got brak over here.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.139
I want to slow down its forward momentum.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.423
I'm going to put that 'e'

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:22.666
(mimics braking noise) right at the end.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:23.772
It looks sort of like a spring,

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:27.380
we want to halt its momentum
by putting that 'e' at the end.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.601
So let's put these into a sentence.

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:31.957
Jesse breaks a vase.

00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:34.892
And how do we remember to
say breaks with 'e-a-k'?

00:04:34.892 --> 00:04:36.684
Well, we put the 'e' in the middle.

00:04:36.684 --> 00:04:40.351
We break the word in half,
we put the 'e' in the middle.

00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:42.019
Let's do the other one.

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:44.001
Paolo slammed on the brakes.

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.908
And how do we remember we want
to have the 'e' at the end?

00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:49.775
Well, the 'e' is trying
to slow Paolo down.

00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:51.395
We're trying to halt
that momentum by putting

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.665
that spring-looking 'e'
at the end of the word.

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:56.826
This one's one of my favorites.

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:57.659
It's the difference

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.832
between bear, B-E-A-R, and bare, B-A-R-E.

00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:05.999
Now the word bear, E-A-R, can
be either a verb or a noun.

00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:11.629
When it's a noun it's this critter,

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.879
but when it's a verb it means to carry.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.986
And B-A-R-E is an adjective
meaning naked or empty.

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.086
When I say bear as a verb,

00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:25.831
I mean that in the sense
of bearing a burden,

00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:27.293
if you've heard that expression.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:30.914
Or if you've ever heard
somebody say, I can't bear it!

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.784
That literally means I can't carry it,

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:35.539
but metaphorically means
I can't withstand it.

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.570
Bare is something more like,

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.438
the cupboards were bare, meaning empty.

00:05:41.438 --> 00:05:44.155
Open up the cupboard, a fly
comes out, something like that.

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:46.293
So how do we keep these
two words separate?

00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:49.876
Well, all you have to remember
is this simple mnemonic:

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.959
E before A, take it away.

00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:55.705
A before E, everyone can see

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:58.762
that you are naked, or that
your cupboard is empty.

00:05:58.762 --> 00:06:00.888
Those are just a couple
of mnemonic devices,

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:03.845
just memory aides that will, ideally,

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:07.063
assist you in keeping these
sets of words straight.

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:08.208
You can learn anything.

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.115
David out.

00:06:09.115 --> 00:06:10.006
- [Eman] Eman out.
