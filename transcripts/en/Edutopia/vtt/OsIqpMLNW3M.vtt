00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:10.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what I want you to do
right now is in your notebook write

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:12.466
down at least one thing you know,

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:16.266
and one thing you don't,
or one question you have.

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:18.916
&gt;&gt;Because we do low stakes writing,

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:23.496
I have seen my students
become more critical thinkers.

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:28.306
I've seen them become less
afraid to make mistakes.

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.426
They're pushing each other
and themselves to think

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:32.936
about things a little more deeply.

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:47.746
&gt;&gt;Meghan Rosa: All right, ladies and
gents, we're going to start our writing.

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:48.516
Begin.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:52.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Every class, pretty much
every day, you will find kids writing.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.016
&gt;&gt;J.J.: We write in English,
Science, actually, no.

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:57.296
We write in every single class.

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:00.076
&gt;&gt;Stefano: We do writing
daily here in our math class.

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.336
We use writing to put down our
ideas and where we're at so far

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:04.386
and where we can go from there.

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So jot down what
it is that you're looking for,

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:07.906
because that can kind
of be like the question

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:08.926
that you're trying to answer, you know?

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:12.656
&gt;&gt;James Kobialka: In numeracy,
in history, in English, in art,

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:15.276
you'll see them writing thoughts,

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:17.266
writing opinions, giving
people comments.

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:19.386
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: I had a
student once say to me,

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:21.516
"I never write because
I'm always wrong."

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.896
He'd gone through all of elementary
school and he was really used to a lot

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.026
of red marks crossing
out his misspelled words.

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:31.666
For us, you don't have to have mastered
spelling before you can think deeply

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.786
about a novel or a play.

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.766
We're going to do a lot of low
stakes writing where, you know what,

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:37.826
I don't care necessarily
about the spelling.

00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:40.576
Here's an interesting issue,
here's an interesting problem.

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:43.976
Let's just think about that
on paper for two minutes.

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:48.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Describe or write
about two things that you can do

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:50.866
to improve your group's work today.

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:54.966
&gt;&gt;Meghan Rosa: Structure is obviously
so important to a piece of writing,

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:57.866
but if you start with the structure,

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.356
then you limit the ideas
that you come up with.

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:04.546
&gt;&gt;Whatever statement you're
focusing on, you can write any notes

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:05.896
that you think will be
helpful for later.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.196
&gt;&gt;We're working on argument right now.

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:10.566
&gt;&gt;The six steps for the--

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:14.166
&gt;&gt;They did a little bit of
research on two different topics:

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:18.946
should homework be banned, and do
schools need to have a police presence?

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.616
&gt;&gt;We're going to start our writing.

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.936
We have seven minutes: begin.

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:29.136
&gt;&gt;We use seven minute writes close
to daily for a couple of reasons.

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.076
It's an idea generator.

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:32.526
Like, if you only have seven minutes,

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:34.786
it's just about like
getting out a bunch of ideas.

00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:39.416
&gt;&gt;Student: I said I think that schools
should be provided with cops only

00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:42.796
if they have a Taser,
handcuffs and a club.

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:44.346
&gt;&gt;Meghan Rosa: It's definitely
important to me

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:45.796
that they are sharing it right away,

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:49.396
so that they can teach each
other to be better writers.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.956
&gt;&gt;Anna: I wrote that I agree
that we shouldn't have homework,

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:53.606
because we have other
things to do at home.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:58.126
For example, since I translate, I am
busy and my body gets really stressed.

00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:02.356
&gt;&gt;The seven minute write, which I really
like because that gives me time to just

00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:04.546
like spill out all my
thinking, and like,

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:06.656
I don't have time to stop and rethink.

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:08.896
Your writing's not always
going to be perfect.

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:10.716
You just have to pour
out all your thoughts

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:11.976
at first and then re-fix it later.

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:16.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Don't forget to
write down your observations,

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:18.616
what do you see, what do you notice?

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:22.636
&gt;&gt;In seventh grade science class,
we use interactive notebooks.

00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:25.096
With the interactive notebook,

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:27.766
they are essentially writing
their own middle school textbook.

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:31.996
And low stakes writing is
integral to that notebook.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.406
As we go through the year,
we do an input and an output.

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:36.986
&gt;&gt;How many hydrogen, carbon, oxygen?

00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:40.106
&gt;&gt;And the input is generally
class notes, which are very, very,

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:41.646
very structured at the
beginning of the year.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:45.876
And the output is always reflecting
on it or doing your own version of it

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.556
or doing diagrams to explain it.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:51.476
So on one side, it's in academic
language, and on the other side,

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:52.646
it is in their own language.

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:56.466
&gt;&gt;Isaiah: It helps me like start
to put stuff in my own words,

00:03:56.826 --> 00:03:58.966
not have to get help all the
time and to be independent.

00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:04.186
&gt;&gt;Sherenity: We've been learning about
molecules and atoms and mass and stuff,

00:04:04.186 --> 00:04:07.336
so it's like, you understand
it yourself,

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:09.686
so now you can explain
it in your own words.

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:13.366
&gt;&gt;I said atoms make up everything
that has mass in this world,

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:15.716
atoms does not make up energy.

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:15.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Love it.

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:22.056
&gt;&gt;Student: Atoms make up mass
and like, use it to build.

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:25.176
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: The low stakes writing
is part of the instruction itself,

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:28.706
it's writing to learn, not to
show what you already learned.

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:34.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You get a student generated
definition or a student generated answer

00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:36.786
which everyone in the
class can then learn from.

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:38.236
&gt;&gt;Wait, what did you write there, Dicky?

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.976
&gt;&gt;Chemical bonds are so
skinny and they hold mass.

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:46.276
&gt;&gt;Low stakes writing is a way of
valuing student voice and student ideas

00:04:46.276 --> 00:04:49.066
and it has carryover
into all different areas,

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:53.676
it will foster better discussions,
it will foster more thought,

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.976
it will foster engagement
of everyone in the room.

00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:58.436
&gt;&gt;Anna: Our parents might ask

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.596
why we stay up so late, 
it's because of homework.
