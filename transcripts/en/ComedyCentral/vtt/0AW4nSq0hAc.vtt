00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:04.804
You can't just go along

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.273
with what people are saying,
Susan, okay?

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:09.075
There's no
scientific proof,

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.778
no real evidence
of a ManBearPig.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.981
Well, there's a lot of smart
people saying ManBearPig is
real.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:18.351
Yeah, and a lot of smarter
people saying it isn't, okay?

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.053
What you need to understand,
Susan,

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.722
is that everyone has an agenda.
Okay?

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.324
Everyone wants to use
the fear of a ManBearPig

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:26.592
to get what they want.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:27.994
(Glass shatters)

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.496
So they throw around
bad science, bad taxidermy.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.198
(ManBearPig roars)
People coming out of the
woodwork

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.067
are now experts
on the subject.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.501
(People screaming)
(Roars)

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:38.304
But you have to use
your own brain, sweetheart.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.772
You can't just
let people tell you

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.274
that if you don't believe
in ManBearPig,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.975
then you don't care
about the world.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:44.544
It is real!

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.680
You wanna believe it's real,
you go right on ahead, Susan.

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:50.450
No, it's right there!
It's right there behind you!

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.486
(Man screaming)

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.521
(ManBearPig roars)

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:58.257
Okay,
ManBearPig is real.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.159
What are we gonna do
about it now, huh?

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.360
What are we gonna do

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:03.229
that's gonna make
any difference now, Susan?

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.264
What?!
We have to do something!

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:08.134
What can we do that everyone
else will also do, Susan?

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.802
Come on, use your brain.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.337
Even if we do something about
it... (ManBearPig roars)

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.705
...what about the Chinese?

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.308
They're just gonna keep
right on -- Ahghhggh!
