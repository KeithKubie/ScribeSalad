00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.520
- [Instructor] We have
already thought about

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.950
the demand curves for perfect
competition and monopolies

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.060
and the types of economic
profit that might result in.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.350
And this video, we're
going to focus on something

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.320
in between, which we've talked
about in previous videos,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.580
which is monopolistic competition.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.900
So, as you can see in all three scenarios,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.230
we have a similar cost structure.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.700
We have our marginal cost curve

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.330
and our average total cost curve

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.450
that's at a minimum point

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.590
right where it intersects
the marginal cost curve.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.190
But it's very different
whether we're talking

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.170
about a monopoly or perfect competition

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.330
when it comes to the demand curve.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.410
For perfect competition,
it is one of many firms

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.970
with an undifferentiated product
and no barriers to entry.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.250
So, these firms just
have to be price-takers.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.470
Whatever the price is in the market,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.220
each of those firms just
have to take that price.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.350
And that price is going
to be their demand curve

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.070
and their marginal revenue curve.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.010
And we've talked about
that, in the long run,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.100
under perfect competition,
none of these firms

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.350
are going to be able to
make an economic profit;

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.340
that, if they are, they're
going to have more entrants,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.070
which is going to push this price down.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.650
And if they're making
negative economic profit,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.220
then you're going to have
people who are going to exit,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.610
which is going to push line up.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.710
And so, it's going to, in the long run,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.220
be at a point where none of the firms

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890
are making economic profit.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.160
And so, another way to think about it,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.707
where our marginal
revenue curve intersects

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.560
with our marginal cost curve,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.680
which for any of these situations,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.180
is the rational amount to produce,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.210
the rational quantity to produce

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.730
for a profit-maximizing firm,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.361
that's going to be exactly at a level

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.120
where the price is equal
to average total cost,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
so you have zero economic profit,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.450
zero economic profit.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.040
Now, there's some interesting
things about this.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.200
We talked about how it's
allocatively efficient

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.130
because we're producing at a quantity

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.380
where marginal cost is equal to demand.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.897
It's also productively efficient

00:01:46.897 --> 00:01:49.380
because we're producing
at the minimum point

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.140
of the average total cost curve.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.780
So, it's very efficient from
a productive point of view.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.310
Now, a monopoly is the opposite extreme.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.800
They are the only player in the market

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.890
with insurmountable barriers to entry.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.500
And so, their demand curve,
they're the only player,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.490
so you could view this as
the market demand curve,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.040
but it's their demand curve

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.530
'cause they're the only product there.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.810
So, at high prices, you have
a low quantity demanded;

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.410
and at low prices, you have
a high quantity demanded.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.420
At in multiple videos,
we've talked about that,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.550
in many situations, a monopoly firm

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.240
cannot do price discrimination.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.540
It has to charge the same
price to every consumer.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.430
Well, in that situation,
your marginal revenue

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.240
is going to go down twice as fast

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.810
because, as you go further and further

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.650
down the demand curve,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.630
you're lowering the price for everyone.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.680
And we've studied this,
this is all review;

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.320
but it never hurts to get more review.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.650
The rational quantity to produce,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.880
and once again, this is true for any firm,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.730
is where marginal revenue
intersects marginal cost.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.900
So, we would produce at that quantity.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.380
And the price at that quantity,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.290
we'd go to the demand curve,
it would be right over there.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.040
And you could see that this monopoly firm

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.450
is able to get quite
a nice economic profit

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.210
because the average total cost

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.940
at that quantity is right over there.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.560
And so, on a per-unit basis,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.880
they're able to make that much
times the number of units.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.440
And so, you have a nice economic profit.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.400
Now, the negative, from a
economic or market point of view,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.510
if you were to be allocatively efficient,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.820
you'd be producing at a quantity

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.840
where marginal cost intersects demand.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.060
But that is not happening over here.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.400
And so, you have all of this

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.150
deadweight loss right over there.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.860
Now, to help understand
monopolistic competition,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.890
let's say you start as a monopoly;

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.210
but now, all of a sudden, the
market dynamics have changed,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.615
where what were insurmountable
barriers to entry

00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:34.080
now become low barriers to entry.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.200
What is likely to happen?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.450
Well, you have this nice
economic profit going on here,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.220
so more firms are likely
to enter the market.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.660
And if more firms enter the market,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.920
what is going to happen
to your demand curve?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.810
Well, the demand for your specific product

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.130
is going to go down because
there's other people

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.780
who are offering similar alternatives.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.150
In monopolistic competition,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.930
you aren't completely undifferentiated.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.500
You might have a brand,
you might have certain

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.980
features that are better or worse,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.760
but there are other substitutes
which people could go for,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.780
which are giving you that competition.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.090
So, as more and more people enter,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.620
as you have this economic profit,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.510
your particular demand curve

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.560
is going to shift down and to the left.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.650
And so, your demand
curve will keep shifting

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.120
until you're no longer able
to get any economic profit.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.770
And so, your demand curve
might go something like this.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.230
Once the firms aren't able
to get economic profit,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.660
well then it doesn't really make sense

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.880
for more people to try to enter it.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.610
So, if you started a monopoly,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.070
your demand would shift
to the left, like that,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.990
to the point where you get like that.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.910
And your marginal revenue curve

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.970
would look something like this,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.010
it would have twice the slope down,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.190
so this would be your
marginal revenue curve.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.290
And notice what has now happened.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.700
It is now rational for you to be producing

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.060
at a quantity where the
price that you are getting

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.560
is equal to your average total cost.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.990
So, once again, as more
and more people entered,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.360
because you were getting economic profit,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.660
and the players in this industry

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.410
were getting economic profit,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.900
the demand curve has shifted left,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.900
so now there is zero economic
profit in the long run.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.540
Now, once again, this is a situation

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.350
here you have deadweight loss.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.280
This is not allocatively efficient.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.850
You're not producing at a level

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.500
where marginal cost is equal to demand.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.240
It's also not productively efficient.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.300
To be productively
efficient, you'd be producing

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.670
at a quantity where you're
at the minimum point

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.300
of your average total cost curve.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.360
And so, this difference right over here,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.870
we could view this as the quantity for,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.900
I'll call it efficient scale,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.543
this right over here, this distance,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.163
you could view this as excess
capacity, excess capacity.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.470
Now, one thing that might be
a little bit counterintuitive

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.410
is, in previous videos, we talk about how,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.230
hey, as people enter and exit a market,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.270
it would shift the supply curve.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.170
But here, we're shifting the demand curve.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.060
Well, when people enter
and exit the market,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.310
it shifts the supply curve
for the entire market.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.210
It would not shift the demand
curve for the entire market.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.660
But what we have drawn over here

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.320
is not the demand curve
for the entire market.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.550
What we have drawn here
is the demand curve

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.440
for this particular firm's product.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.210
So, as there's more and more
entrants in the entire market,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.850
the demand for this particular

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.553
firm's products are going down.
