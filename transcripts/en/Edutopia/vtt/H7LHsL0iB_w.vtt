00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:11.126
&gt;&gt;Ronnie: Boys and girls,
what is inside of this bag?

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:15.416
Air. You are going to see
convection at its best.

00:00:16.226 --> 00:00:19.996
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Now that we are a STEAM
school, using project based learning

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:22.406
as our primary instructional strategy,

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:25.026
we see our students succeeding
at the highest levels.

00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:27.456
They're interested in what's
happening in the world.

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.936
They're interested in their own learning
and how they're going to apply that.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:38.636
&gt;&gt;Ronnie: So here at Charles Drew
Charter School, we are a STEAM school,

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:41.416
with the emphasis on
science, technology,

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.116
engineering, the arts and math.

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:47.926
Our kids not only get the regular
curriculum, but they also have classes

00:00:47.926 --> 00:00:54.046
like science lab with me, robotics,
engineering, art, chorus, band.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.156
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This is called a?

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:56.686
&gt;&gt;Children: Flute.

00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:57.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Flute.

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.426
&gt;&gt;Sayj: I'm taking dance
and orchestra right now.

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:02.296
&gt;&gt;Joshua: I like technology too.

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:06.116
&gt;&gt;Adia: I love science, and I like
to learn about how things work.

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:08.666
&gt;&gt;Donya: Well, for us,
project based learning

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.226
and STEAM can't really be separated.

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:14.696
&gt;&gt;Abigail: Instead of teaching
these skills and these disciplines

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.356
in isolation, we collaborate
and work together.

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:20.456
Our students are making connections
between these disciplines.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.266
&gt;&gt;Donya: We know that the
careers that are going

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.726
to be available are in STEAM fields.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.426
We use project based
learning to help our students

00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:29.036
to be successful in those careers.

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:32.246
&gt;&gt;Abigail: Project based learning
is not just creating a project.

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:34.846
It's not teaching theme units.

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:36.596
It's solving a problem.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:41.896
The project is a product that students
create in order to solve a problem.

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:43.886
It's a project that needs
to have an audience.

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:45.326
It needs to have a lasting impact.

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:49.226
&gt;&gt;Donya: So across the entire
building, teams collaborate

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:51.846
to plan project based
learning instruction.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:56.186
&gt;&gt;So ideally, what we're going to do
is look at these essential elements.

00:01:56.496 --> 00:02:00.056
&gt;&gt;We focus on one project based
learning unit that integrates all

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:02.236
of the subject areas each quarter.

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:07.386
The teachers work together to look at
their standards, look at what's relevant

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:09.526
for our students, what's
happening in the world,

00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:11.386
and design a driving question.

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:16.356
&gt;&gt;Janale: I like it a lot, because
there's one question, one big picture.

00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:18.396
I like big pictures, but I also

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:22.826
like that you can ask little
questions within the big question.

00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:26.396
&gt;&gt;Abigail: A big standard in third
grade is teaching about heat.

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:29.276
We wanted to see if students
could figure out a problem

00:02:29.276 --> 00:02:32.606
within their community that
they could solve using heat.

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:35.516
We immediately thought
of Snowpocalypse.

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:38.536
Heat played an important
role, whether it was related

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:41.186
to the weather, or how Atlantans coped.

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:44.736
&gt;&gt;Adia: There was just
coldness and snow and ice,

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.366
and so heat plays a really
good part to keep us warm.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:52.276
&gt;&gt;Abigail: We eventually arrived at the
question of, how can we better prepare

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:53.636
for Atlanta's changing weather?

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:57.796
&gt;&gt;Natasha: We went in this direction
because we knew that it affected a lot

00:02:57.796 --> 00:03:00.116
of their families, it
affected our school.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:02.936
&gt;&gt;Abigail: My students
researched the event.

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:06.906
I brought in some community
members to just share their stories.

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:09.116
&gt;&gt;Woman: We had so many people stranded.

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:13.596
We had students who were on the
bus, ten, eleven o'clock at night,

00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:16.706
and we was trying to contact parents,

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.976
just to let them know
where their child was.

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:22.116
&gt;&gt;Abigail: They couldn't believe
some of the stuff they heard and that

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:27.536
to me was this very organic way
that they arrived at this problem

00:03:27.536 --> 00:03:31.306
and this feeling of, "I want
to do something about it."

00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:34.686
&gt;&gt;We are going to be
thinking of some ways

00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:39.236
to help Atlantans better
prepare for weather like this.

00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:42.206
&gt;&gt;Donya: The teachers may have
designed a project that's going

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:46.646
to guide the students in a direction,
but the students have a big role helping

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:49.726
to design products that
will solve those problems.

00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:52.576
&gt;&gt;Melissa: My class came up
with some type of safety case

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:54.786
that would help them
if they were stranded.

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:57.626
So they will do certain little
mini projects along the way,

00:03:57.926 --> 00:03:59.386
like a solar oven.

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:03.926
They'll talk about insulation,
they'll test different materials

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.996
to see what are good conductors of heat

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:10.166
and to see how do these everyday
materials fit into your kit.

00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:13.816
&gt;&gt;Girl: Wooden spoon,
plastic spoon, metal spoon.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:18.626
&gt;&gt;Melissa: Does it feel
cold, does it feel hot?

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:21.356
&gt;&gt;Boy: Feel this, feel this.

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:23.616
&gt;&gt;Melissa: Record your observations.

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:26.186
What about the metal spoon, Destiny?

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:28.056
&gt;&gt;Destiny: The metal spoon got hotter.

00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:29.606
&gt;&gt;Melissa: So that was the hottest?

00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:29.985
&gt;&gt;Destiny: Yes.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.686
&gt;&gt;Natasha: One of the questions that
they said that they needed to know was,

00:04:34.686 --> 00:04:36.026
well how was heat produced?

00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:38.946
Mister Thomas came up with the idea
to bring the entire third grade out.

00:04:39.116 --> 00:04:42.846
&gt;&gt;Ronnie: Heat energy can be
transferred in how many ways?

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:43.236
&gt;&gt;Children: Three.

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:49.226
&gt;&gt;Ronnie: Three, conduction,
radiation and convection.

00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:55.146
The heat from the sun will transfer
energy to the air inside this bag,

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:58.466
once the molecules in the air
inside the bag get warmed up,

00:04:58.466 --> 00:04:59.976
the solar bag is going
to rise into the air.

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:05.776
&gt;&gt;Children: [excited screaming]

00:05:06.276 --> 00:05:10.216
&gt;&gt;Abigail: Our commitment to STEAM has
shaped how we do project based learning

00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:10.996
here at Drew.

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:16.256
Technology, science, engineering, that
all factors into what we're looking

00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:19.646
for the students to be able to do when
they're answering this driving question.

00:05:19.726 --> 00:05:22.306
&gt;&gt;Donya: We see our students
collaborating naturally

00:05:22.496 --> 00:05:25.876
to solve problems, not just the
ones presented to them by teachers,

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:32.636
but the ones that they
just face every day.
