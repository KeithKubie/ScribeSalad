00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:13.799
Overall, I think the media has to be much
tougher on those in power.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.470
His network, as well as the others, it is
really a bully pulpit, and I mean they bully

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.890
people, not those in power.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.860
Then the tough questions are, “Are you gonna
run for president?” or “When are you gonna

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.230
announce?” or “Who’s gonna be your vice
presidential running mate?”

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.560
All the speculative stuff.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.829
But when it comes down to what they represent
and who they’re affecting, and not them

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.809
being asked these questions but people themselves,
breaking the sound barrier of the media, bringing

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.730
in the people who are the targets of these
policies.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.120
That’s the really most egregious…

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.070
I would say, it’s who the media leaves out,
which is the majority of people.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.890
They send the talk shows that are sponsored
by the weapon manufactures, by the food processors,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.900
you know.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.689
We’re in a global fuel crisis, oil companies
making more money than they’ve ever made

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:21.689
in their history.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.880
They’re bringing us the Sunday talk shows
that set the agenda in this country.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.409
The weapons manufacturers, the Boeings, the
Exxon Mobils, they’re the ones that are

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.570
defining the debate.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.310
I’m not saying that they won’t ask questions
of them, but it’s a matter of you ask the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.310
occasional tough question or you…

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.950
The continual drum beat, that’s what doesn’t
happen when you have a media brought to us

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.350
by the very corporations that profit off of
people’s pain.
