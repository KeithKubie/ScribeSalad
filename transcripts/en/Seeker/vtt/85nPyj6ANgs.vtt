00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.960
What goes up must come down right?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:08.230
But what if what goes up into our atmosphere
doesn’t come down in the same place?

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.480
Hey guys thanks for watching DNews, I’m
Julia

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.980
A recent viral documentary called Under the
Dome shined a spotlight on China’s pollution

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.980
problem.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.520
According to the film, last year, in beijing,
175 days were considered “polluted” where

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.420
people couldn’t even go outside the smog
was so bad.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.650
According to EU air quality standards, less
than 1% of China’s population breathes clean

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.650
air daily.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.609
It’s so bad it’s even been compared to
what a nuclear winter might look like.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.280
Smog is made of aerosols, small particles
of matter emitted mostly from the burning

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.440
of fossil fuels.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.359
In China most of the smog comes from car exhaust
and coal fired power plants which blasts large

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.609
amounts of sulfur dioxide.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.030
This reacts with water vapor and other gases
in the atmosphere to create sulfate aerosols.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.690
Once in the atmosphere these particles can
have a huge impact on the climate.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.739
In strong concentrations they can refract
or scatter sunlight and even change the way

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:00.739
clouds form.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.170
But China’s so far away, what has that got
to do with us in America?

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.020
Well we’ve had a nasty winter the past few
years.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.430
There were Snowpocalypses and Snowmaggedons.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.310
Boston was buried in snow for the beginning
of this year.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.680
One study published in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences suggested

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.770
that China’s pollution is to blame.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.280
A team from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and the California Institute of Technology

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.500
found that once these Aerosols enter the atmosphere
but they don’t just hover above China.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.650
They’re picked up by wind currents and move
fast.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.150
Particles moving with the atmosphere at 16.4
feet per second will travel thousands of miles

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.150
in a week.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.729
China’s pollution can travel across the
Pacific Ocean, along the way it makes clouds

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.969
bigger and wetter.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.840
The particles give the water molecules something
to cling to.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.100
This may make more storms and make them bigger
and wetter and in turn changes the polar jet

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.200
stream and then everything gets all messed
up and we get worse winters.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.350
Although not surprisingly, the researchers
say they haven’t reached a final conclusion

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.119
and SAY IT WITH ME PEOPLE “More research
is needed”!

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.880
But smog isn’t the only thing going into
the air.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.869
Two recent studies showed how dust from the
Sahara Desert might feed the Amazon.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.800
In the same way smog is picked up in the atmosphere,
so is dust from the desert.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.280
One study published in Remote Sensing of the
Environment found that wind and weather pick

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.550
up 182 million tons of dust a year.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.130
The dust then travels 1,600 miles across and
27.7 million tons of it falls on the Amazon.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.000
But that dust is carrying something important,
phosphorus.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.440
A recent paper published in the journal Geophysical
Research Letters found that an estimated 22,000

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.800
tons of it from the Sahara falls on the Amazon
every year.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.530
Phosphorus is a vital nutrient plants need
to grow.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.230
How crazy is that?

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.610
Something from the one of the most barren
places on Earth, makes another place the most

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.610
fertile.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.200
Like the author of the Sahara study said,
"This is a small world and we're all connected

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200
together."

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.220
Switching gears for a second, did you know
we’re all connected by poop?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.450
Yeah not really but poop transplants are a
thing that could potentially save lives.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.210
Our brand spanking new sister channel, Seeker
has a whole amazing video about it, where

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:20.840
DNew’s own Trace went to go see how it’s
done.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.330
Check it out.
