00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.770
I had a job once at the UN, and I was just
in charge of design, which meant display and

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.770
whatever.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.400
And we got things from, a lot of times, through
the embassies.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.550
I was fascinated by all the…particularly
the textiles and the clothing.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.980
And I started creating a kind of synthesis
in my mind about structurally, you know, and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.789
throughout history and around the world, that
a piece of clothing could be defined as a

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.489
piece of cloth and how you wrap it around
yourself.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.309
Like, a late version would be the toga, the
Roman toga, but an early version would be

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.480
like an Indian sari.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.450
And then, simple structural interventions,
like in this case, to make a pair of pants

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:13.020
you need something that basically has movement
this way and this way, right?

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.150
So “The Four Continents” is a loosely
based idea of, you know, your idea of a pair

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.800
of pants would be different depending on where
you came from.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.770
In some ways, it's abstraction, it's minimalism.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.090
I was using a lot of details of the same vocabulary.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.750
The jackets, particularly, because when they're
on a figure they're not at all geometric.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.790
They're abstract, but in a different way.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.210
These triangles which are the gussets, they
make for movement.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.480
So when the figure is in this, it all sort
of, it's a vortex that goes to the point of

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.280
the triangle there at the neck, because the
shoulders, nobody has perfectly right angle

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280
shoulders.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.290
Well, I was in this kind of netherworld.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.920
It’s…this doesn't exist anymore because
now, clothing in the art world, it's a whole

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.500
genre, really.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.670
Whether it's dealt with as fashion, or whether
it's dealt with as clothing for some other

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.880
use.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.720
But that was not true then, which is part
of why I was really so lucky to be in this.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.790
I felt like Alice falling down the rabbit
hole.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.510
You know, like, "Oh, there's not nothing down
here.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.020
There's like a world down here."

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:45.020
I really wasn't versed in the vocabulary of
minimalism and whatever the more conceptual

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.300
version of it was.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.220
But I was living in the time, so I was a part
of the times anyway.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.860
And it was in some way, I was thinking the
same way, and that was part of what artists

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.959
helped me to see, was that...I think it was
Richard [Nonas] who'd say, "You're thinking

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.750
like an artist."

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.570
They're really like structural studies in
some way.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.700
That's what I think the sculptors made me
understand.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:30.700
I was doing this thing, and it had this incredible
resemblance to the same way of thinking.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.980
So, yeah, definitely timing.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.900
Even if I were doing this, and I was living
in a different place, it would have been...

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.470
It could have stayed in a chest for years.
