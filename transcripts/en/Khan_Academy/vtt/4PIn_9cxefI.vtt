00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.029
Problem 10.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:09.390
John uses 2/3 of a cup of oats
per serving to make oatmeal.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.180
How many cups of oats does he
need to make 6 servings?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.050
So he uses 2/3 per
serving, and he's

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.820
going to have 6 servings.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.170
So it's going to be 6 times--
for every serving there's 2/3,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140
so it's going to be
6 times that.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.100
So it's going to be 2/3 per
serving, and we can even put

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.650
units there.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.240
We could say 1 over servings.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.360
Well, that just confuses it.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.280
2/3 per serving times
6 servings.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.920
So that's just 6 times 2/3.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.400
And that is equal to-- maybe
it's easier to visualize in

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.190
your head as multiplying
two fractions.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.410
We can write that as 2/3 times
6/1, and that's equal to-- we

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.230
could simplify it
ahead of time.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.160
Or we can just write that as 2
times 6 in the numerator--

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.220
which is 12-- and the
denominator is 3 times 1--

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.730
which is 3.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.430
Multiplying fractions is far
easier than adding or

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.030
subtracting.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.440
Because literally the new
numerator of the product is

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.990
just the product of the
numerators, and then the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.310
denominator of the product is
just the product of the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.980
denominators.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.760
2 times 6 is 12.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.600
3 times 1 is 3.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.400
And 12/3-- that's the same thing
as 12 divided by 3--

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.600
that just equals 4.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.120
Which is choice B right there.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.680
Another way you could have
done it is you could have

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.860
simplified it right here.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.030
You could have divided the
6 and the 3 both by 3.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.430
So if you had 2/3 times 6/1,
you could divide the 6 by 3

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.270
and the 3 by 3.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.170
So you get 1, and then you just
get 2 times-- sorry, 6

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.160
divided by 3 is 2.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.870
So you have 2 times 2 is equal
to 4, over 1 times 1.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.360
And the whole reason why you
could do that is this thing

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.270
right here, instead of solving
it up here, I could have

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.580
rewritten it as 2 times
6 over 3 times 1.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.180
And then you could simplify it
before getting to this stage.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.620
You could just divide the
6 by the 3, and you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.450
get a 1 and a 2.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.070
6 divided by 3 is
2, you get 4.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.660
I'm probably beating a dead
horse, but just in case you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.990
need a review multiplying
fractions, you just got it.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.560
Which expression represents
0.0000007

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.320
in scientific notation?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.030
So the easy way to convert
scientific notation,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.080
especially when you have a
number behind the decimal

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.730
point like this, is you
literally just count the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.560
digits behind the
decimal point.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.770
And we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 numbers

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.020
behind the decimal point.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.390
So our answer is
going to be 7.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.700
This 7, right here, 7 times 10
to the-- it's going to be a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.190
negative exponent because
we're going less than 1.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.450
We're going behind the
decimal point.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.510
10 to the minus-- and
I just counted.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.850
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.670
10 to the minus 7.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.140
Right there.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.930
And if you find this problem a
little bit daunting, I have

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.890
actually two videos where
I go into depth

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.380
about scientific notation.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.520
So you might want to watch
those, just in case you run

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.750
into the opposite situation.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.450
If you had 7,000, and you
want to write that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.640
in scientific notation.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.490
So in this case we're going
above, we're going into the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.130
positive domain.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.940
Then, instead of just counting--
when we had a

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.980
decimal, you counted
the actual digits.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.370
You included the 7, right?

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.220
That's where you got
10 to the minus 7.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.430
When you have something like
this, you just count the 0's.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.230
So 7,000 would be 7 times
10 to the third.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.600
If you want more of the
rationale of why that works, I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.210
definitely recommend that you
watch the two videos that I

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.920
have on scientific notation.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.820
Next problem.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.930
The Venn diagram below shows
the number of girls on the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.160
soccer and track team
at a high school.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.790
So this is the soccer team,
this is the track team.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.820
And right here, this is the
girls who are on both the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.670
soccer and the track team.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.520
How many girls are on both the
soccer and the track teams?

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.250
So I kind of jumped the gun.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.880
They're telling us the
answer right there.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.630
There are 6 girls.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.550
This overlap region-- right?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.180
If some girl is, let's say that
some girl right there,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.030
she's in the soccer circle,
and she's also

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.050
in the track circle.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.050
And this number tells us that
there's 6 of these girls.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.800
So there are 6 girls that are
on both the soccer and the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.450
track teams.
