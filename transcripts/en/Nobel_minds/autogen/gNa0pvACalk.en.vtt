00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
hi my name is Hanley I'm currently

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360
hi my name is Hanley I'm currently
 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.230
hi my name is Hanley I'm currently
studying at certain grammar school my

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
studying at certain grammar school my
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.860
studying at certain grammar school my
question is does the Big Bang really

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870
question is does the Big Bang really
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.320
question is does the Big Bang really
create equal amounts of matter and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
create equal amounts of matter and
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.950
create equal amounts of matter and
antimatter if the theory is correct

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
antimatter if the theory is correct
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.830
antimatter if the theory is correct
how did matter win the first war ever

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
how did matter win the first war ever
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.759
how did matter win the first war ever
fought in the universe well honey you're

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
fought in the universe well honey you're
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.410
fought in the universe well honey you're
asking one of the hardest questions we

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
asking one of the hardest questions we
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.359
asking one of the hardest questions we
have today in physics why is there more

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
have today in physics why is there more
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.950
have today in physics why is there more
matter than antimatter in the universe

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
matter than antimatter in the universe
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.529
matter than antimatter in the universe
and so far we don't really have a good

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
and so far we don't really have a good
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.569
and so far we don't really have a good
theory for that we just know that our

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
theory for that we just know that our
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.190
theory for that we just know that our
kind of matter won that war that you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
kind of matter won that war that you
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.520
kind of matter won that war that you
described early after the Big Bang so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
described early after the Big Bang so
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830
described early after the Big Bang so
we're still looking for the reasons why

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
we're still looking for the reasons why
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.670
we're still looking for the reasons why
one might win over the other as far as

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680
one might win over the other as far as
 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.500
one might win over the other as far as
microscopic theory tells us matter and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
microscopic theory tells us matter and
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270
microscopic theory tells us matter and
antimatter are very nearly exact

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
antimatter are very nearly exact
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459
antimatter are very nearly exact
opposites we've not been able to measure

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
opposites we've not been able to measure
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.040
opposites we've not been able to measure
any significant difference so now we

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
any significant difference so now we
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.260
any significant difference so now we
have the same question that you have why

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
have the same question that you have why
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.420
have the same question that you have why
is there more of one than the other and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
is there more of one than the other and
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.720
is there more of one than the other and
I think we await results from the great

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
I think we await results from the great
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369
I think we await results from the great
Collider experiments like the Large

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
Collider experiments like the Large
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.799
Collider experiments like the Large
Hadron Collider which may possibly show

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
Hadron Collider which may possibly show
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750
Hadron Collider which may possibly show
us that does not something that does not

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
us that does not something that does not
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460
us that does not something that does not
fit the standard model that we've been

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
fit the standard model that we've been
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.050
fit the standard model that we've been
using for particles for all these years

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
using for particles for all these years
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.719
using for particles for all these years
so if that happens then we maybe be able

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
so if that happens then we maybe be able
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.980
so if that happens then we maybe be able
to give you a better answer to this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
to give you a better answer to this
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.409
to give you a better answer to this
question
