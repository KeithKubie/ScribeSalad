00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.479
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.140
- So welcome back, everyone.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.570
So for this next
portion of our program,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.550
we're bringing together a
panel, an all-star panel focused

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.270
on global perspectives
on citizenship.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.160
I think, particularly,
given the comments

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.050
we've just heard
from Judy and Tom,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.110
that we recognize that
concepts around citizenship

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.650
and community participation
really vary significantly,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.730
dependent on your context.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.940
And that can, of course,
bring in multiple factors--

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.540
things like locale, what
world region you're from,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.750
your gender, your age, your
socioeconomic status, and so

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.280
on.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.540
So we take this broad
array of perspectives,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.990
and then we add one more
that's critically important.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.210
And that's the focus of
our discussion today--

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.670
and one that cross-cuts
all of those.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.530
And that is the
experience of being

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.600
a person with a disability.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.690
And from the initial cadre of
disability and civil rights

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.140
advocates up through
today's ADA Generation,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.480
it's clear that concepts
around citizenship today,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.730
and what that means,
and how you strive

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.470
for reaching those rights,
and advocate for your needs,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.800
it looks different now than
it did 30 or 40 years ago.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.740
And then you layer
in contextual factors

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.410
related to global citizenship,
and that brings another layer.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.980
So this panel is
really to focus on all

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.140
of those
multidimensional aspects

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.890
of what it means to be a
citizen and to fully participate

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.710
in your community as a person
with a disability here,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.180
now, in 2018, and
how we got here.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.780
So I'm going to keep my
intros brief because you want

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.400
to hear from these panelists.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.059
And the bios are
in your program,

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:37.100
as was mentioned earlier.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.736
So please take a moment
to look at those.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.360
But briefly, we're
going to be starting

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.430
on this side of the
table and moving down.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.440
We'll first hear
from Maria Town.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.330
Welcome, Maria.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.310
Maria is the director of the
Mayor's Office for People

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.807
With Disabilities for
the City of Houston,

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:54.140
where she advocates for the
rights and needs of citizens

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.870
with disabilities related
to everything from hurricane

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.390
relief, to immigration,
to incarceration--

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.557
a number of topics,
particularly at the local level.

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:06.140
But I think everyone who knows
Maria knows that she's a rising

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.130
star in the field and already
has a great depth of leadership

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.360
on these topics.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.820
And she was a former
senior associate director

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.250
in the Obama White House
Office of Public Engagement,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.460
so also with some federal
experience, as well.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.040
Next to Maria is
Ari Ne'eman, who's

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.980
a well-known leader in
the self-advocacy movement

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.010
and currently serves as CEO
of MySupport.com, something

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.340
that's definitely worth checking
out when you have a moment.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.100
Ari is involved in
numerous consulting roles

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.740
across many sectors related
to disability policy

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.652
and is really seen as an
expert in this regard,

00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:42.110
particularly working with groups
such as the American Civil

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.170
Liberties Union.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.420
His voice is really out there.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.760
I actually just read
your blog post, Ari,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.096
from the Health Affairs
Blog a couple of days ago.

00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:52.220
So really cross-cutting
issues of disability policy

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.810
across multiple sectors and with
a real wealth of experience.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.760
Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo,
far to my left,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.200
is a long-term friend and
a global disability advisor

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.120
to the World Bank
Group, where she

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.760
focuses on disability,
inclusive development,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.220
and also was previously
appointed by President Obama

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.480
to lead USAID's work on
disability, including how you

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.820
think about developing
policies in various regions

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.980
around the world and
country strategies

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.800
at the local level for
program implementation.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.070
Charlotte just arrived
here to Boston from Rome,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.120
as is usually the case.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.411
I feel like Charlotte's always
coming in from somewhere

00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:30.370
fabulous around the world.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.440
And so we really appreciate
her being here despite lag

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.422
and taking the
effort to join us.

00:03:35.422 --> 00:03:37.380
So really thrilled to
get this session started.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.920
What we're going to do is hear
from each of our panelists

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.932
individually for
about 15 minutes,

00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:44.390
just to hear their
overall thoughts

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.260
and how they think about
citizenship from their lens.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.960
After that, we'll have
a moderated discussion

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.130
amongst ourselves, and then
we'll open it up for Q&amp;A.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.119
So without further ado, I'll
pass along to you, Maria.

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.910
- Thank you, Cheri.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.790
So I thought to kick
my comments off,

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.140
I would reference
a Harvard alumn.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.410
In his farewell address,
President Barack Obama

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.899
said, "It falls to
each of us to be

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.709
those anxious, jealous
guardians of our democracy.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.010
Embrace the joyous task we have
been given to continually try

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.440
to improve this
great nation of ours

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.630
because for all of our
outward differences,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.870
we, in fact, share
the same proud type--

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.100
the most important office
in a democracy, citizen.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.120
Citizen.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.220
So you see, that's what
our democracy demands.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.490
It needs you, not just
when there's an election,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.820
not just when you can serve
your own narrow interests,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.190
but over the full
span of a lifetime.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.670
If you're tired of arguing
with strangers on the internet,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.860
try talking to one of
them in real life."

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.260
And when he left
office, he said,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.542
"And now I'm going to take
on my most important title,

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:01.000
more important than
president, more

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.190
important than prime
minister-- citizen."

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.280
And I think that that's
an interesting quote

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.680
to sort of start this
conversation because when

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.140
we talk about citizenship,
I think that there's

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.660
an assumption embedded
in that, which

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.160
is the assumption of
active citizenship.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.800
When we talk about
people being citizens,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.510
we're assuming that there's some
sort of activity and production

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.330
connected to what
they are doing,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.640
because they are an
active participant

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.410
in our government's or many
governments' social contracts.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.700
And that assumption of
activity and production

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.330
has been used to
discriminate against people

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.510
with disabilities from
the very beginning

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.880
because, as Judy mentioned,
we have been marked

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.120
as people who just
have needs, as people

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.784
who are solely consumers.

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:01.450
And when you contextualize it in
the American code of Protestant

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.870
work ethic moment, the idea that
people with disabilities cannot

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.730
contribute and cannot be
productive really endangers

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.326
our own ability to engage
in active citizenship.

00:06:16.326 --> 00:06:17.200
And it's interesting.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.190
If you look at photos
from many of the protests

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.250
in the initial disability
civil rights movement,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.750
you see signs that say, we
want to be taxpayers, too.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.779
And we laugh at that.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.570
And we can think that
maybe the only people

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.490
in the world who
want to be taxpayers

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.190
are people with disabilities.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.630
So I'm giving you a kind of
broad, historical perspective

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.670
because, really, when
we talk about disability

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.870
and citizenship
together, in many ways,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.700
disability status and identity
has been seen as antithetical

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.590
to citizenship.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.370
And so now I want to talk
about some more specific issues

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.960
that I'm dealing
with at a local level

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.210
that I think highlight this.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.890
One, and they're all current--

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.020
I find it interesting
that every Harvard student

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.160
that I've met who has been
disabled has been an immigrant.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.622
Now, mind you,
I've only met four.

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:13.830
That's a very limited sample.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.150
But all of them, every single
one of them, have been--

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.620
had a disability.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.490
And most of them share
the same story, which

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.460
is that, I had a disability.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.750
And my family decided
to move to America

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.900
because they knew that I would
have more rights here, and be

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.450
able to access education,
and have a chance of getting

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.680
a job because of things
like the Rehabilitation Act

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.230
and the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.310
And so when I think
about immigration,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.170
disability is a
huge part of that.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.930
There are people who come
to the United States, people

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.540
with disabilities,
because they have a better

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.430
chance of succeeding here than
they do in their home country.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.370
And in Houston, one
in four Houstonians

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.280
was not born in
the United States.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.100
I would say that, in many ways,
we are a city of immigrants.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.020
We have the largest
refugee population

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.680
in the United States.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.120
And so currently, the
Trump administration

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.960
is considering a rule called
the Public Charge Rule,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:28.590
which would prevent immigrants
who receive public supports,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.010
like the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program or housing

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.860
vouchers, from attaining
visas, green cards,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.830
and full citizenship.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.200
So what is that
actually an attack on?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.730
That's an attack
on poor immigrants,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.900
and that's an attack
on disabled immigrants.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.830
And in the City of
Houston, we stand, one,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.290
firmly against
this proposed rule

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.610
and recognize not only how it
will impact those individuals

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.680
who have been so brave to leave
their home and to come here,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.530
but our whole-- our
citizenry as a whole.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.250
And so I want to give you some
numbers and some examples.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.274
What we found for other bills--

00:09:12.274 --> 00:09:13.690
whether they're
at the state level

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.190
or at the federal
level-- for bills

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.880
that target
immigrants, what we see

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.330
is individuals not seeking
city services that they

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.140
are entitled to,
like vaccinations,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.570
like TB vaccinations.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.240
That puts all of us
at a health risk.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.560
By the way, vaccinate
your children, please.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.030
And we also-- there was a
bill at the Texas state level

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.660
called SB 4, which
targeted immigrants.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.630
And what we found is
that there were 70% fewer

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.810
reports of domestic
violence in the Latinx

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.580
community in Houston.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.650
Does that mean that
domestic violence

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.440
was happening at a lesser rate?

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.850
Absolutely not.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.830
It means that people
were scared to report.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.260
It means that people
were getting hurt.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.350
And so now, if you
think that people maybe

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.490
won't try to access
things like SNAP or WIC,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.850
it means that children won't get
access to the food they need.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.830
That's putting our
whole citizenry at risk.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.210
And so hearkening to
what Judy was saying,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.790
until we can get to the
point where we realize

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:27.590
that social justice movements
connected to citizenship

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.500
need to embrace disability--

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.950
not just for individuals, but
also so our whole democracy can

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.480
continue to sustain itself--

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.890
we're going to continue
having discussions like this.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.620
There's also an
economic piece to this.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:54.045
We note that immigrants in
Houston generate $14.75 million

00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:56.540
in economic activity.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.420
Preventing them from
accessing public programs that

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.530
support economic stability will
destabilize our whole economy.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.830
Again, it will infringe
upon everyone's ability

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.280
to be an active citizen.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.480
Another very recent and
wonderful piece of news

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.445
is that felons in
Florida now can vote.

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:21.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.380
Exactly.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.640
So I think it was Referendum
Number 4 on their ballot--

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.100
restore voting rights
to people who--

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.002
felons who had
served their time.

00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:35.710
Florida is not the
only state to do this.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.200
We do this in Texas.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.350
What that means is that one
million people can now vote.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:46.182
That is 9.2% of Florida's
voting-age population.

00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:47.640
Mhm.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.414
And when we look at criminal
justice, at least 80%

00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:55.080
of people in the
criminal justice system

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.914
are people with disabilities.

00:11:56.914 --> 00:12:00.790
So the ballot
initiative in Florida--

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.030
it's a race issue.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.940
It's a gender issue.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.170
It's a disability issue.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.860
It's an enfranchisement issue.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.530
And it's a citizenship issue.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.990
And all of those are connected.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.490
So thinking about
things that we can

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:18.980
do around enhancing
people's ability

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.800
to be active citizens in
the context of disability,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.080
we need more ballot
initiatives like Referendum 4.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.560
I don't know-- how much
time do I have left?

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.060
OK, great.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.960
Something that I've given
a lot of thought to,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.840
and that I think everyone on
this panel could speak to,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.540
is people with disabilities'
rights to privacy.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.250
And privacy, I think,
today is on everyone's mind

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:54.481
in new ways because of hacks
at Facebook and Google--

00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:56.480
working for the federal
government at the Office

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.820
of Personnel Management.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.800
So I think everyone has a
greater sense of how tentative

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.530
their privacy really is.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.410
People with
disabilities, I think,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.160
often just abandon
their sense of privacy

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.450
because, so often, the programs
that we are forced to rely on

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.790
in order to survive
require us to describe,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.370
in great detail,
aspects of our lives

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.544
that are often our
most private moments.

00:13:28.544 --> 00:13:30.460
And so when we think
about things like a right

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.680
to privacy, for people
with disabilities,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.220
that's not the most
resonant concept.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:43.070
However, you would
think that for folks

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:48.032
who maybe don't get to access as
much privacy as everybody else,

00:13:48.032 --> 00:13:50.240
we wouldn't need to tell
our stories because everyone

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.830
else would already know them.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.380
The opposite is true.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.520
Well, doctors need to know
measurements of our bodies

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.780
and the regularity of
our bowel movements.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:09.150
When state agencies need to
know exactly how much money we

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.240
are making at every
point in the day,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.050
when our communities establish
working groups to check up

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.824
on us because they want to
make sure we're kept safe--

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.490
you know, and it makes
it harder to have

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.614
an intimate night at home--

00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:25.800
you would think that people
would get our stories.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.050
But instead, when we
try to tell our stories,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:35.509
to actually articulate ourselves
and maybe expose our truths,

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:36.800
people don't want to hear that.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.110
And so what does being
a private citizen

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.140
look like as a person
with a disability?

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.434
Working in natural
disasters and emergencies,

00:14:51.434 --> 00:14:52.850
as I've done in
Houston, there are

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.090
a lot of people who talk
about registries for people

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.880
with disabilities, in
order to make sure we

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.980
can get rescued and be safe.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.830
And I think registries
are very ineffective.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.100
I think that they are often
a waste of taxpayer dollars.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.440
And I don't think that
people with disabilities

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.569
are inclined to use
them, because if you're

00:15:13.569 --> 00:15:15.610
a person with a disability,
more likely than not,

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.800
you already exist
in many registries

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.040
all over the country.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.300
If someone were able to use
data modeling and pulling

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.500
information from
Medicaid or from SNAP,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.930
you could absolutely
pinpoint where

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.570
most people with disabilities
exist in the United States

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.955
right now.

00:15:36.955 --> 00:15:39.080
So again, what does it mean
to be a private citizen

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.350
for a person with a disability?

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.700
Finally-- this is a
little bit different--

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.770
when we think, again,
about the historic,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.930
people with disabilities
are only consumers.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.710
They're not producers,
therefore citizenship is tough.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.180
Within the disability
community, I

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.827
think we actually have a group
of super citizens, a group

00:15:56.827 --> 00:15:59.160
of people who have been very
impactful to the disability

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.020
rights movement.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.290
And those are veterans.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.330
These are individuals
who have chosen--

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.670
although we can unpack that--

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.630
to potentially sacrifice
themselves for their country.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.870
And when they become wounded,
whether in the line of service

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.230
or not, they become a
person with a disability.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.940
And it is the government's
responsibility

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.290
to care for them
because they have

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.590
been such an active citizen.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.340
And so the connection of
veterans with disabilities

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.190
to all these services, to the
disability rights movement,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.305
is very different.

00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:38.430
And I think that their
understanding of citizenship

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.390
and their role in it
is also very different.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:48.360
And so for me, it's interesting
to consider these opposite ends

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.752
of the spectrum.

00:16:49.752 --> 00:16:51.210
Let's say people
with disabilities,

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.790
like myself, who were
born with disabilities--

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.280
who many would assume would be
on benefits for my whole life,

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.216
and that is not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:17:00.216 --> 00:17:06.720
And on the opposite end, a very
young, virile man who became

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.420
injured in the line
of duty, and therefore

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.650
is valorized for his
active citizenship.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.599
So just think on that.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.730
And I think if we
could figure out

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:24.420
how to get a better conversation
going between those two groups,

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.937
among many others, we can
make progress on this issue.

00:17:27.937 --> 00:17:28.770
Thank you very much.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.990
- All right, yes.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.950
Thank you, Maria.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.480
I think a number of
really thoughtful topics.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.640
Everyone, let those roll
around a little bit,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.050
and maybe we can bring
them into the Q&amp;A.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.591
And certainly, we'll bring some
of those into our discussion,

00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:50.917
as well.

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:52.250
Ari, we'd love to hear from you.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.020
Thank you.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.070
- Thank you all very
much for having me here.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:03.010
One of the things that struck
me about this morning's keynote

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.640
was a comment Judy
made about how people

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.630
say those who discriminate
against people

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.370
with disabilities
don't really mean it.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.700
And there's something very
powerful in naming that,

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:25.660
not least because the biggest
challenge the disability rights

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:33.280
movement has is helping the
public understand that we are,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.630
in fact, a political issue.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.970
Disability is political.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.640
And in some ways,
one of the things

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.120
that's often been leveraged
as the disability community's

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.320
greatest asset--

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.440
the perception that
nobody wants to stand

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.290
against the interests
of disabled people

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.560
in a public way--

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.520
is also, really, our
greatest weakness.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.480
Because if you don't
acknowledge disability policy

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.440
as a political issue,
as an area that

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.240
is rife with
potential conflict--

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.410
and those of us who work in
the world of disability policy

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.530
know that conflict
can be very intense.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.510
But if you don't
acknowledge that,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.130
then we end up with
this impression

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.980
that, really,
there are no sides.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.490
Everyone is acting with
the best of intentions.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.190
And people who
work on disability

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.010
are engaged in some
humanitarian rather than

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.710
a political project.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.660
Judy talked about
the risks of that

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.450
in the context of
overt discrimination.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.610
And I want to talk a
little bit about that

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.920
in the context of some
of the conflicts that

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.970
emerge around disability
service provision.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.480
Over the course of the last 50--

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.230
at this point, 60 years--

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.700
I've been talking about
this for about a decade.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.760
So over the course of
the last 60 years or so,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.800
we've seen a tremendous
amount of change

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.620
in the disability
service provision system.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.450
From 1960 to the present,
over 200 state institutions

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.660
for people with developmental
disabilities were closed,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.730
and their residents
supported to live

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.150
with greater dignity,
autonomy, and independence

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.710
in the community.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:23.370
If you look at 1977,
data we have from 1977--

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.390
in 1977, the average person
with a developmental disability

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.970
living outside a
family home was living

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.870
in a facility with
23 of their nearest

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.600
and dearest perfect strangers
they happened to share

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.390
a disability diagnosis with.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.190
Today, the average residential
setting size is two.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.450
There has been a
tremendous shift in the way

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.720
that disability
services are delivered,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.720
are approached, and funded.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.000
And by and large,
that shift has been

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.350
towards greater integration,
greater autonomy, and greater

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.010
choice for people
with disabilities.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.800
Now, as we start to move
into new kinds of shifts

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.540
in the disability
service system--

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.110
and some of you here are aware
of some of the controversies

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.670
that disability
services face today,

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.830
such as the transition away
from sheltered workshops towards

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.410
community-integrated
employment--

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.430
what some folks
call second-order

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.110
deinstitutionalization--
the shift away from smaller

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:36.890
congregate settings like larger
group homes to individualized,

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.040
in-home services like
supported community living

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.740
or shared-living Hosla models.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.560
All of that is running
into controversy.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.030
And it's very important
for us to understand

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:54.050
that all of the prior
transitions that took place

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.930
were also intensely
controversial.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.300
Some of you know I'm in
the process of writing

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.320
a book on the history of the
American disability experience,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.050
from the Civil War
to the present day.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.340
And one of the things that
really jumps out at you

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.630
is, in every generation,
going back to Union veterans,

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.540
disabled Union veterans
after the Civil War,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.080
we've had these same conflicts
over what is the best

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.860
way to support, care for--

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.110
however we conceptualize it--

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.320
assist people with disabilities.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.410
More recently, in the 1980s--

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.550
1970s, '80s, and '90s,
disability rights advocates

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.250
fought, in pretty much
every state capital

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.230
across the country,
on the question

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.730
of deinstitutionalization.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.600
And the tricky thing
about disability politics

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.670
is that it doesn't
always match up

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.730
to the simple red-blue
divides that we're

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.530
used to in our country.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.720
Some of you may know that one
of the most intense opponents

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.980
of deinstitutionalization and
community living for people

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.890
with disabilities in
the 1970s and '80s

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.580
were public sector
employee unions who

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.670
represented workers
and institutions that

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.650
didn't want to lose their job.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.220
In 1975, the American
Federation of State, County,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.510
and Municipal Employees
issued a pamphlet entitled Out

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.110
of Their Beds and Into
the Streets, working

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.290
to try and scare family
members of people

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.650
with developmental disabilities
that, if institutions

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.940
were closed, that folks would be
left without access to support.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.420
That's, by and large,
not what happened.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.540
We did see that to some degree
in the mental health context

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.140
because the community service
system was not funded there.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.510
But in the DD context,
we've generally

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.840
seen a very positive
deinstitutionalization

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.700
experience.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.270
But at the time,
we saw controversy.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:05.000
So today, as we look at
new kinds of controversy,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.960
it's important to have
that historical context.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.780
Those of you who work
in Medicaid policy

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.380
may be familiar with
something called the Home

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.520
and Community-Based
Settings Rule.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.810
In 2014, the Obama
administration

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.820
issued a rule that was designed
to speak to the fact that,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:32.350
often, what we call community
living doesn't actually

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.790
afford people the kinds of
rights and opportunities

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.920
that we usually
consider characteristic

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.540
of life outside an institution.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.740
And that in the initial waves
of deinstitutionalization,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.980
sometimes what we ended
up doing was taking people

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.190
from a large building
where someone else got

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.440
to decide every
aspect of their life

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.500
and what they did for
every minute of the day,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.130
and put them in a small
building where someone else got

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.654
to decide every
aspect of their life

00:25:05.654 --> 00:25:07.570
and what they did for
every minute of the day.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.990
And well, we do have a
fair amount of research

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.660
that shows that folks
are more likely to have

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.960
choice and autonomy
in smaller settings

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.700
than in larger
congregate settings.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.990
Community also has to be
about the kinds of rights

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.820
and opportunities people have.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.990
And so this rule, the Home and
Community-Based Settings Rule,

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.745
which every state has
until 2022 to comply with--

00:25:33.745 --> 00:25:36.400
it was initially
going to be 2019.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.830
The current administration
extended it to some degree--

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.990
is a multi-dimensional
definition of community.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:50.330
It doesn't just talk about size,
although size is one factor.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:55.270
It also talks about the kinds
of rights that people have.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:26:00.470
Do people have the right to have
visitors in their own homes?

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:06.260
Do people have the right to
decide when they go to bed?

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.840
Do people have the right
to decide when they eat?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.520
Do people have the right
to decide where they live?

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.620
These basic concepts of choice--

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.550
which most people, with
and without disabilities,

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.850
who aren't in residential
service provision

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.720
have the opportunity
to make all the time--

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.490
are really core to the
question of whether

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.830
or not a setting
should be considered

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.460
community or
institutional in nature.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.730
Generally speaking,
if you're 40 years old

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.200
and you have a bedtime,
you're institutionalized,

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.701
even if we're calling
it something else.

00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:50.940
And the response and the
conflict that emerges here

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.750
is really oriented
around this tension

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.270
between autonomy and safety.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.350
And this really gets into one
of the core questions of what

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.370
it means to be considered--

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.050
I know our theme is citizenship.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.110
I don't want to limit it to
citizens-- but to be considered

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:16.860
a person, in the context of
our political, and social,

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.320
and especially human
services culture,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.310
which is, to what extent do we
allow people, what disability

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:28.890
rights advocates have long
called, the dignity of risk?

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:34.050
Because while there are certain
things that people do need

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:38.550
support to avoid, where
there are life and death--

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.040
immediate life and
death consequences--

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:46.590
in fact, most of us make
decisions about our lives

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.880
that are oriented around
more than just basic safety.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.430
How many of you have
ever had something

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.060
to eat that you later regretted?

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.610
How many of you
have ever been in

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.190
a romantic or
sexual relationship

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.110
that you've later regretted?

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.560
How many of you have
ever gone somewhere

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.840
that you've later regretted?

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.880
You think to yourself, why
did I waste my day like this?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.810
How many of you have ever
done something dangerous?

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.540
Do you think your
life would be better

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.220
if you didn't have
the opportunity

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.812
to make those choices?

00:28:23.812 --> 00:28:26.020
And so these are really one
of the core things that's

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.500
at stake when we talk about the
future of disability policy.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:36.160
Are we going to be comfortable
with a controversial, conflict,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.730
full, politicized
disability policy

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.960
conversation that has space
for people to make choices

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.670
that involve risk?

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.270
Or are we going to
go back to this idea

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:54.520
that there are no sides and
there are no politics when

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.590
it comes to disability?

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.670
We know that's not true.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.780
But it's important for us
to really send a message

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.590
to the public that
that's not true.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.570
I want to close by talking
about how this plays out

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.080
in academia, because
I know many of you

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.730
here have a very
significant role

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.870
to play in fields that
are far beyond just

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.045
disability studies
or disability policy.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.650
When we talk about political
science and economics,

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:33.910
scholars have come up with a
wide variety of really valuable

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.680
methodological tools to
help us understand conflict,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.200
and conflict between
different values

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.780
and different stakeholders
in our society.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.960
And one of the challenges
that we run into

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.630
is that those tools
aren't always applied

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.010
in the context of disability.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.460
Some of you who work
in political science

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.680
are familiar with the problem
of one person, one vote, one

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:05.620
time, which is a concept that
comes up in countries that

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.490
are embarking on the
transition to democracy,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.220
but while they may
have elections,

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.390
have not built
sufficiently strong norms

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.510
around political
institutions to be

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.880
assured that free and
fair elections will

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.680
happen more than once.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.830
And there is the risk that
elections will take place.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.580
And then the winners will
prevent further choices

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.800
from being made, if the
polity changes its mind.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.310
And here we have a
pretty basic recognition

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:44.150
that, in the
context of politics,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:49.260
people need to have the right
to choose more than once.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.140
And similarly, when we talk
about disability service

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:56.190
provision, often,
choice is conceptualized

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.190
in this very, very narrow way.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:03.690
You have the right to choose
between group home A, group

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.420
home B, and an institution.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.310
You have the right to choose
where you're going to live.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.130
But we don't necessarily talk
about the kinds of choices

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.930
you should have
the right to make

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.910
after you make that decision.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.490
In a very real way, we
run into this problem

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:26.860
of one person, one
choice, one time a lot

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.680
when we discuss residential
and employment service

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.200
provision for people with
significant disabilities

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.450
because there's a great
deal of focus that

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.160
goes into that initial choice,
but not a great deal of focus

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.390
into the kinds of choices that
occur every day around when

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:48.070
to eat, when to wake up,
who to spend time with,

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.520
and the ability to revise
our earlier choices.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:58.430
So I want to close by saying
that people with disabilities

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.780
are fighting, in
a very real sense,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:08.270
for some of the things that
we consider characteristic

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:13.190
of basic personhood
in our society.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:17.160
And the more we can
acknowledge that fight,

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.590
and the more we can orient our
discussions around disability

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:27.740
to the concrete and specific
areas of conflict that

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.880
drive disability
policy forward and have

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.810
over the course of many,
many decades at this point,

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.330
the more we can have
a real conversation

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.360
to ensure that the
rights of citizenship,

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.610
but also the rights
of personhood,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.677
are afforded to all.

00:32:45.677 --> 00:32:46.510
Thank you very much.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.779
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.210
- Thank you.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.850
Thank you very much, Ari.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.490
Really thought provoking, and
I appreciate those comments.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:00.567
And we'll now end--

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:02.650
I think we'll move right
into Charlotte's comments

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.350
so that we can then get started
and launch into the discussion.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.722
So Charlotte, the floor is open.

00:33:07.722 --> 00:33:08.930
- Thank you very much, Cheri.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.120
And thank you very much for the
invitation to be here today.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.420
I wanted to start off by
just saying that, today,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.540
across the globe,
we're seeing a surge

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.970
around the universal recognition
of disability rights.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.850
And it's very important
for us to recognize

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.900
that this demand is
predicated on and fueled

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.220
by decades of
struggle and results

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.440
of the work of the global
disability movement

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.480
that Judy talked about.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.430
This movement has
been a movement

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:43.410
that has fought relentlessly
for rights, for recognition,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.660
for dignity, and
very importantly,

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.020
for self-representation.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.330
The outcome of this
struggle has been

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:56.430
the construction of a global
architecture around disability.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.010
In that regard, we now
have the Convention

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.200
on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.240
which has been ratified
by 178 countries.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.920
Linked to that or
related to that,

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.630
we also have the Sustainable
Development Goals and the 2030

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.230
Agenda, which now frames
development programming

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.350
across the world.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.940
And so again, very important in
terms of thinking about where

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.520
disability is globally.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.409
It's important for us to note
that both of these frameworks

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:32.449
have been replicated at
regional level across the world.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.850
And in their
replication, what we see

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.659
is that they're nuanced based
on regional characteristics.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.949
And they're seen as part of
indigenization of the rights

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:46.190
in that particular
part of the world.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.620
As we speak, the
African Union is

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.190
about to commence the
process of approving

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.260
an African Protocol for
the Rights of Persons

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.239
With Disabilities.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.140
The World Disability
Report, a World Bank

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:04.780
and WHO collaboration, estimates
that persons with disabilities

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:10.090
make up at least 15% of
the world's population,

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:15.110
making us the world's
largest minority.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.410
Our collective lived
experience and mobilization

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.840
at local level and country
level has been directly,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.750
and I repeat, directly
responsible for the rapid entry

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.000
into force of the Convention
on the Rights of Persons

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.760
with Disabilities.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.170
And then in turn, this
convention and the engagement

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.870
of persons with
disabilities influence

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.970
the intergovernmental
negotiations

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.670
around the Sustainable
Development Goals,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.890
with the resultant
effect of making

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.680
them responsive to
disability and firmly

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.180
recognizing disability as part
of the development agenda.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.970
Now, this would not
have happened had it not

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:59.320
been for the global
disability movement.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.250
Increasingly, persons with
disabilities across the globe

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:07.780
have been shaping social
and economic innovations,

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.810
challenging social
norms and values,

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:12.880
and breaking new ground.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.670
Similarly, it is
pretty clear to me

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.530
that the desire for
recognition of one's own value

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:25.120
and that of a community has
driven the political engagement

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.340
of persons with disabilities,
again, across the globe.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.630
Today, across the world,
we have countless numbers

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.860
of parliamentarians with
disabilities in Africa,

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.890
in Asia, in Latin America.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:46.080
In Ecuador, we have
President Lenin Moreno,

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.370
a president with a disability.

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:54.300
In Argentina, we have a vice
president, Marta Gabriela

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.550
Michetti--

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.380
a woman with a
visible disability.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.960
And of course, we have our own
Tammy Duckworth in the Senate.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.490
But we need more.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.720
And it's possible.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.590
We need more, and it's possible.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.560
And I'll tell you why
I think it's possible.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.520
It's possible because we
have, ever more than before,

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.650
a robust and engaged base
of persons with disabilities

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.640
working at the community level
to galvanize and socialize

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.880
our rights.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.340
It's also important
for us to recognize

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:34.200
that, for the first time, these
organizations, these groups,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.690
these people are connected
via social media--

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.580
connected as never before.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.190
Persons with disabilities
are increasingly

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.340
influencing the course
of their communities

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.280
and their countries.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.820
For example, based
out of Nairobi, Kenya,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.000
a group of young, African
youth with disabilities

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.540
have established a
network using social media

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.560
to share their experience and
stand up for disability rights.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.550
They now have a platform
for their shared beliefs,

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.740
as citizens with
rights and dignity.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.890
This is very exciting.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:17.540
At the same time, we cannot
ignore the fact that this

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:22.790
population continues to
face many, many obstacles.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:27.310
And these range from
stigma, discrimination,

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.900
marginalization,
the lack of access

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:34.550
to services, to opportunities,
and very importantly,

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:38.400
to voice in decision making.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.470
If we accept that the
hallmark of citizenship

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.940
is the intrinsic worth, and
the value of all people,

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.180
and a concept that
continues to evolve,

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.680
then we also need to be
mindful of the barriers

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.190
that we experience.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.780
We also need to be
mindful of the fact

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.710
that our own sense of
worth, as Judy pointed out,

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.620
is not sufficient,
particularly where

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.440
we live in situations
and communities

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.040
where the societal norms
and practices do not

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.900
recognize your worth.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.170
So you might think you have
all the worth in the world.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.870
But if other people
and the community

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.810
doesn't see your value,
doesn't see your worth,

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.930
doesn't recognize
your agency, then

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:34.890
you're in a very
difficult situation.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.540
I wanted to just quickly talk
about the importance of higher

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.290
education because,
globally, students

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.810
with disabilities
in higher education

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:48.070
remain underrepresented.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.560
We're seeing some increases
in the OECD countries.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.800
But this is, by far, not enough.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.500
We know that on the
employment front,

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.310
we also see a lag in terms
of the employment of persons

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.190
with disabilities.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.460
The International
Labor Organization

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:12.940
estimates that 386 million
people of working age

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.690
have some kind of a disability,
and that in some places,

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.600
in some countries in the
world, the unemployment

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.770
rate for persons with
disabilities is as high as 80%.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.460
This exclusion of persons with
disabilities from education,

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.730
from employment
opportunities, as we know,

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.810
is often compounded by the
social disadvantage already

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.900
experienced by persons
with disabilities.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.630
And so what does this
mean in real terms?

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.440
What it means, for me, is
that too many young people

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.070
with disabilities
are not in education,

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.900
are not in employment.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.260
And as a category,
as a group of people,

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:01.030
they will be most affected
by economic exclusion

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.900
and, linked to that,
multidimensional poverty.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.360
We, therefore,
need to ensure that

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.370
their socioeconomic integration
is put in place by tailored

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:15.100
policies and programs.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.810
We need to see more robust
efforts in higher education

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.750
and really begin
to systematically,

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:28.370
and in a system-wide way,
address the lag that we see.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.520
We also need to
make institutions

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.170
of higher learning more
reflective of our demographics

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:39.530
and of our diversity
as a society.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.410
But I also just want
to pick up on a point,

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.280
and that is why we
have seen, globally,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.120
an advancement in
terms of disability,

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.270
within the global
disability movement.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.570
We're also having to
contend increasingly

00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:00.400
with the politics of
fear and populism.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.040
And this is happening in far
too many parts of the world.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.510
In my view, this movement,
this fear-based politics,

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:15.320
seeks to redefine people
as narrowly identified--

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.380
identifying the in
group, and in so doing,

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:23.400
really excludes large
parts of the population

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.000
as a whole and
negates those of us

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.400
who have intersecting
identities.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.070
I think this is particularly
disquieting for persons

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:37.710
with disabilities because,
as people with disabilities,

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.420
we all have
intersecting identities.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.930
These identities
could be gender.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.770
They could be race.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.050
They could be
sexual orientation.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.510
They could be refugee status.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.970
They could be age, and so on.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:58.550
And so we cannot afford
to valorize othering.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.460
Instead, we have to build
a common narrative that

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:08.150
is underpinned by respect,
non-discrimination, solidarity,

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:11.420
participation, and voice.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.440
And if we do this, it'll
enable us, as a group,

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.800
to flourish, to
belong, to recognize

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.690
the struggles of those
before us, and to thrive.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.180
If we fail to do
this, there is a risk

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.830
that the gains that we have made
to date will be clawed back.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.660
They'll be diluted.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.640
They will be erased.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:41.470
There is also a risk that
we will be made invisible.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.130
And there's also the
risk of us unwittingly

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:50.120
assuming new forms of
oppression and suppression.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.330
This is particularly
relevant as we

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:58.600
move into the future of work,
to which scientists have already

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.530
started to warn us that rapid
strides in the development

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.170
of artificial
intelligence and robotics

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.050
could threaten the prospects
of mass employment.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.420
And my question is,
what does that mean

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.940
for persons with disabilities?

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.330
And so I contend that
we have no choice

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:20.710
but to continue bold
and ambitious activism,

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:24.220
activism that ensures that
the aspirations of persons

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:28.510
with disabilities are
demanded and realized

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.310
through active citizenship.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.640
And we constantly need
to ask the question, what

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.430
does this mean for
persons with disabilities?

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.960
We need to rewrite the
narrative of active citizenship

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.480
and civil participation
to include

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:48.320
persons with disabilities,
not as the exception, but as

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.010
the rule.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.280
In shaping this narrative,
we cannot and should not lose

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.990
sight of the need to address
the existing barriers that still

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.640
exclude us.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.780
We need to challenge these
barriers like Maria Alejandra

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.430
Villanueva did.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:10.200
Maria is a young woman with
Down Syndrome who lives in Peru.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.620
And she was able to challenge
a discriminatory government

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:18.390
policy and, in so doing,
nullified the policy

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.020
that excluded people with
certain mental and intellectual

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.900
disabilities from
the electoral rolls.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.180
We need more Marias.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.220
We need to be
seated at the table

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.950
to construct dialogue
between the disability

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:36.050
movement, public institutions.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.700
We need to build alliances
with broader civil society.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.730
We need to be part of
political organizations.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.400
And of course, we need
to be visible and active

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.760
in the private sector if
we're essential-- if we

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.950
are to move the discourse
from inclusion to empowerment.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.780
And I want to repeat that
because I think we really

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.560
need to think about moving the
discourse around disability

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.300
from inclusion to empowerment.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.700
We know that facilitating
disability inclusion

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.910
enables the mobilization
of a new generation.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.110
But we also need to see more
young people with disabilities

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:19.280
as economic and social resources
who can, as citizens, directly

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:25.220
contribute to sustaining the
stability and economic growth

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.330
of our country.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.240
However, we cannot
do this alone.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.800
Using the capabilities approach,
the work of Sen and Nussbaum,

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.430
we have advanced the
conceptualization

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.450
of disability, but
we need more of that.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.990
The work that my dear friends
Michael and Cheri lead

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:51.070
is well-respected globally
and highly sought after.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.600
We need more Cheris.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.790
We need more Michaels.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:58.180
And so allow me, Chair,
to use my last minute

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:02.800
to invite academia to partner
with us to better define

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.610
the discourse around
disability and citizenship,

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.600
on issues around how we
measure participation.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.120
How do we enhance participation?

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.210
There is a lot to do, and
I hope this conference is

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.490
the beginning of this journey.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:21.850
So let me just close
with an African proverb

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.810
that I think sums up my
remarks and, in many ways,

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:29.080
says it in a lot
more eloquent way.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.940
And it says, "If you want
to go fast, go alone.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:39.286
But if you want to
go far, go together."

00:47:39.286 --> 00:47:41.834
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:49.590
- OK.

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:51.300
Thank you very much, Charlotte.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.760
So I'm going to kick off
with a couple of questions

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.910
for the panel that I think will
touch upon the points brought

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:00.704
up and maybe bring up a
few new points, as well.

00:48:00.704 --> 00:48:03.120
So if I could, Maria, I'm going
to tap you on the shoulder

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.869
first since I'm sitting
right next to you.

00:48:04.869 --> 00:48:05.610
- OK.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.940
- And I think it's really
interesting to think about this

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.291
cross-generational perspective.

00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:13.290
In your experience now
with the City of Houston,

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.080
but also working with Public
Engagement with the Obama White

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.370
House, it seemed like you were
really able to bring together

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.290
a community of young voices
of people with disabilities.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.219
And as we think about
this ADA Generation,

00:48:25.219 --> 00:48:27.510
obviously, there's a very
empower-- it's very empowered

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.220
lens.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.747
But also, conversely, do you
think there's any risk there?

00:48:31.747 --> 00:48:33.330
Do you think that a
younger generation

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.577
is at risk of forgetting
the past in any way and all

00:48:35.577 --> 00:48:36.660
the work that's been done?

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.350
Or how are you seeing
people respond to that?

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.890
- I don't think so.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.970
I actually think that the
vast majority of youth

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.250
with disabilities don't
have access to the past,

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.610
so they don't have
a way to forget it.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:56.280
There is still an enormous lack
of recognition and awareness

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.660
of disability history.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.630
And that's everything from
a history of the disability

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:03.389
rights movement,
to knowing that one

00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:05.430
of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.888
was a person with a disability,
to recognizing that Harriet

00:49:07.888 --> 00:49:10.200
Tubman was a disabled woman.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.290
And I also think that many
young people with disabilities

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:19.320
do not know and
don't have a chance

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.494
to learn what their rights are.

00:49:21.494 --> 00:49:23.160
And I'm going to
probably, a little bit,

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.880
mess up a saying from the
self-advocacy movement, which

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.970
is essentially that we invest
so much time, and energy,

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.570
and money in getting our
children to talk only

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:34.620
to tell them to shut up.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:44.070
And I think that for many youth
with disabilities growing up

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:46.020
today, at least for myself--

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:53.640
because we have access to things
like mainstream education,

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.340
we are-- the primary
message that we receive

00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:01.650
about our disability is to
pass, be as normal and as

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:04.740
non-disabled as possible.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:10.190
And that is extremely toxic,
and it's extremely dangerous.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:15.820
And so I think that once
youth with disabilities

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:21.160
are able to learn about the
past and learn about the fights,

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.920
it is actually motivation
to get more engaged.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.770
I also think youth with
disabilities growing up now,

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.500
like every young
person in the country,

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:33.520
is seeing how easily our
rights can be threatened,

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.150
and the importance of that
vigilance that President Obama

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:39.470
talked about.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.940
I also think, too, many young
people with disabilities

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.250
are having to learn how to
attack much more subtle,

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:51.980
but none the less, dangerous
forms of discrimination.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.910
So for example, young
people with disabilities

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:57.100
are growing up with
the expectation

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.500
that they will have a job.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.730
They prepare their resume.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:01.870
They put on their suits.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:04.440
They get an interview.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:07.110
They get to the interview
and are ultimately

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:09.930
denied the job
because they're told,

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:13.410
you're just not the right fit.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.220
You can't take, you're
just not the right fit,

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.170
and sue that employer for
disability discrimination.

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:23.730
Even though embedded in,
you're just not the right fit,

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.720
is, you look different.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.740
That scares me, and I don't
know if I can work with you.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.520
And so I think that
the tactics that youth

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.420
will have to use to
really dig into things

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.390
like that, those subtle--

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.750
subtle comments connected
to much more dangerous forms

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.480
of discrimination are going to
be different than generations

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.170
previous because they were
attacking very explicit,

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:52.680
tangible forms of bias.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.180
So--

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:53.420
- Yeah.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.070
It does look a
little different now.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:59.420
But I think I've experienced
many of the same things

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.980
from the standpoint of--

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.210
I think that I know,
personally, as I approached

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:05.990
a career in medicine,
for example,

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.860
that probably a
lot of my success--

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.060
particularly early on, when I
didn't have a lot of mentors,

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.280
myself, to look
at-- was the tactics

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.700
of passing, of keeping
up, and doing the job,

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.310
and making it work in
whatever way would get it done

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.380
at the end of the day,
but not necessarily doing

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.630
that with a positive
identity of disability

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:26.870
or bringing that to
the table, as well.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:28.610
Charlotte, on a
similar vein, you

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.090
talked a little bit about
mobilization of younger

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.930
generations in Africa.

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:36.125
Can you talk a little
bit more about--

00:52:36.125 --> 00:52:41.150
as we are living in a world with
so much more interconnectedness

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.300
with regards to things
like social media

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.320
and other forms of
reaching across borders,

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.780
do you see advocacy
happen differently

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.780
in places where people
may not have previously

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.530
been able to talk to
each other as easily,

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.905
and particularly those younger
generations who are coming

00:52:56.905 --> 00:52:58.710
into it with that lens?

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:03.770
- So I mean, I definitely see
a lot more use of social media.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:09.110
But I think we also need to just
acknowledge our own privilege

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:13.190
because in a lot of
places where I work, just

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:17.430
getting onto the internet
is very difficult.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.160
It costs a lot when you can.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.530
And so we need to
be mindful of that.

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.460
But I do think that there
are groups-- as I mentioned,

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:29.810
the group that works out of
Nairobi that works TransAfrica,

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:30.990
and they're really good.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:34.790
They're really good about
sharing positive stories,

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:39.060
about sharing new laws
that are coming up.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.600
And they are very, very engaged.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.090
Now, I think what--

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.070
the way that group
was established

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:49.700
was that it got some funding
from the Open Society

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.950
Foundation, which is great.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:56.340
But those type of things should
be happening organically.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.490
My greatest fear
is, what happens

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:00.200
when the funding runs dry?

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.020
So it's really important
for us to recognize

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.750
these types of
initiatives, but find

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:11.000
ways to make them indigenous
to Nairobi, to Lagos,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.829
or wherever it is.

00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:13.370
And so, yeah.

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.230
I mean, I think it's happening,
but it could happen a lot more.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.470
- Yeah, exactly.

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:22.490
And Ari, I wanted to ask
you a little bit about-- you

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.557
know, in your work across
policy, and so many

00:54:25.557 --> 00:54:27.140
of the things that
you said resonated,

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.940
I know, personally
with me, with regards

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.310
to having the
choice to take risks

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:36.110
and to be able to make that
decision independently.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:39.590
Have you seen-- as we enter into
this current political climate

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:42.080
and with a lot of the
challenges that we're in,

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.360
do you see people from
within the disability

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:50.120
community becoming more engaged,
or as the challenges mount,

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.010
more disenfranchised, or both?

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.320
I mean, I think some
people get fired up

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.812
and want to be
even more involved.

00:54:55.812 --> 00:54:57.770
And other people just
think it's just too much.

00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:59.360
And the barriers are
so high that they

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.160
tend to pull back a little bit.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.200
Have you seen any major
trends in that way?

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.480
- So of course, the answer
that I'd like to give,

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.896
and the answer
that we're supposed

00:55:06.896 --> 00:55:09.440
to give in moments like this,
is that the disability rights

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.690
movement is united as one
in this overwhelming wave

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:18.120
of passion and is
voting as a bloc.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.520
And the tragic thing is
that it's not really true.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:28.110
In so far as we have data,
we know that, in general,

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:34.280
people with disabilities follow,
in terms of political opinions,

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.430
some of the same patterns
as the broader public.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:42.950
And you know, as Judy
alluded to earlier, usually,

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:46.400
folks don't take an
identity-first conception

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.180
of their disability.

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:53.870
And so while we, in some
sense, have tens of millions

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:58.220
of people, a large voting
bloc, practically, we

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:02.720
haven't seen voting patterns
really track with that.

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.780
Now, there are some
very significant ways

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.130
in which the disability
community does mobilize around

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:14.690
candidates and policy issues
that speak very directly

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:16.080
to their interests.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.970
I think we saw that
in the context of--

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:23.510
two years ago, in the fight
over Medicaid per capita caps

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:28.820
and the attempt to repeal
the Affordable Care Act.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:32.780
We saw significant mobilization
of the disability community

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:36.140
and, particularly, of
disability rights groups.

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:40.190
But we're continuously
facing this challenge

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:43.010
that there's the
disability rights

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:45.740
community, and the
disability rights culture,

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:48.510
and infrastructure, and so on.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:53.116
And then there's this
vastly larger group

00:56:53.116 --> 00:56:57.050
of people who just happened
to have disabilities.

00:56:57.050 --> 00:57:02.930
And if we want to increase the
effectiveness of the disability

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:05.540
rights community,
we have to expand

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:10.490
it to encompass more than
just a small percentage

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:12.860
of the disability
community, because that's

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.440
the way that we're going
to start meaningfully

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:19.160
influencing voting
patterns and really

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.594
come into political maturity
as a stakeholder group.

00:57:22.594 --> 00:57:23.094
- Yeah.

00:57:23.094 --> 00:57:24.677
That's a really
important perspective.

00:57:24.677 --> 00:57:25.400
Thank you.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.160
So we'll now open it
up to the audience

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.030
for some Q&amp;A. So
please, does anybody

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.070
have a first question
for the panelists?

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:35.567
Looks like right here.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.500
- Hi there.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.850
My name's Mandy Curtis.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:46.210
I'm a social worker
who actually worked

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:47.830
in the medical field
for a few years,

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.636
and now I run a private
practice that works

00:57:50.636 --> 00:57:51.760
a little bit on disability.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.260
I've been legally
blind since birth,

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.940
and I do adaptive rock climbing.

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.000
I was thinking a
lot about what we've

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.480
discussed in terms of in group
and out group, citizenship,

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.310
and global participation.

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:05.620
And I've noticed we've talked
a lot about young people

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.240
and youth, and I
think there's been

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.760
kind of a focus of
discussion on people

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.980
who have had disability and
kind of grown up with it

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.504
from a young age.

00:58:13.504 --> 00:58:15.670
Something that I've interacted
with a lot in my life

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:17.830
and in my work is,
in fact, adults

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:20.890
who have acquired
disability, or have maybe

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:24.160
grown up with a condition but
not known what it was, or had

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:29.260
their disability changed the way
their body functions over time.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:33.050
And I think I have come to some
thoughts about this on my own.

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.800
But I would love to open
this up to a panel of people

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.060
who are very experienced
in these different ways,

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:42.410
and ask you, what do you
think are ways that we--

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:45.520
as a community, but within our
societies and our cultures--

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.500
kind of open the
door for people who

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.680
have experienced
the shock and even

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.020
the loss of acquiring
a disability,

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.970
and having to
relate to their body

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.430
and to their
community in a new way

00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:59.230
that they really maybe not--

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:01.850
they didn't really have
control over at the time?

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:04.420
How do we kind of make space
for that complicated journey

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:10.000
and integration of possibly
acquiring a new identity?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.860
- Cheri, can I maybe
take a shot at that?

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.096
- Absolutely.

00:59:13.096 --> 00:59:17.830
- So I was injured in a
car crash as an adult.

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:20.750
I'd just graduated
from law school.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:21.490
And so I--

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:25.330
I mean, I know exactly
what you're talking about.

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:30.010
Acquiring a disability at
that age, for me, was--

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:32.650
I had a life, like
before and after.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:35.380
It was really that clear.

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:42.220
And it was also very clear to me
about how people perceived me.

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:45.550
And so there was a lot of--

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:49.330
aside from the fact that I
was learning my own body,

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:52.480
people around me
were having to learn

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.900
how to interact with me
because there was-- there

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:58.790
continued to be this
fear, if you want,

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:05.780
this subliminal fear about
my newly-acquired disability.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:10.670
I had a lot of people who
were praying for me every day.

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:11.510
That didn't work.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:14.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:19.250
I had a lot of people who
just couldn't deal with it.

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.642
They just could
not deal with it.

01:00:21.642 --> 01:00:23.100
But then I had some
amazing people.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.660
I mean, my family
was incredible.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:28.340
I had a lot of people
who just really made sure

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.640
that I was given all
of the opportunities

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.180
to make sure that I could
continue to do the work that I

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:35.840
wanted to do.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.300
On a personal level,
I was also very clear

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:48.030
that I didn't want to be
the disability lawyer.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:50.640
And so for the first
couple of years,

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.670
I was totally not engaged
in the disability agenda.

01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:56.650
I was working on
children's rights.

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:59.400
I was working on social
and economic rights.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:04.290
I did not want to be pigeonholed
as the disability lawyer.

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:08.970
But as we know, that
doesn't last for too long.

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:11.670
Increasingly, my work
on children's rights

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.280
were about children
with disabilities.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.370
Increasingly, my work
around prisoners' rights

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.100
was to find out what was
happening with prisoners

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.249
with disabilities.

01:01:21.249 --> 01:01:22.665
And then I just
thought, you know,

01:01:22.665 --> 01:01:26.320
I just need to be true
to myself and call it.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.100
And I think, obviously, it was
the best thing I've ever done.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.980
But I do think that
there's a transition,

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:35.590
and people experience
that very differently.

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:36.120
But, yeah.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.528
So that was my story.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:38.944
- Can I also answer
that question?

01:01:38.944 --> 01:01:40.870
- Absolutely.

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:42.780
- What was your name?

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.010
- Mandy.

01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:44.510
- Mandy.

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:46.680
Mandy, that was a
fantastic question,

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.410
and I'm so glad you raised it.

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:53.190
The vast majority of people
with disabilities in the United

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.920
States are older adults.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.460
And they're older adults
who have most likely

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.760
aged into disability.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.840
And so to kind of
add color to what Ari

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.530
was saying about
voting blocs and how

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.840
we don't vote as a
big disability vote,

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.020
it's because the
majority of those voters

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.290
are older adults who will say
things like, I just don't hear

01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:17.520
as well as I used to.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.220
And the vast majority
of people that I

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:28.360
work with in my office in
Houston are older adults.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:35.320
And so when I am usually on
the phone with, let's say,

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.120
a 70-year-old woman with limited
English who is becoming blind

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.770
due to diabetes, and she is
talking to me about how scared

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:48.192
she is, and about how much--

01:02:48.192 --> 01:02:50.650
how hard this is for her, the
first thing that I have to do

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:52.570
is respect that.

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:59.680
What I cannot do is say, oh,
but it's OK to be disabled,

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.620
and you should have
disability pride.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.760
I can't do that.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.210
That's going to shut
down the conversation.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.780
And what I find myself
doing, many times,

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.730
is very, very slowly trying to
not only connect individuals

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:19.810
to resources, but to community,
because what I have found

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:21.480
is that community
can save lives.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.890
And I have a story here.

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:27.370
So during Hurricane
Harvey, I think

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.380
one of the greatest
public health crises

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.830
that Houston faced was
older adults who, again,

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:35.920
aged into disability, were not
connected to disability support

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:42.250
systems, and were living
very tentative existences.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:45.370
And we worked with a man
whose name was Mr. Johnson.

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:48.640
Mr. Johnson was blind
because of a car accident.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.790
He had diabetes, and he
had lymphedema in his legs.

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:56.340
His leg wraps became
contaminated with floodwater,

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.810
and so his legs became infected.

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:03.760
And so he was at significant
risk of losing his legs.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.980
And it was always
tricky to call Mr.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.480
Johnson because he couldn't--
he had not been taught to use

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.385
assistive technology
and was blind.

01:04:13.385 --> 01:04:15.010
So you would have to
call him and leave

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:16.600
a voicemail, which
he would then try

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.660
to write down to call you back.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.777
And he couldn't tell
us what kind of leg

01:04:21.777 --> 01:04:23.860
wraps he needed because
he couldn't see the labels

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.390
and wasn't connected to people
who could come in and read them

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:28.320
for him.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.730
And so what we did was basically
sent out a disability welcoming

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.270
wagon to Mr. Johnson's
house so that he could see,

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:39.300
one, people with
limited mobility

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.710
who were able to help him--

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.630
these were the folks
that brought him food--

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.550
and connect him to
other blind folks.

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:47.190
And I remember, he called
me three months later.

01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:50.910
And he said, Ms. Maria,
thank you for introducing me

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:51.930
to Maria and Michael.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.850
They saved my life.

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:57.540
And so I think we
need to develop

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.150
better systems of
exposing people

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:04.770
who are aging into disability
to community because, to them,

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.270
it's just a sign of their
fragility and their mortality,

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.270
which, if we're all being
honest with ourselves,

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.520
are very hard to contend with.

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:18.310
- I was struck, and
I've been struck

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.520
over the course of the
last several years,

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.830
by how the disability community
and the idea of disability

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:31.450
culture really needs to be
referred to more in the plural

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.820
than in the singular.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:38.560
It's very challenging because
we want to be able to say, well,

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.550
people with
disabilities want this.

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:43.840
You know, folks say,
people with disabilities

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.000
want you to refer to them
with person-first language.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.050
But in reality, for
some communities,

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.230
that's not the case.

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.380
The autistic community,
the deaf community,

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.420
the blind community--

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:59.390
there's often a preference
for identity-first language.

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:02.230
We want to be able to say,
people with disabilities

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:03.670
don't want to cure.

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:06.070
Well, for many
disability groups,

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:08.650
folks do, very
intensely, want to cure.

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:11.920
And for others, we
very intensely don't.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.280
And I think the challenge
that we run into

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.720
is we built this really powerful
political coalition that

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.960
came together to pass
the ADA, and defend it,

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.690
and to fight for
disability rights

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:28.040
in a variety of contexts.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.420
But that political
coalition is really

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.280
a hodge-podge of dramatically
different kinds of experiences

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.500
and people who
think of themselves

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.030
in dramatically different ways.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:44.740
And so the more that we can
start thinking of the first

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.800
point of contact
for, especially,

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.900
folks with newly
acquired disabilities--

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.780
but even folks who've grown up
with their disabilities but are

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:56.500
looking for a disability
community for the first time--

01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:01.630
to be their native part of
the disability community,

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:06.970
rather than trying to take
our political coalition

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:12.550
and turn it into something that
it really hasn't been, except

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:16.210
for a small number
of people culturally.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:18.610
I think the better
off we're going to be.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:22.010
And the good news is that there
are a lot of folks doing that.

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.700
And there are a lot of
folks doing excellent work

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:28.300
to continue to build,
and grow, and expand

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.940
the different
disability cultures that

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.540
carry such resonance for
so many different people.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.530
- Thank you, Ari.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:39.280
So with that-- actually, that
was such a rich question,

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.130
thank you--

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:42.800
and such a rich discussion
that we used up the time.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.620
Now, I will say that I
think all of our panelists

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.620
would be very open to answering
further questions one-on-one

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.381
after this formal session ends.

01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:54.880
But I also don't want to cut
into people's break time, which

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.540
is, of course, very important.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.900
So with this, we'll break.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.370
How long, Becky?

01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:02.140
For 25 minutes.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.600
Please remember that there
are accessible bathrooms.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.100
There's plenty of
folks in the back.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.380
Just please ask, if you
have any questions regarding

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.192
where to find that.

01:08:10.192 --> 01:08:11.650
And let's please
have another round

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.733
of applause for our amazing
panelists, Maria, Ari,

01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:14.686
and Charlotte.

01:08:14.686 --> 01:08:18.130
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:22.220
And we'll see you
back very soon.

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.070
Thank you.
