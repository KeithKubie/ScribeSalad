00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Our result here that set is not a hashable object suggests that set is mutable.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We haven't yet found a way to mutate sets.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We could find it by looking at the documentation but we're programmers,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we usually prefer to do experiments than to play around with reading documentation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's think about the other kinds of experiments we should do

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and I'm going to show you one useful thing that you can do in the interpreter

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I'm going to show you one interesting thing you can do in the interpreter

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to help with those experiments, so I've created a set here and now I'm going to use the dir operation.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We can apply dir to any object and what we get as a result of dir

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is a list of all the names in that object's name space.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We can think of these as all the things that you can do with s.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Each of these names after s followed by dot is something we could do with s

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and you see an idle, the Python interpreter that I'm doing now,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
actually gives us a list of those as choices when we type s.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We could try any of these operation and see what they do.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Let's start with and, and we can see add was listed here in the directory

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and another thing we can see and you won't see this if you use the end-browser id

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
when we start to type add, we actually see documentation for when it does pop up.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is the way things work in idle, the default Python interpreter

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
if you download that from Python.org.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Different environments for running Python will do different things

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but this is really handy that it says, well, add does what we might expect, it adds an element to the set.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Let's add element 4. We notes that add did not return something.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There is no result here. We can confirm that using print. Let's add 5 to the set as well.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The result that comes back is none.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
There's no result from add but what it did was add object to the set,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so we can see the value of the set now includes 4 and 5.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Let's talk a little more at the different operations that we have on the set.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They're all these double underscore ones at the start.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
These are called special method names often know as magic methods.
