00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.830
&gt;&gt;presenter: Alright, good afternoon everyone.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.759
Today we are pleased to welcome Dr. Tina Seelig
back to Google

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.680
for her second Talks at Google Presentation.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.830
Professor Seelig is the executive director
at Stanford Technology Ventures Program

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.300
and the best-selling author of "What I Wish
I knew When I Was Twenty".

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.980
Today, she speaks with us about her latest
book "Ingenious",

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.240
and it brings lessons from her teaching, and
research into creativity

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.690
and shows how anyone can increase their creative
genius

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.840
and creative potential.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.100
Um, Tina remains one of the most inspirational
teachers

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.460
at Stanford, both for myself and the many
other folks

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.610
who have been through her class.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.760
Her courses on creativity impact not only
engineers, and D school grads,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.020
but lawyers, doctors, um public health advocates,
and and humanitarians in general.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.790
Lessons from her course are applied in companies
throughout the world, including here at Google

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.430
where we have a program called CSI that teaches
many of the same things

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.850
that were taught in her class.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.840
Um,Together, with other proud alumni
in her class here at Google

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.422
in the audience,
please join me in welcoming Tina back to Google.

00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:00.422
Thank you.

00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:01.422
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Tina Seelig: Thanks so much.

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:02.422
Thank you

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:08.850
&gt;&gt;Tina Seelig: It is my total pleasure to
be back here again.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.920
It was exactly three years ago that I was
here giving you

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.700
a talk about my last book "What I Wish I Knew
When I Was Twenty."

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.210
Who would have known that three years later
I would have a new book out and would get

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.660
to share with you.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.460
This book is based on my dozen years teaching
classes on creativity and innovation

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.290
and entrepreneurship at Stanford.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.470
And I decided I wanted to capture
what I've learned through these experiences.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.409
And uh it's interesting, I had lunch
with some of the Googlers today,

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.970
and they asked how I got
from being neurophysiologist to being a,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.210
you know, teaching classes on
creativity and innovation.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.010
And it turns out, I really went into
neuroscience initially because

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.869
of my interest in creativity.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.460
I wanted to know how the brain generated ideas.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.790
And I have to say that, after finishing four
years

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.610
of my PH.D at Stanford,
um, I realized we were still pretty far

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.540
from understanding how the brain works
and how creativity is generated.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.020
So I went out into the real world
to look at creativity in action.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.529
I've worked in startup companies,
and I'm just delighted to be at Stanford now

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:11.799
for just over a dozen years.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.859
Uh, really focusing on this, on creativity
in individuals, in teams and organizations.

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.109
The First question I want to ask is:
Where do ideas come from?

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.410
Where do ideas come from?

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.410
Anyone?

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.410
&gt;&gt;audience member: Inspiration
&gt;&gt;Tina:

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.689
From Inspiration.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:26.689
And where do you get inspiration?

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.900
&gt;&gt;audience member: From putting two unconnected
things together as an example

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.329
&gt;&gt;Tina: Great!

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.330
Connecting things that are unconnected.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.330
What else?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.780
&gt;&gt;audience member: [inaudible]

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.879
&gt;&gt;Tina: From your environment.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.109
You know, the interesting thing here is if
I had asked you

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.019
How do you do experiments to figure out how
the world works?

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.110
you would end up coming up with some very
very clear ideas

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.379
about how to do a science experiment.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.949
From the time
we are little, we are given classes and taught

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.129
how to come up with hypotheses and how to
test them,

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.739
how to analyze the data, and basically how
to discover

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.959
how the world works.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.609
But we aren't given
a parallel set of processes to think about

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.529
how to invent
new things.

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:11.059
Now here you are in Google where there is
invention, invention going on all the time,

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.769
but one of the things
that happens is, we aren't actually really

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.879
clear about all
the variables that are coming into play.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.829
So what I've been trying to do is figure out
a way, a model,

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.919
that shapes how we think about creativity
and innovation

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.590
in individuals, in teams and organizations.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.889
So...I am going to start out
by showing you a picture of this model,

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.939
and I'm going to take it apart and put it
back together.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.650
The model I call "The Innovation Engine",
and it looks at the things that happen inside

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.939
you,
the inside of this Mobius strip:

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.799
your knowledge, information, attitude
and the outside, the things that have to come

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.829
into play
in the outside world:

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.709
the resources, habitat and the culture.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.749
Now the interesting thing is if you ask most
people

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.389
to make a list of the things
that are important for creativity,

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.819
they usually start with imagination.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.870
Because that's the obvious place to start.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.159
So we're going to start there too....

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.339
....With your imagination.

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.699
Now, we're actually all imaginative.

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.859
We wouldn't be sitting here, or standing here,
uh, where we are if we hadn't been.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.940
We had to learn through creative problem solving
in every single aspect of our lives, right?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.840
Walking, talking, riding a bicycle,
and certainly all of the products you are

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840
developing here today.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.039
But why is it that many people don't
think of themselves as creative?

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.520
And a lot of it comes from the type of training
and environments that we've been in.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.740
Think about it...

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.340
When we're in Kindergarten, we're given problems
like this....

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.831
..What two numbers add up to ten? or, if
we are given five and five, what's the answer?

00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:44.919
what's the answer to this?

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.129
&gt;&gt;audience member: [inaudible]

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.340
&gt;&gt;Tina:
Ten, okay.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.889
I got a little ahead of myself there.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.270
Okay, if we're given this, there's one right
answer

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.810
because we're taught that one right answer.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.759
But what if we ask the question in a different
way?

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.560
What if we ask what two numbers add up to
ten?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.560
How many answers are there to this?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.630
&gt;&gt;audience member: infinite answers

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.939
&gt;&gt;Tina: Infinite answers.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.639
You can of course
take the obvious answers like eight plus two,

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.300
and three plus seven, but negative numbers,
fractions,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.340
decimals, and if we don't ask questions in
the right way,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.659
we don't come up with the right answers.

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.830
And this is very very important,
because one of the first steps in increasing

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.050
your imagination
is asking the right question.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.050
Think about it.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.120
If I ask you, um, if you'll build a bridge
for me,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.560
you could go off and build a bridge,
or you could come back to me and say,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.879
"Why do we need a bridge in the first place?"

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:42.750
And if I said "I need to get across the Bay",
wow, there are so many ways to do that, right?

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.830
You could walk around, you could swim,
you could take a boat, you could have a helicopter,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.240
you could have a tunnel, you could have a
hot air balloon.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.960
The fact is if we don't ask
the question properly in the beginning,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.220
we don't end up coming with the right answers.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.530
Or the whole field of possible answers.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.030
Albert Einstein is quoted as saying
if he had a problem to solve,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.970
and it was terribly difficult,
and his life depended upon it,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.629
and he only had an hour to solve the problem...
he'd spend the first fifty-five minutes

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.939
framing the problem,
because the frame of the problem

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.729
is essentially the frame
in which the answers will fall.

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.220
And so we have to think about practicing this.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.870
This is NOT trivial.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.520
If you think about it,
the entire Copernican revolution came about

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.460
by reframing what we think of the solar system.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.990
Instead of saying the Earth is the center
of the solar system,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.419
by reframing it and saying
"Wow what would happen if the sun was the

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:35.960
center of the solar system?"

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.470
All of a sudden it opened up the entire field
of astronomy.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.960
This is not just true in science,
this is true in art as well.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.940
Think of artists like Escher
who challenge us to look,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.030
question the foreground, and the background.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.909
And most of his artwork really looks at changing
the way we frame the picture.

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.509
There's some really fun ways to practice
doing this every day.

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.529
Really fun ways.

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.319
My favorite way to do it using jokes.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:06.039
So, um, you guys are probably familiar
with the Pink Panther, the Pink Panther

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:13.550
and Inspector Clouseau, uh looks at a dog
on the street and he's about to go and pet

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.999
him
and he says "Does your dog bite?"

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:19.050
and, uh, the, uh, person who's carrying the
dog says,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.150
"No, my dog doesn't bite."

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.080
He reaches down, dog bites him and he says,
"What happened?"

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.520
and he says "Well, that's not my dog."

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.660
[crowd laughs]

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.460
The fact is the frame changes in the middle,
and this happens all the time.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.340
If you look at jokes, you will find that jokes
are funny because the frame switches.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.479
Here's an example:
Two women are walking, uh, playing golf one

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:41.379
day,
and, uh a funeral goes by, in the cemetery

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:45.039
next door,
and one of them stops, quietly bows her head

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.659
and says a prayer,
and her friend says "You are the most thoughtful

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:50.159
person
I could ever imagine!"

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.129
She says, "Well, it's the least I could do.

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:53.490
We were married for
twenty-five years."

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.669
[crowd laughs]

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:57.599
Again, the frame switched in the middle of
the joke.

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:58.750
THAT's what makes it funny.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:06.129
So look at jokes as way for you to practice,
even on a day to day level, how to frame problems.

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:09.789
Now, another way to increase your imagination,
and you brought this up earlier,

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.190
is to connect and combine things that are
not obvious.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:18.219
And this is an incredibly powerful tool,
because most new inventions actually come

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:21.689
about
by putting things together that already exist

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:23.669
but in non-obvious ways.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:29.879
One of my favorite ways to explore this is
looking at the Japanese art of Chindogu.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.820
And the art of Chindogu is creating unuseless
inventions.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.740
Now these are things that aren't really useful,
and they're not really useless, but they are

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.789
kind of unuseful.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.120
So here's an example, you know, the shoes
with the, uh, uh,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120
umbrellas on them.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.339
Well, it might not be completely practical,
but opens up a really interesting set of ideas,

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:53.660
and you'd say "Whoa, what might that be if
we had an equivalent

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.860
to umbrellas on our shoes?"

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.840
Or speaking of shoes, what if we had little
[laughter] dustpans on our shoes?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.649
Now I would say, this is actually really interesting.

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:06.350
We normally have to get down on the floor
to sweep things up,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.880
what kind of ideas does this unlock by thinking
about what happens if you put a dustpan your

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.000
shoes?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.130
Or what if you put a mop on a baby's tummy,
right?

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.130
Why not, if instead of the baby making a mess,
the baby's job

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.870
is to clean up [crowd laughs] after itself
okay?

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.680
[crowd laughs]
So as it's , you put it on the floor, you

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.160
know, sort of like
better than a little robot, you know, the

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.019
baby crawls around,
cleans up the floor.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:29.019
Okay.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:33.550
So you have framing problems, you have
connecting and combining ideas, it's also

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.399
important,
no, uh, this is an example of an uh, every

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.190
day way to combine and connect ideas.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.970
One of my favorite approaches is uh using
the New Yorker Cartoon contest.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.770
How many of you read the New Yorker?

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.770
Lots of you?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.770
okay.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.770
It's one of my favorite things, um, and in
the back,

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.630
there is the contest where there's cartoon
that has not captions,

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.720
and there's almost always things that are
incongruent that are in the picture.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.520
Things that shouldn't be together, things
that are out of scale,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.520
things that seem ridiculous when you put them
in the same frame.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.019
And it's your job to connect them, to create
some storyline that in a really

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:05.760
fun and interesting way connects them.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.040
So here's a picture of two businessmen and
a hobby horse,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.810
and here is the caption that they had,
"We'll start you out here, then give you more

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.380
responsibilities
as you gain experience."

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.380
[crowd laughs]

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.790
Maybe that could happen here at Google.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.790
I don't know.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.790
[crowd laughs]

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.120
So, I said you've got to connect and combine
ideas,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.800
you've to reframe problems, you also need
to challenge assumptions.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.250
Now what does this mean?

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.410
This is actually critically important
for your imagination.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:36.070
It means going beyond the first right answer.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.690
Most of us, when we try to solve a problem,
come up with the first answer

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.170
and think we're done.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.730
And this is terribly problematic if you
want to come up with a really creative solution.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.829
And it's one of the reasons that we do brainstorming,
because brainstorming is a great way, if used

00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:52.850
properly,
to really generate a LOT of ideas, often ideas

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.880
that are unexpected.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.699
The way I like to teach my students to challenge
assumptions

00:10:56.699 --> 00:11:00.220
is that I give them problems that don't have
a right answer.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.320
In fact, they are problems I have no idea
how I would tackle

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.649
and so I want to be as surprised by the types
of results

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:06.940
they come up with as they are.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.860
Uh, let me tell you a story
about a recent project I gave:

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.170
This was in Japan.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.449
I was asked to run, um, a couple of workshops
with students at Osaka University.

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:22.269
I want to frame this by saying
I was told I'm going there because these students

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:25.449
are NOT creative,
and they kind of wanted to prove it to me.

00:11:25.449 --> 00:11:28.579
And I said "No no no no
your students are amazingly creative, and

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:29.949
I can demonstrate it."

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:31.959
So after running a two hour workshop with
them,

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:33.110
I gave them this challenge.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.259
And this is the design brief.

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:38.200
Essentially it says: Your job is to create
as much value

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.630
possible.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.750
Value measured in any way you want, in two
hours,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.759
starting with the contents of one trashcan.

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:48.769
You can pick whatever
trashcan you want.

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:53.440
So basically we're taking something that doesn't
even have zero value, it has negative value.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.920
Right, this is, basically
you pay people to take away the trash, so

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.970
we're going to take this.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.680
Take something that people thinks has no value,
and create as much value

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.899
as possible in two hours.

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:07.319
So to raise the stakes a little bit, I also
invited, um, my colleagues around the world

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:11.230
and the U.S. and Asia, Europe,
Latin America, to participate with their students

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.230
as well.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.660
So we now had thousands of students from around
the world

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.880
who are participating at the same time.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.400
Each one picking whatever
garbage can they wanted, and creating as much

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.029
value as possible in two hours.

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:25.660
They had, basically, some time to think about
it, but as soon as they opened up,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.370
you know, spilled out the garbage can, they
had two hours.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.350
Interesting thing happened that was unexpected.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.529
The students ended up spending
a bunch of time at the beginning, discussing,

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:40.050
and thinking about and debating
what value meant to them.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.691
They thought about happiness and health,
about community and knowledge, and of course

00:12:44.691 --> 00:12:46.490
financial security.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.970
And that ended up helping them really frame
the way they looked at whatever garbage they

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:51.970
had.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.699
So you wanna see what some of the students
did?

00:12:54.699 --> 00:12:55.699
Okay.

00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:56.699
So this is a team.

00:12:56.699 --> 00:12:57.699
The first one
is from Ecuador.

00:12:57.699 --> 00:13:00.670
And they picked a garbage can
I probably would not have picked.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.240
It's a garbage can filled with yard waste.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.709
All sorts of leaves,
Wow, what could you do with this?

00:13:06.709 --> 00:13:08.180
I mean this is, you know, this is compost.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.389
Well these students looked at it a different
way, and created a mural

00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:15.040
with all of this yard waste.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.130
Pretty cool?

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.130
Beautiful.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:23.050
There was a girl in Ireland who found
a garbage can filled with old socks that her

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.910
mom
was throwing out from her brother's sock drawer.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.980
All these holey old socks.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.350
Boy, I probably wouldn't have picked that
one either.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.990
She took them, cut them apart, sewed them
back together,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.380
and made a beautiful sweater.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.380
Pretty cool?

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.440
Wow, who thought of making a sweater out of
old socks?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.079
Pretty interesting idea.

00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:46.290
And then there was a team in Japan,
and this team went to the local laundromat

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.560
and they got the plastic bags and the hangers.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.550
And they realized there was a spot on the
campus

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.790
that was called "the dead zone."

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.980
It was part of a big grassy hill
that was all kind of damp because of the grass

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.029
was always just a little bit wet.

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:02.000
And people didn't want to sit there because
it was kind of uncomfortable.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.160
So they made these mats that you could sit
on,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.250
and you could roll them up and keep them in
your backpack.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.380
And whenever you wanted, you'd roll them out.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.250
But they didn't stop there,
they decided to start an entire community

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:17.261
around this, and they painted games
like Twister, on these mats so that when you

00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:22.130
go there
and you rolled out your, your mat and sat

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.540
on it,
you could play a game with someone else there.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.379
In fact, what ended up happening was the local
vendors started coming by,

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:31.870
and selling coffee and pastries and they ended
up creating an entire community

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.839
around this area that had really been a dead
zone.

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:39.730
So, we've talked about framing problems, connecting
and combining ideas,

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.000
challenging assumptions.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.250
But the fact is, your imagination is NOT enough.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.180
These are great places to start.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.480
You need to start with a base of knowledge.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.589
And if you do not have a base of knowledge,
then you don't have any tools

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:56.650
for your imagination.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.889
This is incredibly important.

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:02.300
Your knowledge
is a tool box for your imagination.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.019
The more you know, the more you have
to work with.

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:08.339
Now the interesting thing is, it doesn't have
to be something that is even

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:10.610
directly related to the problem you are trying
to solve.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.240
In fact, uh, at lunch
I had a very fascinating conversation with

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.709
some of the Googlers here,
about neurophysiology.

00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:20.500
And we ended up talking about really single
cell

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.889
neurophysiology and talking about all the
lessons you can learn

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:28.020
about organizations and social networking,
based on looking

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.620
at individual nerve cells.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.620
Pretty cool?

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.279
And I could talk about this
and share these ideas because I am a neurophysiologist.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.970
And the fact is,
you can bring knowledge from any field, but

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.709
you NEED something to work with.

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:42.709
So how do we get knowledge?

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:46.029
We get knowledge, of course, by going to lectures,
and reading books,

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.380
and by going to school.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.380
But you know what?

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.069
You also gain knowledge
by paying attention to the world.

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:55.839
By being more observant
than anyone else.

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:59.879
Because when you're paying attention,
you see problems that need to get solved,

00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:02.410
and you
often seen solutions that are right in front

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.410
of you.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.110
Now, most people don't do this.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.490
In fact, magicians know this.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.579
This is why magicians play with your attention.

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:14.120
They know that
a single, a hand gesture, or a little joke,

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.839
or pointing to someone
in the audience can totally distract you and

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:20.019
you don't see
what's going on over here.

00:16:20.019 --> 00:16:22.430
On the other side, are comedians.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.480
Like Jerry Seinfeld, okay, who draw your attention
to things.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.370
And they basically focus on things you didn't
pay attention to,

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:33.860
like "did you ever notice that, standing in
line, or buying shoes".

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:38.240
They pick something mundane, and it becomes
very funny with that

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.180
level of scrutiny.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.579
One of my favorite stories on how to increase
this comes from Stanford.

00:16:43.579 --> 00:16:48.339
One of my colleagues, Bob Segal,
who teaches classes all over the world.

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:52.490
He takes students to
Madagascar, and to the Galapagos, and to Papua

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.630
New Guinea
and he takes them on these excursions where

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.329
they are essentially naturalists.

00:16:57.329 --> 00:17:00.579
Well, he does a class called "The Stanford
Safari".

00:17:00.579 --> 00:17:04.800
In a two week immersion program, the students
act like naturalists

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800
at Stanford.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.300
Now, not only do they walk away learning everything,
from the pest controller and the organist,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.560
and the librarian,
and all the presidents, you know, they end

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.220
up getting this deep dive
into the university.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.200
They also walk away with an incredible
appreciation for what can happen when you

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.170
actually pay attention.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.480
So we have our imagination, we have our knowledge
base,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:34.100
but you also need the attitude that a problem
can get solved.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:40.050
If you do not have the confidence, the motivation,
the drive, to push through

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.400
when a problem seems daunting, you are not
going to gain the knowledge,

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.430
you are not going to [inaudible] engage your
imagination,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.670
and you're not going to come up with a solution.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.530
Most people in the world view themselves as
puzzle builders.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.140
That means they're going out and getting all
the pieces they need

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.270
and putting them together, to solve their
problem.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.070
But what's the problem with that?

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:06.280
The problem with that is, if you are missing
a piece what happens?

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.430
Oops, it can't be done.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.040
And another thing with a puzzle is, you're
basically solving a problem that's a known

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040
problem, right?

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.510
A known
problem with a known solution.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.350
But what if you're trying to solve problems
that don't have a known

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.350
solution?

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.320
And in fact, they're really challenging?

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.510
Instead you need to view yourself as a quilt
maker.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.000
Quilt makers are
people who take the resources that they have

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.371
available to them,
and they bring them to bear on the problem

00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:34.070
that they are trying to solve.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.020
And by looking at this image of this quilt,
I hope you realize

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.000
that the results are truly remarkable.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.140
Much more remarkable than putting together
a known puzzle.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.010
It's interesting though, because we grow up,
and we usually hear

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:52.060
Murphy's law, which says: If anything can
go wrong, what?

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.320
It will, right?

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.280
In fact, often people, I don't want to ask
how many of you have this,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.970
a poster in your office.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.750
But the idea is that this was a common thing,
that people had this poster that says if anything

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.630
can go wrong, it will.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.310
Well, there's a problem with that, if that's
what you believe, then you're

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.800
going to basically stop every time there's
a problem.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.130
Peter Diamandes, who runs Singularity University
and X PRIZE Foundation,

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.390
walked into one of his colleagues' offices,
and they had this sign up of Murphy's Law.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:23.650
He got so angry, he picked up a marking pen,
he went up and crossed out "it will" and wrote

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.700
"fix it!"

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:29.200
[crowd laughs]
If anything can go wrong, fix it.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.190
That is the mindset of a true innovator
and an entrepreneur, is someone who when they

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.390
see a daunting challenge says,
"I am going to do everything in my power to

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.910
fix it."

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:45.300
So, this is your internal combustion engine
for creativity:

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.072
your knowledge, your imagination, and your
attitude.

00:19:49.072 --> 00:19:51.920
Your knowledge is the toolbox for your imagination.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.620
Your imagination catalyzes the transformation
of your knowledge into new ideas.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.520
Your attitude is the spark that sets this
in motion.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.060
But you know what, you can be as creative
as you want, if you are not

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.820
in an environment that stimulates this, then
basically, you're hosed.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.550
And this is a problem in a lot of places,
because you get

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.290
really creative people who really want to
solve big problems,

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.590
and they are in environments that don't foster
it.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.710
So you have to look at other pieces of the
puzzle.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.130
The first thing you have to look at is the
habitat.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.750
Now you are incredibly fortunate here at Google
to have

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.200
this incredible habitat.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.491
You walk around, and I just want
to take pictures at every corner, because

00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:35.370
you walk into the,
into the whole facility of the Googleplex

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.790
and you say this
is a place that is designed for me to be creative.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.800
And this builds on the fact that when we're
kids,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.870
it looks more like kindergarten, right?

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:48.300
In fact the color scheme
matches that in kindergarten: primary colors,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.280
red, lots of,
lots of things that stimulate your imagination,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.510
lots of manipulatives, the space is very flexible.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.510
Really cool.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.170
When you go into kindergarten,
do you think that's a place you could be creative?...

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.170
...Absolutely!

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.390
But unfortunately, what happens is most of
us

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.940
graduate from kindergarten, and we end up
in classrooms

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.050
that look like this....

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.470
...Wow...this is really disappointing, and,
you know,

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.390
the rows of chairs are lined up in, in straight
lines.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.810
They're bolted to the floor.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.330
This is to make it easy
for the teacher.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.350
So that it, you know, things are easy to clean
up.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:25.140
Do you think it makes it appropriate for creativity?

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.000
No, and then we say,
you know, these kids, they're just not so

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.430
creative anymore.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:33.050
And then they get out of this; they graduate
from high school and college

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.780
and they go to work in environments like this.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:41.080
Wow...and then again people say
our people are not creative.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.530
Well, this is ridiculous.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.840
As I said, we're all creative
and we're waiting for this to be unleashed.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.840
I feel fortunate enough.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.790
to work at Stanford, and our spaces are very
conducive

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.790
to creativity.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.200
This is a picture of the D school at Stanford,
where we have, un, our ubiquitous red couches,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.500
the furniture all moves.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.780
It's not expensive.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.430
We have most of the furniture is from IKEA,
you know, uh,

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.770
foam cubes that can be moved around.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.870
Lots of whiteboards.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.100
You walk into the space,
and you say: WOW.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.430
This is a place where I could be creative.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.080
And you know, here are some pictures of my
class, it looks like a kindergarten,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.640
the students are working, actually on a pretty
complicated problem here, but they've

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.970
got the sort of material here, you know, Play
Doh and markers, and construction paper,

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:25.290
or they're working on the floor, working on
a simulation game, and you know,

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.250
AGAIN, it looks more like a kindergarten.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.590
And as we know, innovative companies
do this well.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.130
This is at IDEO, where when somebody leaves
to go on vacation,

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.140
it is very likely that when they come back,
their office has been transformed.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.840
You go on a road trip, and you come back and
your office is now in the back of a van.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.720
You go on your honeymoon in Paris, and you
come back and your office looks like the Eiffel

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.790
Tower.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.230
This is NOT frivolous.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:50.540
This is a messaging that every single thing
that you do is ripe for creativity.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.670
And here's a picture, right, this is Google
in Zurich.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.630
I don't know exactly what these
pods are for, but they're very, obviously,

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.880
you walk in and it feels very playful.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.890
Or at Pixar, where there's a slide going through
the middle of the building.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.760
So having an environment, a physical environment
is important.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.520
You also need to think about the rules, the
rewards, the constraints,

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.820
the incentives.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.960
All of those things come into play, and those
things all

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.350
to contribute to the types of habitats we
live in.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.640
But in addition,
we are really sensitive to the types of resources

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.200
we have available to us.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.460
Now, what are resources?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.790
Interesting thing is, here we are in Silicon
Valley,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.900
we think of resources, wow, we certainly have
a lot of money around, a lot of

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.750
money we can spend on projects.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.200
But resources come in so many different flavors.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.770
Think of natural resources, think of communities,
think of processes that we have in place.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.840
Each of these can be leveraged.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.540
And one of the problems is, people who don't
live here often think that they need to replicate

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.100
what we're
doing in Silicon Valley.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.050
They think that the only types of resources
that are valuable are the ones that are found

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.050
here.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.690
But other parts of the world have equally
valuable resources

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.580
that they need to learn to leverage.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.870
So besides the habitat and the resources,
it's incredibly important

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:11.330
to think about the culture, because the culture
in any organization

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:17.240
affects everything you do, you think, you
feel, you act, is affected

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.630
by the culture.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.930
Now one of the most important pieces of a
culture

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.500
is a willingness to experiment.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.040
To try lots of things,
and keep what works.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.980
And one of the problems is, that people often,
especially as an organization gets bigger

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.690
and bigger,
get more afraid of failing, and also get more

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.720
afraid of showing
things to something, someone who's more senior

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.740
until it's fully baked.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.730
So they spend a lot of time, a lot of money,
a lot of energy, a lot of resources

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.050
right, especially if you've got resources,
on making a project look finished.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.060
Well, there's a huge problem with this.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.340
The problem is, you might have committed to
something

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.210
that's a bad idea, and now, you've put bunch
of time,

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.240
money and energy into this, and in fact, when
you show something

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.090
to someone and it looks finished, they are
much less likely

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.970
to give you feedback.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.130
One of my favorite examples of a way to do
this well

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.130
comes from IDEO.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.670
I'm going to show you a video clip,
of, uh, came from one of their projects, one

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.080
of their recent projects.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.770
They were designing a new iPhone app called
"Monster Maker",

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.900
in their toy group.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.850
And the idea was, uh, is a little game
and they wanted to see if the concept was

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:21.930
going to work.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:27.330
So this is the prototype that they did to
test the concept.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.880
I want you to tell me how much money they
spent,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.530
how much time it took, how much engineering
talent,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.530
and whether this was effective.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.530
&gt;&gt;[video clip]
&gt;&gt; woman: cue music [techno music starts]

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:35.530
So these
are possible dance moves for Monster Maker.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:41.230
So music starts,
and I'm the player so I come in and I touch

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.690
the monster
and he gives me a special dance move, ha ha

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:51.240
, and I go and touch again,
and he does a different one.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.340
And it can go for as long as I want.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:01.790
Because he has a few signature moves.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.680
When I've had enough,
when I'm done dancing I touch the back button,

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.810
he pauses
and the music stops.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:08.870
[techno music ends].

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.650
Monster Maker
[laughter on video]

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.650
&gt;&gt;man: Cool!

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:12.650
[More laughter]
[inaudible]

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.200
&gt;&gt;man: Whoa!
[laugher on video]

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200
[video ends]

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.390
&gt;&gt;Tina: So it's kind of funny isn't it, but
how much time

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.490
did it take to do?

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.110
Like nothing right?

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.580
Maybe an half an hour to make this.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.580
Okay?

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.210
How much money did it cost to make this?

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.430
Practically nothing, right?

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.820
How much engineering talent did it require?

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.820
Nothing.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.020
How effective was it in testing the idea?

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.020
Fabulous.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.640
This is the attitude you need, to be willing
to try lots of things,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.580
do rapid prototypes and get the feedback.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.510
One of the problems we have also, about trying
lots of things,

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.870
is we feel as though, if it doesn't work out
well, that it's failure.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.010
And, you know, we talk a lot about Silicon
Valley and about

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.080
our comfort with failure.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.120
But I really want to reframe
the way we think about that.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.200
As a scientist, when I do an experiment that
doesn't turn out

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.370
as I expected, I don't call that a failure.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.770
I call it data.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.870
This is really important.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.180
Data is information.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.660
And we love
data.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.580
Data tells you about interesting things.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.770
In fact,
some of the most incredible discoveries in

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.800
science
came from experiments that were failed, that

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.540
ended up with results
that were surprising.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.920
And so the fact is, you need
to look at the same sort of surprising results

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.050
in the same way.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.140
As, Wow, this didn't work, what does that
tell us about our user?

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.470
What does that tell us about our customer?

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.520
What does that tell
us about whatever we're looking at?

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.550
Because that's incredibly
useful information.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.010
The other thing that's really important to
keep in mind is

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.390
that culture is way beyond, way beyond just
experimenting.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:48.380
The culture is like the background music of
an organization.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.420
Now think about it, if you watch a movie,
the background music

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.640
is an incredibly powerful character in that
movie.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.480
When you watch a movie and something daunting
is going to happen,

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.070
the music tells you.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.510
When something wonderful is going to happen,
the music tells you.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:13.880
The music is the background soundtrack
of any company, and we really need to keep

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.290
that in mind.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:20.440
Both in a, because it affects every single
thing we do.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.210
So this is now the external engine for creativity,
right?

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.510
The resources, habitat, and culture.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.750
But let me show you
how they all fit together.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.340
Because you might think,
oh Gee, that's kind of interesting, you made

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.490
this
little pretty picture with this Mobius with

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.770
the inside and the outside.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.750
But there's actually a reason it's all braided
together.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.470
Because the inside and the outside are there,
but the inside and the outside

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.310
dramatically affect each other.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.910
Let me show you how.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.799
You could look at imagination and habitat.

00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:58.160
Your habitat is the external manifestation
of your imagination.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.840
If you don't imagine it; you can't build it.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.580
And also, the habitats
you build, directly affect the way you think,

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.130
the way you feel,
the way you act.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.890
Does that make sense?

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.700
So essentially,
we need to think, especially as we're managers

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.170
of organizations,
what kind of habitat am I building?

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.960
Because the habitat I build
will affect the way the people I work with

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.049
think and feel, and act.

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:29.450
In addition, knowledge and resources are parallel.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:34.090
Because the more
you know, the more resources you can unlock.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:38.780
And the types of resources
you have, determines what you know.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.250
Think about it.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.850
If there are lots
of fish in our environment, it's likely I'm

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:44.390
going to know something
about fishing.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.070
And the more I know about fishing, the more
fish

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.760
I will catch.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.400
The more venture capitalists there are
in my community, the more likely it is I'm

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.670
going to know about
venture capital.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.740
The more venture capitalists, the more I know
about venture capital,

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.670
the more likely it is is I'm going to get
funding.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:59.670
Make sense?

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.910
So the fact is resources, and um, and knowledge
are directly related.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.930
In addition, attitude and culture are parallel.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.740
And this should seem
obvious, right?

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.560
The culture is the collective attitudes of
the individual.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.900
And of course, the culture affects how each
of us feels.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:23.330
So let's look at a story how each of these
things works together.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.940
I was just recently, in February, in northern
Thailand.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.330
And I met
this wonderful woman, her name is Lek.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.250
And she grew up in a very
poor family up near Chiang Mai.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.850
And her family had an elephant.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.580
The elephant was part of her family, and she
loved this elephant.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.280
She ended up learning, as she got older, that
elephants in Thailand

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.470
are treated very very poorly.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:48.940
Um, they're in the logging industry,
where they're stepping on mines and getting

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.260
horribly hurt.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.690
They're abused by tourists, where they're
completely overworked,

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.040
and and really to total exhaustion.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.530
They're in circuses where they're
they're basically treated terribly.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.320
She decided she had to do something
about this.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.630
So let's look at this.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:08.050
She started with the motivation,
the drive, the commitment to do something

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.630
to help these elephants.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.110
She learned as much as she could about them.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.660
She gained her base
of knowledge.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.660
Okay?

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.790
She learned that there are only 500 elephants
left

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.880
in captivity.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.340
That thousands of them are...no that are left
in the wild

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.900
and that thousands of them are in captivity.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.050
She figured she needed
to do something.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.780
So she leveraged the resources that she had
available,

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.950
which were actually the sick and hurt elephants,
to build a habitat,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.440
which was an elephant nature preserve.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.040
And she invites people
to come there as volunteers, and to work there,

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.720
and people
to come and visit any day.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.860
And so I went there
with some of my colleagues.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.160
I was totally transformed
by this experience.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.120
I was one of these tourists who would have
come in and said "oh let me go ride an elephant."

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.170
But after spending a day there, I became as
passionate as anyone else

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:58.770
who was there that I needed to do something
to help save these elephants,

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.760
and to help with their plight.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.460
And this is the point...you can start anywhere
on this innovation engine.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:10.400
This Mobius strip is shaped like this because
everything is intertwined.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.560
You can start by creating a habitat, that
stimulates other's imaginations.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.130
You can start by getting the knowledge that
is going to fuel your imagination.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.700
And you certainly can start with the attitude
that you want to start a problem,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.600
solve a problem, and then do everything you
can to make it happen.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.470
The fact is we each have the keys to this
innovation engine.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.490
It's up to us to turn them.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.330
Thank you very much.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.710
[applause]

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:45.670
So I would be delighted, this is just sort
of a summary here,

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.710
for all this, but I would be delighted to
answer any questions.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.250
You're gonna ask a question?

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.250
Perfect.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.990
&gt;&gt; male #1: I have a habit of asking the first
question.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.990
&gt;&gt;Tina: Good.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.140
Great!
&gt;&gt; male #1: Um, this isn't

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.330
so much a question as I want to give a pointer
to something

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:05.130
that you said that resonated very well, for
uh, a bunch of us here.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.780
Your IDEO prototype.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:11.400
um there was a small team here, Alberto Savoya,
and Steven Eueller,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.340
&gt;&gt;Tina: sure
&gt;&gt; male #1: who, who were pushing this notion

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.340
of pretotyping.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.820
&gt;&gt;Tina: yeah
&gt;&gt;male #1: It resonated perfectly, and I think

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:24.020
that uh, I guess it's a sideways
plug, if, if ya, if people in the audience

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.960
haven't seen Alberto's video.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.170
Pretotyping.org.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:31.200
Um, I think it resonates very well with that
specific example.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.200
&gt;&gt;Tina: Exactly.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.430
In fact, I know him and really am a huge fan
of his work,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.890
and he's coming to run a workshop in MY creativity
class on pretotyping, so.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.060
It's all great.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.560
thank you very much.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.840
Any other questions?

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.480
Comments?

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.130
Thoughts?

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.630
So let me ask you, while you're thinking about
any questions you might have.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.030
What part of this, is anything surprising
here?

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.210
What was the most surprising?

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.390
What was the most interesting?

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.790
What was the most unusual?

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.140
What might be
the most valuable piece of this?

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.070
Something that might be actionable for you?

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.070
Anyone?

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.070
&gt;&gt; male #2: habitat

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.070
&gt;&gt;Tina: Habitat.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:07.510
So say more about that.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:15.099
&gt;&gt; male #2: [inaudible]

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:21.700
&gt;&gt;Tina: Right, that the habitat is really
important.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.700
Yes.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.700
Great.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:27.510
So what are you, is there anything you'll
do differently in the habitats

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.510
that you're in?

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.690
&gt;&gt;male #2: So I'm in a really boring office,
and so I'll be fixing that.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.369
&gt;&gt;Tina: [chuckles] Oh great.

00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:34.369
Terrific!

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:35.369
Super.

00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:36.669
Anyone else, any other thoughts about?

00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:37.669
Yes.

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:40.089
&gt;&gt; male #3 : Hi, um, thank you for the presentation.

00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:43.559
I just kind of had a cur-, a question
about the kind of the culture, because I know

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:48.889
you went into kind of the community in Japan,
and they were saying how people, that students

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.159
there weren't as creative.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:54.220
So I want to maybe hear
just a few more of your thoughts on the culture

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.350
piece of all of this.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.369
&gt;&gt;Tina: Yea, right.

00:34:56.369 --> 00:34:57.369
Happy to.

00:34:57.369 --> 00:35:00.339
So here's the story behind, the back story
behind that

00:35:00.339 --> 00:35:05.000
My last book, "What I Wish I Knew When I Was
Twenty", um, has been relatively popular here

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.509
in the U.S. but it became totally crazy popular
in Asia, especially in Japan, and so they

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:17.099
asked me to do a TV series for Japan on what
was happening in my class.

00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:21.960
So, we, um, did
an eight part series at HK from Japan, did

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.110
an eight part TV series on my creativity class.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.289
And it showed eight weeks in a row in Japan.

00:35:27.289 --> 00:35:30.510
And everyone was very excited about this,
but said "You know what, this would never

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.510
work here."

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.950
And I said "That's just not true."

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.460
And they said "Please come and prove it."

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.600
So I ended up going, and I worked with some
students

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:42.080
at Osaka University, and could not have been
anymore impressed.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.599
The students walked out
at the end saying, "I had no idea I was this

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:46.599
creative."

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:50.410
And the fact is, they had the knowledge,
they had the imagination, they certainly had

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:54.560
the attitude, but they needed to be
in an environment that allowed them to unleash

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.140
their creativity.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.720
And I find that so true.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.410
What people come here to Google, and they
walk in the door,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.080
they don't even have to know what their job
is, right?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.019
You can hire people
without them knowing what job they're going

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:08.910
to do, and say "I want to work here."

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.700
Why?

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.250
They walk in and they say this is a habitat
where I know I can really

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.250
stretch my imagination.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.410
And I think it is something people are hungry
for.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.609
&gt;&gt; male #4: [clears throat] Hey, this is great,
I feel like

00:36:21.609 --> 00:36:24.410
one of the challenges for some of the young
people in this room... and we probably have,

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.700
uh,
probably everyone in the room, we probably

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.700
have to read your book.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.040
Um I feel like I have
a pretty good grasp of what you need to do

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.490
and the problem is just time.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:36.471
I work about
60 hours a week, and then beyond that I want

00:36:36.471 --> 00:36:38.950
to watch TV and hang out with my girlfriend.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:44.059
And so just finding time to be more creative,
and foster all of this.

00:36:44.059 --> 00:36:45.369
&gt;&gt;Tina: I love that you asked that question.

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:48.750
I work probably the same number of hours,
okay?

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.509
It's, it's not about time, it's about an attitude.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:55.859
If you look at the things that you're doing,
at every problem as an opportunity for creative

00:36:55.859 --> 00:37:00.039
solution, then you actually find
that there are opportunities to bake this

00:37:00.039 --> 00:37:02.259
into your life in everything you're already
doing.

00:37:02.259 --> 00:37:07.450
So I invite you to think that way...Just try
it because, um, uh, even if it's walking to

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:08.450
this room.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.130
So I have a whole chapter about observation,
and about paying attention.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.140
Um, even while
you're sitting here looking around the room

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.290
to train yourself to look at things that
other people don't notice, right?

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:22.000
How high are the ceiling, what are the floors
made of, who's sitting here?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.210
Or what's going on?

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:27.050
Even in those little downtime moments, to
force yourself think in a slightly

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.040
different way it really starts unlocking these
opportunities.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.059
So thank you.

00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:32.059
yeah?

00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:36.020
&gt;&gt; male #5: I am on the sales team, and point
about your

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.700
presentation that really stuck with me was
when you said that we all need

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.509
a base of knowledge in order to be imaginative.

00:37:40.509 --> 00:37:43.089
And I think it's important
to say that that base of knowledge we should

00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:44.859
have should be from all areas,
as you pointed out.

00:37:44.859 --> 00:37:46.380
It could be from anywhere.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.490
Just one example I wanted to share
is, I don't watch TV, I don't have cable,

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:50.720
like I think a lot of it is a bunch of junk.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.099
But when I go home, and I visit my family,
they like to watch TV so I'll sit

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:55.660
there and watch it with them.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.150
Well, one day I watched and I saw a commercial
for

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.890
the Dominoes Pizza Tracker.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.720
I mean for some reason, that inspire, that
gave

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.040
me an idea of a new way to track ads.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.750
Like customers calling us, they give us
issue, we resolve it secrecy and then we tell

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:09.750
them when we're done.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.730
For some reason,
that commercial taught me "oh..that's what

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.730
customers care about.."

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.119
We should tell them
every stage of the process.

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:15.920
Like they care about their pizza, I'm sure
they

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.160
care about these expensive ads that we're
supposed to run.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.359
So if I had
not been exposed to knowledge that I was for

00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:24.369
so long ignoring,
because I don't like to watch TV, that just

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:26.789
one idea that came to me
in a totally unexpected place.

00:38:26.789 --> 00:38:27.789
&gt;&gt;Tina: Yeah.

00:38:27.789 --> 00:38:28.789
And in fact, it happens everywhere.

00:38:28.789 --> 00:38:31.589
Let me give you another
example that is sort of related to Google.

00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:36.000
Um, there's a fellow, in fact, a story
I told in my book, "Ingenious" about him because

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.109
it totally blew my mind in so many respects.

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:42.539
His name is David Friedberg, and he used to
work at Google.

00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:46.089
And he lived up in the city
and he would drive to Google every day, and

00:38:46.089 --> 00:38:50.880
every day he drove to Google he would
pass this bicycle shack, that was, you know,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.210
bike rental place, near the train station.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:58.569
And he would notice that on days when it was
raining, guess what, they were closed.

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:02.809
And every time he'd go by, he'd go "oh they're
open today" "They're closed today."

00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:07.250
Wow, isn't it interesting that their business
is so dependent on the weather.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.400
He started thinking: what other business are
affected by the weather?

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.019
And started thinking, of course, of ski resorts,
or movie theaters, or farmers.

00:39:16.019 --> 00:39:19.960
Um, all sorts of businesses that are affected,
wedding planners, okay?

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:25.970
He decided to start a company that basically
sells weather insurance

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.200
to people who need it.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.230
In a completely different way, like farmers
get crop insurance, so, but instead of that

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.930
they can just track the weather
you get paid if it rains.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.099
Okay, so you can basically figure it out.

00:39:38.099 --> 00:39:39.530
He,
you know what the thing is, it first of all

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:44.010
started with him observing
something probably other people didn't pay

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.010
attention to.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:48.819
Just the bicycle shack
on the way to work that turned into a whole

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:49.819
business.

00:39:49.819 --> 00:39:53.920
The other thing is,
all the people in the company knew nothing

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.910
about weather, knew nothing
about agriculture, but they brought in people

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:02.670
who were neurophysiologists,
who knew about, you know, dynamic models.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:06.369
People who are astrophysicists,
who knew how to analyze big data.

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:11.119
Of course, over time, they're learning about
meteorology; they're learning about agriculture,

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.890
which they'll take to
the next venture.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:17.680
But essentially they came with basic knowledge
about, completely different fields, brought

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.670
them to bear on creating
a brand new and quite successful venture.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.950
Well, I just want to thank you so much.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.549
It is a huge honor to be here.

00:40:25.549 --> 00:40:26.549
Thank you so much.

00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:26.550
[applause]
