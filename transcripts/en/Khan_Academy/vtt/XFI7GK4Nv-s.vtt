00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.202
- Let's say that I have a circle.

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:05.667
My best attempt to draw a
reasonably perfect circle.

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:09.700
So, there you go, not too
bad, it's a little bit

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.366
of a hairy circle but you get the idea.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:16.067
So, this is a circle, this
is the center of the circle,

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:19.267
and let's say that I have
an arc along this circle.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:21.900
So, I'll do the arc in green.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.700
So, I have an arc that
is part of the circle,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.800
and it subtends an
angle, so that's my arc.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.400
Right over there, and
it subtends an angle,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.068
and the angle that it subtends,
so what I mean subtends,

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:40.033
you take each of the endpoints of the arc,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.733
go to the center of the circle,

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:47.733
go to the center of the
circle just like this,

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:53.966
and so it subtends angle
theta, right over here,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.033
so it subtends angle theta,
and let's say that we know

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:02.033
that angle theta is equal to two radians.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:06.300
So my question to you is what fraction

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.300
of the entire circumference
is this green arc?

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:16.333
What fraction of the entire
circumference is this green arc?

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:21.000
And like always, pause the
video, and give it a go.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
(laughs) All right, so let's
think through it a little bit.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.067
So, you might say well how do I know that,

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.300
I don't know what the
radius of this thing is,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.166
I don't, how do I think through this?

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:36.100
And we just have to remind
ourselves what radians mean,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.633
what radians mean.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:42.133
If an arc subtends the
angle of two radians,

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:47.133
that means that the arc itself
is two "radiuseseses" long.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.066
(laughs) So, this right over here,

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.766
let me make this a
little clearer, so this,

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:56.533
if the radius is r, if this radius is,

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.866
I already used that
color, if this radius...

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.293
I have trouble switching
colors (laughs) all right.

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:05.133
If this radius is length r,

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:09.600
then the length, if this
angle is two radians,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.833
then the arc that
subtends it is going to be

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:17.600
two radiuses long, so this
length right over here,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.333
is two radiuses.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:23.700
Now, what fraction of the
entire circumference is that?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.134
Well, the entire circumference, we know,

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:27.400
we know this from basic geometry,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.233
the entire circumference
is two pi times the radius,

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.800
or you can say it's two pi
radii, two pi "radiuseses",

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.700
(laughs) two pi radii is
the correct way to say it.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.233
So, what fraction is it?

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:41.800
It's two radii, it's two radii,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.800
over two pi radii, over two pi radii,

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:51.666
twos cancel out, rs cancel
out, and so it is one "pith",

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:53.172
(laughs) I guess you could say,

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:57.172
it is one over pi of
the total circumference.
