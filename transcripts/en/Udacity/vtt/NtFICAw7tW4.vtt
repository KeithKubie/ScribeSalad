00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:03.820
What's an example of a data visualization that you've seen that

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.020
tells a subjective story, rather than an objective one?

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.560
&gt;&gt; There's a bunch.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.680
Probably the most well known one that I would fit in that category,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.555
are Nicholas Felton's annual reports.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:13.060
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.372
&gt;&gt; They're super beautiful.

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:18.330
And, you know, I guess you could argue about their objectivity.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
But they're, they're very much personal, extremely personal information.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.470
They're just personal, they're personal annual reports.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.160
So, hard to describe them.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.310
But if you go look at them you'll, you'll see what I mean.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.020
I think in that vein,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.800
there's been a lot more kind of personal data reporting, which is interesting.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.930
He sort of set the standard with these annual reports.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.994
But, there are more and more people doing kind of personal data tracking.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:48.270
And then doing interesting visual things with that data.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.500
So there's a new project, I'm going to forget the guy's name who made it,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.700
but I think the website is aprilzero.com.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.550
And it's this really, really in-depth sort of personal data reporting platform.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.209
And the interface is really beautiful.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.070
I'm not sure what I can kind of learn from it.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.850
But just aesthetically, it's like quite stunning.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.586
And you can see you know, his, his travel information.

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:17.715
And sort of, how much he's working and what his calendar schedule is.

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:20.520
And I think you see he has, you know, Fitbit, or

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.951
whatever these different like, wearable technologies.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:30.460
And so those pieces of information are reporting in there too.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.030
I think, you know, it's really interesting, this kind of stuff.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.615
because it, it's not, I don't know if that makes it subjective or objective.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.360
But it's, it's very personal.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.150
So in that sense, it's sort of just taking the view of that one,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.600
that one person or that one experience
