00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.610
Let's,
at the Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 1>Some of the more fascinating pieces of evidence in South America have come out</v>

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:11.661
recently about these channels and pathways that they've found in the Amazon that

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.070
could not have been created any other way.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.540
But by humans creating irrigation,
humans creating the,

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.480
like it appears like grids,
like a city grid,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.350
<v 0>definitely the Amazon is a colossal mystery and a,</v>

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.970
it's one of the subjects that I explore in depth in America before.
First of all,

9
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.840
to give some basic figures,
the Amazon basin is huge.

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.870
The Amazon Basin is 7 million square kilometers in area.

11
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.160
Um,
and within it five and a half million square kilometers,
uh,

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.000
remains almost entirely unstudied by archeologists.

13
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.240
And that's the five and a half million square kilometers that is still covered

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.360
by dense rain forest.
And to put that into perspective,

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.500
five and a half million square kilometers is the size of the entire Indian

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.820
subcontinent.
So it's like saying we've done world archeology,

17
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:07.080
but we've just ignored India.
You know,
we've done weld archeology,

18
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.380
but we've just ignored the Amazon is the same as the same Margaret five and a

19
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.290
half million square kilometers.
The view was,
again,
there was a dogma,

20
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.610
there was a preconception,
human beings couldn't have flourished in the Amazon.

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.540
It's a,
it's not a resource rich area.
The soils are poor.
Um,

22
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.730
it's a difficult area challenging to get to very far from the Bering straits.

23
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.800
So the view was that humans hadn't entered the Amazon until about a thousand

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.790
years ago.
And then gradually,
little by little,
that view has begun to change.

25
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.020
And it's begun to change because of the tragic clearances of the Amazon,

26
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:44.580
because the Amazon rainforest is literally being cut down and turned into soya

27
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.160
bean farms and a and cattle ranchers.

28
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:51.600
And in that cutting down process has emerged things that shouldn't be there at

29
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.580
all.
Uh,
for example,

30
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:58.080
evidence that large cities flourished in the Amazon enormous cities which were

31
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:59.760
larger than the,

32
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.770
there was a Spanish explorer who went down the Amazon River system in 1541 1542,

33
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:09.210
he was the first European to cross the entire length of South America from west

34
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:14.190
to east along the Amazon.
He reported seeing incredible cities,

35
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:19.080
advanced arts and crafts.
Millions of people are thriving culture.
Uh,

36
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.050
and a hundred years later when other Europeans got into the Amazon,

37
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:25.470
they couldn't find these cities.
So they said,
oh,
Francisco Oriana,

38
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:28.620
that was his name,
made it all up.
It was just a,
it was just a fantasy.

39
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.430
And then in the last decade,
as the clearances of the Amazon have proceeded,

40
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:34.710
we've begun to see the traces of those cities.

41
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.180
What happened was that the Spaniards brought small pox into the Amazon.

42
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.100
Smallpox devastated the local population because there was no immunity to it.

43
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.240
There was a massive die off.
The cities were deserted within a 50 years.

44
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.220
They were completely overgrown by the jungle.

45
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.910
And that's why they were not seen by the explorers who came in a hundred years

46
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.490
later.
But now the youngest being cleared,
those cities are emerging.

47
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:57.610
And we can say that,
uh,

48
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.320
a city like London had a population of roughly 50,000 in the 16th century.

49
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.480
There were cities of that size all over the Amazon.

50
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.310
Huge numbers of them and a possible total population of the ams.

51
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:13.150
And that exceeded 20 million people.
Yes,
20 billion.

52
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.480
This is the latest evidence from the Amazon.
And then you ask yourself,

53
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:20.380
how did they do that?
How did they feed 20 million people in the Amazon?

54
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.140
Because it's a fact.
Rainforest soils are poor.

55
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.560
It's one of the reasons these soya bean farms are really stupid idea because

56
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.850
once you clear the rainforest,

57
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.260
the land is largely unfair tile and you can't grow stuff on it for very long.

58
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.820
So how did they feed all these people?

59
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.090
The answer was they invented a soil and that's how oil has a name.

60
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:40.780
It's called Tara Prater.

61
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.010
Archeologists refer to it as Amazonian dark earths or Amazonian black earth.

62
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.790
It's a manmade soil.
It's thousands of years old.

63
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.390
It's full of microbes that are not found in adjoining soil.

64
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.180
It's based around bio char.
Uh,

65
00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.040
and you can take a handful of 8,000 year old terror operator and you can add it

66
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:03.850
to barren soil and that soil will instantly become fertile.

67
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.800
It's highly sought after in the Amazon.

68
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:09.070
And it explains how they fed these people.
There was science in the Amazon,

69
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.860
they create this,
well,
this is something that's not understood.

70
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:15.520
It's still not understood by soul experts to this day is to how that was done.

71
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:20.500
But it's one of many intriguing evidences,
pieces of evidence of much higher,
uh,

72
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.970
development in the Amazon that it has been given credit for and have a kind of

73
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.810
Science Indiana.
Jamie's got an image of it up there.
So this is a,
this is Tara.

74
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.030
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Exactly.
And so was that done by burns?
These controlled burns?

75
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.920
They did.
They,
one way that it was achieved was,
uh,

76
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.770
was to do wet burning,
um,
of middens.
They would be,

77
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.860
they would be burned and smolder they wouldn't burn fiercely,

78
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:48.610
which just produces charcoal.
They would,
they would burn and smolder.
Um,
and,

79
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.000
and that by what is called bio char would result.

80
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.650
And that's part of the fertility of the soil.

81
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:56.800
But the mystery is the microbial content of this soil,

82
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.160
which is completely different from the microbes in neighboring soils.

83
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:04.570
And that remains unexplained.
So do they,
what are the theories?
Composting,

84
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.990
some sort of advanced compost as some sort of some sort of advanced composting.

85
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:08.890
But again,

86
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.450
what has not been explained is the Ma is the microbial content of these soils.

87
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:17.530
So they're there,
first of all,
is an issue of how,
uh,
two things,

88
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.180
how large populations get fed in the Amazon and evidence that there was a

89
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:26.470
culture in the Amazon that was capable of manipulating the environment in such a

90
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.900
way that it could support large populations with the invention of terra prater.

91
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.750
Secondly,
new evidence previously not recognize the Amazon is basically a garden.

92
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.170
The Amazon is a manmade rainforest.
Uh,

93
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.550
there are certain trees like Brazil nut trees or the ice cream bean tree,

94
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.440
which are food crops,
which are very,
very valuable.
And they dominate the,

95
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:50.490
uh,
the,
the tree regime in,
in the Amazon.
They,
what's,

96
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.230
what's referred to as hyper dominant species.
In other words,

97
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:57.160
people living in the Amazon over thousands of years selected certain,

98
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.750
which they then cultivated and grew.
So the whole thing is not simply a wild,

99
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:03.800
pristine rainforest.

100
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.300
It's a very ancient manmade environment and emerging from that man made

101
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:12.110
environment as well as evidence of large cities,
large populations,

102
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.350
and this mysterious dark earth are huge geometrical structures.

103
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.441
Um,
and again,
I,

104
00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:24.441
I go into this at length in America before because I love this mystery we have

105
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.150
in the UK structures that are called hinges.
Um,
I,

106
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.750
I live in the city of bath and about 30 miles away there's a beautiful site

107
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.680
called Avery and another more famous site called Stonehenge.

108
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.360
And what a Henge is,

109
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.050
is a ditch which has been dug deep and then an embankment has been pushed up

110
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.060
outside the ditch.
When people first saw these structures,

111
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:49.190
they wondered if they'd been built for defense,

112
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.890
but then it became obvious they hadn't been built for defense.

113
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:56.780
Because if you want to create a moat,
you put it outside your embankment,

114
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.500
not insight you're embankment.
So an a Henge is an earth work,

115
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.730
which consists of a deep moat with a large embankment outside it that it can be

116
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:08.270
circular,
it can be square,
and in the UK and other parts of Europe,

117
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:12.140
it often contains stone circles,
megalithic stone circles as well.

118
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:14.180
But the hinge itself is entirely in earthwork.

119
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.540
What we find in the Amazon are thousands of hinges that are now beginning to

120
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:23.210
emerge from the cleared areas of the jungle and others that have been identified

121
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:27.110
for the first time with Lidar.
Lidar technology is being employed in the Amazon.

122
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:30.680
It's nondestructive.
You can see what's under the trees.
What does lidar,

123
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.170
light imaging and detective radar,

124
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.410
they bounce laser beams down into the jungle as a whole pattern of them.

125
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:39.500
You need helicopters and they,
but it doesn't damage the rain forest.

126
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.420
And you can strip away and see what's,
see what's there.
If I'm,

127
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.000
if this is too much about their diversion.

128
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:48.290
Let me give you the example of Guatemala.
Guatemala is a small country,

129
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.520
if I remember correctly.

130
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:53.570
It's not much more than a hundred thousand square kilometers in size.
Um,

131
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.540
it is filled with intriguing Mayan ruins.

132
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.820
Everybody has heard of a t Carl.

133
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.960
What archaeologists didn't know was that literally within walking distance of

134
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.970
decal surrounding that whole area where more than 60,000 structures that they

135
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:12.860
hadn't identified and these have all been identified by lidar in a country

136
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:15.080
that's just a hundred thousand kilometers in area.

137
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.820
So you have to ask yourself in that five and a half million square kilometers of

138
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:23.330
the Amazon,
if lidar technology could be applied comprehensively,

139
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.090
what would we find beneath there?

140
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.130
And the evidence already is extremely tempting and extremely tantalizing.

141
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:35.270
And I'm intrigued by these huge geometrical figures,
uh,

142
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:39.620
which involve primarily a circles and squares.

143
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.880
And they are classic hinges in the sense that they are deep ditches surrounded

144
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:48.620
by huge embankments.
They're extremely geometrical.
For example,

145
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:53.390
you can find an octagon surrounding a square at a place called Jack Ozar in the

146
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:57.900
Amazon.
You can find a perfectly in closing a circle.

147
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.280
Now that is an exercise called squaring the circle that are archaea are our

148
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.290
academics have given to the Greeks.

149
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.200
They said the Greeks were the first person people who perform that exercise.

150
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.010
But now we find in dated sites in the Amazon that this was being done in the

151
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.450
Amazon long before the Greeks.
What are the dates at?

152
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.160
The earliest dates that have been found in these sites now are about three and a

153
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.800
half thousand years old,
about three and a half thousand years old.

154
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.670
But the evidence is that the sites have been constantly remade and what

155
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.880
intrigues me is what remains in that five and a half million square kilometers

156
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.920
that has not been investigated yet.
We are just,

157
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.110
I think looking at the edges of a mystery,

158
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.330
the archeologists involved to a mainly from Finland and also from Brazil feel

159
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:40.170
the same.
They're,

160
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:43.290
their estimate is that there are thousands of these structures remaining in the

161
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.760
jungle and they're open as to how old they may ultimately prove to be.

162
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.620
The investigation needs to be done.

163
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:54.621
But what's fascinating about them is this very powerful geometry and astronomy.

164
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.800
So a number of the sites are perfectly aligned to true north,
true south,

165
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.740
true east and true West.
I'm not talking about magnetic north,

166
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:04.500
I'm talking about true,
astronomical north to do that.

167
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:07.320
There's only one way to do it.
And that's with,
uh,
with astronomy.

168
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:09.960
So that tells us that astronomers were at work in the Amazon.

169
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.470
The geometry is very complex and very precise.

170
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:16.580
That tells us that people with geometrical skills,
we're working the Amazon.

171
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.680
And thirdly,
the scale of the sites of hundreds of meters,

172
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.680
gigantic earthworks on the scale of hundreds of meters,
uh,

173
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.630
tells us that this was highly organized.

174
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.830
A project that was undertaken on a very large scale or very large number of

175
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:33.360
people.
It's a wonderful mystery and,
and deserves much further,

176
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.810
much further attention.
And I'm,
I'm,
yeah,
that's Giacosa exactly.

177
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.580
The square squaring the circle.

178
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.560
So you can see the outside embankment and then inside it is the square ditch.

179
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.850
And then there's another embankment inside that and a circle and a circle inside

180
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.870
that made a road right through the [inaudible] road.
Yeah.
You know,
because,

181
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:54.720
because there's no respect for,
there's no respect for the ancient,

182
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:58.980
for the ancient world,
unfortunately.
And there's another one look at that.
Wow,

183
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.700
that's incredible.
That thousands of the sound,

184
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.410
the stuff that they found in the Amazon,

185
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:08.310
what imaging technology where they're using to find all.
Initially,

186
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.870
initially it was entirely found because areas of the rainforest had been
cleared.

187
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.840
Economic interests said,
we want to make a cattle ranch here,

188
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.730
or we want to make a soy bean farm here.

189
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:21.380
So we're just gonna clear the rainforest.
In the process of clearing the forest,

190
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.750
they start discovering these earthworks that had previously been completely

191
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:28.970
overgrown by the jungle.
Then the next step was to say,
uh,

192
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.010
what can we,
what can we do to find out more about this?

193
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.680
Obviously they don't want to destroy more jungle.

194
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.280
And Luckily we have a technology which is,
which is Lidar,
as I mentioned,

195
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:42.390
which uses radar and using lidar.
They've been identified,

196
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.980
able to identify many more of these sites and then to get to the sites without

197
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:51.780
destroying the jungle and to begin excavations on them and to find that they go

198
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:55.030
back in the cases of the ones that had been explored so far,

199
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.680
at least 3000 years.
Uh,
this is an intriguing development,

200
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:02.650
completely unexplained in our understanding of the Amazon.

201
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:07.000
And what it suggests is a heritage of extremely ancient knowledge.

202
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:08.920
You don't wake up one morning and,
you know,

203
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:13.720
create a perfectly geometrical square or circular earthwork that's perfectly

204
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:17.050
aligned to true north,
south,
east,
and West on an enormous scale.

205
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.720
There has to be a background to that.
That'd be a reason for doing it.

206
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:22.630
And the evidence is none of these sites were lived in.
There's no habitation,

207
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.410
a refuse founded in them whatsoever.
They were,
they,

208
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.600
we don't know what they were used for.
I make the case,
uh,

209
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.510
in America before that they're connected to a system of ideas,

210
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.030
which is found all around the world,
which,

211
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.270
which is to do with death and the afterlife,

212
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:42.130
destiny of the soul.
