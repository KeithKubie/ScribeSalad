00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:08.630
10,000 years ago,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.018
a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa.

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:13.905
The virus spread through the air,

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:15.365
attacking the skin cells,

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:16.298
bone marrow,

00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:17.026
spleen,

00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:19.211
and lymph nodes of its victims.

00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:21.828
The unlucky infected developed fevers,

00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:22.631
vomiting,

00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:23.915
and rashes.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.542
30% of infected people died

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.834
during the second week of infection.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:31.046
Survivors bore scars and scabs

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:32.671
for the rest of their lives.

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.210
Smallpox had arrived.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.006
In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.466
hit during the Egypt-Hittite war.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.882
Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:44.962
to the Hittites,

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:46.336
which killed their king

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:48.563
and devastated his civilization.

00:00:48.563 --> 00:00:51.816
Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:53.876
via Egyptian merchants,

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.153
then through the Arab world with the Crusades,

00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:57.796
and all the way to the Americas

00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:00.906
with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests.

00:01:00.906 --> 00:01:03.661
Since then, it has killed billions of people

00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:06.966
with an estimated 300 to 500 million people

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.521
killed in the 20th century alone.

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.048
But smallpox is not unbeatable.

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:14.548
In fact, the fall of smallpox started

00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:16.376
long before modern medicine.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.586
It began all the way back in 1022 A.D.

00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:21.015
According to a small book, called

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:23.025
"The Correct Treatment of Small Pox,"

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:25.121
a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:26.759
named O Mei Shan

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.559
in the southern providence of Sichuan

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:30.367
would grind up smallpox scabs

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:33.096
and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people.

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:34.605
She did this after noticing

00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:36.949
that those who managed to survive smallpox

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:38.336
never got it again,

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:40.357
and her odd treatment worked.

00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:42.171
The procedure, called variolation,

00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.171
slowly evolved

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:44.612
and by the 1700's,

00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:46.835
doctors were taking material from sores

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:48.871
and putting them into healthy people

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:51.717
through four or five scratches on the arm.

00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:52.752
This worked pretty well

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:55.588
as inoculated people would not get reinfected,

00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:57.171
but it wasn't foolproof.

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.754
Up to three percent of people

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:02.340
would still die after being exposed to the puss.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.928
It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:07.253
noticed something interesting about dairy maids

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:09.380
that we got our modern solution.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.727
At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice

00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:13.410
to a country surgeon and apothecary

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.525
in Sodbury, near Bristol,

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:17.138
he heard a dairy maid say,

00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:20.114
"I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox.

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:22.734
I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face."

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.383
Cowpox is a skin disease

00:02:24.383 --> 00:02:27.306
that resembles smallpox and infects cows.

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:28.719
Later on, as a physician,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.438
he realized that she was right,

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:32.891
women who got cowpox didn't develop

00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:34.391
the deadly smallpox.

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:37.793
Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family.

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:40.345
But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host,

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:42.605
in this case cowpox infecting a human,

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:43.891
it is less virulent,

00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:45.359
so Jenner decided to test

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.682
whether the cowpox virus could be used

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:50.105
to protect against smallpox.

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:53.379
In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid,

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.597
Sarah Nelmes,

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:57.424
who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm

00:02:57.424 --> 00:02:59.842
caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom.

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.519
Using matter from her pustules,

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.582
he inoculated James Phipps,

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.937
the eight-year-old son of his gardener.

00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:08.105
After a few days of fever and discomfort,

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.932
the boy seemed to recover.

00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:12.459
Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again,

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.340
this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.715
No disease developed,

00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:20.397
and Jenner concluded that protection was complete.

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:22.129
His plan had worked.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.426
Jenner later used the cowpox virus

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:25.723
in several other people

00:03:25.723 --> 00:03:28.219
and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox,

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.688
proving that they were immune to the disease.

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:31.816
With this procedure,

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:34.441
Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination.

00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:37.436
Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:38.942
to try to protect people,

00:03:38.942 --> 00:03:42.569
vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.773
The medical establishment,

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:45.406
cautious then as now,

00:03:45.406 --> 00:03:47.788
deliberated at length over his findings

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:49.160
before accepting them.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.220
But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.640
and variolation became prohibited

00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:55.908
in England in 1840.

00:03:55.908 --> 00:03:57.753
After large vaccination campaigns

00:03:57.753 --> 00:04:00.530
throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.228
the World Health Organization certified

00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:05.712
smallpox's eradication in 1979.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.083
Jenner is forever remembered

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.076
as the father of immunology,

00:04:09.076 --> 00:04:11.352
but let's not forget the dairy maid Sarah Nelmes,

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:12.438
Blossom the cow,

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:13.640
and James Phipps,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.359
all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.236
who helped eradicate smallpox.
