00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.640
- Dude, I love confident,
white dude dancers.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.473
- [Big Jay] It's great.

00:00:03.473 --> 00:00:06.800
(electric guitar chords)
(fire crackling)

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.140
- I saw a video the other day,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.190
I wish I could find the
original one I found,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.810
because on YouTube I
can't seem to find it.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.490
But it was just a video of a girl doing

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.123
the most spastic, weird,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.193
fun, sort of, but like,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.740
dancing.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.880
And it said EDM Shuffle Dance Girl.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.130
- EDM Shuffle Dance Girl?

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.790
- Yeah, and that's what I remember,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.390
just like the key words to remember.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.350
I can't find the original
one I saw on Facebook,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.700
but then I just looked it up
on YouTube and watched it.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.140
It's, I guess,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.890
high-on-molly EDM dancing.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.723
- Is this the girl?

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:44.190
- No, no.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.550
- [Dan] Who's she though?

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.570
- [Big Jay] Another one doing it.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.140
I'm telling you.
- Top five shuffle vines.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.973
- I didn't even know this was

00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:51.580
a whole culture of EDM shuffling,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.188
if you're aware of this at all.

00:00:53.188 --> 00:00:54.021
- Whoa.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.600
- [Big Jay] It pretty much
starts at the running man.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.305
Running man's a lot of it.

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:02.560
- They're just moving their feet.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.100
They have glowed-up feet.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.940
- Well, you don't have to,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.100
although Black Lou says he
does own a pair of these.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.278
- Black Lou, do you know
how to dance like this?

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:10.340
- [Black Lou] Not at all.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.173
- Not at all?
- Not at all.

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:12.006
- Look at this.
- You're about to.

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.925
- [Christine] It looks like Crip walking.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:14.800
- [Dan] You're a Crip walk.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.233
- You're a Crip walk.
- It does.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:17.066
- You are a Crip walk.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:17.899
- [Dan] Whatever.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.100
We have to get these shoes.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.562
- Well, Christine, so you're
saying you have a leg up

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:23.425
because you know how to Crip walk?

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:24.521
- [Christine] I don't know
how to do any of that.

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:25.840
- Can we--
- I don't like these,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.280
these are too good.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.840
These are making me upset
like we shouldn't try,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.673
although I still want to.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:30.680
- Or it actually looks like

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.753
Blood walk.
- I think we need these shoes.

00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:33.480
- You don't.
- All I'm seeing is

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.313
we need shoes.

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:35.310
- [Big Jay] You don't
need the shoes at all,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.210
that's just the...

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.633
- [Dan] This kid's awesome.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.540
Looks like he was just--
- These people

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.563
are too good at it.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.530
I wanna see the ones that are all whacked.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380
- Yeah, do bad.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.490
Because this is hard to watch,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.930
because it's like, I can't do that.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.251
Nah dude, look at her butt.

00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:55.440
- Dan, Dan, look at me.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.440
You can do it.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.273
- [Dan] Yeah?

00:01:57.273 --> 00:01:58.120
- You just can!
- Or if I see someone

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.000
bad do it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.773
- There's no way to do it wrong!

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.490
- Oh my God, they're doing choreographed?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.190
- These are vines, this
isn't what we should've,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.370
this is people showing
off, fuckin' swingin' dick.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.823
I wanna see idiots at home do it.

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:11.670
- (laughs) Sick soldier stomping.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.693
- There we go, that guy.

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:14.297
- [Christine] It's like Riverdance.

00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:15.752
- [Big Jay] Yes, it's a
little bit Riverdance,

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:17.077
it's a lot of running man.
- It's like Lord of the Dance

00:02:17.077 --> 00:02:20.260
with Michael Flatley.
- Now we're cookin' with gas.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.590
- (laughs) It's a lot of Running Man.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.110
- Yeah dude, I just wanna
see bad versions of this.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.981
- Here we go, Shuffle Fail Compilation.

00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:28.580
- Beau-ti-ful.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.463
Blast it!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.563
Shuffle fail!

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.900
Yeah, this is me.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.000
- This is what might happen in the studio.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.550
(electronic dance music)

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.383
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.170
- Is he doing that bad?

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.567
- [Dan] I don't think it's good.

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:50.650
(Christine laughs)

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.483
- You don't?

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:52.480
- [Dan] I think he hits that main carpet,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.740
he's gonna be in some trouble.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.573
At the Bonfire SXM.

00:02:55.573 --> 00:02:56.550
- Oh, he's about to catch a lip.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.450
- Oh, he's steppin', steppin',
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.690
How's this a fail?

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.794
Oh!

00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:04.048
And he hit it.

00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:04.881
That's awesome.

00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:06.630
- He busted the thing, so
there's a bunch of fails.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.140
- [Dan] Oh, you can do
the horse? (clicks tongue)

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.460
- Yeah, but you can do whatever you want,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.172
as long as your legs are just

00:03:11.172 --> 00:03:13.790
goin' fuckin' flippy-floppy nonstop

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.662
from the second you
start 'til you're done.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.700
- I think I wanna do the happy prospector.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.910
- [Big Jay] Keep your hand work,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.230
your hand work's gotta be minimal.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.400
- Oh so it's like, bum,
bum, bum, bum, like that?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.550
Oh, this is Riverdance.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.506
♪ I think it's very vital ♪

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:28.920
- It's the same thing.
- Christine, stop confusing

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.490
the situation, stay with shuffle dancing.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.200
- Oh yeah, this is me.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.300
- There you go, that's
gonna be you, I agree.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.770
You're assuming yours will
be something like that.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.810
And some way you're gonna think

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.267
you did a complete straddle split.

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:40.550
(Dan and Big Jay groan)

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.750
- [Dan] Yeah, that's me.

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.499
(all groan)

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:47.926
(Big Jay laughs)

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:50.090
- It's just a guy falling on
his back and staying there.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.550
Here we go.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.650
Whenever you try it
outside of a school ground,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.450
you know you're destined to fuck up.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.770
Oh, I could do this.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.210
- [Big Jay] Yeah, this is
how I feel it's gonna go.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.176
Whoa, what?

00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:02.597
Hey!
(Dan laughs)

00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:04.020
- [Dan] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.290
- Must learn balance
before you shuffle dance.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.160
- This is great because it's slick fours.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.033
He's in trouble.

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:11.828
- [Big Jay] He's got a whole lot

00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:12.661
of electronics.
- That whole

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.110
entertainment center's going
down, at the Bonfire SXM.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.900
We'll tweet it out he just, eh? (groans)

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.430
- Oh, come on.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.810
That's in a fail compilation,
you don't fail at this a lot.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.640
- Hey could we go out to the parking lot

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.773
so you can film me doing
some shuffle dancing?

00:04:27.773 --> 00:04:28.950
- This is like he's fighting wind.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.400
- It's actually pretty awesome.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.329
Is this the reporter stuck in a hurricane?

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:33.965
(Big Jay laughs)

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:35.215
Hm, hm, hm, hm.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.180
Oh man, I think we could all do this.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.680
- Nobody in this room gets outta here

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.728
without shuffle dancing.

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.830
(DJ Lou laughs)
- Dude, I'll go first.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.880
You think I'm scared?

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.259
This song, I wanna dance to this song.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.595
- [DJ Lou] I think I have it.

00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:49.428
- I don't know what this--
- This girl's doing it

00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:51.240
with her, it looks so fun.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.530
It looks like you're doing nothing.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.260
- And you gotta take your shoes off.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.480
- It looks like something
you get caught doing

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.870
in an elevator and have to stop.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.174
- After you get promoted?

00:04:58.174 --> 00:04:59.960
(Big Jay and Dan laugh)

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.793
- [Big Jay] Beep beep bop,

00:05:00.793 --> 00:05:02.300
somebody's gonna buy an Alfa Romeo!

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.853
Hey, hey.
- Hey, sorry.

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:04.686
- [Big Jay] What's up,
thought this was going

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:05.519
straight down to the lobby.

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:06.692
- I just got the Johnson deal.

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:08.886
(Big Jay and Dan laugh)

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:10.890
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.150
Do we know what songs these are?

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.350
Hey.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.183
Hi.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.790
Oh, this is terrible.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.620
Actually that's not bad.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.840
- Lot of these girls in there
have been fart porn. (laughs)

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.723
(Dan makes farting noises)
Little-known fact.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.552
All these girls in there
have been fart porn.

00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:27.848
(farting)

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:30.611
(Dan laughs)

00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:31.611
Oh, Jesus H.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.100
- All right, are we gonna
pick out some music?

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.470
I get it, it's sock dancing, I got it.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.000
- [DJ Lou] I pulled
some songs for you guys.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.490
- It's North American sock dancing.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.160
- You don't have to be in socks though.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.196
- Guess who's gonna be in socks.

00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:45.200
- Are you going to socks?
- Yeah, dude.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.500
- Maybe I should go to socks too.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.680
- Yeah, oh yeah.
- For sure socks.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.513
- Watch out.

00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:50.346
- I bet I'd break a big toe

00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:51.860
by just kicking the ground really hard

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.687
when I'm just flailing
my feet like a doof.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.069
I'm just gonna crank my foot.

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.470
- I can't wait to have an ankle brace.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.870
- Troy from Philadelphia just said,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.700
we don't have to take the
call, but thanks for the call.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.057
Troy goes, he goes, "I go to EDC events

00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:05.570
"and you won't see anyone,"

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.310
he's saying you won't see
anybody fucked up doing that.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.180
Yeah, you can't.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.380
If you're fucked up, you're
going over right away.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.070
They won't even know you
were trying to do that,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.493
they'll go, "Looks like Dan
can't get his legs under him,

00:06:14.493 --> 00:06:17.026
"oh, he's down, he's down." (laughs)

00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:18.425
Everyone there will be
like, "He can't get his legs

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.999
"under him, oh, oh, he's doing the dance."

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.832
As soon as you look like you don't have

00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:22.840
your legs under you, you don't.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.940
- Who's gonna start this off?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.890
- [Big Jay] DJ Lou.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.453
- I'm the DJ.

00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:29.960
- [Big Jay] All right, it can't be DJ Lou,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.750
it's gotta be one of, I'd say...

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.760
- I'll try.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.757
- Jacob's gonna be a great one.

00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:36.030
You wanna go first?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.863
You can go first if you wanna go first.

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:38.920
- Because I think I'll be terrible at it.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.260
- We're all gonna be sorta terrible at it.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.597
- Yeah, but I'll start.
- But put your heart into it.

00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:43.370
- You can't move your hands?

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.203
- No, you can.

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.132
Look at these people moving their hands,

00:06:45.132 --> 00:06:47.933
but just it's mostly, it's
a foot-based situation.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.060
You're gonna do it over here?

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.530
- Yeah.
- We'll swap spots.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.363
- All right.

00:06:52.363 --> 00:06:53.246
- [Big Jay] You have to use my headphones.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.079
- All right.

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.890
- Everyone dancing has
to use my headphones.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:56.723
We got this.

00:06:56.723 --> 00:06:59.773
Jacob, play me out. (laughs)

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.890
- I'm ready, I'm ready, I got it.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.810
Jacob, come on, what are you doing?

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.410
Also, we gotta bring the mic up.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.720
- [Big Jay] Jacob, are you...

00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:12.134
- [Jacob] The way you said it

00:07:12.134 --> 00:07:12.967
I thought that you were talking

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:15.050
to like square dancing, line dancing.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.657
- Oh, look who's getting nervous now.

00:07:17.657 --> 00:07:18.539
"Well, let me know

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:19.750
"when it's square
dancing day," says Jacob.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.200
- Oh no, no, you know
me, I'm a country fella.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.380
I'm an urban cowboy.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.470
- Oh, I came in prepared to boot scoot,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.140
if I would've known I
would've trained for this.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.457
- Let's try this shit out.

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:31.826
- I like it over here.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.050
- Are you ready?
- It's kinda weird, right?

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.440
- I like it.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.030
- Wait, let me see this again.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.080
Let me watch a video.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.610
- Are you in socks?
- Yeah.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.767
- Wait get those--
- I kinda know how to do it.

00:07:45.767 --> 00:07:47.460
- No, don't stare, that's what I'm saying,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.720
you don't overthink it.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.030
Just go fuckin' haywire
with your feet, man.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.710
- Okay, all right.
- Oh shit, sorry.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.840
- [Big Jay] Get the chairs outta the way.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.360
We need both those chairs outta the way.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.670
Put one in the hallway if we got to.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.053
- No, we're good.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.470
- I want that one gone.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.083
That's space.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.710
That's prime real estate right there.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.160
- [DJ Lou] Do you want my
special sunglasses, Dan?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.530
- Yeah, thank you.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.920
- That'll help.
- I'd be careful,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.270
make sure you don't kick the console

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.110
and then break your toe.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.760
- All right, start it off
again so I can get into it.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.943
- Danny Soder.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.010
Let the beat drop. (laughs)

00:08:25.861 --> 00:08:28.169
(all laughing)

00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:30.586
- This is fuckin' ridiculous!

00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:32.763
- Try to have some style with it,

00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:34.090
you're really clunkin' around.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.350
I mean, you know, where's your grace?

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.030
- I'm the first one out!

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.630
- That's fair enough, it's true.

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:41.802
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- It looks like you're

00:08:41.802 --> 00:08:43.167
getting ready for two-a-days.

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:44.830
- (laughs) I'm just doing
an old football drill.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.690
- Are you gonna hit the deck?

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.580
- I tried, that was
me, that was me trying.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.251
- That wasn't bad.

00:08:50.251 --> 00:08:51.084
It was not good.

00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:52.560
- No, it wasn't good,
but I'll tell you this,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.785
those old football drills
really came in handy.

00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:55.618
(Big Jay laughs)

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.440
- It was from your heart. (laughs)

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.060
- Did you film that, Lou?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.400
- He's got my butt.
- Black Lou, you got it?

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.110
- I mean, we got two cameras on it.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.100
- Should me and you
bookend it, or should I go?

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.810
- Yeah, you go last, because
you're gonna be good at it.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.810
So why don't you--
- Why would you believe that?

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.640
- Why don't I move to that mic.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.520
- Why don't you come back to your mic,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.423
and I'll go right here.

00:09:15.423 --> 00:09:16.256
- I mean, yeah.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.110
- I gotta talk while you come around,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.953
Jacob just panics and doesn't say a word.

00:09:20.953 --> 00:09:22.250
(Dan laughs)
Holy shit.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.967
- It's like Major League
II, where he's like,

00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:26.107
"It's hit, it's caught."

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.080
Hey, it's the Jake, it's Jake the Snake.

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:32.860
- Don't like this.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.200
- Yeah, so I'm not good at this dancing,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.157
but hey, at least I felt it out.

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:35.990
- Why would you say that?

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.480
No, don't play it up so
negative, you did good.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.700
I was really proud of you.
- I didn't do good.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.730
- I was really proud of you back there.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.150
So who goes next then?

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.000
- I don't know, who wants to go next?

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.587
- Black Lou?
- I'll go.

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:50.139
- What?

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:50.972
- Jacob!
- And I'm gonna

00:09:50.972 --> 00:09:51.805
crush this, too.

00:09:51.805 --> 00:09:53.029
- [Dan] You're gonna what?

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:54.156
- I'm gonna have to school you.

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:55.653
(all laughing)

00:09:55.653 --> 00:09:57.893
- Am I about to get served by Jacob?

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.880
Oh man, I really hope.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.850
- I love it.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.690
- I'll tell you this,

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.640
if you don't school me you're terrible.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.380
Oh!
- Oh, motherfucker.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.140
- [Dan] One of his multiple
layers is coming off.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.170
- I gotta take the shoes off.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.100
- [Dan] Yeah, you gotta go socks.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.300
- [Big Jay] Oh yeah, I
gotta go shoes off too, huh?

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.327
- Yeah guys, if you guys are gonna fuckin'

00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:18.503
EDM shuffle dance.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.940
- If you guys are ready to get
your heads outta your asses.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.810
- If you guys wanna take
this thing seriously,

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.310
like what it is?

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.450
Which is a real, live, radio
show, that is doing some dumb.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.725
- Came in smelling like onion,

00:10:30.725 --> 00:10:32.187
left it smelling like feet.
- Hey Lou, drop a beat for me.

00:10:32.187 --> 00:10:33.020
[All] Oh!

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.063
- Straight street!

00:10:37.153 --> 00:10:39.547
(all laughing)

00:10:39.547 --> 00:10:42.350
- Yeah, Jacob is schooling me!

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.420
Look at the feet moving, oh!
- Owning it!

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.110
- He's not stopping, he's not stopping!

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.550
He is not stopping.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.680
He can't be beat, oh, oh, oh,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.702
he likes the arms behind
the back, there it is.

00:10:53.702 --> 00:10:54.810
Push it, push it.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.643
Push it.

00:10:55.643 --> 00:10:56.476
- I want everybody to remember this,

00:10:56.476 --> 00:10:59.500
we're competing for the Golden Ring Pop.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.120
- Oh, oh, oh, double, double back-push!

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.890
- Shuffle dancing's premiere!

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.280
- He's outlasted me.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.203
Jacob is, oh, oh, oh, he's still moving!

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.333
Is he on ice?

00:11:10.333 --> 00:11:11.166
There he is.
- That good enough?

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:12.260
- I love it.
(Dan claps)

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.550
Love it!

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.490
There's no time limit,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.100
you can feel until your
heart stops telling you.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.797
- Yeah, I did five seconds,
you just Luke Perry'd it,

00:11:17.797 --> 00:11:19.250
you just eight-seconds'd it.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.537
- [Jacob] Whatever.

00:11:20.537 --> 00:11:22.280
(all laughing)

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.113
You good to go again?
- Christine's gonna take over

00:11:23.113 --> 00:11:24.240
filming when Lou dances.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.073
- Yeah, Black Lou, are you

00:11:25.073 --> 00:11:26.960
about to jump in next, or White Lou?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.200
Which one of the Lous is next?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.033
- [Man] White Lou!

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:29.866
- [DJ Lou] I don't know.

00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:30.699
- Come on.

00:11:30.699 --> 00:11:31.750
- I don't know.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.670
No one's ever said that

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.899
before shuffle dancing.
- Black Lou!

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:35.750
- Ah, Christ.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.670
He goes, "Hey, you
wanna go shuffle dance?"

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.130
He goes, "God, gotta get
outta my goddamn chair."

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.254
- He's just, "Golly."

00:11:42.254 --> 00:11:44.860
(Big Jay sighs)

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.070
Miserable sons of bitches.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.070
- Chest is killing me.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.371
- Are you going?
- Christine, you're next?

00:11:49.371 --> 00:11:50.204
- [Christine] Is it me?

00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:51.710
- Sure.
- Yeah, you gotta go.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.201
You gotta go, Christine,
we all have to do it.

00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:54.034
We all have to jump off.
- Look at her

00:11:54.034 --> 00:11:55.977
rolling her eyes, she's like,
"God, let me, all right, fine.

00:11:55.977 --> 00:11:58.620
"Finally somebody who
knows what's going on."

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.470
- Yeah, let's see.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.970
I mean, Jacob's a hard act to follow.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.250
I set the bar low, then
Jacob just slam-dunked it.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.400
- Christine, you're gonna
look like Joey Lawrence

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.800
doing this dance with your fuckin' shirt

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.470
tied around your waist.
- Whoa, whoa!

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.320
- [DJ Lou] Ready?

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.363
- Here it is.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.130
Yeah!

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.810
Go Christine, doing it!

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.400
Kick out, kick out,
she's got one good move.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.425
She's got one solid move.

00:12:20.425 --> 00:12:22.494
- She's really going back
to that well, everyone.

00:12:22.494 --> 00:12:23.580
(all laughing)

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.053
Soon as that beat changes,
she's gonna lose her shit.

00:12:27.053 --> 00:12:27.886
- There it is!

00:12:27.886 --> 00:12:29.385
- Now looks like she
stopped giving a shit,

00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:30.620
and she's out.
- And she's out.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.360
And she's out, right now Jacob's in first,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.030
Christine's in second and I am leading,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.760
not leading, I'm following up.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.430
- If that was a mechanical bull contest

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.370
you wouldn't have gotten laid

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.800
from the fattest guy
at that bar with that,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.743
the way you quit.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.588
That was great, everyone's digging in.

00:12:45.588 --> 00:12:48.040
- Christine started off strong.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.237
- She knew that move.

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.070
That move she was onboard with.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.044
- That move was in.

00:12:51.044 --> 00:12:51.877
She was in that move.
- But then they were like,

00:12:51.877 --> 00:12:53.127
"Hey, whatever happens if it gets past,

00:12:53.127 --> 00:12:54.907
"I don't know, seven
seconds of that move?"

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:57.650
And she was like, "I did
not think that far ahead."

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.730
- It's like holding
Tyson to past six rounds.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.597
You're like, "He's gonna gas,

00:13:00.597 --> 00:13:02.775
"he's gonna gas, just hold it in."

00:13:02.775 --> 00:13:03.608
- I wanna get good at it.

00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:05.340
- Black Lou or White Lou?

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.173
- White Lou.

00:13:06.173 --> 00:13:07.552
- White Lou first?

00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:08.398
- I don't think I'm going, I gotta DJ.

00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:10.740
- Oh, you're going.
- Oh, come the fuck on.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.940
- Jacob, can you run the board?

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.924
- [Jacob] Can I?

00:13:13.924 --> 00:13:15.648
(all laughing)

00:13:15.648 --> 00:13:17.387
Lou, can you hit my intro?

00:13:17.387 --> 00:13:18.737
- Yeah, hell yeah!
- If you could please

00:13:18.737 --> 00:13:19.900
hit the intro for Jacob.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.064
- Double down.

00:13:21.064 --> 00:13:22.182
- [Announcer] DJ Jacob.

00:13:22.182 --> 00:13:24.099
D-D-DJ Jacob.

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:26.625
Spinnin' the hits.

00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:29.208
(siren blares)

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.780
- Black Lou, we gotta make you an intro

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.327
so we can sub you in too.

00:13:34.327 --> 00:13:35.160
- Okay.
- But we gotta

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.700
make it fuckin', we have
to make it like, black.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.533
- Oh yeah.

00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:39.710
- Oh man--

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:40.810
- Snow, Snow.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.440
- Don't even, guys, shut up.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.184
That's tomorrow's episode.
- I forgot, I forgot, I know.

00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:45.470
- You guys keep talking
about tomorrow's episode.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.150
All right, you ready White Lou?

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.130
- [DJ Lou] Fuck yeah.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.790
- So ready to get it on,
he's already dancing.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.623
The music hasn't even started

00:13:50.623 --> 00:13:51.850
and he wants to get it over with so bad.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:52.950
- Make it loud, Jacob.

00:13:54.946 --> 00:13:56.477
I don't know, I got nothing.

00:13:56.477 --> 00:13:58.011
- No!
- No, you fuckin'!

00:13:58.011 --> 00:14:00.594
(all laughing)

00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:04.107
- I got nothing.

00:14:04.968 --> 00:14:07.623
(Big Jay laughing)

00:14:07.623 --> 00:14:09.128
Now I'm all embarrassed, I'm out.

00:14:09.128 --> 00:14:11.640
- He goes, he goes, huh.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.599
- Lou, you get back there, Lou!

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:14.640
No, Lou!

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.672
No, Lou!

00:14:15.672 --> 00:14:16.856
Lou, no!

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.695
No, Lou, no! (laughs)

00:14:18.695 --> 00:14:19.528
- No!

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:25.134
- Lou made one move and fuckin' bailed.

00:14:25.134 --> 00:14:26.406
- Lou went, and it wasn't even feet.

00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:27.745
He went...

00:14:27.745 --> 00:14:28.578
- You guys were dying

00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:30.208
laughing so hard.
- He didn't even do his feet!

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:33.300
Lou just went, he went, "All
right, I don't wanna do it."

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.001
(all laughing)

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:37.501
- It was one move!

00:14:38.342 --> 00:14:40.761
He went, "Now I'm done, I'm done."

00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:42.310
- He just did like a
little over-the-shoulder,

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.327
he went, he goes, boom-do-do, and he went,

00:14:45.327 --> 00:14:46.520
"Guys, this is stupid."

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.390
Lou, you can't quit that quick!

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.215
- [Jacob] I really thought
he was gonna Chris Penn this.

00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:52.048
And just kill it.

00:14:52.048 --> 00:14:53.300
And then, no.
- Everyone thought

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.270
you were gonna kill it.
- It didn't happen

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.390
at all like that.
- Holy shit, that was funny.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.530
- Oh, God dammit, that really rattled

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.930
those horseradish chips in my stomach.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.560
- Why won't you try, Lou?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.795
- I just had all the
confidence drained out of me.

00:15:03.795 --> 00:15:04.628
(Dan laughs)

00:15:04.628 --> 00:15:06.170
- You did it yourself, though!

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.730
No one said anything!

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.380
- Maybe if you guys weren't
laughing in my face,

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.330
I think I could continue.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.243
- We're not laughing!
- We laughed after!

00:15:12.243 --> 00:15:13.498
- You did one move!

00:15:13.498 --> 00:15:14.381
- You, just wait--

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.586
- We didn't even laugh at your dancing!

00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:17.520
- We can't laugh at your
dancing, you never danced!

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.370
- We laughed at you bailing on dancing.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.280
- You threw your arms like you were

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.383
about to start the flamenco. (laughs)

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.400
And then you took off.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.700
- [Jacob] I bet if Pete and Sebastian

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.213
asked you to dance you'd do it.

00:15:28.213 --> 00:15:29.740
- Oh, he's right!

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.750
He's right, oh, what happened?

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.583
- [Jacob] You need us

00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:32.416
to call them up?
- You jerks EDM dancing

00:15:32.416 --> 00:15:33.260
last night?

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.403
- There's no time for dancing,
we're too busy laughing.

00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:39.023
- Lou, you gotta get out
there and you have to dance.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.010
- Lou, aren't you embarrassed--

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.860
- That you made one move,

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.723
- Oh my God, dude.
- And then just disintegrated

00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:49.021
into nothing?

00:15:49.021 --> 00:15:50.484
- That was one of my favorite
things I've ever seen my life.

00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:52.697
(Dan laughing)

00:15:52.697 --> 00:15:54.660
And my fuckin' cheeks hurt.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.730
- Lou, we were not
laughing at your dancing,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.214
we laughed at you bailing on the dancing.

00:15:59.214 --> 00:16:01.500
- Immediately!
- Immediately.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.333
Immediately.

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:03.880
- Confidence comes and
goes, what can I tell ya?

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.050
- No shit!

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.297
I mean, fleeting as
anything I've ever seen!

00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:08.170
- That's the equivalent
of going like this.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.228
It's raining, no it's not,

00:16:09.228 --> 00:16:10.670
that was just a drip from the sky.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.890
- He goes, "Nope, air conditioner."

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:12.723
- Yeah.

00:16:12.723 --> 00:16:15.820
- Should we do a Stew day
and have him dance as Stew?

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.653
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, I mean

00:16:16.653 --> 00:16:19.052
who dances sober?

00:16:19.052 --> 00:16:20.058
- These people.
- Apparently everybody,

00:16:20.058 --> 00:16:21.490
if not, you're going through a hedge, man.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.860
I don't know if you've
seen what's going on,

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.790
it's violent feet movement.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.900
- Black Lou, are you ready?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.860
You're not ready.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.862
Yeah, you're ready,

00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.363
you were born ready.
- Born ready.

00:16:30.363 --> 00:16:31.260
- Jinx.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.140
Let's kiss.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.350
You still gotta go, big daddy.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.510
- Yeah, I thought we were bookending it,

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.343
I'm after Black Lou.

00:16:35.343 --> 00:16:36.570
- I'm so glad I'm done.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.950
It's like going on stage.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:38.783
Right Lou?

00:16:38.783 --> 00:16:39.640
How good does it feel to be done?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.010
- You got it out of the way.
- I didn't even start.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.437
- Isn't it nice to be done, Lou?

00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:44.900
(DJ Lou laughs)
- Dude, that was so great.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.620
- All right, Black Lou's coming in.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.200
- Yeah, coming in hot.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.867
Cowboy hat on.
- I'm told they have

00:16:49.867 --> 00:16:51.900
softer bones for more rhythmic moving.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.990
- Oh, here he goes.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.620
Uh-oh!

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.630
Here it is.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.080
Shoes on, side to side!

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.530
Jacob, you got some competition, dude.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.060
- [Jacob] I'm not really
seeing the footwork.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.207
- Well, hold on.

00:17:02.207 --> 00:17:05.920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and
Black Lou's already,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.573
he's gaining on him, there it is.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.726
Yeah, lotta hand.

00:17:09.726 --> 00:17:11.550
- I'll tell you what,
the hand stuff's working.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.200
- He does, and he's doing a lotta tilt,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.440
I'm noticing the tilt.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.840
- Glow stick ready!

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.950
- Yeah, oh, oh, oh!

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.090
- Oh, he almost did the Russian thing!

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.650
- I mean, it's definitely
between Black Lou and Jacob.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.570
It's definitely between
Black Lou and Jacob.

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:23.690
- [Jacob] Gonna have to do a dance-off.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.560
- You guys might have to get,

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.821
dude, someone's about to served.

00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:26.654
- [Jacob] It's gonna get street.

00:17:26.654 --> 00:17:27.502
- It's gonna get--

00:17:27.502 --> 00:17:28.483
- It's about to get straight hood in here.

00:17:28.483 --> 00:17:29.320
- You know how I like it.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.153
Suburb.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.850
- You know how I like
it, the berm of the hood.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.683
- Yeah.

00:17:34.683 --> 00:17:35.780
- You know, like the outskirts,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.590
like where you still
get affordable places,

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.760
but it's like, nicer Hispanic families.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.720
- Young parents.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.620
- Young parents.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.320
- You know how I keep it, young parents.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.373
- Straight street, all right.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.920
- You ready?

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.753
You ready to do this?

00:17:48.753 --> 00:17:50.540
This is the last one, and
then I think it's gonna come,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.650
great job Black Lou.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.860
I think it's gonna come
down to Jacob and Black Lou

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.870
if Jay cannot--

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.703
- Oh, thanks for counting me out.

00:17:56.703 --> 00:17:57.970
- Dude, I don't know what you do,

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.137
I was just very impressed
with Black Lou moving.

00:17:59.137 --> 00:18:02.070
- I gotta empty my pockets,
I wanna be light on my feet.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.700
- You're gonna take out your chain?

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.560
- No.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.440
- Oh, you're gonna keep
the chain for movement?

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.280
- Chain stays.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.040
- Oh dude, I really like
where this is going.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.990
- [Black Lou] Two chain!

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.510
- I think I need some
chairs outta the way.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.290
- Yeah, you gotta worry about,

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.419
we got a laptop right there.

00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:17.252
- That's fine, that'll be fine.

00:18:17.252 --> 00:18:18.110
- You good enough?

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.130
You feel like you got space?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.590
- [DJ Lou] Jay, if you're
not feeling the song,

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.290
just tell me to change it and I will.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.220
- Is it the No Doubt one again?

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.670
- No.
- That stunk.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.283
- [DJ Lou] Yeah, I knew
you didn't like that.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.434
Yeah, oh, oh! (laughs)

00:18:34.434 --> 00:18:35.678
Okay!

00:18:35.678 --> 00:18:38.471
Walking forward, walking sideways!

00:18:38.471 --> 00:18:40.770
You're doing a lot of
cartoon shuffling here.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.170
You're going around, I like the flare-out.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.160
Flare it, flare it, move it, flare it,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.439
move it, flare it, side to side, side--

00:18:47.439 --> 00:18:49.110
(all shouting)

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.990
You definitely won.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.240
You definitely, out of the
two of us, you won that one.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.073
- Of me and you?

00:18:53.073 --> 00:18:54.150
- Yeah, of me and you.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.559
- I feel like my face look
frightened the whole time.

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:56.392
- It did.

00:18:56.392 --> 00:18:57.268
(all laughing)

00:18:57.268 --> 00:18:58.189
You looked like you were walking--

00:18:58.189 --> 00:18:59.272
- I'm going through a window.

00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:00.597
I'm gonna go through a window!

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:01.830
- I felt like I was trying to talk you

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.203
over a tightrope walk.

00:19:04.879 --> 00:19:06.240
I was like, "Come on, come on."

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.390
- Were my out-kicks good?

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.710
- Your out-kicks were great.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.255
That was your Christine move.

00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:11.088
(Big Jay laughs)

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:12.296
Your out-kicks were--

00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:13.730
- The out-kick, I did go
back to the well a lot.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.140
- Yeah, you did, you
were doing the out-kick,

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.750
but by the way, I was
just doing foot shuffle,

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.710
I went back to the well
the whole time too.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.190
It's definitely Black Lou and Jacob

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.370
are the two best EDM shuffle dancers.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.610
- I feel like you need slipperier surface.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.050
- Yeah, I think you get
hurt that way though.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.070
You're gonna blow the knee out.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.400
I mean, do we wanna keep
this You Got Served style

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.610
between Black Lou and Jacob?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.443
- Absolutely.

00:19:35.443 --> 00:19:37.120
- [Dan] Black Lou, are you ready?

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.104
- [Black Lou] Sure.

00:19:38.104 --> 00:19:39.425
- [Dan] Are you ready to
keep it, ready to keep it,

00:19:39.425 --> 00:19:41.764
straight grimy?
- Straight street?

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:42.745
- You know how I like it.
- Grimy.

00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:44.608
- Straight street.
- You know how I like it.

00:19:44.608 --> 00:19:45.441
Unregulated.
- Jacob's going first right?

00:19:45.441 --> 00:19:47.550
- I shouldn't be this out of breath.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.140
- I'm out of breath, I'm worried
I'm having a heart attack

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.723
because I ate horseradish chips
and then danced real quick.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.413
That's how unhealthy I am.

00:19:53.413 --> 00:19:55.083
- No, Jacob, these headphones.

00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:57.260
- Yeah, you can't take
your own headphones, dude.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.226
What are you doing?
- Well you know

00:19:58.226 --> 00:19:59.580
he doesn't like wearing
other people's headphones.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.913
- Yeah, oh yeah.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.850
So Jacob will be going first.
- My ears have been AIDS-free

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.200
for three years.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.890
- Jacob's the white dance crew.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.550
So Black Lou, let me give you my advice.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.060
Take it how we always
do it, straight serious.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.013
Sirius XM.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.118
You ready, Jacob?

00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:18.490
- Straighten your new
tee neck, your tee neck.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.026
- I'm just waiting for the beat.

00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:21.636
(Dan and Big Jay laugh)

00:20:21.636 --> 00:20:25.033
(electronic dance music)

00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:26.838
(Black Lou laughs)

00:20:26.838 --> 00:20:29.255
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.153
- Damn.

00:20:31.153 --> 00:20:31.986
Damn!

00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:33.250
- Oh, he's moving!

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.350
- He goes for it!

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.134
- I mean, feet just a-flailin'.

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:36.967
- [Man] Holy shit!

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:38.950
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.270
Yeah, Sierra Skye, if she's right now,

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.620
she's interested in Jacob.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.007
He does a good push.

00:20:45.007 --> 00:20:46.341
- I'll tell you, wherever
she's at, she's--

00:20:46.341 --> 00:20:49.380
(Dan shouts)

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.980
- Oh, he just threw
some shade at Black Lou!

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.150
- Wherever Sierra Skye is,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.730
she's wet and she doesn't even know why.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.890
- Yeah, she's just like going somewhere

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.237
and she's, "Roman, I think it's over.

00:20:58.237 --> 00:20:59.610
"I think it's over."

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.420
I mean, you threw a lot
of shade at him, dude.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.253
- [Jacob] Thank you.

00:21:02.253 --> 00:21:03.550
- Yeah, you're welcome.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.610
- Jay, what did you think--
- Thank you.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.880
About Jacob's performance?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.920
- Fantastic.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.770
- It was fantastic.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.723
Black Lou.

00:21:08.723 --> 00:21:10.240
- He's got a lot to live up to.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.890
- You really set the bar, dude.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.630
You really set the bar,
but I feel like Black Lou's

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.790
got something in his pocket,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.623
because he just gave White Lou--

00:21:15.623 --> 00:21:16.519
- I didn't like my performance.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.100
I'm going back and I'm
just, I'm in my own head.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.140
- Dude, you know what, man?

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.973
- No.
- We're learning

00:21:19.973 --> 00:21:21.570
this world together, hey, look at me.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:22.403
- It was just--

00:21:22.403 --> 00:21:23.236
- Hey, look at me.

00:21:23.236 --> 00:21:24.823
We're learning this world together, dude.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.049
- There was a chair to my, I was--

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:28.347
- That's how I felt,
hey, that's how I felt.

00:21:28.347 --> 00:21:29.450
But you know what?

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.610
We all learned that...

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.970
Well, we all suck at this, except Jacob--

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:34.803
- I don't give a fuck, man.

00:21:34.803 --> 00:21:36.900
It doesn't even matter,
the whole idea was stupid.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.733
- It was stupid.

00:21:37.733 --> 00:21:39.860
- Fuckin' White Lou
gets out of even trying.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.200
Asshole.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.813
- The way White Lou bailed,
he failed fantastically.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.646
- That should be a, you
find yourself in the wrong,

00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:47.479
in a WorldStarHipHop video.

00:21:47.479 --> 00:21:49.500
- Oh, you don't even want headphones?

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.364
- No.
- Acapella?

00:21:51.364 --> 00:21:52.422
- Oh, dude.

00:21:52.422 --> 00:21:53.580
He almost 8-Mile'd you.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.530
- Oh, you need 'em.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.333
- What's that?
- Or else you get to

00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:58.560
hear how out of rhythm your steps are.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.900
- Oh man, I'm out of breath.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.552
Jacob, can you come up
here for a little bit?

00:22:02.552 --> 00:22:03.385
Just right here, right here's good.

00:22:03.385 --> 00:22:04.324
- Uh-oh.

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:05.217
- Thank you sir.

00:22:05.217 --> 00:22:06.050
(all laughing)

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.717
- Now he's gonna serve your ass.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.760
- Here we go, this is it.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.153
Black Lou's response to
Jacob in EDM shuffle dancing.

00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:20.970
(Dan and Big Jay shouting)

00:22:24.361 --> 00:22:25.478
(Black Lou laughs)

00:22:25.478 --> 00:22:28.978
- He's about to bust a twerk in your face.

00:22:29.847 --> 00:22:31.500
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.629
- Hot block!
- Shuffle dancing!

00:22:34.629 --> 00:22:36.180
He just did a turkey walk!

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.560
Jacob's not impressed.
(Big Jay cheers)

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.890
Jacob's not impressed.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.583
- He hits a slow-mo on him.

00:22:41.517 --> 00:22:43.130
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.960
Oh, he opened up his chest and
he's wormin' into his heart!

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.950
- You're gettin' served!

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.807
- Oh, he's taking him out to dinner!

00:22:47.807 --> 00:22:50.255
- Table for one, Jacob Battat!

00:22:50.255 --> 00:22:52.660
- Oh shit!
(Dan yelling)

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.380
- Response!
- Oh fuck!

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.690
- Russian! (laughs)

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.420
- Oh, immediate kickback!

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.511
- Russian kick, Jacob
scrambling around! (yells)

00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:03.810
- Oh, somebody call an ambulance,

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.230
we're having an interracial seizure!

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.870
- Get Steve Harvey in here,
this shits gettin' too street.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.590
Everyone needs, y'all
need to chill, playboy!

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.290
- Someone's gotta street it
down, he wants you to get,

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.482
oh, he wants you outta the way.

00:23:14.482 --> 00:23:16.300
Is there gonna be a flip?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.540
Black Lou's about to flip.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.020
- Now you guys are just breakdancing.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.067
(all yelling)

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:22.660
- Oh shit!

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.003
- [DJ Lou] Holy fuck me!

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.219
- Hey Lou, great stealing
my move at the end.

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:28.850
(all laughing)

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.250
- I think there's only
one way to settle this.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.640
It's now Jacob and Lou's
radio show, we have to leave.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.473
- We're outta here.

00:23:34.473 --> 00:23:36.871
- It's now The Bonfire with
Jacob Battat and Louis.

00:23:36.871 --> 00:23:41.871
(electric guitar chords)
(fire crackling)
