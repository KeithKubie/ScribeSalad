00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.340
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.280
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well
good afternoon.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.400
I am Carla Hayden, the Librarian of
Congress, and I hope you are having

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.840
as great a time [applause] at
the 17 National Book Festival.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.010
I must tell you, we
have had quite a day.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.100
And this is going to be
another special session.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.030
I am delighted to be here at
the History and Biography Stage.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.810
I have to admit that I
am a pretty history geek.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.410
And personally this is
means so much to me.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.420
First, I want to sing and I am
not a singer, but I vowed to sing

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.760
for Helene Cooper as a reporter.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.250
She joined the New
York Times in 2004

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.920
as an assistant editorial
page editor.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.660
And she has been a diplomatic
correspondent for the Times,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.220
as well as a White
House correspondent.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.700
And she is now the Pentagon
reporter for the paper.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.590
And in 2015 she was part of the
team that won the Pulitzer Prize

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.240
for international reporting,
specifically for her work

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.400
in Liberia during the
Ebola epidemic.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.580
And that same year she received
the prestigious George Polk Award

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.470
and the Overseas Press Club Award.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.020
And prior to joining the
Times, she spent 12 years

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.010
with the Wall Street Journal, where
she was an assistant bureau chief

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.380
of the Journal's Washington Bureau.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.790
And I know that many of
you are fans, like I am,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.580
of seeing her on Sunday mornings
giving insightful, thoughtful words

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.600
for us all to think about.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.440
Now long before her life
working high profile jobs

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.170
in the country's top papers, she
experienced firsthand what it means

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.500
to be swept up in the larger
forces that make front page news.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.940
Her bestselling memoir,
the House at Sugar Beach,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.230
In Search of a Lost African
Childhood, published [applause],

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.370
published in 2008, poignantly
describes a world upended.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.030
The book begins with Cooper's
happy, secure upbringing as part

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.250
of quote what passed for the
landed gentry upper class

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.320
of Africa's first independent
country.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.620
The overthrow of the Liberian
Government in the 1980,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.150
brought chaos, violence and
tragedy to her own family,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.030
who were forced to flee to America.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.890
And with unsparing pros,
she recounts this past

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.020
and her ultimate return to
Liberia more than two decades

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.420
after a near death
experience in Iraq.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.140
Her newest book, Madame President,
The Extraordinary Journey

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.660
of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,
extends her work to biography.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.370
Sirleaf, who survived Liberia's
political and social upheaval,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.100
became the leader of
its women's movement

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.890
and was the first democratically
elected female President

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.190
in African history.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.130
And in 2011.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.330
You can give a hand for that.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.130
I see. Yeah.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.650
[Applause].

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.510
And in 2011 she received
the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.810
We are all thankful that
Ms. Cooper has returned

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.330
to her birth place
to write this book.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.530
And her book is impressive for
both its detail and insight

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.980
in providing something
that we can all look to.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.420
Ms. Sirleaf is reserved
in her personal life

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.170
and her presidency is
examined in this book.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:11.180
We are all thankful that Ms. Cooper
is extending her writing career

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.300
to biography and history
and we look so forward

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.210
to having her talk
and be with us today.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.530
Now, at the close of her
talk, you will have a chance

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.270
to ask her questions at
one of the microphones

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.540
that you see setup on the isles.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.390
And you should know that
this is being live streamed

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.690
and you are on camera.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.050
And you will be archived at the
Library of Congress [laughter].

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.620
So, make these questions good.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.510
So, please join me in giving a
warm welcome to Ms. Helene Cooper.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:58.950
[ Applause ]

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.420
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Hello.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.180
Thank you so much, Carla,
for that great introduction.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.030
This morning, I woke
up to the sound of rain

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.830
and I thought nobody
is going to come.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.290 position:56%
So, I am really happy to see that
all of you managed to make it today.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.280
You clearly are, like
myself, book lovers.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.660
For me, this book began
12 years ago while I was

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.490
on a reporting trip
in Eastern Congo.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.400
I did not know it at the time.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.090
We never realize in a moment when
significant things are happening.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.480
At least I do not.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.540
I have been on assignment for the
New York Times in Eastern Congo

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.010
as part of a series of
stories that I was writing

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.560
about development in Africa.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.370
I went to Ghana, to
Ethiopia, to Kenya.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.450
And I remember that with
each place I kept thinking

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.310
that despite the poverty and
challenges, none of them seemed

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.480
as bad off as my own home country
of Liberia, which had just come

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.400
out of two decades of civil war.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.730
Until that is, I got
to Bukavu in the Congo.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.160
Oh finally, now I am
home, I thought,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.030
as I crawled out of the
small single engine plane.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.480
After the semi desert of
Ethiopia in the Savannas of Kenya,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.890
Bukavu was otherworldly lush, just
like my home country of Liberia.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.510
Leafy green mountains,
luxuriate banana trees.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.030
The same beautiful verdant
landscape that we have in Liberia.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.850
And the same sense of
abandonment that comes

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.880
from having a population ravaged
by years of pointless wars.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.120
Hundreds of boys trolled the
streets with nowhere to go.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.170
Downtown buildings were marked with
holes from rockets and grenades.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.550
The only cars were the
white U.N. SUV vans.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.030
What struck me most though
in Bukavu were the women.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.610
As I drove into the city, I passed
women I had known all my life.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.590
There were old women
with huge bundles

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.290
of bamboo sticks on their backs.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.130 position:56%
There were market women in their
colorful dresses huddled at the side

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.430
of the road selling
oranges, eggs, nuts.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.340
There were young girls
sitting in front

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.180
of village huts bathing
their little brothers

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.760
and sisters in rubber buckets.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.530
No electricity was anywhere around.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.330 position:56%
But one 10-year-old girl had dragged
a bucket of dirty creek water

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.860 position:56%
up the hill to her house so she
could wash her four-year-old sister.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.780
These were the women that I
had grown up with in Liberia.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.130
The women all across Africa --

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.840
the worst place there
is to be a woman --

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.550
who somehow manage to carry that
entire continent on their backs.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.240
I remember one woman in particular,
who stood out to me in Bukavu.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.070
It was twilight when I passed her.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.790
And she was trudging up the hill

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.420
with all these logs
on her shoulders.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.460
Her husband was walking
just in front of her.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.760
He carried nothing.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.350
Nothing on his back.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.070
Nothing in his hands.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.880
Nothing. He kept turning around
and telling her to hurry up.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.910
That image has stayed
with me for 12 years.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.090
A few months after
my trip to Bukavu,

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.160
I was back in the United States.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.510
When the women of Liberia,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:37.190 position:56%
my home country staged an incredible
power play, defying centuries

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.520
of history in the most
patriarchal of places --

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.460
they flooded to the poles
and staged a democratic coup.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.480
They upended years of male rule
and voted for Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.890
to be President of Liberia.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:57.080 position:56%
The first woman to be democratically
elected President in Africa.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.550
I knew instantly that I
wanted to write about this.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.120
This book looks at
the what happened.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.690
It is a book about Ellen
Johnson Sirleaf and what it took

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.520
to upend all those years
of male rule in Liberia.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.720
But it is also a book
about what drove the women

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.750
who put her in power.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.520
And it is a book that looks at how
they did it, who these women got

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.060
so fed up with being exploited
and raped and assaulted

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.430
that they decided the only way
forward was to turn the tables

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.280
on the men anyway that they could.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.000
In 1985 a young Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf was thrown into jail

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.190
by Samuel Doe, who was then
the President of Liberia.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.860
She was put in a cell next to
men who were condemned to die.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.870
She listened in that
cell as the men next door

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.450
to her were executed
by a firing squad.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.150
Afterwards, she sat in the
corner of her [inaudible] cell.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.850
Her eyes squeezed shut.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.680
Her lips moving silently
as she prayed,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.520
wondering if the soldiers would
rape her before they killed her.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.980
Hours passed.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.390
Outside the soldiers drank
and became even rowdier.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:25.560
Then, just past midnight, one
soldier walked up to her cell.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.210 position:56%
Stood at the bars and stared at her.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.820
Several minutes passed in silence.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.440
Then he said, I am
going to fuck you.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.510
He opened the cell door
and Ellen rose to her feet.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.570
Her heart pounding.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.860
But just as the soldier
was entering her cell,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.060
a voice behind him
said, as you were.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.320
The soldier dropped his hands.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.170
Retreat said the voice.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.490
The soldier closed the cell
door, locked it and moved away.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.090
Her savoir stepped
forward into the light.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.460
He was slightly older than
the others, in his mid 20's,

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.780
with beautiful dark
skin and a serious face.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.380 position:56%
Looking at him, Ellen wanted to cry.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.320
They say you [foreign
language], he asked her.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.730
[Foreign language] she replied.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.240
Say something in Gola.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.950
[Foreign language], she said.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.170
Her rescuer stared at her
for what felt like forever.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:31.450
Finally, he said, okay I will stay
here tonight, nobody will harm you.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.530
So on that night, Ellen
Johnson Sirleaf was not raped.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.210
But someone else was.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.760
A young Geo girl who also
had been captured and brought

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.020
to Shefland [assumed spelling]
was gang raped by soldiers there

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.680
in the early hours of the morning.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.450
As Ellen huddled in her cell.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.460 position:56%
Whether Ellen's would be rapist took
part as well, she would never know.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.470
After brutalizing the girl,
the soldiers brought her naked

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.650
and crying hysterically into
Ellen's cell and pushed her in.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.020
she looked to be around 19 or 20.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.480
She was bleeding and her
eyes were wild with fear.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.980
Jumping up, Ellen put
her arms around her

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.450
and lowered her onto the floor.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.830
In the corner, the two rocked back
and forth clutching each other.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.270
Slowly the girl's cry softened.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.880
Her naked body started to tremble.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.300
Leaving her new cellmate for a
moment, Ellen went up to the bars.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.690
There were a few soldiers milling

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.460
around alongside the
one who had rescued her.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.680
[Foreign language], Ellen said.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.660
Her voice shaking.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.410
The soldiers looked at her.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.240
She tried again.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.510
Think about your sisters.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.530
Still nothing.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.830
I beg you.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.570
At least bring [inaudible]
something for the child to wear.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.690
Finally, one of the men laughed
and brought back a piece of cloth.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.130
And Ellen helped the
girl cover herself.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.620
For the rest of the night,
the two huddled side by side.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.920
They did not sleep.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.790
Just sat and rocked back and
forth as the minutes ticked away

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.670
until dawn when the
soldiers came for Ellen.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.010
As she walked to the jeep, Ellen
looked at her young Geo cellmate.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.370
The two women had spent
less than 12 hours together.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.950
One was now going to face the
man she was certain would be

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.720
her executioner.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.120
The other was staying with the men
who were certain to rape her again.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.590
The jeep pulled away and
Ellen turned in the seat

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.170
to stare back at the young girl.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.450
She would never see her again.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.660
But in many ways, that young
Geo girl would change the course

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.130
of history in West Africa.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.220
The Geo girl would become
another stick, a fuel in the fire

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.110
of the women's movement in Liberia.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.640
Little girls do not come
out of the womb vowing

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.580
to become activists
for female power.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.810
They do not spend their
childhood thinking

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.400
about how they will repair
their dignities large

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.530
and small that bleed women daily.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.120
It is a series of things that
multiply and turn ordinary women

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.210
into movements of female
determination.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.940
You are living your
life sweeping floors

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.760
at a Reninbaum [assumed spelling]
drug store in Madison Wisconsin

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.570
when your husband storms
in to yell at you

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.060
in front of your white boss lady.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.710 position:56%
You are stunned by the violent shock

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.140
of a hand slapping your face
delivered by the man who promised

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.260
to love, honor and cherish
you until death do you part.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.210
You feel the warm, wet skin

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.230
of a brutalized naked hysterical
young woman as she crouches

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.640 position:56%
in the corner bleeding after being
savaged by the men who sworn an oath

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.000
to protect Liberia and her people.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.530
I wanted to be a school teacher
like my mother, Ellen said,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.270
looking back 30 years later.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.480 position:56%
Describing that night at the
Shefland [assumed spelling] Barracks

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.040
to me, she would use the
mental sleight of hand

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.850
that is common amongst
survivors of unimaginable horror.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.050
She would relive the events of that
night with no emotion whatsoever.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.990
The joy ride on the beach, which
the soldier told her would be her

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.860
execution site.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.290
The useless pleas from
the condemned men

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.960
that she found a way
to help them be spared.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.550
The overwhelming terror of men
who know they are about to die.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.290
The overwhelming terror of
knowing you are about to be raped.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.560 position:56%
The gut clutching anger of holding a
young woman after she has been raped

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.890
by soldier after soldier
after soldier after soldier.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.300
That is what I wanted to do
when I was young, Ellen said.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:30.600
To teach. But the young
Ellen, the [inaudible],

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.160
may have started off wanting to
teach, but this was not a woman

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.540 position:56%
who is destined for the [inaudible].

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.620
Hers would be a different destiny.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.070
One launched in a jeep by the young
Geo girl who had been her cellmate.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.330 position:56%
President Doe did not realize it,
but in locking Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.390
up in jail, he created both
an international cause celeb

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:56.310
and ignited the women's
movement in Liberia.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.530
All across Liberia young women
were riveted by the story

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.870
of this jailed female political
dissident, who was standing

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.380
up to the men running the country.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.490
Eventually, after a year and
under pressure from women's groups

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.810
in the international
community, Doe released Ellen.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.530
But he had created a monster.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.140
The stage was now set
for the revolution

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.660
that will overturn gender
politics in West Africa.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:30.050
But the men still had one more
act to play and it was a doozy.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.370
I could stand up here
for hours going

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.840
on about what Charles
Taylor did to Liberia.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.770
But that needs to be the
subject of his own book.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.330
The tribal war he started.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.880
The child soldiers.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.560
The hundreds of thousands
of people killed.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.580
The wars he launched in Sierra
Leone and in the Ivory Coast.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.190
He kidnapped children from
their terrified mothers.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.490
His forces went on a
raping and killing spree

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.580
that spared almost no one.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.290
Once again, as they had
so many times before,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.300
it was the Liberian women that
carried the country through.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.900
While the men were waging war,

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.020
the women in Liberia
all became market women.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.240
Traveling by foot to the border
to get food to bring back

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.620
to a starving population.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.770
They had the babies of their
rapists in the forests.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.290
Strapped those babies on
their backs and went back

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.730
into their market stalls
or sat on the side

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.580
of the road selling oranges.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.270
And they bided their time.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.270
When the war finally ended,
they made their power play.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:39.510
In 2005, 12 years before pantsuit
nation became a secret Facebook

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.050 position:56%
group, and I am with her buttons and
bumper stickers sprouted on lapels

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:49.540 position:56%
and SUV's here in America, the
women of Liberia held a master class

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.510
in how to get a female
elected president.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.630
[ Applause ]

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.650
They had a perfect vehicle for
their guerrilla campaign --

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.090
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.000 position:56%
A woman who was supremely qualified,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.050
who by far out qualified
the men who were running.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.470
But who also had no
qualms whatsoever

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.790
about playing dirty politics

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:20.080
and fighting any dirt the men
would fling with smellier dirt.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.030
The election came down to a choice

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.700
between the 67-year-old Harvard
educated global bureaucrat

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.710
and the professional
football player George Weah.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.110
George Weah was a world
renowned football player.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.460
He was a start in Europe
where he was a striker

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.940
for the Italian team A.C. Milan.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.390
In 1995 Weah won the Ballon d'Or.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.070
He was named FIFA World
Player of the Year

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.030
and African Player of the Century.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.790
Two goals in particular stood up.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:54.710
One was against Bayern in 1994
when he embarrassed not one or two,

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:59.220
but three Bayern defenders with his
quick pivots before letting rip a

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.470
gorgeous sally into the near post.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:08.490
The other goal known around the
world as the goal was in 1996

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.890
when Weah destroyed
the Verona midfield

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:15.050
as he single handedly slalomed
his way down the pitch, twitching,

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.620
turning, bucking and weaving
all the way to the Verona goal

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.960
in a legendary performance
that Liberians

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960
who watched it using their
makeshift tiger batteries

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.610
because there was no electricity,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.810
still talked about
it a decade later.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.840
That Weah had no college education
did not bother his youthful

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.050
supporters, who countered that
the Verona goal showed its

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.050
own education.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:41.610
At the other end of the spectrum
was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.330
Finance minister under
former President Tolbert,

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.270
dissident under former President
Doe, United Nations, World Bank,

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.550
IMF, Pedigree, Allied,
turned fool of Taylor.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.900
She had morphed from an abused
wife, cowering and hunched

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.360
in the front seat of her
husband's car while he beat her

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.030
to an international bureaucrat
and iconic political dissident,

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:08.290
who was attempting to do something
no woman had ever done before.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:13.070
Win by popular vote the right
to lead an African country.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.980
The men all fell in line behind
George Weah and then complained

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.490
that the women supporting
Ellen were sexist [laughter].

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.240
It was a remarkable display.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.500
Given the choice between
a football player

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.100
with no credible college
education, but two fantastic goals

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:35.330 position:56%
against Bayern and Verona, and a
Harvard educated development expert.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.150 position:56%
The top male presidential candidates
who fell short in the runoff

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:43.180
with one exception,
endorse the football player.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.490
Weah meanwhile honing
his message for why he

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.630
and not the old lady
should run Liberia settled

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.650
on an educated people
have failed theme.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.740
You know book, you not know
book, I will vote for you,

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.270
became the Weah runoff slogan.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.110
And that theme was endorsed

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:05.660
by the failed male presidential
candidates who endorsed him.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.440
Liberia had one of the lowest
literacy rates in the world.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.840
So an illiterate population
would identify with a president

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.310
who dropped out of school, right?

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.750
Wrong. What the men who
endorsed that strategy failed

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:23.320
to realize is how much the very
idea was angering the market women.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.130
Those women may not have
been educated themselves.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.670
But they worked day and night in
the fields and the market stalls

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.720
to send their children to school.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.090
Now the men were telling them
that education was not important.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.420 position:56%
Just as the men fell in behind Weah,
the women fell in behind Ellen.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.720
It did not happen all at once.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.490
Female political candidates had
appeared all over the ballot

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.990
in the elections running for senate
and the house on the same ticket

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.010
as Weah and Tubman and
the other male candidates.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.460
But once the time came for
campaigning for the runoff,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.470
those allegiances peeled
away, as even the women

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.750
who were staunch members of parties

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.910
that oppose Ellen's unity party
abandoned their men and took

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.120 position:56%
up a new mantra -- vote for a woman.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.210 position:56%
Door to door the market women passed
out T-shirts and handed out flyers.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.190
They slept on the side of the road
at night curled up on their mats.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:23.550 position:56%
They walked from village to village
exhorting women to vote for a woman.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.910
We as supporters responded by
predicting that if she lost,

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.830
the country would go back to war.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.040
No Weah, no peace -- they chanted.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.660
Thus the runoff started
resembling past elections,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.370
like the one in 1985, in which
Doe supporters had suggested the

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.670
same thing.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.750
Vote for Doe or the
country goes back to war.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.130
In Liberia this tactic was how
men managed to get their way.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.850
They simply threatened the people.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:54.930
Except that in November 2005, they
appeared to have met their match

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.980
because the women had
their own tricks.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.970
Tricks that would make Weah's
tactics look like boys play.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.270
You want beer?

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.230
Jack, give me your voter ID
card, I will buy you beer.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.840
I say we buy voter
ID cards [inaudible].

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.590
Who looking for money?

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.070
Jack, bring your voter ID card.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.020
The group of women had
stationed themselves

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.870
at a bar near the ELW8
junction, a major intersection

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.850
in Monrovia along the
road to Roberts Field.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:41.600 position:56%
The women set to work luring the
young men in a time honored fashion.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.240
Except this time it was
not sex on the table.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.570
This time the women were
the ones with the cash

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.330
and the young men were the ones
with the commodity for sale.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.920
Some of those boys
were finish stupid,

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.380
one market woman recalled
with a smirk.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.060
She was happy to go into detail

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.740
about what she called the
women's crafty techniques.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.300
We were crafty she said,
one silver tooth glinting

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.500
in the sunshine as she laughed.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.040
Many of the young men thought
that they were done with voting

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.230
after the first round
and did not understand

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.680
that they would need their ID cards
again if their man was actually

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.710
to assume the presidency.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.540
Others knew and did not care.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:24.000
Late in the evening of a muggy
hot day, the lure of a crispy cold

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.170 position:56%
and multi-club beer far out shown
whatever benefits they thought their

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.790
voter ID cards could bring them.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.320
As for the ones who were too
smart to sell their voter card,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.830
well their mothers simply
stole them [laughter].

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.360
Some of the [inaudible] said
they would be voting [inaudible],

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.120
voting for George Weah, they
[inaudible] their ID cards,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.210
Parley Harris said [assumed
spelling] said, looking sheepish

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.980
and defiant at the same time.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.990
One market woman who agreed
to be referred to as the Oma,

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.560
said she snuck into her son's
room while he was sleeping.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.990
Slipped his voter ID
card out of his wallet

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.540
and buried it in the
yard [laughter].

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.560
Years later there was
no shame among the women

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.860
who stole their son's ID cards.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.600
Yeah I took it.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.030
So what? The Oma said.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.210
That foolish boy, what he knew?

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.930
I carried him for nine months.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.230
I took care of him.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.960
I fed him when he were hungry.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.360
Then he would take the whole
country and give it away?

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.410
You would get elephant heads or
childhood [inaudible] [laughter].

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:35.470
[ Applause ]

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.340
After burying their
son's voter ID cards,

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.220
the women supporting Ellen then dug

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.070
up an old video of
a naked George Weah.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.610
Somehow a 14-year-old commercial
for cologne that Weah made

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.150
in Italy just happened to
surface in the Liberian media.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.400
In the commercial, Weah at the
time a world famous striker

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.060
with the football team A.C.
Milan, walks into a restaurant

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.400
to greet his white dinner date
after dousing himself in cologne.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.880
He is fully clothed
at the beginning.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.170
But when the woman sees him from
across the room, she is so overcome

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.040
that she imagines him naked.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.020 position:56%
The commercial then cuts to a naked
Weah strolling across the restaurant

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.760 position:56%
to his date, while other white women

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.190
in the restaurant drool
and fan themselves.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.570
Finally, Weah arrives at the table,

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.090
leans over it towards
his date and smiles.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.310
When he sits down,
he is clothed again.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.770
And he says suavely,
[foreign language].

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:41.950
To get an idea of how
this commercial played

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.600
in Liberia [laughter], you have

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.730
to understand this countries
bible spouting puritanism

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.440
and its deep racial scars.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.260
Many of the freed American slaves

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.600 position:56%
who founded Liberia were the mixed
race children of white slave owners,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.940 position:56%
who proceeded to setup the same kind
of society from which they had fled.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.000
Except this time, the lighter skin
colonists were the upper class,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.930
lording it up over
the native Liberians.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.180
So matters of race still
struck deep into the heart

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.400
of the average Liberians.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.410
That is why for many
Liberians it was bad enough

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.630
that Weah was strutting
around naked on Italian TV,

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.330
but in front of white women.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.960
That was too much.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.250
Weah walked butt naked
screamed the headline

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.570 position:56%
in the New Democrat Newspaper, which
provided this hilarious synopsis

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.530
of the commercial for those
without access to YouTube.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:41.020
The video seen portrays white women
in looks of sexual awe and ecstasy,

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.730
glancing at the black man
with his athletic build

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.660
and muscular features exposing
his genitals flipping walking

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.960
before them.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:54.740
Weah's political supporters
tried to brazen their way out.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.950
Mr. Weah committed no
crime by posing butt naked,

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.510
one party official [laughter]
helpfully told reporters.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.880
Only constitutional deviants
should not be elected.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.990
But the body politic quickly dusted
off their holier than thou clothes.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.330
Adopting the convoluted
sentence structure,

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.370
at which Liberian men
were particularly adept.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:19.990
Joshua Duncan Freedom, Principal of
the Kind Pentecostal High School,

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.900
told reporters if the
congress for democratic change

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.940
through its vocal [inaudible]

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.650
and justify George
Weah's butt naked video

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.580
on the international
information super highway

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.620
on some constitutional right, then
Liberia must be prepared God forbid

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.620
under a CDC rule to give audience
to the legality and normalness

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.560
of murder and even
cannibalism [laughter].

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.430 position:56%
The truth is this cloak of religious
indigitation simply covered

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.840
up what Liberians of both
sexes were really mad about.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.050
That Weah was flashing his
oiled, well chiseled body,

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.750
buttocks included in
front of white women.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.650
Liberian women saw it as a
rejection of black women.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.300
Liberian men were jealous.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.460
Either way, this was a
loser issue for Weah,

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:13.030
as Ellen supporters
knew it would be.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:16.870
On Tuesday, November 8th, the
people of Liberia woke up and went

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.830
to the polls for the
second time in four weeks.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.070
There was a real and
palpable sense in the air

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.200
that something big was happening.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.420
Helpful poll workers
at a polling station

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.240
in Sinkor were allowing pregnant
women and nursing mothers to cut

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.800
to the front of the line.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.980
So Bernice Freeman, Louise Yussa
[assumed spelling] and a handful

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.400
of other women were passing around
babies and toddlers [laughter].

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.860
You want borrow the baby,
Bernice was grinning at one woman,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.420
sneaking a furtive
look over her shoulder.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.240
Put a baby on your back.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.590
To another woman she had
advised, act pregnant.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:54.780
If they think you are pregnant,
you can vote in the front.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.330
It was unclear whether the poll
workers noticed how many different

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.780
women were carrying the
same baby [laughter].

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.510
The [foreign language].

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.910
That night a bunch of women were
listening to the election news

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.470
when an informant came
in with an update.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.310
The official results
were not in yet.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.160
Some polls were still open.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.120
The final tally would
not be known for weeks.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.530
But already there was a whisper in
the air from Ellen's spies posted

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.460
at different polling placed.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:27.540 position:56%
People were not supposed to disclose
voting trends at the polling booths

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.670
for fear of swaying those who
had not cast their vote, yet.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.750
Yet. But all across the country,

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.870
Ellen's army of women were finding
ways to skirt the regulation.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.760
For Lusoo Sloan [assumed spelling],
the work around came by reverting

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.970
to an old nursery school chant used
to teach children the alphabet.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.870
S-O so. G-O go.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.700
N-O no. Every Liberian
kid knows this chant.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.410
For Lusoo on runoff night, the
chant took on a new meaning.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.050
Hanging outside a polling booth,

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.520
she nervously asked an
informant how the vote was going.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.340
He eyed the voting officials in
attendance, then grinned slightly.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.180
S-O so. G-O go.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.950
N-O no, he sang.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.520
Then he added, U-P up.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.690
Unity Party up.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:13.910
Lusoo started dancing
and singing glee.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.430
S-O so. G-O go.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.970
N-O no. U-P up.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:21.580
U-P up. When the election officials
glared at her, she sassed them.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.230
You cannot stop me from
singing my S-O so, she said.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.510
U-P up. She went to
bed that night singing.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.660
The old lady was in the lead.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.420
On Wednesday morning Ellen woke
up and walked into her living room

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.120
to find it already full
of campaign aides excited

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.970
about the preliminary returns
from Lofa and Nimba Counties.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.500
She was not just in the lead.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.820
She was in the lead by a lot.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.160
60 percent to 40 percent.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.890
It was a lead that she never
relinquished during the days

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.880
of counting that followed.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.690
The old lady would
be Madame President.

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.100
Out of the 25 years of carnage
that was Liberia's decent

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.340
into hell had emerged a new leader.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.130
And that person was a
67-year-old grandma.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:07.380
On November 23rd after the
official results were announced,

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.830
Ellen was heading back to her house

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.940
from Campaign Headquarters
juggling congratulatory phone calls

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.560
from all over the world.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.110
In the backseat of her
SUV, her American friend,

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.740
Steve Cashin, turned
to her grinning.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.050
The White House just
called, he said.

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.510 position:56%
President Bush wants to talk to you.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:28.010
He recited a very secure
encrypted phone number.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.900
Call that number.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.790
A minute later Ellen
was on the phone

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.720
with the American President
accepting his congratulations.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.890
Then the phone went dead.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.410
Liberia in 2005 had no
landlines thanks to the war.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.320
So everyone used cell phones.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.990
They paid for that service
from Lonestar Cell Company

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.820
by purchasing scratch cards

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.230
from [inaudible] boys
on the side of the road.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.260
The President Elect of Liberia
had just run out of credit

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.450
on her scratch card [laughter].

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.680
Turning to Cashin, Ellen smirked,

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.290
this is not very presidential
at all is it?

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.230
When word spread about
Ellen's victories,

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.860
the markets of Monrovia emptied
as the women who minded the stalls

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.450
at Rally Time and Nancy Door
[assumed spelling] and Red Light

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.020
and Painsfield [assumed spelling]
ran jubilant into the streets.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.320
Go to school!

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.620
Go to school!

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.920
Some of them yelled.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.220
Do not play football [laughter].

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:25.380
I still think about that
woman I saw in Bukavu

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.410
in the Congo all those
years ago, the one walking

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:32.130
with her husband carrying
all those logs on her back.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.480
In so many ways, I guess
this book is for her.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.780
Thank you.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.580
And I am happy to answer
any questions.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:57.430
[ Applause ]

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.340
&gt;&gt; Hi thank you for your
wonderful presentation.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.640
I was expecting a lot.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.410
I was not expecting nudity,
so that was great [laughter].

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: You need to really
Google the George Weah naked video.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.710
&gt;&gt; I am afraid now.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.010
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Nah
you got to do it.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.160
I have spent hundreds
of times in, you know,

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.100
research hours watching
it [laughter].

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.400
&gt;&gt; Research.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.810
I like research a lot that way.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.220
My question is actually.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.480
There is a big part of
Johnson Sirleaf's story that is

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.780
to do with her education.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.260
And I had the opportunity to
meet her about 10 years ago just

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.990 position:56%
after she was elected, very briefly.

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:30.640
I am sure she does not
remember me, obviously.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.820
And she talked a lot about
how she wanted to do a lot

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.850
around education for her country.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:40.130
And then surprisingly though 10
years later progress has not been

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:41.430
as fast as expected.

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:45.120
And last she made a controversial
decision to bring in a public

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.410 position:56%
for profit education company, Bridge
Academies, and just to like kind

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.200
of collective gasp of
education advocates and sort

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.870
of public education
advocates and I am wondering.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.200
Because I understand that she
has a lot of competing priorities

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.990
and number she would
be committed to that.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.810
Do you have any insight
about why maybe

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.390
in a broader spectrum what
she is up against in terms

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.130
of bringing education for
all to the kids of Liberia.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.950
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Education is
a huge deal and for the entirety

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:17.730
of her presidency, test scores
in Liberia stayed in the toilet.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.770
A big part of that is
because of the Civil War.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:24.260 position:56%
You have to remember that for almost
two decades everything stopped.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.560
Nobody went to school.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.540
So you do not have, you
do not even have teachers

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.220
in Liberia today who are able.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.380
It is not just a matter
of building schools.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.280
You have to have people who
know how to read and write

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.980
in order to teach students.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.300
And so it is such a
big, a big challenge.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.600
It is a huge uphill battle.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.590 position:56%
I think her decision to bring in
Bridge was definitely controversial.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:47.190
But it is not as if
the education system

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.800
in Liberia could get any worse
than it already has been.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.590
It has been pretty, pretty bad.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.380
So, I am very curious
to see how Bridge does.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.820
I am sort of a skeptic myself.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.590
But at this point people are
throwing a lot of different ideas

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.360
out there in an effort to get.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.580
One thing that is a little bit
hopeful though is now I spent.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.360
Whenever I go back to Liberia,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.430
I do go into schools
and I talk to students.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:17.330
And one thing I have noticed
is that the young girls

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.760
in the school systems in
Liberia now seem to all think

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.250
that they can be president,
which is actually,

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:28.860
it has been kind of
a cool thing to see.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.650
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:33.950
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Hi.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.600
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to say first of
all, I enjoyed your commentary

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.700
on Meet the Press when you are on.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.330
So thank you so much for that.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.630
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Thank you.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.160
[ Applause ]

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.660
&gt;&gt; My question has to
do with an ancestor.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:55.120
My great grandfather had visited
Monrovia in about 1920-21.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.610
And what I would like to know is
they did, someone did an interview

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.820
with him but we do
not have the masthead

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.130
to tell us where the source was.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:10.470
Since the Civil War,
are there any records

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.540
or archival information available?

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.300
I do not know what the,
the structure sounds

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.500 position:56%
like it you know is kind of tore up.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:26.250
So, do you know if there is any,
the newspapers or any other source?

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.550
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Yes and no.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.180
There is a history
museum in Monrovia.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.480
But they have got.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.780
It was destroy.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.780
It was very, not completely
destroyed,

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.070
but it was crippled during the
Civil War and a lot of stuff was,

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.610
a lot of artifacts were destroyed.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.770
So there is something
that is still there.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:46.570
There is a national
archives in Liberia.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.010
So, you know, you can look there.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:54.200
There is. Liberia has a very, very
healthy newspaper competition.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.540
And there is a health press there.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.930
So there are a lot of newspapers.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.150
But I do not know if they
are going to have archives

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.900
that are going to go back to 1920.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.200
So, it sort of.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.930
You might have to go and kind of.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.240
I mean, I think it
would help if you know,

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.000
if you knew who did the
interview and where.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.100
Did it appear in a newspaper?

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.830
&gt;&gt; I believe it appeared
in a newspaper

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.590
because of the way it was written.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Yeah but they were
not doing microfiche and that kind

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.800
of stuff in Liberia back then.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.100
So.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.990
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well maybe I
will visit the country.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.290
Thank you.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:33.590
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for your book.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.890
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Thank you.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.190
&gt;&gt; I mean I have worked with
President Sirleaf for a while.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.290
And I am continuing
on a project with her.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.650
And your book was just.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:46.600
I did not think anything could
get better than her autobiography.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.730
But the way that you were
able to extract that,

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:53.930
merge it with your own interviews
and put your objective lens on it.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.830
I mean it really is,
it is a tour de force.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.130
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Thank you.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.310
&gt;&gt; For people who want to
read on women in politics.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:03.120
My question to you is now

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:08.250
that President Sirleaf's
presidency is coming to an end

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:12.270
and you have had the Liberian
education trust with the, you know,

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:17.200
with the success that she has
had in education in that arena.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.500
You have got the rebuilding
of the hospitals,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.630
some of the roads are back.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.840
You certainly have.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.140
She has gotten.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:31.210
She is indicted and bringing to
trial some of the major leaders

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:32.900
in the government for corruption.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.690
And of course Ebola.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:40.700
What do you think her most
long lasting legacy is?

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.610
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: I think
it has got to be the women.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.980
It is. There is no way, no matter.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.630
And she has had.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.680
She has had sort of.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.400 position:56%
There is. She has a lot of flaws and
her 12 years have disappointed a lot

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.400
of people who expected more,

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.190 position:56%
while at the same time she has still
been the best that we have had ever.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:09.180
But I think that when you look at
the legacy that she leaves behind,

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:15.380
I cannot say enough how big
a deal that gender barrier

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.740
that she busted through is.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:24.970
The idea that all over Liberia you
have women who have now carried,

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.650
who have for years
carried this country

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.220
on their backs economically
realizing that they can turn

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.580
that into political power.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.420
And you do not have a viable female
candidate running to replace her.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.280
But that does not matter
because I think

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.400
that in the future the women now
have understand these market women

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.550
now understand just how powerful
they can be when they want to.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:47.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.330
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Thank you.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:57.010
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was an education volunteer
in Liberia I think around the time

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.240
when your first book came out
and before, in preparation

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.470 position:56%
for my trip I tried to find and read
as much as possible about Liberia

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:12.050
and most of the books were
out of print at that time.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:18.800
I ended up going to Liberia, loving
my experience and lived there

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.340
for three years and now
I am actually getting PhD

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.220
and my topic is around Liberia.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:33.210
And my question to you is I
want to know if you could talk

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:39.030 position:56%
about where you see or what your
intent is in terms of historiography

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:46.360 position:56%
on Liberia and a lot of the material
that is out there is inaccurate

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.000
or just there are lots
of gaps in that as well.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.340 position:56%
So I am wondering if you could speak
to history on Liberia and literature

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:59.810
that may be coming out
or what you see there.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.110
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Well
you are right.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:02.910
There is not a lot out there.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.930
I realized that when I was
working on my first book.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.980 position:56%
But there is more than people think.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.550
And there is a growing cadre

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.700
of Liberian writers,
who are also putting.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.190
And some of them are here now.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.380
Who are putting their
own stories to paper.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.510 position:56%
So I think you are going to see, you
are going to see more coming out.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.250
But you are absolutely right.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.130
There is a lot of things were
destroyed during the war.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.430
This is a culture.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.410
Liberia is a culture
that has much more

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:34.760
of an oral tradition
than a written one.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:40.410
And the writing is starting,
is you know picking up now.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.380
But no we do not have a lot of.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.130
There are history books on Liberia.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:49.620
But you are again right that
not all of them are accurate.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:55.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, I too wanted to thank
you for Madame President.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.120
I just finished reading it.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.460
I am a return Peace Corp volunteer
and I actually taught history

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.070
and English at Senacaly [assumed
spelling] Central High School.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.370
And there was.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.160
And this was in the 60's.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.630
And there was only one
woman in my classes.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:12.430
There were not all that men either

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:16.800
because the high school was
fairly new and you know.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.960
So the students were
like in their 30's

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.190
who were graduating
from high school.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.810
But there was only that one
woman and I always felt for her.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.110
But, I wondered.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.480
It is my understanding there
was another election that is

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:35.430
around the corner in Liberia and
there are a bunch of candidates.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:38.310
I believe Weah is running again.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.940
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: He could win.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.460
&gt;&gt; That is what I was
going to ask you.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.070
What is your perspective
on that election?

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.940
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: It is going
to be a great election to cover.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.880
As a reporter I am like drooling

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.210
because you have all
these characters running.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:53.630
Not just Weah, who.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.810
But Charles Taylor's
wife is running.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.750
His former allies are running.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.350
We have got George Weah's
baby momma was running,

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.650
but she just pulled out.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:03.950
[Laughter].

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:08.090
It is such a. It is
like it is such a great.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.790 position:56%
I mean, Liberia is, as a reporter it
is like shooting fish in a barrel.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.890
You just go there and
the stories just pile up.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.350
I think it is going
to be interesting.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:21.310
You have this Pepsi Cola heir,
former board of directors,

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.740
executive of Pepsi, Alex Cummings.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.120
And there is the Vice President,
who is sort of viewed as kind

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.580
of the establishment candidates.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.880
But it is.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.180
You know, Liberia.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.480
Liberians can be very perverse.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.120 position:56%
And I do not at this point know who
they are going to end up going with.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.190
I do not think anybody
can call it right now.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.150
It is completely a free for all.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.760
I cannot wait to go
home to cover it.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.580
&gt;&gt; Are the women coalescing behind
any candidate for this election?

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.880
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: No.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.720
And in. Back in 2005 they had not,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.740
at this point in the election
cycle they had not coalesced behind

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.820
Ellen either.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.420
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Thank you.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.720
Yes sir?

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.190
&gt;&gt; Helene first I want to thank
you for writing this book.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:05.570
It is. It is very impressive

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.440
that like women's history
is coming to the limelight.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.040
My question is in 38 days from now
we are going to have an election

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.150
in the Liberia, specifically
on October 10th or October 8th.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:22.580
It is most likely that this
naked soccer player is going

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.310
to be the next president.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.760
What are your thoughts about,
what is this going to mean

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.060
for the future of Liberia?

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.630
The economy is a mess.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.070
Healthcare is a mess.

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:35.280
Education is a mess.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.730
And the citizens are
hungry for, you know,

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:43.550
much more because they you know,
they have been disappointed a bit.

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:46.660
A lot of the things that
have improved in Liberia,

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:50.240
as far as the security, as far
as other parts of the economy.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:56.100
But you know going forward, what
do you think this is going to mean

00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:01.090
as far as this, what are these
people, either his baby momma

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.860
or someone else becoming president.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.970
And also what do you think Ellen
is going to do going forward

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:11.420
to remain part of Liberia's
fabric, political fabric,

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.100
as well as societal fabric.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.400
Thank you.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.700
&gt;&gt; Helene Cooper: Thank you.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.000 position:56%
First of all, so I would not assume.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.670
I do not think it is
a foregone conclusion

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.210
that George Weah is going to win.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:25.970
I think it is, as I said earlier
I think it is a free for all.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.030
I think anybody at
this point could win.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:34.970
And I think that, you know,
maybe people grow into roles.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:40.160
I do think that one of the
reasons I find, one of the places

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.320
where I find optimism
is that in the 12 years

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.470
that Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has been
president, she has really opened

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:51.520
up freedom of speech and freedom
of the press in Liberia to levels

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.950
that we have never had before.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:56.990
So the Liberian people are far
less tolerant of the sort of things

00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:00.220
that they accepted decades ago.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.950
That is one of the reasons why
with Ebola, Liberia was hit harder

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.600
than either Sierra Leone or Guinea.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.780
But Liberia came out of
it much faster than either

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.130
of those other two countries.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.250
And I think that is in large part

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.030
because Liberian people were
not going to tolerate you know,

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.080
the kind of inaptitude that would
cause this to linger and linger.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.760
So, I think that the sort of free
for all atmosphere that we have

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.900
in Liberia and the freedom
of speech and the freedom

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.330
to criticize is something
that Liberians are not going

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.350
to be willing to let go of.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.390
And I think that is
something that causes me

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.270
to feel a little bit more
optimistic about our future.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:43.280
I am being shown a rap it up sign.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.970
So, I think this is all the
time that we have today.

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:52.310
I really appreciate all of you
coming in on this rainy Saturday.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.750
Thank you very much.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.890
[Applause].

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:59.750

of the Library of Congress.
