00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.700
Cedar balls: the kind of balls that you put in the closet to chase away insects.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.120
Now, one positive thing you can say about
this experiment is that it smells nice,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.960
and you can't say that about many
experiments.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.780
[Brady]: Oh, can I smell?
[Professor]: Yes, yes.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.620
[Brady]: (sniffs) Mmm, yeah.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.400
[Professor]: I should probably polish them because I've been using them for a long time.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.670
Here is a soup bowl that I sto...
I mean, borrowed from a cafeteria in Cambridge,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
and if I put a few balls -- let's say three -- and swirl

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.320
you see that the balls circulate in the direction that I'm swirling.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.740
"Of course," you say.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
Now when I say "swirl" I mean: do this motion.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.820
I'm not actually rotating the whole thing, I'm just doing this.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.420
So when I swirl, those balls circulate in the direction that I'm swirling;

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.520
I'm swirling in this direction and balls circulate in the same direction; that is, counter-clockwise.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.140
But now, let's increase the number of balls;
make them more crowded.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.140
When I swirl now

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.240
the balls start circulating in the *wrong*
direction, opposite direction.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.540
So there was a transition.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.760
With one ball the circulation is the same direction as the swirl.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.340
Two, three we have already seen, they circulate in the same direction.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.460
Four it's still the same direction.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.140
But five there's a lot of hesitation.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.500
Six.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.380
But at seven it's pretty clear that they're circulating in the opposite direction.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.000
And eight and so on.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.920
This is quite remarkable.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.200
And it's a bit like a phase transition -- if you like -- a total phase transition between gas and liquid.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.520
When you have only a few of those balls and I swirl, these balls are independent particles

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.550
they don't talk to one another,
they are minding their own businesses.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.130
And what happens is that whenever the wall of the soup bowl bangs against one of them,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.810
it just transmits the bang, linear momentum,
in the same direction.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.350
So if I'm swirling like that, they are being sent in the same direction;

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.130
that's why they are the circulating the same direction that I'm swirling,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.450
because they are not talking to one another, they are independent particles.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.580
In contrast, when you increase the crowdedness,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.100
whatever linear momentum I input into the system

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.340
gets scattered among the neighboring contacts because they are very closely touching one another.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.240
But what doesn't get wasted
is the rubbing phenomenon.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.560
So. Imagine that you have a ball like this, and then the wall of the soup bowl rubs against this.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.460
Not only does it get pushed away,
but it also gets rotated like that.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.040
And this rotation is transmitted because the neighbors are very close to the next one, the next one, the next one.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.920
So this rotation is propagated among all the entire group.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.480
So the linear momentum is being wasted,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.360
but the angular momentum -- that is, a tendency to keep rotating;

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.280
that's the quantity that measures how much there is rotation -- gets transmitted.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.600
So you have a transition
from the linear momentum dominated regime

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.700
to the angular momentum dominated regime.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.260
And what happens is that when you rub it like this
it rolls in the direction opposite.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.840
It starts moving globally, drifting in the direction opposite to the way I'm pushing.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.200
That's why there is this take over effect.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.320
And that is really a little bit like 
-- in some facetious fashion --
like a transition between gas and condensing to liquid.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.060
Because you see in gas, molecules are
just flying around minding their own businesses;

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.800
they're free and they don't really talk to one another,
and they bounce against the wall of vessel,
and then they bounce.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.300
But when you are a liquid, you have molecules that are touching against each other;

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:45.860
they can slide against each other, but they interact a lot.
So it is really like a transition from gas to liquid.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.640
And the order parameter is increasing the crowdedness, is like lowering the temperature, or increasing the pressure.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.690
And if you keep making them more and more crowded then they eventually freeze solid completely.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.610
So you see this is really like a phase transition.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760
Ok, now...

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.200
One or two perhaps details...

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.380
When you have, say, so many,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.040
we've already seen that collectively they circulate in the direction opposite to the direction I'm swirling.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.139
That's true.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.799
Please look at individual balls; for example the middle one is probably easiest see.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.600
I'm going to swirl the whole thing counter-clockwise like this.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.900
You can see that the middle one is also

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.600
spinning;  going around around
in the counter-clockwise fashion.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.180
And it's the same for any of the individual balls. 
For example look at this one; when I

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.520
swirl like that, this one is drawing a
trajectory which looks like this.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.620
It's still counter-clockwise but there's a
global drift which goes clockwise.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.300
So it's quite interesting that the
individually they're still doing the right thing, so to speak,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.700
but together there's a purely collective group behavior that emerges, which does exactly the wrong thing.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.020
So it's really not what's happening to individual particles, individual molecules, that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.580
-- how they are behaving together --

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.020
that is the collective phenomenon that emerges.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.760
The way to analyze this is ...

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.580
Of course, you know, rotations of three dimensional balls, that's very complicated,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.080
you should do it in two dimension of analog.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.320
So you imagine for example, discs which are sliding on the completely slippery surface like an ice skating rink, but coated in rubber let's say,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.040
so that when they are in contact with one another they can rub against each other. And so is the periphery of this arena.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.640
And when you do that you get exactly the same kind of phenomenon.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.360
[Professor Tokeida, speaking on a previous video]: 
Each paper clip is linked to the rubber band but not between themselves.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.790
Let's finish with something that is work-in-progress.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.240
So far we have been linking paper clips together, and sometimes we refer to this as addition.
