1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:07,180
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,240
ahhh

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,520
just checking in on you see
now your week's going. I
know your week's going great.

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,420
And Philly right now.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,830
She not a sports fan then you probably
all upset that everybody's all excited

7
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:28,970
running around tearing up
the street sides, you know

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,400
eaten horse shit. I felt bad for that
Philly fan that had to eat horse shit.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,570
You know what I mean? It's just all
the shit that their fans have gotten,

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,501
you know,

11
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:43,840
attention for like the bar has just been
set so high that this poor bastard that

12
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:47,960
was due, he was like
out of ideas, you know,

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,330
you know where it is as far
as bad behavior, you know,

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,340
or Philly fans are right now.
It's kind of like,

15
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:56,210
remember when they did the dunking contest
every year in the all star game and

16
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:59,120
at first it was amazing.
You know,

17
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:02,440
somebody just like takes off in the
file and it's like, Holy Shit. You know,

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,280
the next thing you know,

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,730
you've got to have like some fucking
quivering fucking woman standing there and

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,790
you've got to jump and your balls have
to just scrape the top of her fucking

21
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,750
head while you covered your
eyes like Dee Brown. You know,

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,230
that's Kinda like where eagles
fans had flyers to fans.

23
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:19,940
All Philly fans are as far as like,

24
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:24,740
how the fuck are we going to get on
ESPN this time? What are we going to do?

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,690
Throw up on a kid. I already did
that. What are we going to do?

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,040
Punch an old lady in the content.
We've been doing that since the 70s.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,380
What does fall, my God, there's
a pile of horse shit, uh,

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,780
turned on yet.
Fucking video camera.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,940
That didn't even make sense.
I'm not going to put that on Eagle stance.

30
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:53,390
I'm not going to put that on Philly.
I'm in debt is an individual act.

31
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:56,720
That guy wanted to do that
shit for the longest time.

32
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,440
He just needed an excuse.
You know what I mean?

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,190
Flick. All of us, most of us have
never eaten another human being. Right.

34
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:08,800
But put in the right situation,
you'd fucking do it. Right.

35
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,900
What was that movie alive plane
crashes in the rocky mountains.

36
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,290
You know, they're right next
to aspen, but they're all rich,

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,350
so they're not going to help out.
They wouldn't give him a sandwich.

38
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:21,760
And next thing you know,
they're eating each other.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,290
There's this have to do with eating or
why the fuck did this have to do with

40
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,460
Eaton Horse Shit? I was trying to think
where they actually landed. When was it?

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,760
They didn't land.
They crashed.

42
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,330
I would actually be upset if I survived
that. You know, like you're like,

43
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,650
Oh fuck, I'm gonna die. Right.

44
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:41,440
And then you fucking survive me on top
of that mountain freeze and you fucking

45
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,590
ass off then you wished you did.
Um,

46
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,810
anyways. Anyways, um,

47
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
I actually was finally able to look at
some of the highlights because I really

48
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,090
wanted to see eagles fan celebrating.

49
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,510
I just couldn't handle it cause
they beat my team. And, um,

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,060
I believe I said,
you know,

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,350
on the podcast and towards the end of
December that if the Patriots get bounced

52
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,840
out of the playoffs, I was going
to root for the fucking eagles.

53
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,150
Just cause you know, they
had one, one, like I said,

54
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,980
I really don't have
anything I wanted to say.

55
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,420
I forgot to say that on Conan because
so many people fucking reached out,

56
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:16,780
you know,

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,350
Twitter and all of this crap because of
my Philly rent thinking I really didn't

58
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:24,160
want the eagles to ever win one. And all
of this, it's just I got booed in Philly.

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,750
I made fun of Philly.
If I got booed in Texas,

60
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,800
that would've made fun of pickup trucks
and women who wear too much makeup,

61
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,290
you know, and you dumb fucking
boots are walking around. All right.

62
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,650
If you've got a flat screen TV
and not fucking cowboy, all right,

63
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,390
you look like you're on
your way to a gay bar.

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,360
I would've said something like that
in Texas. That's what I would've done.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,470
Oh look who's here. The lovely knee. Uh,

66
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,920
the fuck are you eating?
What are those things called?

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,850
Panoramas take it down a bit. Hey, that's
when you know your wife's hair. Hey,

68
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,870
what are you having a good time? Take it
down a bit. I'm eating pomegranate theme.

69
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,700
I'm eating pomegranate seeds.

70
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,260
I heard they're good for my
ovaries and my lady parts. They do.

71
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,550
I heard, I read that they're supposed
to shine up your vege lifts over there.

72
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,450
Oh baby. You know, it's
weird. As a weird segue,

73
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,530
you know, a year ago or so
when I didn't have a kid, oh,

74
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:25,240
we'll go back a year and a half when he
didn't get yourself knocked up. Right. Um,

75
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,480
I would just be walking around the house.

76
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,820
I would be singing whatever contemporary
shit that you know you were listening

77
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:31,654
to,
you know,

78
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,280
does she is white gold and Michelle
flavor dad some plum, right.

79
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:39,370
I'd be singing that shit right then.
Now that we have a kid,

80
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,490
I'm down there at brushing my teeth going,
whoa.

81
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,700
Vampyr Rina and may be blue
with pointy teeth. Whoa.

82
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,260
They're the marina but are
not so dev arena daddy.

83
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,620
Yeah. What happened? What happened to me?

84
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,050
A puppy dog.
What's,

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,730
when they go and do,
when they go on the adventure.

86
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:08,480
How's the song go on a mission
going on a mission that's

87
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,510
going on, a mission. Go in on a mission

88
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,870
about, Ooh, what? Oh, I costs.
That's why I brought you on.

89
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,330
Those are me undies. Biondi
sent matching, matching.

90
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,900
Underwears I love it. Are So
cute. What's the, what's on that?

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,460
A taco with hot sauce.
You get it.

92
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,780
Do you need to be explained?

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,450
And they make him be fun in front of me
for being a red head and making me a fun.

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,640
Well, they make it be fun of me
for being out redhead head. What?

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,720
The what the hot sauce.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,710
You see the text that I sent you that
now they're going to have red head emojis

97
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,330
in June. Uh, yeah. Which I just think
it's going to lead to more redheaded hate.

98
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,120
The thing about being a redhead is what
you want to do is not stand next to

99
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,760
another redhead. You want to sort,
sorta like fade into the background,

100
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,310
but you know what? You don't really,
you're not going to use those.

101
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,760
But they also have, um, bald, bald emojis.

102
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,590
Do they have a bald with a red beard?
I don't know if the baldy has facial hair.

103
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,070
When am I ever going to
fit in my whole life? Oh,

104
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,200
when are you ever be represented?

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,000
You realize how difficult it is to be a
redheaded white male is so close to the

106
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:27,530
brass ring, but those blue blood and
what? They won't let me in Jesus.

107
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:31,160
I am like the, I'm like the runt of the
litter. The one that the mother rejects.

108
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,130
Yeah. You're the real underdog. I
hit when you do you? Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:37,850
The rail under the, why don't
you just do it? You know,

110
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,230
giant fucking I roll with the,

111
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,870
there it is a meme level.
It looks beautiful outside.

112
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,680
So why don't you put on your underwear,
Nini? I want to see you in those.

113
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,640
I want to wear it on Valentine's Day. We
have to both were on Valentine's Day. No,

114
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,940
we don't. That's why
they go, because I'm an,

115
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm an adult that I can make my own
choices despite the fact that, you know,

116
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,470
something was killing me.
Can you just wait your taco underwear?

117
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,350
Can you just have a little
fun and not be so uptight?

118
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,790
Could you just say uptight like we're in
a fucking black and white comedy movie

119
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:15,680
here. Hayes white and she's black.
She teaches them to loosen up. Huh?

120
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,340
You're really uptight. You're not
uptight. I'm a fucking control freak.

121
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,990
I don't like people telling me what to do.

122
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,550
You're uptight if you're a control freak
than means or uptight. No, it doesn't.

123
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,480
Yeah,
it does.

124
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
A black people up tight because a sick
of white people fucking running shit.

125
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,390
What does that have to do
with anything that control?

126
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,080
Didn't Janet Jackson do a
whole fucking album about that?

127
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,820
Why am I here? Because I want you
to see the matching underwear.

128
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,460
I thought you'd have fun with
it rather than put demands on.

129
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,660
Isn't it enough that I have
to pay for the whole evening?

130
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:54,770
We're celebrating our relationship.
Whereas your contribution.

131
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,930
Oh yeah,
but you're supposed to do that.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,530
You're supposed to do that. You have.
Are you supposed to want to do it?

133
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,400
That's up to cost you no money
and you're burning calories.

134
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:13,400
Ridiculous burning
calories. What do you, what?

135
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,390
That's a rubric exercise
if done correctly. Oh,

136
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,150
whoa. Getting a blow. We were,

137
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,080
y'all are wearing matching underwear.
Don't fuse those two worlds to there.

138
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,550
I will. And I just did. Hmm.

139
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,750
It's because of that world that
you now have a new world. Okay.

140
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,750
There you go. Okay. By the
way, a a lovely little one. Um,

141
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,220
she uh, she took her first steps
this week. Oh, it was awesome.

142
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,540
Yeah, she did. It's funny
you're going to start crying.

143
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,420
I wanted to film it and then fucking
put Aerosmith's walk this way.

144
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:56,310
Underneath it. Every time
she falls that debt, boom.

145
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,360
Boom cat and we'll hit the stairs when
she falls down and arrest. So cute.

146
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,820
She's so proud of herself too.

147
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,220
I didn't realize babies get
like proud of themselves. Yeah.

148
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,480
Like when she learns how to do stuff, she
looks over and smiles like, Huh? Yeah.

149
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,340
Look at me seeing this. He
checking this out. So cute. Um,

150
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,250
anyway, so, well, let's get down
to what everybody's talking about.

151
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,530
The scandalous interview
by a Quincy Jones. Nia. Ah,

152
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,860
Jesus Christ. Iconic interview. I
didn't like it. Of course you then,

153
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,670
what do you like, Bill? What? Oh, what
is popular that you actually enjoy?

154
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,310
What do you mean? There's a bunch of shit
that I like to talk. A cupcake. Oh look,

155
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:41,550
a bath. Full puppies. I hate it.
None of that's true. I like cupcakes.

156
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:44,700
I actually know how to make them and
I've made you some and I love dogs.

157
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,960
You've never made me a cupcake. You
fucking whore. Put that microphone.

158
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,880
It's exactly what I just said.
Excuse me. There's no need for that.

159
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,970
I drove all over the fucking La base and
trying to find you a fucking Yellow Cup

160
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,290
cake with chocolate frosting and it
didn't exist and I went out and I fucking

161
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,430
made them for you.

162
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,450
You don't remember that you
have in network in your life.

163
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,750
Made me cupcakes.
And this is in Los Angeles or New York?

164
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,810
This is here like when the last,
within the last two years.

165
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,380
Yeah.

166
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,630
Give me that microphone. You're off the
podcast. No Way. You're up the podcast.

167
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,600
Remember the unbelievable you made it
and you went out and bought me cupcakes

168
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,520
like late at night when I'd
have my cupcake cravings.

169
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:33,050
But you've never made because that would
mean you'd make like a dozen cupcakes

170
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:37,340
because that's how many were in the pants
and you frosted them and everything.

171
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,200
Yeah.
I don't remember this.

172
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,600
Yeah.

173
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,020
Yes. Walking with me. I know. Go
into the cupboard and go, look,

174
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,470
there's a fucking cupcake tray.
Why would I have one of those?

175
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,630
Uh, that's right. There it is guys.

176
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,340
And whatever said for years that
you're only as good as the last act,

177
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
it doesn't mean shit to them.

178
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,860
You know the Patriots are always
just pushing fucking all pros out.

179
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:08,630
The door liners are in there too.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Wow.

180
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,520
Well guess who's not making
cupcakes anymore? Come.

181
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:17,810
Maybe I should film it. Well you make
some for Valentine's Day. No know why.

182
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,771
Cause you're not going to remember.

183
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:23,120
And then you come on the podcast made
red velvet ones and meanwhile I'm wearing

184
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:26,810
matching underwear. I'm playing the
game, I'm playing the game. Right.

185
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,320
And then I make you cupcakes. You
don't even remember. How dare you.

186
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,170
You look gorgeous. So by the way, oh,

187
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,750
Naomi's been hitting the
gym and I've been noticing,

188
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,110
I'm trying to keep it together.
Keep it together. Keep together.

189
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,550
Do you know my issue is that was all
positive right there. I made you cupcakes.

190
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:44,570
I said you're looking good.

191
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,640
All of that was what I didn't
like about Quincy Jones.

192
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,710
He was talking shit about
people who are dead.

193
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,560
And then everybody took
everything he said is fact.

194
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,530
And it's like you didn't notice
halfway through his gold.

195
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:58,240
I know who killed Kennedy. Oh Shit.
You should have told Oliver Stone.

196
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,360
He wouldn't have wasted all that time
making that movie when he could've just

197
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:06,190
called you up. Um, I
just liked what he said.

198
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,290
When you go for the money,
God walks out the room.

199
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,050
That's where like as far as all
that gossip about everybody else,

200
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:14,960
it's like do it once you
grow up. Huh? Well, who?

201
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:18,030
Who goes around doing that will you just
got used to steal Shaun's you didn't

202
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:19,570
say that when you will make
an records with them. Yeah.

203
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,890
He's still fucking alive.
Tell all the stories.

204
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:26,340
This is what I'm telling you are not cool.
Not Cool people on the old people,

205
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,740
my family, they just,
they don't give a fuck.

206
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:30,240
They're just telling them
stories about everybody.

207
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:32,850
This person did this and this
person did this and back in the day.

208
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:36,150
Was that cause what do they add
to lose? They're not, you know,

209
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:39,360
fearful of being politically correct.
Let me get this straight.

210
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,750
You're not supposed to be,
yes, you're supposed shit.

211
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,700
You're not supposed to be a snitch.

212
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,300
He's supposed to keep your mouth shut
and all of that shit your whole fucking

213
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:52,080
life. He's not in the men in the end when
everybody, do you know what the fuck?

214
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:53,530
I mean,
well,

215
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,030
I don't know how I was brought up
when she didn't do that to people.

216
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,980
[inaudible] no,
not that street shit.

217
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,590
Yeah. Like I said, I don't
pop off. I'd flip out,

218
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,060
but even in the hard streets in
the suburbs, pretty classic line.

219
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:12,840
I think for the podcast when I lived
in that Culdesac you want to talk about

220
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:15,720
dead end streets, man, you
had to go out to my suburb

221
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,370
that suite edited and all it was was
beautiful words into a lovely pond.

222
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,250
Oh, a lunch yesterday with mom
and she like, did you hear her?

223
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:31,680
Like kind of chastised
me for not drinking water

224
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,940
cause all, but I wish I could have
enjoyed done your body. Oh Man.

225
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,040
And I drank a whole bunch of water like
the whole entire morning and then saves

226
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,020
automatically. They automatically
filled up my glass again for more.

227
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:50,260
All right. In ask where they
just automatically filled
it up. And my mom was like,

228
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,880
do you want some water? And
I was like, no, it's okay.

229
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,150
And she like hits me on the arm. It's
just, you should be drinking water.

230
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,530
And it's like, I drink water all God damn
day long. It was just a mother's love,

231
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,180
I guess. So I just annoyed me anyway. It
has nothing to do a little bit. Hey Nia,

232
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,650
you should drink more water.
Wow.

233
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,900
That's an eye. Literally drink water
all day long. Nobody notices. Right.

234
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,590
System and why in that moment
she had to like, I don't know.

235
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,000
It literally has been bothering me since
yesterday. Oh it doesn't? Yeah. Oh,

236
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,400
then I wouldn't have
slept you on the wrist.

237
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,630
So if I knew it was really bothering
you and it's just annoying.

238
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,270
You want to talk about Nia? No, I got it
off my chest. Oh, there you go. See that?

239
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,430
That's what I've learned about women.
You just, Oh, I didn't know that.

240
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:39,230
You just learned about women. Yes, I
have no nothing. You have no instincts.

241
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:40,520
You have no intuition.

242
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,490
I nailed that whole thing about how you
guys stopped giving compliments when you

243
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:46,910
get married and you even said,
fair enough. I don't remember that.

244
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,930
Of course you don't just like the
cupcakes. You know what's funny?

245
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,080
I'm going to stop doing shit for
you and just say that I did it.

246
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,800
Cause you're not going to remember either
way and you're going to be like, wow,

247
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:58,191
I must,

248
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:02,220
I can't believe I keep forgetting that
I have the greatest husband ever again.

249
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,340
He made me a chocolate cupcakes.
I keep forget

250
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,580
what else. I can't believe that fucking
sat there with that Goddamn kitchenaid.

251
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,710
I wore goddamn apron for you. When do I
get for that? Huh? Nuh Huh? I'm sorry.

252
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:22,700
I can't remember. Ah, look at you. A
little sunflower icon. Isn't that cute?

253
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,710
I've never noticed that.
Anything that comes with it.

254
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,670
So what's up? What's up? Why am I here?

255
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,640

Her road. It is your bottom half

312
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,740
Our anniversary is coming up. Yeah. And
we don't even officially know the date.

313
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,900
No we don't.
No we don't.

314
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,510
So, I mean, do we always
say it's Valentine's Day?

315
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,400
No, we don't. And we never go
out on Valentine's Day. No.

316
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,970
We usually go out a couple of days after
when the price has come back to some

317
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:33,690
sort of sensible yeah, you can
get a table, right balance.

318
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:35,640
I say you go to Wendy's at
night, they're like, we're sorry.

319
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,420
It's going to be like a 45 minute wait.
Um,

320
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,510
but we never came up with like,

321
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,010
I guess we just now our anniversary is
our wedding date as opposed to like the

322
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:50,060
first time we ever hung out. Right? Yeah.
Neither one of us are big on dates. No,

323
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,890
but one of us, it's a little
bigger on cupcakes than the other,

324
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,920
but it was February 14
years ago. Wow. Yeah.

325
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,500
That's so crazy.
14 years

326
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,730
still looking good.
Still looking great.

327
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:10,240
Now they'll tell you that and I already
knew that until that little little

328
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,940
fucking display you just put on.

329
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,680
I'll make you cupcakes and knew each
other and you look good too. All right,

330
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:20,770
let's stop this. This is annoying
people. All right. Thank you.

331
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,440
The Conan O'brien show
for get me on on Monday.

332
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:25,990
Even as much as it was
painful for me to sit there.

333
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,960
I think a Philly fans deserve that.
You know,

334
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,730
if they're all this shit they've
gotten because of that rant,

335
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,950
which I said once again, was not part,
it wasn't personal. It wasn't personal.

336
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:37,780
It just so long ago too. It was, that's
a funny thing is now people had gone to

337
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,220
[inaudible]. Well, he plugged in one one.
Yeah. It only took half a century. Fuck.

338
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,320
Are you bragging about?

339
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,800
That's like the guy who fucking
finishes a marathon in Lynn, like hours.

340
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,040
It's like,

341
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,620
yeah, dude, I could've walked it
in that, that amount of time. Also,

342
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,980
that audience deserved it.
Who did the audience and Villi?

343
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,180
They deserve your wrath.

344
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:00,300
Yeah, they did. They were assholes.
Yeah. You know, it's funny.

345
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Most of them probably have kids now and
they're raising little asshole kids,

346
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,420
but you know something.
Not all Philly fans are like that.

347
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,210
I remember having Shay's a
nice guy. Uh, you know you,

348
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,120
I remember those guys always
sunny. Yeah, they're nice guys.

349
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:18,900
I didn't see them do it. Yeah. They
weren't tipping over any cars and stuff.

350
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,930
Oh my God.
Um,

351
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,370
I remember you called me after that
whole thing in Philly happen and you were

352
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:29,330
like, I have a massive headache.
And I said, what happened? He like,

353
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,400
I just got into a fight with like 10,000.

354
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,490
You didn't you call me right after
it happened. I'll never forget it.

355
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:42,010
And I was like, oh my God. Whoa.
And then it just blew up and I think

356
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,960
that's right.
You were at my apartment and I was,

357
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,720
I rode home with Bobby Kelly and he was
filling teenage way head tonight. You?

358
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,220
Yeah. I was like, Bobby,
I've got a headache.

359
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,330
You judge people to go back and shells.

360
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,880
You know what Bobby Kelly
had to follow that night?

361
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,970
Bobby Kelly had to go on after the
intermission where somebody with an ear

362
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,740
infection drained it. Somebody else drank
it. And somebody who watched it. Cute.

363
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,790
This is in Philly? Yeah. What is
going on with the P in that? That guy,

364
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,670
that horse shit. Like what is
going on? No, no, no, no. Well,

365
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,950
what is going on over there?
Seriously.

366
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,610
You know, what happened to Philly was
when they built night interstate 95,

367
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,950
they got bypassed.
Okay.

368
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,460
So I just think that
they're just stuck in time.

369
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,590
But back in a time when people
ate Horse Shit, I dunno. I Dunno.

370
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,470
I think there's something there you,

371
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,710
there's either some sacred burial ground
that they built the city on or there's

372
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:43,620
some sort of toxic waste,
like the Simpsons thing going on.

373
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:44,760
I don't know what their deal is,

374
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:48,600
but all I know is they don't care that
people don't like them and they're proud

375
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,520
of their behaviors. So
I say, God bless them.

376
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,280
That's some really amazing people
though, an affiliate, right?

377
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,940
If you had any horse shit,

378
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,450
it, uh, the roots, that's not
a person, Scott, it's a band.

379
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,510
Um,
all the black people

380
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,560
I know, you're like really racist.
Oh, Kevin Hart. Keith Robinson.

381
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,410
Kevin Hart. Yeah. I didn't

382
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,890
know that he sold out the Eagle's
stadium. Yeah. And he was,

383
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,910
he did stand up in a fucking
football state. Funny.

384
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:23,560
He was so happy after they won.
You saw him on TV drunk. It's like,

385
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,280
I know that sounded hilarious. So it
was pretty great. It was pretty great.

386
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,520
He was very happy. Yeah. So that's the
deal. And what am I going to get mad?

387
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,060
You know, my team can't win
it every year. Right, right.

388
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,700
I don't know. I think you're
very gracious about it. You like,

389
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,000
that's the one thing you've actually
mellowed out about as the years have gone

390
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:46,620
by. I mean that candid compliments.
Go ahead boards. That's the one thing

391
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,561
I could actually say.

392
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:52,561
I see improvement on the rest of it
is taken a fucking nose dive now.

393
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,060
You're very gracious when it comes
to other teams. Yeah. I don't,

394
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:02,650
I don't take it to the point of like,
like I said, I just, you know, what's his,

395
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,420
I retweeted that, that uh,
nick foals audio in the, uh,

396
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,030
in the huddle was great. Other than he
said, I love you guys and just like,

397
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,650
why does everything have
to be so fucking sweet now

398
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,830
I would love to teleport Nick your
responses in a huddle in an NFL game.

399
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,211
I mean,

400
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:29,211
I would've loved to have had teleported
him back to that fucking 1980 super bowl

401
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,980
team when they were playing the Raiders
and just be okay before we do this first

402
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,190
place. Want to say I love
you guys just said, well,

403
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,800
we'll put Montgomery look at him high
when they win the Superbowl and stuff.

404
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:41,170
You can say, I love you. It's now when I
was not, when I was a kid. They didn't.

405
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,820
They didn't think anybody actually had
emotions when you were a kid that all of

406
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:50,270
a sudden it's a new millennial thing
to have emotions and express them.

407
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,500
Men did not cry.
When I was a kid that I saw,

408
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,910
I saw the Celtics won three championships.
I saw the Lakers win five.

409
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,090
I saw the Pistons went to,
you know,

410
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,010
the first time I think I
saw a guide cry was Jordan.

411
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:09,970
It was because his dad died and he
wasn't there and that was understandable.

412
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,060
You know what I mean?
But he'd just cry because he won.

413
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,930
He said that angry look on his face,

414
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,970
go only open five fucking six
and you always seem to win it.

415
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:22,330
On the road and you know, he's looking
at some little kid who was crying.

416
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:26,710
He got off on it, he got off on BNB.
That's what a man was back then.

417
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,200
Okay. Um, first of all, I just
want to say I love you guys.

418
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,780
I want to just take time to just,
everybody knows

419
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,500
how much way to offensive line is lost.
You guys, you know, you were really,

420
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:42,334
you know,

421
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,640
I dare you coming out of your football
pants the beginning of the year and now

422
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:49,250
you're just looking so shapely,
dare you and your next show was.

423
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,060
So when you think at night, I dare
you to say love you guys. Goodnight.

424
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,390
I dare you to say it. Oh, you kidding me?

425
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,540
I have a fucking do that per 10
minutes until everybody just got so

426
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,650
uncomfortable and left.

427
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Huh? I want you to do it shows over,
but uh, I just want to take some time.

428
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,370
You'd just speak from the heart.
You know,

429
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,660
my life has changed a lot in the
last year letter and in a great way.

430
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,990
I became a father and I look at the
world at different time, different way,

431
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:17,390
and I've noticed the whole thing. You can
just be like, all right, goodnight. No,

432
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,760
it has to be a big thing because then
they're going to expect that there's going

433
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:26,761
to be this punchline that never comes
and gets you going on and on about how

434
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:28,960
much love you have in your heart.
Don't forget to look at this.

435
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,620
Don't forget to look at the
sky today. Everybody, you know,

436
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:34,570
it's those little things
that we take for granted.

437
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,200
If you get some of that fucking
pomegranate. Oh, my jacket. Oh, right.

438
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,290
You said my jacket is a table.
Yeah. I'm telling you now.

439
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,310
The second this podcast

440
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,701
is over,

441
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:48,780
we're going to do a dry run for two little
fucking booty shorts on just to make

442
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,740
sure we're in. We're in sync run. Oh. Oh.

443
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,100
Was that within six? No, that
light. I was, uh, the new kids.

444
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,510
I almost said the right boys.

445
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,620
I can now keep this Darryl's.
Oh, Joseph McIntyre.

446
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,450
Mm. The right stuff. You got
the red stuff. That's right,

447
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,760
baby. Okay, well I think that
might be the way you answer me.

448
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:15,580
Yeah.

449
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,170
Sorry,
I didn't mean to keep going.

450
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,850
If you were of that age, those
boy bands, they caught you, right?

451
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,153
[inaudible]

452
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:33,030
new edition and then you know the white
new edition also known as new kids on

453
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:36,420
the block. And wait a
minute, wait a minute.

454
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,880
Are we talking about the
Osmonds came before new edition.

455
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,400
Well that's no
new edition.

456
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,930
Had the same manager. Okay. As new
kids on the block and their manager,

457
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Maurice Starr said he wanted to make
a white pop crossover version of new

458
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,660
edition that don't get mad,
don't get mad at white people.

459
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,320
And it was a black guy's ideas who said,

460
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm mad at white people and we're
doing that fucking Elvis shit.

461
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,980
New Kids on the block have always given
props and respect to new edition their

462
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,270
whole entire careers.

463
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,970
That's good because I would hate to
know that those two bands are fighting.

464
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,570
I'm just saying it's, it's a nice thing.
All right, well you have a new addition.

465
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,930
Got Screwed. They really,
really did big time.

466
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,500
So it's just nice that new kids on the
block as I was giving them their other

467
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,810
crops. Okay. And why know why?
Why get all weird? Not Weird?

468
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,033
It feels weird.

469
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,030
Well that's because you live in a
place of fucking awkwardness and anger.

470
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,310
Can I ask you a question?
Do you really know what to tell you about?

471
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,410
I asked you questions sincerely.
Is it ever you?

472
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,130
Is it always me and my world of
awkwardness and anger and negativity?

473
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:54,840
As you say? [inaudible]
fucking unbelievable. If
you guys caught it for me,

474
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,790
I woke up this morning,
but I do want to do,

475
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,870
I fucking change my daughter's diaper.
Right?

476
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,320
The hanging out with her,

477
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:05,930
I'm watching cartoons is all the
great shit that had done today.

478
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,441
And this is what we,
all,

479
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:10,670
she all she talks about how
she just just dials into is my,

480
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:14,800
is my fucking anger. Right? And I haven't
even lost my shit yet today. So what?

481
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:19,100
I burned my hand in the kitchen, which
is not why I yelled. Fuck. That was why.

482
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,790
Because I was putting the fucking
keynote into my thermos and you know,

483
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:28,290
and always falls down in between the two
stupid burners you said that's why you

484
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,040
screaming obscenities?
Yeah,

485
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,730
cause I want before he fell off the spoon
and it went all the way down anyway to

486
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,480
clean it up and I just went, fuck. Then
you will the other and be like, what?

487
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,400
I was like a burned my hand.

488
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,130
No, you're a sweetheart because you've
just given me a bunch of compliments and I

489
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:51,910
love you and you're fantastic. Yeah. Yeah.
That's really doesn't hold any water.

490
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,540
You've been trashing me like you've been
in the last three times you've been on

491
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,374
the podcast.

492
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,730
You make it sound like you're emotionally
held captive here when you're running

493
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,220
the deal. [inaudible]
yeah. Listen to that laugh.

494
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,910
That is the laugh of somebody that's
running a fucking relationship. All right.

495
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:10,620
That's the podcast for this week.
Anniversary.

496
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,090
Happy yet bursary this TV anniversary.

497
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,080
Uh, shit today. Just be our anniversary.

498
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,140
All right. Why can't we just say the
seventh? I'll remember that. Well,

499
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:28,180
what day is today? Well,
it's the eighth. Oh,

500
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,020
so it was yesterday.

501
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,080
What kind of life are you leading that
you don't even know what fucking day it

502
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:38,470
is? You have the nerve to talk about
me. What month is it? Quick. Quick.

503
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,080
There you go. Sure. History month.

504
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:47,310
Shouldn't you be like lighting a candle
every day until they make a giant black

505
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,710
Menorah with 28 candles and science?
Lack of Nora. Yeah. No, I uh, no.

506
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,680
Then I'll, this day in 1932, no,

507
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:59,610
I'm reading stories a little everyday
about African American or African

508
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,900
Americans are dead today.
She'll lace,

509
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,140
which was later taken credit was taken
by the light that would actually,

510
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,200
it was three women who are good
at math of African descent.

511
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,440
February 9th,

512
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:19,270
the first name ship was actually built
by a native American was African blood.

513
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,730
Robert Folden killed. That person
had said, I invented this deep shit.

514
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,800
This happened February night at eight 45

515
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,033
is that it?

516
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,160
February 9th, eighth, eight Oh four.

517
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:41,810
Thomas Jefferson finally gave
him into his desires. Um,

518
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,150
hopefully it was her desire to, but
that's not how it worked back then. Yeah.

519
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,300
Yeah. Performing next, um,

520
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,440
at the Patrice O'Neal benefit
or Patrice O'Neal benefits.

521
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,790
There's a 54 tickets left.
Uh, something like that. Um,

522
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,050
that's on February 20th. My next
one is going to be in Santa Barbara,

523
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,700
Santa Barbara, which was actually
made an African American named it.

524
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,740
And 1972 people took it over because
they liked the view of the beach.

525
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,570
Are you a, are you sure? Flying to Santa
Barbara? Have you decided yes, I am.

526
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm frying playing a helio
copter out there. Are you?

527
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,970
Which will y'all be there and
then flying back. So can I come?

528
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,470
There's no room for you.
What do you mean there's no room?

529
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:34,390
There's no room in the copilot
and the opener. Yeah. Oh, okay.

530
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,100
Well I guess that's that then.
No two openers to open up your,

531
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,861
so flying out there.

532
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,810
One them's version and I'm going to be
fucking dying laughing cause he hates to

533
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:44,420
fly and it's going to freak them out.
That among controls,

534
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,780
even though we're going to out the copilot
there, he's going to be freaking well,

535
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:52,730
tell whoever the other person is. It's
coming with you to film him. Oh yeah.

536
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,990
When we first go into a habit,
because you don't,

537
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,540
when the first time you go into Howard,
this one of the weirdest feelings ever,

538
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,860
other than realizing that you're
attracted to me 15 years ago,

539
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,920
14 years ago, that must've
been, am I attracted to that
orange headed Weirdo? Um,

540
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,180
so negative. Well that's nice
near, that's a nice thought.

541
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,850
Then you wonder why I live in a
world of anger and awkwardness. The,

542
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,820
when I first saw you,

543
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,180
the first time ever I saw your freckles
really handsome and I was like,

544
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:28,060
oh, what were you like? That's,

545
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,070
that's what I always know
like five years later.

546
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,930
So it was meant to be,
oh, you like me. So I met,

547
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,920
I met my wife in an alley behind the
first in an alley behind the Apollo.

548
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,890
Yeah,
that's the first I was going into do,

549
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,660
I was going into do showtime at the
Apollo. My Dad had booked you on,

550
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,240
it's showtime at the Apollo my day.
I used to book the Comedians on it,

551
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:54,560
show Timothy Apollo. My Dad is actually
known bill longer than I have. And,

552
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,260
um, I saw, he was like, oh,

553
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:02,210
I got this funny wipe away from Boston
on the show. And I was like, okay,

554
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:02,571
cool.

555
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:06,920
I had just graduated from college and I
went back there and he said hi briefly

556
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,440
and I was like, oh, he's
really good looking.

557
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,950
And then when I saw you years later on,
tough crowd,

558
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,010
I immediately recognize
you. I was like, oh my God,

559
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:19,600
that's the guy that I met at
the Apollo with my dad Jana.

560
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,190
And you were such a
jerk to me. I wasn't, I,

561
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:25,330
you kept trying to ask you why
he was such an asshole. Oh no,

562
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,940
that's not how it went at all. I wouldn't
even look at me. You in the elevator.

563
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,710
I was looking over it and I'm just like,
think of something to say.

564
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,740
Sitting with something saying you was
staring straight ahead like those fucking

565
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,750
guys in London with the big furry hats.

566
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,410
Expressionless trying to play hard to get,

567
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,460
but you also had a girlfriend at the
time and I had a boyfriend. No, I didn't.

568
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,400
Yeah, you thought I did. No, you did.

569
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:49,610
And then when we ran into each other
at the party for Chappelle show,

570
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,560
that's when you told me you
didn't have a girlfriend,

571
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:54,380
but when we first met you did have it.
I didn't fucking ask you.

572
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:57,500
I want I had a girlfriend. I know.
Well then. All right then. I know,

573
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,440
but you're still looking
at so what I can look,

574
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,010
I was looking to,
even though I had a boyfriend,

575
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,840
but we didn't do anything until after
we were both till after. Exactly. Yeah.

576
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,640
Jesus, I tell you going to call
Quincy Jones there. Oh listen.

577
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,340
Where you guy kicked the bucket
and kicked a bug and you wait till

578
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,140
I would never do that to you, but I
do. I don't. Why would I give a shit?

579
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,410
I be dead. I had to imagine myself.
No, I don't want to, first of all,

580
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:30,170
I don't ever want to think about your
time before me. That would be too much.

581
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,660
Well, it's going to happen. I'm 10
years older than you and I'm a guy,

582
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,920
but I do take better care of
myself than you do. Oh wait, I do.

583
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,100
I do the elliptical.

584
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,550
I swear to God you eat keynote where for
three weeks and you think you're some

585
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:45,140
fucking like health,
like you really need to knock it off.

586
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,540
Fair enough. You're like,
oh wow I just ate. You don't
want to have so much energy.

587
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,150
Yes bill, we are all aware of like
the health benefits of your animal.

588
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,150
Jealous who?
My new healthy diet.

589
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,930
I'm not jealous you are you always nosing
around like a little fucking rabbit we

590
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:03,030
didn't know is wiggling. Like wait,
what are you eating over there?

591
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,870
What are you going over there? And I'm
just curious what you're doing cause yeah,

592
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:09,270
you're, you're doing really
well with your diet and stuff.

593
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:14,271
But I just think be like we're the first
person that discovered Keana was where

594
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,280
you'd go on and on about not what I think.
What do you think?

595
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,630
I think I went to the dentist yesterday
and found out that I was supposed to do

596
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:23,550
16 weeks of Invisalign,

597
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:27,810
but because I've left these things in
sometimes even during shows spitting on

598
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,720
the front too. Fucking rose cause
I want to get this over with.

599
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:35,310
He says it's only going to be 13 weeks,
and I just put in tre number nine,

600
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,323
bitch,

601
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,870
I got another month of these
fucking things. That's it.

602
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,520
Yeah. Do you just know? You know
how excited I was when I got,

603
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,140
I remember when I got you. I
remember my, I got your teeth fixed.

604
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,650
All this shit that I've done for you.
Please don't put it that way.

605
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,170
All this shit that I've
done for you look up.

606
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,370
I see one more fucking piece of clothing
that you just had to have that you did.

607
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,380
Just frisbee down at a fucking goodwill
for some homeless guy to traipse around

608
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,920
in while he's looking
to get his fucking junk.

609
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,860
All right. I gotta get off. I have
to get on on with my fucking day.

610
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:13,950
This has been the podcast.

611
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,360
We can now play a little bit of
music and then you can listen.

612
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,730
Do another half hour of bullshit
from a Thursday podcast, uh,

613
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:25,590
earlier this year, 10 years ago. I
don't know how it works. Um, that's it.

614
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,920
All right. Have a wonderful
weekend. You'd come to once again,

615
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:31,210
congratulations to
everybody. You'd Philly, uh,

616
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,070
please don't eat excrement from an animal,
right?

617
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,330
Hey,

618
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,943
eh?

619
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,733
[inaudible]

620
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
what's going on? It's built bar and
it is the Monday morning podcast from

621
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,910
Monday,
February 8th,

622
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,690
2010 one day after Superbowl 44.

623
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,150
Well, um, usually I don't begin
my podcasts with a warning,

624
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,130
but I'm going to this week. Um, if
you live anywhere near Indianapolis,

625
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:58,450
you want to shut this thing off right now,
okay?

626
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,660
If you one of those fantasy
football playing Douche
bags with you stats and your

627
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,440
Peyton manning poster hanging
above your fucking bed,

628
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,890
you want to shut this thing off right now.
All right?

629
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,090
Because this podcast is dedicated
to you guys. You fucking cons.

630
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,070
Who I've been telling you for the last
five fucking years that Peyton manning is

631
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:25,690
overrated. I even went off on them last
week. Last week I went off on that guy.

632
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:30,691
And you cannot believe the emails that
I got from people all just fucking,

633
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,340
not only defending Peyton Manning,

634
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,500
but brushing off Tom Brady and his
three super bowl rings as if, oh,

635
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,440
you can plug anybody into that system,
you know,

636
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,140
but paint [inaudible] hate
manning. Who paint. Manny, he too.

637
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:46,780
He two for 50 fucking
touchdowns during what?

638
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:49,870
He threw five touchdowns against
the fucking Buccaneers in November.

639
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,000
I said it last week.

640
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,180
Peyton manning is a regular season
statistical juggernaut. Alright.

641
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,860
If you want to know who the fuck that
guy is, if you're still confused,

642
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,730
the fuck is there an invasion.
You hear that shit.

643
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,760
That's what happens
out here in fucking la.

644
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,580
So many probably just
robbed a convenience store.

645
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:14,140
They go a little overboard out here.
Um, dude, I'm telling you right now,

646
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:16,600
if you want to know who Peyton manning is,
you'll know who that fucking guy is.

647
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,110
Picture this.
If Dan Marino fucked Brett Farve,

648
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,620
their baby would be Peyton
manning. That's who he is. Okay.

649
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,230
In this asshole had only one one fucking
time his whole career and all these

650
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:32,320
analysts on TV, it was ridiculous.
They're all going, you know,

651
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,480
I'm telling you right now, you know,
if he wins here, uh, you're, you're,

652
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,380
you're arguably looking at one of the
greatest quarterbacks of all time because

653
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:46,180
of what? Based on what? Based on
what his regular season stats.

654
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,470
This guy fucking chokes every year in
the fucking playoffs. He's only one once.

655
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,640
He's only one once and everybody's
just fucking talking about and all you

656
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:58,210
assholes. Who fucking emailed me
this week where your emails now,

657
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,610
I emailed each you one of you,

658
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,450
every one of you fucking back and I
never heard it from you. You know,

659
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,770
maybe he's still fucking stunned.
Maybe you're still fucking confused.

660
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:09,550
So you know what?

661
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,820
You know what I'm going to do just for
all of you fucking idiots out there who

662
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:15,220
think that Peyton manning is
the greatest fucking guy ever.

663
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,090
Totally disrespecting Tom Brady.
Let me,

664
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,130
Tom Brady has to wear,
you know,

665
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,250
he has to wear a fucking welder's
mask at night to go to sleep.

666
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:27,790
That's how fucking bright is room is
from those three championship rings.

667
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,930
And you guys still disrespect him.
The analysts on TV still disrespect them.

668
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,260
They never talk about him.

669
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:36,800
The way they talk about Peyton manning
all accounts is what the fuck you do in

670
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:40,460
January. You know, nobody
talks about Terry Bradshaw.

671
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,300
You guys haven't watched super
bowl 10 it's up on fucking youtube.

672
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,200
Watch that game. Terry Bradshaw,
if you looked at his numbers,

673
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:51,890
you fucking stat boy pussies.
If you looked at his numbers on paper,

674
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:54,680
you wouldn't think the guy was shit.
You'd be like, oh, Peyton manning.

675
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,160
He's like twice as good as this guy.
He's closing in on 50,000 yards.

676
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:01,940
All Bradshaw has a 25,000 yards.
Yeah, in four fucking rings.

677
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,490
Superbowl 10 Terry Bradshaw Fades back
to pass in the fourth fucking quarter,

678
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,940
gets knocked unconscious,
gets a concussion. Okay,

679
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,710
and on that play that he got a concussion,

680
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,460
he throws a 50 yard strike to Lynn
Swann for the go ahead. Fucking score.

681
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,863
All right.

682
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,260
That's what the great ones do and nobody
ever brings up Terry Bradshaw. You.

683
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:24,400
What the fuck has he ever done by
other than when? For fucking super.

684
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,680
So just in case you guys are still
confused about your boy Peyton Manning,

685
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,400
I'm going to read you some of his stats,
the stats that fucking count. All right?

686
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,540
Yeah, we go the greatest
quarterback of all time.

687
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,300
I've got a little music for you this week.
All right.

688
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,660
December 30th I'm such an obnoxious ass.

689
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:52,430
This is Carly Simon by the way, sitting
and nobody does it better. You know,

690
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,810
this is what all the analysts have been
singing for the last fucking 10 years of

691
00:42:56,811 --> 00:43:00,990
this guy's career. December
30th all right. CIC,

692
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,330
SAS in the regular season,

693
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,450
dolphins beat the colts 2117 overtime
wildcard game. Oh, whatever. Whatever.

694
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,120
That's his first trip to the playoffs.
He'll get better.

695
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,720
2002 colts lose 41 nothing's in a play
off route against the New York jets,

696
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,500
j e t s jets, jets, jets.

697
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,650
This is the greatest
quarterback of all fucking time.

698
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:27,260
Potentially with one fucking ring.

699
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:30,220
Everybody tuned in and watched to
see how he does against the saints.

700
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,970
That's look how we did
January 8th,

701
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:38,930
2004 cold slews 24 14 to
the New England patriots.

702
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,760
Greatest fucking quarterback,
potentially a better one fucking ring.

703
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:49,370
Oh you she footwork. He's on believable.
Okay. His hand eye coordination.

704
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,390
He's got the pedigree.

705
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,070
January 60 2005 Colt again
lose to the Patriots,

706
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,810
20 to three greatest fucking
quarterback all of all fucking time.

707
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,880
January 15th, 2006 cults lose
to the Steelers. 21 to 18

708
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,670
greatest quarterback of all time, and
right around then people start going, oh,

709
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:17,990
is this another Dan Marino? But no, the
next year, see, finally fucking shows up.

710
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,300
Finally grows it.
Dick comes back,

711
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:23,540
21 points down against the
Patriots wins his first Super Bowl,

712
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,450
and then I'm thinking, okay,
he's a fucking man now, right?

713
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:31,070
I'm going to see some Montana Shit. I'm
going to see some, some fucking Terry.

714
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,560
I'm going to see some time fucking Brady.

715
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,810
What's he do the next
year he loses at home

716
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,270
to the San Diego chargers. All right.
Maybe you had a fucking hangover,

717
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,360
maybe at a fucking hangover.
What's he do with the next year?

718
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,930
Quarter fucking quarterback ever loses
to the eight and eight chargers at

719
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:56,310
fucking home, right?
And you hear the song,

720
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,250
this is what these fucking analysts
who been just continue to sing.

721
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,160
He's the new bread farm.

722
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,020
Brett Farve can do no wrong throws
against his body over the fucking middle.

723
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,540
And what is Tom Jackson
say? Well, you know,

724
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:13,460
he's never been afraid to lose the
game. He fucking blow it. Be Mush.

725
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,210
Those vikings purple nuts right into
the fucking ground and they're still

726
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,330
fucking rubbing his god Damn
Mississippi cocky. I'm sick of it.

727
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,310
So here you go.
She goes up against the lowly saints.

728
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,680
They've never won a fucking thing in 40
fucking years of being in the league.

729
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,520
What's going to be the difference?
Peyton manning. I'll tell ya,

730
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,870
I gotta go with Peyton Manning. Oh,
Peyton manning fist. Peyton manning stat.

731
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,670
Peyton manning lost the fucking
game yesterday. The final drive.

732
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,470
I've got a question for you.
Indianapolis fans.

733
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,060
This Tom Brady throw a pick six
at the end of the super bowl,

734
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,730
there's Joe Montana.
Throw a fucking pick six.

735
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,570
Does Terry Bradshaw does.

736
00:45:56,571 --> 00:46:00,470
Ben Roethlisberger one of the
most overlooked quarterbacks
of all times sitting

737
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,900
at home with fucking two rinks.

738
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,190
Does he know he doesn't?
All right,

739
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:12,020
so fuck all you fucking idiots out in
Indianapolis. There you go. How was that?

740
00:46:12,021 --> 00:46:16,370
Did you like that right in your fucking
ass. God bless the saints everybody. Huh?

741
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,770
Dude? Did I say drew Brees his name? What?

742
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:21,740
Maybe three times when they finally
figured out he's going to win the game.

743
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:25,130
Then they're like, oh, by the way, drew
Brees is about to break Tom Brady's,

744
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,740
you know, single fucking Superbowl
record for completions there.

745
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:33,590
I got it out. I got a little started
there for a second, but I got it out.

746
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,430
Unbelievable.
Unfucking believable.

747
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,410
You know something.
This is how fucking bad.

748
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,600
Not even bad.
How fucking I predicted that.

749
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:51,050
I actually got Keith Robinson to
fucking apologize to me. Keith Robinson,

750
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,310
classic black dude doesn't like
white people. Hates cops. Okay.

751
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,280
There's no reason for
him to apologize to me.

752
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,850
He actually apologized. He goes,
you know what? You're right.

753
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,080
You were right about this
guy. Ah, I feel vindicated.

754
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,030
Vindication. What a great emotion.
So there you go. There you go.

755
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:13,700
Congratulations to the New Orleans saints.
Okay.

756
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,430
And I know what it feels like
to fucking have a great team.

757
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:18,050
And nobody even fucking talks about you.

758
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,050
Do they even bring you guys up
for half a second? Oh, by the way,

759
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,280
it'd be great for the fucking shitty.

760
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,590
The amount of shit that you guys
have been through down there.

761
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,690
How many Superbowls had
been played in New Orleans.

762
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,900
How many times have you seen people from
other cities come to your town and feel

763
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:36,220
the joy of winning a championship?
And you just sat there, you know,

764
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,140
with your beads and your check
and foot and you're Voodoo? Go on.

765
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,560
When the fuck is it going to happen for
us? Well, finally did. Congratulations.

766
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,950
You're totally fucking deserve that.
Your defense was the shit.

767
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,530
Even when the culture receivers,
we're catching balls. I mean,

768
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:52,510
you guys were hitting them. They
look like they, they'll like many,

769
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:55,210
many explosions.
You will not knocking them off their feet.

770
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:00,520
Totally fucking deserve
it. Can't be, could not be
happier, could not be happier.

771
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,970
Not only did you know, I know it feels
like to wait for fucking championship.

772
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:09,460
So congratulations to everyone down in
New Orleans and I also want to thanks the

773
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:13,510
saints for fucking proven me, right?
Proven me right? There you go.

774
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,120
There you go. All right, so
while you fucking analysts, hey,

775
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,670
then you enter you a pas at
ESPN in Bristol, Connecticut.

776
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,690
You listen into this shit,

777
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,840
why don't you go play it to some of those
jerk offs at Upi have on the fucking

778
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:29,240
air? Who can't do anything? Dude, I'm
telling you, they'll even go out there.

779
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,260
I'm even watching a little bit of shit
this morning. This loosen. I'm stuttering.

780
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:35,440
I'm so fucking pissed right now.
They're still not saying, ah Brady.

781
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,550
What's his face? Peyton blew it.
They keep talking about drop passes.

782
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:47,080
Ms Field Goes, get the fuck
outta here. Pick six nail in
the coffin. Thanks Peyton.

783
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,350
You know what? He's going to lose.
You see how tanned up he was?

784
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:55,670
Oh

785
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,150
Jesus Christ. It's going to be
a great week. I feel fantastic.

786
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,500
You know? Especially as a fucking
Boston fan. You know what I mean?

787
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:07,430
I already watched, I watched the
Lakers come in and win another one.

788
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:12,910
You know I watched the Yankees win number
27 was I actually going to sit here

789
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,400
and have to watch the cult
when to and prove me wrong.

790
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:20,150
That may be Peyton is let's be puberty.
Peyton maybe is,

791
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,770
maybe Peyton is one of the greatest
of all time. Fucking unreal.

792
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,930
Ed is one guy this week was sending me an
email saying, you know what, Dude, if, uh,

793
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,130
if I, you know, if, if Peyton
played for the dolphins,

794
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,030
I don't know what year this guy's talking.

795
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,870
And he said they definitely would win
at least one championship and it Brady

796
00:49:38,871 --> 00:49:41,720
went there. You know, it wouldn't
have made a difference. Yeah.

797
00:49:41,721 --> 00:49:44,960
Why would it make a difference?
Brady only is cool under pressure.

798
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:49,670
How many fucking super does that guy
have to fucking win on the last drive to

799
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:53,660
get some respect? I don't get it.
I don't get it. I don't get it.

800
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,280
And what about Ben Roethlisberger who
has twice as many fucking rings as Peyton

801
00:49:58,281 --> 00:49:59,330
Manning?
Okay.

802
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,320
Let's look at Peyton Manning's brother
Eli Manning against the Patriots.

803
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,650
Tom Brady,
once again,

804
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:09,400
drives them down the field for the fourth
fucking time for the go ahead score.

805
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,760
Huh? Did Eli get nervous? No,

806
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,130
he didn't drove him right
down the fucking field.

807
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,410
It did what his big brother didn't do.
Oh,

808
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:19,300
I would love to hear that
awkward phone call today.

809
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:22,740
Ah,

810
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,590
sorry. I'm sorry to everybody who
doesn't listen. Yeah. You know what?

811
00:50:25,591 --> 00:50:28,490
I'm not sorry. Fuck you. I was
right. I always wait. Okay.

812
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:30,080
This is the Monday morning podcast.

813
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,810
I'm fucking strutting around like a God
damn rooster here. Loving life. Anyways,

814
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,880
let's get down to the podcast here.
Um,

815
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:43,220
last week I worked in a, I
worked in Irvine, California,

816
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,350
and uh, I worked at the, uh, the
Improv the first time is just south of

817
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,520
Los Hung Gullies. And uh,
I gotta tell you something.

818
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:56,600
You guys ever watched that show,
uh, the real housewives of the Osi?

819
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,600
Of course you don't. Why
would you? All right,

820
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:04,010
but do you have a woman in your life who
dominates the TV once a fucking week?

821
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:07,760
Whenever that show comes on? You know,
you can't help but see it, right?

822
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,790
I remember watching that show going like,
there's no fucking way.

823
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,100
You know what I mean?
You know, it's a TV show.

824
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:17,810
They take the extremes of different
areas in the dumber you elected like the

825
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:19,790
Jersey shore thing. You're sitting
there going, you know what?

826
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:22,970
There's no fucking way people are that
goddamn stupid. And then what happens?

827
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:26,630
You go on youtube and you see
bootlegs, bootleg cameras, you know,

828
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:28,970
shots of the Jersey shore and you're like,
Holy Shit,

829
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,280
there's an element of truth to this.

830
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:36,281
Now I'm not saying everybody in the OCC
is a 63 year old cougar with their face

831
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,780
yank back. But uh, uh, wow.

832
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,310
After,
um,

833
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,410
after one of my shows I had a group of
women coming up to me who collectively I

834
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:53,410
think their age was about
606. And um, if you saw,

835
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,250
I don't know, these plastic
surgeons are to get sued to these.

836
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,810
You ever seen Rhianna's mugshot.

837
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:04,730
All right.
It's not a mugshot.

838
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:09,410
You remember the picture after she got
the shit kicked out of her by a Chris

839
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,960
Brown or wherever the fuck his name is.
You remember that?

840
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:17,260
Just picture that face except
wherever her face was swollen.

841
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,810
Just imagine if it was equally
swollen on the other side of her face.

842
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:27,080
Like it was a symmetrical beat down.
That's what,

843
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,300
that's what plastic surgery looks like.

844
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,970
Rather than ever one
swollen up fucking Aye.

845
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,700
You got to and there and you're like,
wow,

846
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:38,120
what does this person get the shit kicked
out of them. But because they're too,

847
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:41,870
and they're exactly perfect,
Ula and you know,

848
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,620
Michelangelo was dead. You gotta be like,
well, he didn't kick the shit out of her.

849
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:49,580
This must be plastic surgery.
I'm talking like my eyes,

850
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,630
my eyes were watering when I
looked at their faces. And, uh,

851
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:59,510
they, they, and they all get
like the, these, these, uh,
those, those fucking lips.

852
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,880
And then not even, and it was a, it
was a fucking nightmare. But anyways,

853
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:06,861
uh,
but you know what I mean?

854
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:10,760
So of course I bring that up on stage
and it was like a talking about plastic

855
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:15,761
surgery in the occ in Orange County
is like bringing up Scientology in

856
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:19,820
Hollywood. It just gets really
fucking quiet and awkward.

857
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:25,100
So anyways, but I want to thank everybody
who came out to my shows. And, um,

858
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,740
actually, you know what, I
had one person come out, uh,

859
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,230
you know a lot of people who are in this
business and a lot of people who aren't

860
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:31,741
in this business,

861
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,490
they try to act like they don't give a
shit about fame and they don't care about

862
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:38,550
celebrities where I am
not one of those people,

863
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,590
I love famous people and if they
even look in my general direction and

864
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,120
acknowledge me, it actually fills me up
inside. That's how fucking insecure I am,

865
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,900
right? So Thursday night I'm doing
my show down in, uh, down enough.

866
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,700
What the fuck was I? Irvine, right?
Yeah. Bill, we know you're there.

867
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,360
We're not arguing. Just get to
the fucking point. I'll, right.

868
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,530
So I'm standing there after
the show, whoring myself
out, I'm selling my DV Dvds.

869
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:08,700
I'm shaking hands and kissing
fucking babies. Right?

870
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:13,440
And all of a sudden this like famous
people, they just got that thing, man,

871
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:17,250
I didn't even know who the fuck this was.
This woman comes up and really quickly,

872
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:21,000
like two seconds just goes, hey, I
thought you were great and shook my hand.

873
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,600
I felt that electricity. And then she
went away and I was like, God damn man,

874
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:28,860
who the fuck was that? I just got done
shaking like fucking a hundred hands,

875
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,850
nothing, nothing regular.
All away. Accountant.

876
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,850
Hey Plumber eight a college student.

877
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,360
She comes up fucking unbelievable.
Felt a connection.

878
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,920
And then as she ran away, I'm looking
at it, I'm like, you know, I ain't go,

879
00:54:42,921 --> 00:54:46,830
that looks like a Tonya contain
is how I was saying anything.

880
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,250
Evidently it's tiny contain. And I
walked in there and someone goes, hey,

881
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,150
they just, that was Tony contain, if
you don't know who the fuck that is,

882
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,830
she was the best looking video girl
for my money out of all the heavy metal

883
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:01,950
movies of all fucking time.
The Whitesnake video,

884
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,650
you know the one she danced on the cars.
I didn't like that one.

885
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,330
I like what she did at
the foot of the bed.

886
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:11,430
That little miniskirt barely covering
her. A little, a whatnot, you know,

887
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:15,000
lifted her fucking leg up like
a fucking show pony, you know?

888
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,810
I know that doesn't mean shit to you
kids nowadays, but this was pre internet,

889
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:20,730
Internet porn and all that type of stuff.

890
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:23,640
All you had was Victoria's
secret and your imagination.

891
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,980
I guess she could rent
porns at that point.

892
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:27,520
But I was too fucking
young and I was like lucky.

893
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,560
Go near to you think of booking
mood. So I never rented one. Okay,

894
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,600
so that's as far down the fucking pussy
rabbit hole I had been as far as video

895
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:41,250
pussy and a unbelievable
unfucking believable.

896
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:45,120
So
I don't know.

897
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,570
You guys probably think that's a lame
fucking story. I gotta tell you something.

898
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:52,260
When somebody who you used to jerk off
to comes up to you 20 years later and

899
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:56,040
says, Hey, great job. That's
a special moment. You know,

900
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,280
I had a lot of special moments this
week. I really did. You know what?

901
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:04,710
I didn't want to beat on my car.
I like saying that.

902
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:05,610
I don't want to beat him my car.

903
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:08,300
The reality is I have a
Toyota Prius and it has a,

904
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,010
what looks like little
breath mints for tires.

905
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,410
And I didn't feel like driving
it down in the fucking rain.

906
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:17,670
So I went out and I rented a car and I
rented one of those dodge challengers,

907
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,730
black on black.
All it had was the v six,

908
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,910
just waiting for all the gear heads
to get done groaning. Ah Dude.

909
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,960
That's just like a bitch.
Go.

910
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,710
What'd you still could take a few
drove that was a v six 3.5 liter.

911
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,890
It's still moved the car. It
was a, I'm telling you man,

912
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,590
even if you get the V sex dude,

913
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:37,750
you're going to feel like fucking
Steve McQueen in that car.

914
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:41,320
That car is the shit.
I think it's way better than the Mustang.

915
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:44,740
I rented the Mustang when I
was in, uh, Fort Lauderdale.

916
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:47,590
So all I have left to
rent is the new Camaro.

917
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,330
I like all of those cars and, but I
got to met man, the challenger Man,

918
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:53,470
that fucking,
you know what it is?

919
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:58,150
It's the forefront lights for
headlights in the front. I don't even,

920
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,710
I don't even know if one of them don't,
you know,

921
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,590
if two of them are just
dummies or they just, you know,

922
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,840
they'll like blinker lights or
something like that. I don't know what,

923
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:08,890
but it just reminded me when I was a
kid that was a sign of status to me.

924
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,890
You had the forehead lights cause I
was always into the caddies. You know,

925
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:14,170
in the late sixties one they had the Ford,
you know,

926
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:16,510
the two and two and they
were on top of each other.

927
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,000
And then for some stupid
fucking reason in the 70s,

928
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:23,170
they put them side by side and they
just didn't fucking look right. But, um,

929
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,410
I dunno, I, I would really, uh,

930
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,110
I think I'm going to get one
of those cars at some point.

931
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,340
I've got to find out how much they
are and uh, you know what I mean?

932
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,210
Cause I'm an insecure guy. I mean
that's a perfect car for a guy like me,

933
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:42,010
you know? Oh look at me, I'm
a winner, right? I'm a winter

934
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,730
dodge challenger 41
nothing. All right. Anyways,

935
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:53,260
uh, let's get on with the podcast here. I
got a lot of different sections to this.

936
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,300
I'm hoping you guys are actually
listening to this. If you are,

937
00:57:55,301 --> 00:58:00,301
that means I figured out my new podcast
server that Mark Marin of dub did WTF

938
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:05,050
podcast, who I'm going to try to have
on as a guest, uh, in the next month.

939
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,720
Um,
this is my new server.

940
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:12,130
It's costing me about 36 bucks a month
and I'm still not charging for my fucking

941
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:15,130
podcast. This is a little
bit of guilt, so you know,

942
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:19,540
I figured you guys can pay me back.
Don't steal my DVD online. All right,

943
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:23,860
go on in order the fucking thing. I'm
giving you a podcast every God damn week.

944
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,690
Now I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

945
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:30,691
I don't expect anybody in Indianapolis
or re anywhere remotely related to Peyton

946
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:34,570
manning to buy my DVD.
But the rest of you,

947
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:38,530
sons of bitches just go on and
pay for the damn thing. Okay?

948
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,600
We spent a lot of money on that.

949
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,290
We gave you a bunch of extras
or come out to one of my shows.

950
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,940
Pay me back that way. Okay. And whatever.

951
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:51,250
If you're in between jobs right now
and you're going through a rough time,

952
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:54,520
here's some free fucking comedy.
But when you hit it big, remember,

953
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,130
remember who fucking held you up?
Huh?

954
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,820
When you look down in the sand and
there was only one set of footprints.

955
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,930
That was when I carried
you with my podcast.

956
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,160
Look at me getting all biblical.
Why are you getting biblical bill?

957
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,850
I thought you don't believe in that shit.
You know why? Cause I have a confession.

958
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,310
I've got a confession to make to you guys.

959
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:19,540
You know what I did on Sunday and
I think this is why paint man,

960
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:20,650
he got his fucking ass kicked.

961
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:23,810
I actually hope you're all
sitting down at this point.

962
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:25,400
I actually went to church on Sunday

963
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:33,530
after all the Shit I talked about
organized religion and all that shit.

964
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,520
I actually went,
I went to church,

965
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,820
I went to fucking church. And, uh,

966
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:44,720
I don't know why it's one of these
deals is something about I haven't been

967
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:48,410
drinking, I'm trying to clean up my
act and the last 20 years, you know,

968
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:53,411
I've just slowly become a complete piece
of shit and I'm really trying to get

969
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:57,410
back to who the fuck I was. You
know, I used to be a good guy.

970
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,940
I used to not be cynical. I used
to believe in people. I had hope.

971
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,570
I gave to charities, you know,
I was a fucking swell guy.

972
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,450
Know 20 years of being on the road,

973
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:13,451
drinking who was corrupt club owners
fucking me over at the end of the weekend.

974
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:17,930
You know, you start to, uh, I got
no excuse, whatever, I'm a week.

975
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:24,560
Um, so whatever. So I was like, I dunno, I
need to, uh, I need to do something good.

976
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,540
So I was actually,
this is how far I went.

977
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:30,470
I actually considered going to confession
and not even because I believe in this

978
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:33,440
shit. I just wanted to see what the
priest was going to say. Cause I never,

979
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,620
you know, at the risk of
burning some of my new material,

980
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:41,000
I just never bought into that shit that
like I have to talk to God through you.

981
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,780
You know,
now you're,

982
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,480
you're some sort of voice and you want to
listen to all the fucked up shit I did.

983
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:50,720
As you look through the fucking screen,
pretending you're not looking at me,

984
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,260
you know,
plus I got admit,

985
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,960
I kind of want to see how many our
fathers and hail Mary's I was going to get

986
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,560
considering the last time I went
to confession. It was simple stuff.

987
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:04,300
Like I beat up my brother, you know, I uh,

988
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,190
had impure thoughts about my fucking,
you know,

989
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:10,880
whatever English teacher or
some stupid shit, you know,

990
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:16,520
why is that a sin?
Ace have this fucking language teacher.

991
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:19,260
When I was in, in middle school,
we didn't have junior high. It's,

992
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:22,730
this fucking girl was so
fucking ridiculously hot. Right?

993
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:27,560
And she used to wear these dresses with
a slit, go and write up the fucking side.

994
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,030
You know, a little Italian girl. She
was short. So she'd wear the sky, hey,

995
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,830
fuck me shoes. You know, every once in
a while she gave us a treat once a week.

996
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:40,190
You know, she come in with those
fucking things on it and it was really,

997
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:44,240
it was ridiculous. Um, and
not only that, she was,

998
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:45,260
she was my French teacher.

999
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:47,270
She's trying to teach me a
different fucking language weights.

1000
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:48,530
So one week she comes in,

1001
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:52,280
she literally has a sled
going up both sides.

1002
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,130
And she had this habit she'd,

1003
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:57,920
she'd rate whatever she wanted us
to learn and she would step back.

1004
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,500
So she'd have one foot,
like,

1005
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,930
I don't know how to explain.

1006
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:05,150
It's like if you're a wide receiver
and you're looking at the quarterback

1007
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,920
checking for the audible,
you got one foot in front of the other.

1008
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:08,780
That's what she's still,
but she's got a slit on both sides.

1009
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:11,360
So now not only do we see a
slip on the outside of the leg,

1010
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:15,050
I can actually see the inside of
her fucking thigh on the other side.

1011
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:19,920
I am in eighth grade. Okay.
My Dick is at is fucking,

1012
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,680
you know,
saluting the troops at that point.

1013
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:25,530
I might listen to what the fuck is
saying in English. Forget about French.

1014
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:30,180
And then she ends up calling on me as
I'm sitting there with my little Woodrow

1015
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,970
Wilson, right. And she's
like, ah, you know,

1016
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:37,080
fucking whatever the fuck she
said in French. And I had no idea.

1017
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:38,310
And I tried to play it off.

1018
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:43,440
Then she got all fucking mad at me because
I lied to her and I didn't have the

1019
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:45,120
emotional maturity be like,
really?

1020
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,130
Why don't you put some
fucking clothes on sweetheart?

1021
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,880
And maybe I'll pay attention to your
fucking language lesson here. All right.

1022
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:53,400
You stand in here with half your
fucking who are hanging out.

1023
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,320
You think I'm looking at chalk on
the board? You asshole. But I didn't,

1024
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:02,310
I just sat there and stared at my
books and she screamed at me. And uh,

1025
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:04,620
when she told me to go down in the office,
I did,

1026
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:09,420
didn't even put up a fight that I miss
my bus home and I walked home in the rain

1027
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,960
fucking saying all this shit that I wish
I had the balls to say, but I didn't.

1028
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:17,160
All right. That was a sad memory. Okay,
let's plow ahead here. So anyways,

1029
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:21,480
so I decided, I'm like, I
gotta go, I'm going to go to
fucking church, right? I got,

1030
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,280
I got to start doing some
something good in my life,

1031
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:26,250
something positive or whatever.
And for some reason,

1032
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,130
I don't know why I'm going to church
because I don't believe in this shit.

1033
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,390
I don't. But, um, I dunno.

1034
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,680
My girlfriend's mom goes to church every
week. She's a sweetheart. I'm like,

1035
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:40,680
you know, fuck this. I'm going to go
to church with my girlfriends mom. Huh?

1036
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:44,820
That's a nice thing to do, right? Then
all my female listeners just go walk.

1037
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,600
Didn't you just do that? Of course you
did. It's a fucking nice thing to do.

1038
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,990
So, you know, and I'm going all out.

1039
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,760
I haven't gone to God's house in like 20
years. So I'm like, what am I gonna do?

1040
01:03:56,761 --> 01:04:00,030
Go there with a button down and some
jeans and some shoes. Fuck that.

1041
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,170
I broke out the tonight show with Conan
O'brien suit number that's shiny one

1042
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,190
that some of you comes bitched about
some I fought this fucking HD and you can

1043
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,570
see the inside of my nose.
It looked good in real life anyway,

1044
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:13,410
so I put that on.

1045
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:16,080
I'm looking like a fucking million
bucks or maybe I'm looking a little ray

1046
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:19,190
Liotta. I don't know how I'm
looking, but I'm feeling good. Right?

1047
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,830
Went to church and I walk in.
What's the first thing I see?

1048
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:25,950
I see a big Jesus nailed on the cross,
you know?

1049
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,860
And is he looking at me now
he's looking down and I'm like,

1050
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:32,490
is he looking down because he's in
pain cause he's slowly dying from this

1051
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,850
torturous device or is it part of the
guilt? Oh look what I did for you.

1052
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:39,510
I hope you appreciate it.
You know,

1053
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,430
so I'm my guy. You're thinking negative
bill. Don't think negatives is,

1054
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:47,400
it's a good thing. It was a sunny day.
You know, it's been raining out here.

1055
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:51,240
La is never more beautiful
than right after it rains. Wow.

1056
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,740
That was the cheesiest
thing I've ever said.

1057
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,730
I should just broken into a fucking song
right there. Reminds me of my mother

1058
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,690
now.
You'd already as it fuck it.

1059
01:05:00,691 --> 01:05:03,630
And I don't know what beats down all
the smog and you can actually see out to

1060
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:05,740
the ocean. It's fucking
awesome. So anyway,

1061
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:09,690
so I sit down into the pew and I got
to admit, it's kind of bring it back.

1062
01:05:09,691 --> 01:05:13,260
Good memories. You know, we
used to go with the family.

1063
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,160
I used to go to church every fucking week
from like third grade till I was like

1064
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,500
22.
I don't think I missed a week.

1065
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,610
And I go with my family and then
afterwards we go to fucking Dunkin donuts

1066
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:27,400
stowed and we get from fucking donuts.

1067
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,650
I don't know why we get a dozen
donuts and then we'd go home,

1068
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:35,980
have Sunday breakfast, and then we all
sit around eating donuts as while we did.

1069
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:39,760
It was a good thing though.
It was a family thing. It's
a part of, it was like, wow,

1070
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:42,730
this is what I actually felt
better that I was in there

1071
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,090
and right as I was
starting to feel better,

1072
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:51,120
first fucking words out of the
priests mouth is, uh, he goes, hey,

1073
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:53,150
thanks for coming out everybody.
I see a,

1074
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,680
I see you all came out here
early to get it out of the way.

1075
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:59,410
She could watch the super bowl.
That's what he says right off the bat.

1076
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,620
It comes with the guilt.
What do you mean get it out of the way?

1077
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:05,490
Fucking game comes on at
three 30 out here. What do
you got? A three o'clock mass.

1078
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:09,880
You asshole. You don't, I'm not getting
an out of the way. How about this? Um,

1079
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,020
I made time for it.
You fucking cunt.

1080
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,320
I still have to go to the grocery
store and buy the fucking hamburger.

1081
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:19,500
I came here first.
It was right out of his mouth.

1082
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:23,650
First thing you fucking says right
here you go. All came here. Only

1083
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:31,130
one to suffocate him with that
fucking smart he was wearing.
I was like, no, no, no,

1084
01:06:31,131 --> 01:06:33,800
no. You don't try to think fucking
positive. Try to think positive.

1085
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:36,740
Stop looking at the negative cause there
is an element of this that does feel

1086
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:41,460
good. There's an element of this that
feels right. So I'm still sitting.

1087
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:43,460
Yeah. You know, and uh,

1088
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:46,830
then all of a sudden they start reading
the stories and here comes the reader,

1089
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,370
if you're not Catholic, they always
have a reader and they read a couple of,

1090
01:06:50,371 --> 01:06:51,420
a couple of little,

1091
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:55,950
Jesus did sing a couple of songs and
then the priest comes in and he fucking

1092
01:06:55,951 --> 01:07:00,930
brings in home like the headliner, you
know, reads a little bit of Gospel.

1093
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,890
So I don't want this guys doing it, these
reading scripture. I Dunno. I Dunno.

1094
01:07:04,891 --> 01:07:07,980
I Dunno the fucking words. I don't
know the technical words. So anyways,

1095
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:10,320
the reader for this week comes up,
I swear to God,

1096
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:14,040
he's like fucking 45 years
old and I shit you not,

1097
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,920
he's wearing a boy scout shirt,

1098
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,150
a fucking boy scout shirt,
and he has facial hair,

1099
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,540
a boy scout shirt and facial
hair and you're in your forties.

1100
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:28,530
I am I the only one who sees sex offender,
you know,

1101
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:33,300
and you would think with the scandal that
has gone through the Catholic church,

1102
01:07:33,301 --> 01:07:35,550
they'd be like, hey dude, we
appreciate you coming in here.

1103
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:40,380
But could you take off the fucking boy
scout uniform considering that's another

1104
01:07:40,381 --> 01:07:44,430
organization that doesn't exactly have
the greatest tap track record when it

1105
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:47,910
comes to little boys, right?
But they don't. So I'm sitting
there going, no, no, no,

1106
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:50,700
no. This guy's a good guy.
This guy's a good guy.

1107
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:55,290
He stayed on the path of the right.
Unlike you, Mr [inaudible], this guy,

1108
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:59,340
he stayed in scouting. All right? If
he diddled somebody at this point,

1109
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,650
they would've figured it out.
Maybe he's just a good guy.

1110
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,340
He knows how to start a fire without a
match. Let's listen to what he has to say.

1111
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,000
All right, and what does he do? He
fucking goes up there and he starts,

1112
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,500
this was basically the story.

1113
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:16,820
Jesus is standing on the edge of a
lake as he is. You know what I mean?

1114
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,420
James Brown had the cape. Jesus has
the lake. Everybody's got this shtick.

1115
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,070
It's fucking show business,
right?

1116
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,610
So Jesus is standing by the edge of the
lake and there's a couple of fishermen.

1117
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,780
Of course, of course. There was like three
jobs back then. You are fucking black.

1118
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,920
Smith of fishermen are a leper, okay? So
this is one of these fishermen stories,

1119
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:35,730
right?

1120
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,970
So the fishermen's Simon and some other
fucking Douche bag is sitting there

1121
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:43,880
cleaning out their nets and
Jesus goes a Romy Romy out,

1122
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:45,420
you know, 10 feet to
the lake. And they go,

1123
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:49,410
absolutely wasn't like we weren't fucking
busy over here cleaning up after a

1124
01:08:49,411 --> 01:08:53,280
hard day's work. So they roll the dude
out there, he's 10 feet off shore,

1125
01:08:53,281 --> 01:08:58,070
and now he's preaching to the
people on the shore from a Robo.

1126
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,890
You know, I'm sitting there going,
what? A fucking arrogant ass,

1127
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:04,320
but I got to give it up to him.
That's a little showbiz there.

1128
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,270
You stand on the beach,
you're just regular.

1129
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:08,250
All of a sudden you're out
there in the water, you know,

1130
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:12,730
all of a sudden it's like
he's got a stage, so whatever.

1131
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,760
So now he's out there like the arrogant
ass. He is. He standing up in the boat,

1132
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,790
which you're not supposed to do.
You're not supposed to fucking do that.

1133
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,140
He just breaking the rule.

1134
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:23,020
Just like when you see a cop
speeding in a fucking cruiser,

1135
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,140
not using this directionals.
He's not even on a call.

1136
01:09:26,141 --> 01:09:30,250
What kind of fucking example you
set. So anyways, he starts preaching,

1137
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,170
he's done preaching.

1138
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:36,220
He then tells these fishermen to
take their nets and they go fishing.

1139
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,760
And they were like, wait a minute, son of
God, not trying to step out of line here.

1140
01:09:39,761 --> 01:09:40,061
I know,

1141
01:09:40,061 --> 01:09:45,040
you know you came out of that debt
vagina that was never fornicated with uh,

1142
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,410
you know,
we've been fishing all day and well,

1143
01:09:47,411 --> 01:09:51,310
you know the risk of sounding crass,
sounding crass, we haven't caught shit.

1144
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,620
So Jesus goes,

1145
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,660
am I not the son of God?

1146
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,680
Did I not just tell you to bring your
fucking nuts out here? And they, yeah,

1147
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:04,070
sorry man. What was I thinking? Right.
Okay. I had the little casino moment.

1148
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,460
How I sticky head to that little
fucking hole. Yeah, you weren't laying,

1149
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,140
that's why he had the fucking money ready.
Right.

1150
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,760
So they grabbed their fucking nets.

1151
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,430
Ali know that coke is Joe de
Rosa uses that line all the time.

1152
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:21,380
So they grabbed their fucking nuts and
they bring it out to the lake and they go

1153
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:24,590
fishing. And what happens,
not only do they catch fish,

1154
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:29,710
they catch so much fucking fish that
it almost breaks their nets and they're

1155
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:31,940
dragging them back. And Ah, Jesus,

1156
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:36,860
best shit ever. And then he looks at
me, he goes, today, you caught fish.

1157
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,370
Tomorrow you're going to fish for men.

1158
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:45,180
And then they all walked away evidently
leaving their fish behind to follow

1159
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:47,430
Jesus to go fish for men.

1160
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,240
Can you fuck, I mean, what kind of a
fucking story is that? You're hungry.

1161
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:58,060
You wanted the food. You're going to leave
that to go try to pick up some dudes.

1162
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:02,210
And I'm listening to this with some guy
with a fucking boy scout fucking uniform

1163
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,000
on.
I'm not making any of this shit up.

1164
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,530
I was waiting for them
to start playing whether

1165
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:11,430
girls, it's raining men. I don't
understand. I know it's a metaphor.

1166
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,800
You're going to go fish for men.
Fucking Amway.

1167
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,690
We got to get somebody
else to believe this shit.

1168
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,140
What a crock of shit and catch shit. And
then he said, hey, put your netsuite has.

1169
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,310
Then we got a bunch of
up, he said, come on,

1170
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,490
let's go tell it to more people so I can
make more fucking money and live rent

1171
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:31,470
free and not pay taxes. So anyways,
um, but I'm still feeling good.

1172
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,333
There's something about,

1173
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,360
there's something about going to
church though. It's, it's get me,

1174
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,150
get me in my chest is something
that's still feeling good.

1175
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,070
Oh my master telling story. Okay. I'm
keeping the fucking, the, the, the, the,

1176
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:49,110
the peep, the blast for
me. People in this shit.

1177
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,060
And I'm also keeping the Jesus freaks.

1178
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:53,760
I'm driving you right to
the fork in the row. What?

1179
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:58,230
Is he going to choose Jesus or is he
going to keep trashing organized religion?

1180
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:03,060
Hang in there. Here we go. Getting
into the third act. So then the, uh,

1181
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:07,500
the priest there, the headliner, he comes
up, you know, and I'm thinking, all right,

1182
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:10,980
let's see. He reads the fucking Gospel
and everything and now I'm waiting for it.

1183
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:15,150
He's going to say, and what does
he do? He pops in a CD. All right?

1184
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,090
And all of a sudden we'll
listen to some cardinal,

1185
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,870
some bishop from the Vatican
doing a guest spot and you know,

1186
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,880
and what does the guy said he teaches at?

1187
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,770
He does some quick little bullshit
up front going, praise Gigi.

1188
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:30,640
You breed him fruit view [inaudible]
wonderful day and we'll, you know,

1189
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:34,170
give to you to hear me g and g old Jesus.
Right?

1190
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:35,760
And when he's done saying that Shit,

1191
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,120
little five minutes of that shit just
stroke and you with the Jesus stuff,

1192
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:43,980
what does he do? Huh? Come on people.
You haven't seen this episode before.

1193
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,300
What's his next move?

1194
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:50,430
What is the move after they butter you
up and hit you with the guilt and tell

1195
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:53,940
you how thankful you should
be for, Geez, what does he do?

1196
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,680
He starts hitting us up for money.

1197
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,990
So I sit ups up for money for some of
the poorer churches that aren't making it

1198
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,460
and we got a quota.

1199
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:06,540
We got a $41,000 quota and
we didn't make it last year.

1200
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:12,150
You know, it goes on and fucking
on. Right, right. Then, right?

1201
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:15,000
Then my girlfriend's mother, who
is hilarious, leans over, she goes,

1202
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:17,850
of course you'd have to come this week
because she knows, I think it's bullshit,

1203
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,390
right? Fucking guy in the cub scout
uniform. Now they're asking for money.

1204
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,840
So we're laughing. And then
the priest, when they finally,

1205
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:28,350
he now he shuts off the boombox. Wherever
the fuck away. I know it was a bomb box,

1206
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:31,360
but they're headed hidden.
So it seemed holy, you know,

1207
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,880
then he spends the rest of his
homily telling people, you know,

1208
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:40,470
where to fill in their credit card
number, like in, in unbelievable detail.

1209
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:44,430
You pick up the envelope in the front.
If you look over there on the left,

1210
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:45,600
if you fill in your credit card,

1211
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:48,720
I'm sure a lot of you don't have
your credit card numbers memorized.

1212
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:53,700
Trying to make little fucking jokes. You
know, and one of the things was, you know,

1213
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:58,590
if you don't want this to be a monthly,
uh, um, deduction on your credit card,

1214
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:03,360
just, you know, check the box. I love that
they're trying to get you every month.

1215
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,450
And the only way they're not going to
charge your card every month is if you do

1216
01:14:06,451 --> 01:14:08,400
something there need,
you know,

1217
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,850
they're hoping all those fucking old
people with heart to hear and they're not

1218
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,390
going to check the fucking box. And the
next month I couldn't buy ODL pole. Right.

1219
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:20,650
They don't give a fuck. And then
that was it. And then the mass ended.

1220
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:22,990
But there was something down
still. I don't know, it felt good.

1221
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:26,840
You know what it was when I walked
out and they were having their,

1222
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:31,210
their little fucking bake sale and they
will have in their raffles and I bought

1223
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:34,630
my girl's mom a ticket to win some
fucking pots and pans and shit. You know,

1224
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:36,580
it felt good because
you're around good people.

1225
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,730
And that's what I hate about religion
is because the people who show up,

1226
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:44,820
they had good fucking people and
they get fleeced. You know, you know,

1227
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,870
it's funny is actually I
gave two bucks if you know,

1228
01:14:46,871 --> 01:14:50,290
bought a raffle ticket for the pots and
pans and then we walked by another table

1229
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,320
and the glaze like, oh, you know, this
one's only two bucks for this raffle.

1230
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,050
And I look what they're raffling off
and was one of those fucking, you know,

1231
01:14:56,051 --> 01:14:59,470
Virgin Mary pictures with his like
holy blood dripping down her face or

1232
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:00,940
something like that. And it's like, yeah,

1233
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:04,290
I really don't want that hanging
in my apartment. Okay. It's just,

1234
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:07,270
it's creeping me out. I'll take
some pots and pans, you know,

1235
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,840
I'll make a rump roast, have
a little get together. Right.

1236
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,900
I'm not going to wash anybody's feet
as they come through the fucking door.

1237
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:19,450
I leave that for gcs. Um,
so anyways, there you go.

1238
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,310
Actually went to church and,
uh,

1239
01:15:21,311 --> 01:15:24,580
I didn't buy into any of the bullshit that
the fucking guys with the uniforms on,

1240
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,001
we're saying,

1241
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:28,750
but there was something that I kind of
felt a little bit nice and evidently

1242
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,250
they're having a car wash on Saturday.
I'm going to go buy,

1243
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,990
I'll go by, I'll get my fucking car wash.
Why not the car wash in my neighborhood?

1244
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,410
They're always protest and that they're
not paying the fucking illegals to wash

1245
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:46,140
the cars or fuck it. I don't know.
So there you go. That aren't a spark.

1246
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:49,420
Some fucking discussion.
One side's going to say,

1247
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:53,020
I sold out in the other side's going to
keep trying to push me towards Jesus.

1248
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:56,080
It's not going to work. I know what
the feeling was when I went in there.

1249
01:15:56,081 --> 01:16:00,890
That's that overall natural spirituality
that you're born with. Then, uh,

1250
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:03,770
organized religion. Okay. I'm
going to give them a bent.

1251
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,800
The benefit of the doubt that they
started off with a good, a good purpose,

1252
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:12,430
but they hoard it out. They whore out.
That feeling. When you do something nice,

1253
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:14,620
you feel good.
You know,

1254
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,440
I felt good cause I was there with my
girlfriend's mother and it was a nice

1255
01:16:17,441 --> 01:16:22,150
thing to do and I wasn't hung over and
I wasn't a Douche bag the night before I

1256
01:16:22,151 --> 01:16:26,170
did my shows. Everything was good.
I didn't hurt anybody. You know,

1257
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,760
I can do that without,
uh, you know, you know,

1258
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:34,060
I can do that and still have a fucking
chicken sandwich on, on Good Friday.

1259
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:35,560
Whatever the fuck it is when I'm not,
you know,

1260
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,740
tell me what to eat and when I can
jerk off a fucking jerk off all I want.

1261
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:42,820
He cuts. All right, let's
get to the topics here.

1262
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,690
Spent a great fucking podcast. She
got to give it up. Come on, man.

1263
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,220
It's been a great fucking podcast.

1264
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:51,120
Started off with some music
I got into religion. I'm,

1265
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:54,190
I'm feeling this one and right now. Why
don't you know what I'm doing right now?

1266
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:57,160
You think? You think I'm fucking
pat myself on the back? I'm not,

1267
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:01,610
I'm actually killing time right now
because I'm trying to get to the fucking,

1268
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:05,590
where the hell is it? The questions
for the week. Podcast. Quick questions.

1269
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:09,110
Click twice. All right,
let's get into this.

1270
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:13,250
Let's get into this as quickly as we
can and then I'm getting Outta here.

1271
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,830
Um, all right. Oh, here's
a new one. This is,

1272
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:23,650
this is one that I like because as you
can tell, I'm really into sports. Um,

1273
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:28,770
I'm into sports the way I'm not into g
Jewish and is that how I spelled obscure?

1274
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,750
O. B. S. C. U. R. E. Sign.
You spell obscure Cy. You
spell anything that's fucking,

1275
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:42,650
that looks weird. That made sense
to my brain when I wrote that.

1276
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,070
You know what's funny is I'm so fucking
stupid. That might even be right,

1277
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:48,410
but now I'm looking at it and it
just looks wrong. You ever do that?

1278
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,940
You have actually spell
it right and you're like,

1279
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:51,920
there's no fucking way I got it right.
I'm too stupid.

1280
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,910
And then you look it up on
the Internet like Holy Shit,

1281
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:56,000
I got to write and actually got it right.

1282
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:59,150
I wish I could retain that information
because I know God damn well.

1283
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:02,210
The next time I write it, I'm going to
go through the exact same process again.

1284
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,790
That happens to me with that.
The word restaurant,

1285
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,320
I can never remember if it's
Ari, s. T. A. U. R. A. N.

1286
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:13,910
T or R e. S. T. A. Fuck. A. R. A. U. N. T.

1287
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:18,620
I keep always figure out whether
Hugo's all right, here we go. Yeah,

1288
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:20,870
that's, that's what I get to
say. It's a great podcast.

1289
01:18:20,871 --> 01:18:24,980
Now it's going to fucking Peter out.
Alright. Obscure movies, bands in books.

1290
01:18:24,981 --> 01:18:26,210
If you guys have read a great book,

1291
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:29,960
if you've seen a really cool band and if
you've seen a really cool movie that is

1292
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:34,760
not, you know, I mean, don't, don't
fucking recommend Lord of the rings.

1293
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,450
Okay? I'll just check out this band
you to, you know, the guy, the guy.

1294
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:42,950
You've got a pretty good catalog,
you know, just some shit that is um,

1295
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,040
you know, under the radar a little
bit. Here's one foyer that uh,

1296
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,060
one of my brothers actually recommended.
Uh, they recommended the movie,

1297
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:54,920
the conversation that stars are
gene Hackman, a young Harrison Ford,

1298
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,920
and that fucking do to place Frito.
I can never remember his name,

1299
01:18:57,921 --> 01:19:02,300
but he is the greatest IMD baby
I've ever seen in my life. Okay,

1300
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:04,040
go look it up.
You know,

1301
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:07,010
he died tragically young of some
disease is fucking horrible,

1302
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:09,800
but you can't mess with his I MDB.

1303
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:12,160
He never did any meet
the parents bullshit.

1304
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,990
This guy was in the godfather
that he did the conversation.

1305
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:18,620
Then he did the godfather part two,
then he did dog day afternoon,

1306
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:22,910
and then he did the deer hunter
and then he tragically passed away.

1307
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,280
It's not even tragic he did it.
There's no reason for him to continue.

1308
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,770
Guy Was the shit. I was
actually reading up on him. He,

1309
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:32,900
I guess he was one of the reasons why,
you know,

1310
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,990
Al Pachino moved down in New York to
become an actor and he was like his best

1311
01:19:35,991 --> 01:19:39,320
friend who was a really sad story.
He was engaged to a Meryl Streep,

1312
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,580
phenomenal actor. And I don't even
know his name, very tragic, whatever.

1313
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:47,580
But the conversation is a great
movie and I think it's very, uh,

1314
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,230
it,
it holds up and it's very,

1315
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:54,080
I don't even know what the
fucking word is of this time,

1316
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,390
whatever the word is to say that.
All right,

1317
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,300
here's something somebody else
recommended. Somebody said, um,

1318
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,350
he's a couple movies. Recommend you
there, Woody Allen pictures. Um,

1319
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:07,500
there's not a lot of people talk about,
one of them is called whatever works.

1320
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,900
I'm not going to describe
it because I'll ruin it.

1321
01:20:09,901 --> 01:20:13,470
All I'm going to say simply say is it's
worth a watch if you've not already

1322
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:17,460
indulged. Also, have you seen the
a flick Alan did a few years ago,

1323
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:20,010
a few years ago called match point.

1324
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:24,120
Definitely not your average woody
Allen picture, but it was really good.

1325
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,710
So I'm going to check those out.

1326
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,390
And somebody actually
this weekend recommended,

1327
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,900
I can't remember what Sylvester Stallone,

1328
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,810
I talked about people getting microchipped
and they were trying to say that

1329
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,830
semester like demolition man was that
the name of it was saying that movie was

1330
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:46,620
so on point as to what the
fuck is going on right now.

1331
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:50,250
And they basically talked about the
phasing out of cash and everybody getting

1332
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:53,640
fucking microchipped and if you fuck
with the deal, they turn your chip off.

1333
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:58,530
I think it was called demolition man. Um,
if anybody knows what the name of it is,

1334
01:20:58,531 --> 01:21:03,120
please let me know and I'll, I'll, I'll
reconfirm it next week on the podcast. Um,

1335
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:07,560
and here's a book that somebody saying,
um, if you don't want to read Socrates,

1336
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,560
this woman from Germany,
I thought that was really cool.

1337
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:12,210
Somebody from Germany is
actually listening to this,

1338
01:21:12,211 --> 01:21:16,050
actually recommended this saying
Socrates is really dry, obviously,

1339
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:21,000
because it was fucking 9,000
years ago. And, uh, so they said,

1340
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,590
if you want to,
I have a better read for you,

1341
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:27,270
which is based on the great philosophies
of soccer, Socrates, Aristotle,

1342
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:28,780
and Plato.
Uh,

1343
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,040
it's called Sophie's world is the name
of the book and has the same core ideas

1344
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:36,540
and it really takes you
to the edge of your mind.

1345
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:42,300
How great is that to describe a book? It
takes you to the edge of your mind. See,

1346
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,430
I love stuff like that.
There's no fucking way.

1347
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:47,940
I'm not gonna read that Sophie's world.
It's spelled s o.

1348
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:53,880
P. H. I. E. S. Come on man, start
ringing. Stop being a dumb fuck like me.

1349
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:57,240
Come on everyone. Let's, let's try it.
Let's try to try to improve ourselves.

1350
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:01,030
You know, I'm trying, I went to church.
I try not to fucking heckle through.

1351
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:01,220
You know,

1352
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:05,070
it was funny when I was there is I was
saying prayers I had not seen said in

1353
01:22:05,071 --> 01:22:10,071
like 20 fucking years and this is one
pray prayer after the homily at in

1354
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:12,630
Catholic Church that is like,

1355
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:16,590
it takes a minute or a minute and a
half everyone to say and it's like,

1356
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:20,280
and it goes to something like we
believe in one God the Father Almighty,

1357
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:24,380
the maker of Heaven and earth of all
that is seen and unseen. Ababa Ba,

1358
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,120
I don't even know what the fuck it was
but it was like one of those things where

1359
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:29,220
like I was just,

1360
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:34,340
I was just reciting it like a fucking
Zombie to the point I was laughing because

1361
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:37,680
I couldn't remember it,
but as people were saying around me,

1362
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:40,890
I was just right on it. You know,
kind of like when there was a song,

1363
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,410
if you're really into this band in high
school and you hadn't listened to the

1364
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:46,740
song in 20 years and all of a sudden
it comes out and you're just fucking

1365
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,520
finding the words like where the fuck are
these coming from? Cause they, they get,

1366
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:54,980
they had embedded in my head 20 straight
fucking years and not missing mass,

1367
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,850
um, or whatever it was. 14
years. All right, here's,

1368
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:02,010
here's the last thing I'm going to read
for this week and then I'm gonna do some

1369
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:05,070
overrated, underrated. Um, all right.

1370
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:09,010
Some advice somebody asking me
about abroad over there. Dear Bill,

1371
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,750
since you have no idea who I am,

1372
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:14,140
I don't mind writing to you and explaining
my current problem I'm experiencing

1373
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:16,810
with a certain female.
And since you don't know me,

1374
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:18,310
you'll probably be more than honest.

1375
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:22,630
You'll be more honest than the girls I
tell this story to. Okay, here's the deal.

1376
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:27,310
I'm currently chasing this girl that
I've known for a year who for some reason

1377
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:30,610
goes through phases where one
day I'm the greatest thing ever.

1378
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:34,570
And then for the whole next I could die
from cancer and she wouldn't blink an

1379
01:23:34,571 --> 01:23:39,370
eye. She also has a tendency to make me
jealous on purpose for no reason at all.

1380
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:44,110
I've confronted her on the issue and her
explanation was that she hates when I

1381
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:46,330
get jealous. All right. Right there dude.

1382
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:51,930
She is standing on top of an old
Victorian House waving the beware.

1383
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:55,420
I'm a cunt flag.
All right,

1384
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,830
so you got to get away from this girl.
This is the,

1385
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:03,040
you know what this girl's deal is?
She wants to be in a relationship.

1386
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:07,210
She doesn't want to be in one with you,
but she doesn't want to be alone,

1387
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:09,670
all right?
And in the back of her head,

1388
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:13,660
she knows she's wasting her time by
hanging out with you rather than going out

1389
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:16,540
trying to find Mr, right?
So what she's doing is,

1390
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:21,490
is rather than dealing with that herself
as she's taking it out on you, you know,

1391
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:22,790
and,

1392
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:26,140
and another thing she's doing is really
sadistic is she knows that you like her

1393
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,290
and she's playing you. You
know, just playing with you,

1394
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:33,400
playing with your fucking mind and just
trying to see the shit that she can get

1395
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:37,750
you to do. Fuck her. All right, this, you
know what? You want to fuck that girl.

1396
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:40,780
This is the, you got to walk away
from her. Walk away from her.

1397
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,320
Go hang out with your buddies. If you
don't have any buddies, go get somebody.

1398
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:47,470
Go hang out in a bar and do what
I always say to do. All right,

1399
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,290
cause you're wounded right now and you're
going to be in the bar and you can be

1400
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:51,124
feeling now.
Well,

1401
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:55,000
these girls don't make me feel the way
that each other girl does. Fuck that.

1402
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:59,620
You got to beat that feeling down and
you beat it down with alcohol and hitting

1403
01:24:59,621 --> 01:25:02,620
on girls. You don't give a shit
about getting the fucking game.

1404
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,660
It's going to build up your self esteem.
Now,

1405
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:07,030
I'm not saying be mean
to these other girls.

1406
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:11,110
Don't take out your heartbreak that
this other fucking chick gave you.

1407
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:14,950
Don't take that out on these other girls
because then you become a cop to go out

1408
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:17,560
there and fucking find out
how your personality works.

1409
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:21,630
You know it's going to build up your
self esteem. Next time she sees you,

1410
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:24,760
you got to fucking broad on each arm.
She's going to get competitive.

1411
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:28,570
Next thing you know, your Dick
is in her fucking mouth. Okay?

1412
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,810
And you finish in their son.
All right.

1413
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,130
Sorry man. I stood up. I stood up. I
started feeling like a fucking coach.

1414
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:44,110
I want a little big there. Don't finish
unless she says it's okay. All right.

1415
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:45,670
But if you bang are
definitely wear a condom.

1416
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:48,220
You have fucking respect for yourself.
You have respect for your body.

1417
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:50,710
All right to go out there
and talk some shit, son,

1418
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,070
you had shoulder pads that'd be fucking
banging on right now and send you out

1419
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:58,510
right through the fucking tunnel
into some meat market. Okay.

1420
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:01,710
Overrated. Underrated for
this week. A overrated.

1421
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:06,560
This guy says children right off
the Bat, I love this guy. He said,

1422
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:09,530
I'm sick and tired of people
doing shit for the children.

1423
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,600
We got to do it for the children.

1424
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,690
I understand that you need to
look after infants and toddlers,

1425
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:18,770
but I remember being nine, 10 and 11 and
at that age I really didn't give a fuck.

1426
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:21,590
I was too busy trying to hump
some girl behind a garage,

1427
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:26,030
all the while trying not to get caught
by the people who were supposedly looking

1428
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:27,530
after me.
My parents,

1429
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:31,820
half of the little twats just want to
fucking eat cookies and ice cream and play

1430
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,540
Xbox 360 all day. So I say, fuck the kids,

1431
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:40,550
help the adults that are struggling
with bills and shit. I love that.

1432
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:41,510
What a fucking great guy.

1433
01:26:41,511 --> 01:26:44,810
I love him because he's speaking from
his heart and a right in the end,

1434
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:48,340
it petered out with his ignorance.
Fuck the kids and,

1435
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:53,540
and help the adults who are struggling
with bills and shit. I love and shit.

1436
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:57,740
It really just knocks it down by fucking
90 Iq points right down to my level.

1437
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,840
All right, I'll go with that one. Exactly.

1438
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:03,410
Why don't we help out the fucking people
without jobs. And then this is other,

1439
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:08,030
his other one underrated. Uh, he
says whores and he spelled it h.

1440
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,350
O. A. R. S.

1441
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:15,410
I think that's hilarious because isn't
board spelt with a B, which is a pig,

1442
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:18,830
you know, which is another fucking
derogatory term from a woman.

1443
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:23,630
So he's kind of combined whores
and bores whores, Hoa ars.

1444
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:27,080
He said there's nothing like a good whore.
Aho Ar.

1445
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,120
She will make you appreciate a good woman.

1446
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:32,870
I can't tell you how many times I've
looked at a stripper or some country,

1447
01:27:32,871 --> 01:27:35,990
little whore and thought to myself,
thank God she goes,

1448
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:40,400
she goes home to some other dumb
fuck wives and girlfriends hate them,

1449
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:44,180
but until you spend the night at
a club full of skanks and whores,

1450
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,880
you can't really appreciate a good woman.
See,

1451
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,200
I like that because it's actually
positive for women. That's right.

1452
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,890
That's absolutely right.
I totally agree with you on that one.

1453
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:58,730
And that's the podcast for this week
and I'm not going to go long because I

1454
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,260
think this was a fucking great one.

1455
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:04,400
I had a blast on this [inaudible] I
say a blast. How fucking old am I?

1456
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:09,050
I had a rock and good time. No,
I did. I feel fucking vindicated.

1457
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,300
So fucking vindicated.

1458
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:15,880
Peyton manning was exactly who the fuck
I thought he was and they were crowning

1459
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,350
him king crown and I'm fucking king.

1460
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:21,770
And I'm not saying that that
dude one eventually become king,

1461
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,690
but you got to do some shit first.

1462
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:27,440
That's all part of that marketing
shit where they're selling.

1463
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:31,550
They're just selling you a f like
before they ever do it. You know,

1464
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,080
fucking guys come in and lead.

1465
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:35,780
They get a sneaker contract before
they gain a yard. It's bullshit.

1466
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,100
When the Superbowl's when in the end,
drive your team down the field,

1467
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:43,550
tie up to score, winning her over in over
time, and then I'll give it up to you.

1468
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:46,970
I'm not that much of a home or where I'm
going to be. I'm going to be a contract.

1469
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,910
You've got to fucking do it first
before people say you're the greatest.

1470
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:53,210
All right. I know I repeated
myself, but you know it's not,

1471
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:57,110
it's not a lot of times in life when I'm
fucking right and I was right on that.

1472
01:28:57,111 --> 01:29:01,420
So congratulations to the saints and a,
all the fans are the saints and all that.

1473
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,720
It was fucking awesome to
see that you guys deserve it.

1474
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:07,020
I hope you make a bunch of fucking money
down there and you rebuild the houses

1475
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:10,170
and you give them back to the fucking
people who previously owned them rather

1476
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:11,660
than the cons. Who Want
to build cheesecake? Yeah.

1477
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,790
Factories down there. All right, that's
it. I'll talk to you guys next week.

1478
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:15,624
Have a wonderful

1479
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,673
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1480
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:01,560
you.
