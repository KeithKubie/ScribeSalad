started again it starts like five times

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629
started again it starts like five times
 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.099
started again it starts like five times
which is really odd uh and that's kind

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109
which is really odd uh and that's kind
 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.659
which is really odd uh and that's kind
of a problem like I said there there's a

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669
of a problem like I said there there's a
 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.640
of a problem like I said there there's a
few too many this needed one more

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
few too many this needed one more
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.640

rewrite in my opinion and I think

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
rewrite in my opinion and I think
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.979
rewrite in my opinion and I think
whatever it was based on it was probably

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989
whatever it was based on it was probably

to see it even though I'm not you know
 

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.800
to see it even though I'm not you know
it doesn't fully work um

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:27.810
it doesn't fully work um
 

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.509

something like that it's along those
 

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:42.930
something like that it's along those
lines it doesn't make much sense you

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:42.940
lines it doesn't make much sense you
 

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.920
