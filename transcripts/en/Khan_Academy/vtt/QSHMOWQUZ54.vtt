00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:02.383
- [Instructor] Let's take a
look at some statistical studies

00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:04.826
and see if we can figure
out what type they are.

00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:06.511
So this first one, "Roy's Toys received

00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:09.814
"a shipment of 100,000 rubber
duckies from the factory.

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:12.191
"The factory couldn't promise
that all rubber duckies

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.382
"are in perfect form,

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:14.871
"but they promised that the percentage

00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:18.168
"of defective toys won't exceed 5%."

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:19.692
Let me underline that.

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:21.054
"They promised that the percentage

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.055
"of defective toys won't exceed 5%.

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:25.873
"Roy wanted to get an estimation

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:27.967
"of the percentage of defective toys,

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:32.591
"and since he couldn't go over
the entire 100,000 duckies,

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:36.236
"he took a random sample of 10 duckies.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:40.741
"He found that 10% of
them were defective."

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.175
So what's going on here?

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.550
Roy gets a shipment.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.911
There's a 100,000 ducks in the shipment.

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:48.107
He wants to figure out what percentage

00:00:48.107 --> 00:00:49.997
of them are defective.

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:53.154
He can't look at all 100,000 ducks.

00:00:53.154 --> 00:00:54.505
It's not practical,

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.677
so he samples 10 of them.

00:00:56.677 --> 00:00:58.135
One, two, three, four,

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:01.223
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:04.641
and he finds that one out
of those 10 are defective,

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.627
10% of the 10.

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:07.464
So first of all,

00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:10.662
this is clearly a sample study.

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:13.412
This is a sample study.

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:14.737
How do we know that?

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:18.847
Well, he is taking a sample
from a broader population

00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:20.705
in order to estimate a parameter,

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:24.153
and the parameter is the
percentage of those 100,000 duckies

00:01:24.153 --> 00:01:26.307
that are actually defective.

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:27.665
Now, the next question is

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.841
is what kind of conclusion can he make.

00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:31.501
Roy, since he got the shipment,

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.832
and he took a sample

00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:35.592
and he found that 10% of
the sample was defective,

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.416
he might be all up in arms

00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:41.149
and say, "Oh, this toy
shipment from the factory,

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.399
"they violated this promise

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.047
"that the percentage of defective toys

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:47.331
"won't exceed 5%

00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:48.981
"'cause I sampled 10 toys,

00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.458
"and 10% of those 10 toys were defective."

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:55.018
Well, that isn't a reasonable conclusion

00:01:55.018 --> 00:01:57.282
because this is a small sample.

00:01:57.282 --> 00:01:58.385
This is a small sample.

00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.218
Think about it.

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:00.922
He could have sampled five duckies,

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:03.070
and if he just happened to
get one of the defective ones,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.193
he would have said, "Oh,
maybe 20% are defective."

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.248
What he's really gotta do is sample,

00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:10.105
take a larger sample,

00:02:10.105 --> 00:02:12.850
and, once again, whatever your sampling,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.994
there's always a probability

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:16.751
that your estimate is going to be

00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:19.155
not close or definitely not the same

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.703
as the parameter for the population.

00:02:21.703 --> 00:02:23.260
But the larger your sample,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.612
the higher a probability
that your estimate

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:29.961
is close to the actual
parameter for the population,

00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:32.649
and 10 of this is just too low.

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:33.498
In future videos,

00:02:33.498 --> 00:02:36.975
we'll talk about how you
can estimate the probability

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:38.433
or how you can figure out

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.600
whether your sample seemed sufficient.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.510
But for this one, for what Roy did,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.472
I don't think 10 duckies is enough.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:48.539
If he sampled maybe 100 duckies,

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:49.495
or more than that,

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:51.540
and he found that 10%
of them were defective,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.542
well, that seems less likely to happen

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:56.213
just purely due to chance.

00:02:56.213 --> 00:02:57.519
Let's do a few more of these,

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.858
and actually, I'll do
those in the next videos.
