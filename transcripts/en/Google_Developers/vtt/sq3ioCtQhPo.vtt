[OLD COMPUTER NOISES]

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.750
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.083
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:08.299
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.590
Now, studies have shown that
an increase in performance

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.260
leads to happier,
more-engaged users, which

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.560
is why you should check out this
post on the new APIs in Chrome

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.110
to help you improve
scroll performance.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.220
Frameworks like Ruby
on Rails and Sinatra

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.390
make it easy for developers to
rapidly build web applications

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.350
and APIs for the cloud.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.480
And App Engine provides
an easy-to-use platform

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.590
for developers to build, deploy,
and manage and automatically

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.660
scale services on Google's
infrastructure, which

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.570
is why we're excited that Ruby
Runtime on Google App Engine

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.927
is going beta.

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:43.260
For more details and links
to the Getting Started Guide,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.650
samples, and interactive
tutorials, check out the post.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.580
And that's it.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.260
It's light today
because everybody

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.830
is, mmm, focused on
Google I/O next week.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.710
[CHEERING]

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.030
Seriously, it's going
to be a lot of fun.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.140
Oh, and there won't be a TL;DR
next week because the "Dev

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.620
Show" team will be on the ground
at I/O getting your questions

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.400
answered.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.810
Make sure to use the
hashtag #askdevshow.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.800
And I'll see you next time.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.360
What are you still doing here?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.210
The video's over, and
Google I/O is next week.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.110
Let's get to work.
