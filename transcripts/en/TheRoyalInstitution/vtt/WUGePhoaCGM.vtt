00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.280
Winter is finally over and it's time to
pack away the wooly layers and wave

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.670
goodbye to winter blues. It's fair to say
that people tend to be far more cheery

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.750
and happy during the summer time when
the weather is good rather than the gray

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.070
and dreary months of winter but can the
seasons are really affects our mood and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.289
behavior? There is a small subset of the
population who do suffer during the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.859
winter months from a condition known as
Seasonal Affective Disorder. This is

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.960
suitably shortened to the term SAD. This is
basically recognized as the beginning or

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.930
the worsening of the symptoms of
depression which occurs with the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.280
changing of the seasons
typically the winter or autumn months.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.520
Exposure to daylight is thought to be
one of the main culprits behind this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.360
disorder with people typically seeing
reduced daylight hours during the winter months

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.620
So the human body has eyes which
it uses to detect light changes.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.539
Variations and light levels are then
communicated to the brain which in part

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.228
uses this information to regulate our internal body clock.

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:09.869
Our internal body clock is basically a complex dance of
chemicals that's happening in your brain

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.369
and these chemicals influence things
like mood, appetite and sleep.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.000
So you can kind of see where I'm going with this.
If light can influence this system

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.638
then seasonal variations in light levels
will cause changes in how the system operates.

00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:25.890
More specifically this is
thought to affect the levels of two

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.479
hormones one called serotonin which
affects mood and the other called

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.769
melatonin which helps regulate sleep

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:36.314
Studies have found that when people are exposed to bright light early in the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.107
morning their production of melatonin occurs earlier in the evening.

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:44.040
This means it's easier for them to fall asleep at the correct time

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
As the seasons change our bodies need to learn to advance our

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.720
production of melatonin as sunrise
occurs later and later.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.860
This is called melatonin phase advancement

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.080
One idea is
that people with irregularly long body

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.580
clock cycles find it more difficult to
adjust to these seasonal changes.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.630
This leads to symptoms such as low mood
fatigue all of which are commonly

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.470
associated with SAD.
It's thought that this disorder is a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.269
biochemical evolutionary hangover from
our mammalian ancestors you typically

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.660
hibernated during the winter months but
enough with the winter doom-and-gloom

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.040
because summer is finally here so get
outside and take advantage of that sunny

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.900
weather. But if comes September the idea
of the looming winter months is getting

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.269
you down then you can always just go and
live in Yuma Arizona which had over 90%

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.299
sunlight during its daylight hours is
the world's sunniest place
