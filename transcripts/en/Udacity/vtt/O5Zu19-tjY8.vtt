00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, students. I am back to teach you a bit about SLAM.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There was a request--a popular request, actually, in email and the discussion forum.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
SLAM is a method for mapping that's short for "simultaneous localization and mapping."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Some of the this might show up in the final exam, so do pay attention.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Mapping is all about building maps of the environment.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You might remember in the localization classes we assumed the map was given.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
One of the big passions in my life has been to understand how to make a robot

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
make these maps like this map here, which is a 3D map

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of an abandoned underground coal mine in Pennsylvania

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
near Carnegie-Mellon University.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Over the past 10 years or so, I have worked on a number of different methods

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
for buildings maps that are quite sophisticated,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
like this particle filter method over here that you can see.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
All these methods have in common that we build a model of the environment

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
while also addressing the fact that the robot itself accrues uncertainty while it moves.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When, in this example here, the loop is being closed,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
you can see how our mapping technology is able to accommodate this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and find a consistent map despite the fact that the robot drifted a little along the way.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The key insight in building maps is the robot itself

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
might lose track of where it is by virtue of its motion uncertainty.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You accommodate this in localization by using an existing map,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but now we don't have an existing map. We're building a map.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's where SLAM comes into play.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
SLAM doesn't stand for "slamming" a robot.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What it really means is "simultaneous localization and mapping."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a big, big, big research field.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Most of my AI book is about this technology,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and today I want to show you my favorite method called "graph SLAM,"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which is also by far the easiest method to understand.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We will reduce the mapping problem to a couple of very intuitive

00:02:02.000 --> 09:59:59.000
additions into a big matrix and a vector, and that's it.
