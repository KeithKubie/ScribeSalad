00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.720
We were on problem 227 when
I got a phone call.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.790
It was actually from Jonathan
who helps me with the Khan

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.070
Academy, so I thought
it was worth taking.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.130
He works at LinkedIn and he
wanted let me know about all

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.410
this news that was
occurring there.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.100
Anyway, I'm getting
distracted.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.840
Let's go back to the
GMAT problems.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.480
So problem 227.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.230
In the coordinate system above,
which of the following

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.990
is an equation of line l?

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.460
And they didn't put this 2 here
and this 3 here, but from

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.439
the drawing you can assume that
this is the point x is

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.340
equal to 3, and this is the
point x is equal to 2.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.600
And then frankly, you need that
information to figure out

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.070
the equation of this line.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.900
So, first of all, what's
the slope of the line?

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.730
Make sure my tool is right.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.250
The slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.790
See, when you go from this point
to this point, what's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.030
the change in y?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.950
It's 0 minus 2, which makes
sense, because we went down by

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.420
2, and the change in
x is 3 minus 0.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.250
Whenever you do slope, it's
important remember, if I'm

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.580
taking this as the first point
on the y side, so 0 minus 2, I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.270
have to do the same on the
bottom, 3 minus 0.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.290
Otherwise, we'll get the
negative of the slope.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.220
Anyway, this is equal to minus
2/3, and what's the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.910
y-intercept?

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.250
Well, it's pretty obvious.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.460
When x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 2.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.370
So we could say, y of
0 is equal to 2.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.820
So the equation of this line,
at least the mx plus b form

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.880
that you learned in school, is y
is equal to minus 2/3 of the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.970
slope times x plus
the y-intercept.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.270
And that's not one
of the choices.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.340
They've written it in
a different form.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.470
They call it the ax plus by
equals c form, so let's see if

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.810
we can get there.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.130
Let's get rid of this 3 in the
denominator, so let's multiply

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010
both sides of this
equation by 3.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.160
I'll switch colors.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:04.030
You get 3y minus 2x-- no, 3y is
equal to-- sorry-- minus 2x

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.430
plus 6, right?

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.310
I just multiplied
everything by 3.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.590
3y is equal to minus
2x plus 6.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.550
Now let's add 2x to both sides,
and you get 2x plus 3y

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.170
is equal to 6, which
is choice B.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.580
Next problem.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.020
Problem 200.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.010
No, what is this?

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.600
Problem 228.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.920
If a two-digit positive
integer has its digits

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.330
reversed, the resulting integer
differs from the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.110
original by 27.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.140
So let's say I had AB.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.700
That's a two-digit number.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.980
And I'm going to subtract
BA from it, and so the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.960
difference is 27.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.590
Since I'm assuming a positive
difference, AB has got to be a

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530
bigger number than BA.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.410
So at least the way I've
written it, what do

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.110
we know about it?

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.730
Well A has to be greater
than B, right?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.730
If AB is greater than BA, A has
got to be-- well, right.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.050
A has got to be greater
than B.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.770
I was going to say A could be
greater than or equal to B,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.580
but if A was equal to B,
then this thing right

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.180
here would be 0.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.610
So if we assume that AB minus B
is a positive 27, then that

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.180
tells us that A is greater than
B, or B is less than A.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.820
So if B is less than A, when
we're doing the subtraction

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.110
problem, we're going to have
to-- when we do this part,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.896
when we do the ones place, if B
is less than A, we're going

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:33.750
to have to borrow, right?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.230
So if we borrow, this A becomes
A minus 1 and the B

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.830
becomes B plus 10, and then
we'd be ready to subtract.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.300
So what could we say?

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:57.090
We could say that B plus 10
minus A is equal to 7, which

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.030
tells us that B minus A
is equal to minus 3.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.490
And that's essentially what
they're asking for.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.360
They want to know by how much
to do the two digits differ.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.960
Well, B minus A is equal to
minus 3, that's saying that A

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.045
minus B is equal to
positive 3, right?

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.760
You just multiply both
sides by negative 1.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.430
Or you could say that the
absolute value of B minus A,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.730
or A minus B, or how much they
differ is equal to 3, right?

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.670
The absolute value of
B minus A is plus 3.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.260
And just to make sure that this
all works out, if we do

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.166
it with the tens place, A minus
1 minus B is equal to 2.

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.780
Let's add 1 to both sides.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.740
You get A minus B is equal
to 3, so it works out.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.510
A and B differ from each
other by exactly 3, and

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.040
that's choice A.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:58.520
Problem 229 The circle-- OK, let
me see if I can draw this.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.220
So I have one line, I have
another line, and

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.670
then I have a circle.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.420
It starts right there, so it
looks something like that.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.706
There's a tangent.

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:14.940
It has center c right there.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.630
And it says the circle with
center c shown above is

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.720
tangent to both axes.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.760
If the distance from o to c
is equal to k-- I'll get a

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.940
different color.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.280
So this is from the
origin to c.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.540
So they label the origin as o.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.470
But if that is equal to k,
what is the radius of the

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.880
circle in terms of k?

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.830
Let's think about this.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.290
So this is-- this is going to
deal with triangles, and how

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.610
can we use the radius and relate
it to this right here?

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.660
Well, the first thing that might
come to mind is if I

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.970
just drop a line straight down
from here, that's equal to the

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.130
radius, right?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.640
That's equal to the radius,
because it is a 90-degree

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.880
angle right here, right?

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.840
It touches that line.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.780
So if we could figure out this
distance right here, then we

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.360
could use the Pythagorean
theorem to maybe figure out

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.420
what the radius is.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.610
And luckily enough, this
distance is also the radius.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.490
And if that's not obvious
to you, think about it.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.740
The distance from here to here
is exactly the same thing as

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.240
the distance from here
to there, right?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.510
And from here to here is the
radius of the circle.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.460
So this is also r.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.980
So now we can use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.590
r squared plus r squared
is equal to k squared.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.210
Or 2r squared is equal
to k squared.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.600
They wanted radius in
terms of k, right.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.580
So you get r squared is equal
to k squared over 2.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.870
Take the square root of both
sides. r is equal to k over

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.340
the square root of 2.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.575
Do they want us to
rational-- nope,

00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:52.280
that's one of the choices.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.773
Sometimes they want you
to get the square

00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:54.890
root of 2 in the numerator.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.750
At least when I used to take
Algebra, they used to harp on

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.410
that little bit.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.140
But anyway, this is choice B.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:12.120
Next question, problem 230.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.500
In an electric circuit, two
resistors with the resistances

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.700
x and y are connected
in parallel.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.490
This is reminding me of
the Physics videos.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.760
So they're connected
in parallel.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.060
And this resistance is
x and resistance y.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.270
In this case, if r is the
combined resistance of these

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.140
two resistors, then the
reciprocal of r is equal to

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.900
the sum of the reciprocals
of x and y, and that's

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.420
what they teach you.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.080
So if you want to know the
combined resistance of this,

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.640
and let's say that's r, they
say 1 over the combined

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.700
resistance is equal
to 1/x x plus 1/y.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.220
And if you took basic circuits,
this is one of the

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.290
fundamental things about
parallel resistances.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:00.970
And then they want to know what
is r in terms of x and y?

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.370
So let's see if we
can solve for r.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.040
So 1/r will be equal to--
let's get a common

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.550
denominator, xy.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.190
1/x x is y/xy.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.380
1/y is x/xy, right?

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.110
And then we can take the
reciprocal of both sides.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:24.970
So then r/1, or r, is equal
to xy over x plus y.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.200
I just switched those
two around.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.100
And that is -- xy over x plus
y-- that is choice D.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.360
Problem 231.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.730
Let me do it in this
brown color.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.830
231.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:47.370
Xavier, Yvonne and Zelda, who
happen to go by X, Y and Z, at

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.530
least in my world, each try

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.750
independently to solve a problem.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.880
If their individual
probabilities for success are

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:02.070
1/4, 1/2, and 5/8, respectively,
what is the

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:09.290
probability that Xavier and
Yvonne but not Zelda will

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.720
solve the problem?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.100
So Xavier and Yvonne,
but not Zelda.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.920
So that's the case we're
looking for.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.030
So we're looking
for that case.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.020
So there's a 1/4 probability
that Xavier solves it, and

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.750
then there's a 1/2 probability
that Yvonne does, but the

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.560
probability that both of them
do is 1/4 times 1/2.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.630
That's the problem that
they both solve it.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.130
And then we want that case
and-- not or-- and

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.560
Zelda can't solve it.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.390
So what's the probability that
Zelda doesn't solve it?

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.830
5/8 is the probability that she
does solve it, so what's 1

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.430
minus this?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.770
So there's a 3/8 probability
that Zelda does not solve the

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.670
problem, right?

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.780
And what does this
come out to?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.590
This is equal to 3 over--
4 times 2 is 8.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:58.020
8 times 8 is 64, which
is choice E.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.250
And I'm out of time.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.430
I'll see you in the
next video. video.
