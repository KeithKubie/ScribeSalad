bravery you know because one of the
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.529
bravery you know because one of the
things that we've learned as clinicians

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
things that we've learned as clinicians
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.910
things that we've learned as clinicians
say is that when you help people

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
say is that when you help people
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.070
say is that when you help people
overcome anxiety it isn't that you make

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
overcome anxiety it isn't that you make
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019
overcome anxiety it isn't that you make
them less anxious necessarily although I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
them less anxious necessarily although I
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.580
them less anxious necessarily although I
think you could do that to some degree

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
think you could do that to some degree
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710
think you could do that to some degree
by having people confront some of the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
by having people confront some of the
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.659
by having people confront some of the
demons in their past but instead of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
demons in their past but instead of
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.400
demons in their past but instead of
making them less anxious you make them

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
making them less anxious you make them
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110
making them less anxious you make them
braver and that's not the same thing

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
braver and that's not the same thing
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.389
braver and that's not the same thing
right because there's lots of reason to

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
right because there's lots of reason to
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860
right because there's lots of reason to
be anxious the world's full of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
be anxious the world's full of
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229
be anxious the world's full of
uncertainty and fear and reasons for

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
uncertainty and fear and reasons for
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.600
uncertainty and fear and reasons for
fear and reasons for pain but to be

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
fear and reasons for pain but to be
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.040
fear and reasons for pain but to be
braver means to confront those

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
braver means to confront those
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720
braver means to confront those
voluntarily and that's really a good

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
voluntarily and that's really a good
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.360
voluntarily and that's really a good
thing when will the next Bible lecture

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
thing when will the next Bible lecture
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.819
thing when will the next Bible lecture

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
occur October 24th will be three of them
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.560
occur October 24th will be three of them
before the end of December and I want to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
before the end of December and I want to
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.119
before the end of December and I want to
keep them going into the future they

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
keep them going into the future they
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799
keep them going into the future they
they've been quite successful I would

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
they've been quite successful I would
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.590
they've been quite successful I would
say and I would like to go through the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
say and I would like to go through the
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450
say and I would like to go through the
whole book although that would probably

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
whole book although that would probably
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340
whole book although that would probably
take me the rest of my life but I do

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
take me the rest of my life but I do
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.440
take me the rest of my life but I do
really think it's necessary because it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
really think it's necessary because it
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.340
really think it's necessary because it
is the case that the specific narratives

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
is the case that the specific narratives
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.170
is the case that the specific narratives
and the meta-narrative that are that are

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
and the meta-narrative that are that are
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149
and the meta-narrative that are that are
embedded in the biblical stories and its

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
embedded in the biblical stories and its
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.280
embedded in the biblical stories and its
surrounding literature are at the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
surrounding literature are at the
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.820
surrounding literature are at the
fundament of Western culture and we need

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
fundament of Western culture and we need
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620
fundament of Western culture and we need
to reconnect with that in order to make

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
to reconnect with that in order to make
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.510
to reconnect with that in order to make
sure that that our culture stays strong

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
sure that that our culture stays strong
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.890
sure that that our culture stays strong
and I don't think it's particularly

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
and I don't think it's particularly
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.749
and I don't think it's particularly
strong right now and that's a very bad

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
strong right now and that's a very bad
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.359
strong right now and that's a very bad
that's a very bad thing for everyone it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
that's a very bad thing for everyone it
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.890
that's a very bad thing for everyone it
leads to nihilism and despair and and in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
leads to nihilism and despair and and in
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870
leads to nihilism and despair and and in
an ability to plan for a meaningful

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
an ability to plan for a meaningful
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480
an ability to plan for a meaningful
future and cynicism and all of those

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
future and cynicism and all of those
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.950
future and cynicism and all of those
things and that's especially bad for

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
things and that's especially bad for
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140
things and that's especially bad for
young people because when you're young

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
young people because when you're young
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.539
young people because when you're young
and your life is ahead of you it's the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
and your life is ahead of you it's the
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.270
and your life is ahead of you it's the
last the last time that you need to be

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280
last the last time that you need to be
 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.620
last the last time that you need to be
nihilistic and cynical it's definitely

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
nihilistic and cynical it's definitely
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.189
nihilistic and cynical it's definitely
not good so
