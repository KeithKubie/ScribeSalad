&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Hello everybody.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.450 position:56%
We can be a little louder than that.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.750
I think it's almost noon right?

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.990
[laughter] Hello everybody.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.290
[applause] My name is Audie Cornish

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.510
and I host NPR's "All
Things Considered."

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.530
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.210
And I am a sometime panelist
on NPR's Pop Culture Podcast,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.210
"Pop Culture Happy Hour"
and, like you, a book lover.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.700
NPR is a media partner this year
with the National Book Festival.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.280
We want to thank the co-chairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.630
and the many National Book
Festival partners like the ARP.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.250
Thank you so much.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.840
Now today we're going
to have a conversation

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.880
with two amazing writers.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.050
It's not my idea to put
them in the same room.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.820
So, whoever's idea it was,
let's say thank you to them.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.720
Winston Groom, author of the
forthcoming novel, "El Paso."

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.130
Winston Groom.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.200
Winston Groom was DC
born and Alabama raised

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.860
and he's mined history for
much of his writing career,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.470
from his first novel, set
during the Vietnam War,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.630
to his non-fiction works like,
"Shrouds of Glory," about one

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.540
of the final campaigns
of the Confederate Army,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.090
and of course you might have
heard of a little book called

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.740
"Forest Gump," popularized by
the motion picture that followed.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.760
It's a romp through
boomer generation history,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.550
told through the eyes of a
southern man with a knack for being

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.970
in the right place
at the right time.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.720
Now Winston Groom comes
to us today on the eve

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.930
of publishing his latest book,
"El Paso," and that book --

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960
you'll need this for the
rest of the conversation --

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.270
is set during the early
1900s during the great war,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.100
the Mexican Revolution,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.540
when an American railroad tycoon
finds his family kidnapped

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.020
and his Mexican cattle
business under siege

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.810
by a cut-throat revolutionary.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.860
That book is out in early October.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.660 position:56%
Winston Groom, welcome to the stage.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.870
[ Applause ]

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.850
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Thank
you very much.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.150
[inaudible]

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.450
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Yes.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.210
[ Applause ]

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.570
Our second author is
Colson Whitehead,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.810
who is a New Yorker,
born and raised.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.210
[applause] Colson Whitehead has
made his mark basically dancing in

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.230
and out of genres; a zombie
apocalypse in the novel "Zone One,"

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.930
corporate culture satire
in "Apex Hides the Hurt,"

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.710
and a myth-busting turn in
the novel "John Henry Days."

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.990
He joins our stage today
having just published

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.110
"The Underground Railroad."

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.900 position:56%
That's the story that imagines;
what if the network of former slaves

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.190
and abolitionists that helped
runaways leave the South had an

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.910
actual underground train?

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.300
The book is out everywhere [laughs]
including Oprah's Book Club.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.510
Colson Whitehead, welcome
to the stage.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.350
So, I have a little bit of
housecleaning before we start.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.260 position:56%
Number one; this is your opportunity
to turn your cellphones off

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.620
and think about the questions
you might have towards the end.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.650
We are going to have a Q and
A. So, to start I want to ask

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.770 position:56%
with something that I noticed in the
start of your book, Winston Groom,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.840
which is that you said, "This
is not a historical novel

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.030
in any conventional sense."

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.670 position:56%
[laughs] So, tell us -- define that.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.360
What, to you, does it
mean to do a historical --

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.430
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Well, I -- when I
think of a historical book I think

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.660
of like "Prince Valiant"
or something.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.070
[laughs] This is historical
characters

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.180
that I used to move my story along.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.840
It was a historical setting
that I wanted because of a story

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.570
that a friend of mine
told me about his father.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.430
My friend was a Morgan, [assumed
spelling] a New York Morgan,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.520
and not -- it was a different
family from JP, they were cousins.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.050
But they were quite wealthy

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.460
and in the late 1800s they owned
an enormous cattle ranch in Mexico,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.000
in the state of Chihuahua.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.880
The elder Mister Morgan, who
had been, I believe the Governor

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.880
of New York, used to take his
private railroad car down there

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.880
to inspect his quarter of a million
head of cows, or whatever it was.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.190
Unfortunately in 1916 the
American Revolutionary bandit,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.500
General Poncho Villa, had begun to
depredate these American holdings

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.100
down there and he in fact
-- my friend's story was --

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:45.050
he took the manager of the farm, of
the cattle ranch, and he strung him

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.720
up and he sabered him --
had him sabered to death --

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.020
he kidnapped two of his children.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.610
And so that story captivated me
to the extent that I've thought

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.890
about it for 20 years and I made
-- I wrote on it for 20 years,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.690
but I could never get it right
until about a year and a half ago.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.410
I threw everything aside and
fooled with it, but what I have

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.670
in the story is that
it is the grandchildren

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.020
of this wealthy railroad
baron -- he's not a Morgan,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.420
I changed his name -- but
to make it a short story,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.030
as you do in Hollywood -- if you
going to pitch a movie they say,

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.820
"Pitch it in the space that it
takes to take an elevator ride."

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.900
So, to make a long story short, it
took about 400 and something pages

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.820
and 300 and something of
them concern a manhunt

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.070
through the high Sierras to try to
get back these kidnapped children.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.690
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: And this manhunt
takes place in Northern Mexico

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.010
and throughout the book they
sprinkle real-life characters --

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.200
you sprinkle real-life characters;
John Reed and Ambrose Pearson

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.270
and names from the period.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.350
Colson Whitehead, I want
to ask you, with your book,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.940
"The Underground Railroad," it
kind of mimics a slave narrative

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.240
in that it's told from the point
of view of one particular slave

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.790
for much of the book and you
don't necessarily draw names

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.090
from the period.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.390
Am I correct about that?

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.800
It's a little bit of
an alternate universe.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.360
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yes,
I mean it starts off,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.550
hopefully in a realistic 1850,
and then, you know, the premise is

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.590
that the Underground Railroad
is an actual railroad.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.320
And so you're already departing
from reality, as far as I know,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.910
and it's not straight historical.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.280
And then each state our
protagonist goes through --

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.530
South Caroline, North Caroline --

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.000
is a different state of
American possibility,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.010
sort of like "Gulliver's Travels."

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.610
So, definitely the later chapters
don't stick to historical record

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:45.070
and for the most part aren't
inspired by real folks,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.820
although real events do inform what
happens to our protagonist, Cora.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.650
But I did want the first section
that takes place on the plantation

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:01.720
where Cora lives and works and
has many troubles to be realistic

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.330
and take place in a -- I guess
what most people would call

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.200
in a historical novel
-- imaginative space.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: And I just want
to make it clear; this does not feel

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.610
like science fiction
when you're reading it.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.420
I had -- I read, you know,
the first chapter of your book

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.750
and I just put it down for
five days because it was sort

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.570
of -- it was pretty intense.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.720
And I think when you go back into
these periods writers, I assume,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.000
in your research look for, I
guess totems or actual artifacts

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.460
from the period that
help inform your work.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.180
And for you, can you list some
of the things that you found

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.750
that helped you inform sort of
how you went about the story?

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.050
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Sure, yeah.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.660
I mean there are a
few general histories

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.070
of the Underground Railroad --

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.360
"Bound for Canaan" by
Fergus Bordewich came

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.660
out about eight years ago --

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.390
but my main source were the
actual slave narratives --

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.460
pre Civil War; Fredrick
Douglass, Harriot Jacobs,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.670 position:56%
sort of the famous ones, and then
in the 1930's; FDR being a nice guy,

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.970
trying to get people back

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.620
to work during the Great
Depression had the Works Progress

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.650
Administration and they sent out
writers to interview former slaves,

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.370
people who had been kids
or teenagers at the time

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.510
of the Civil War and then that
was like my biggest resource.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:26.810
I drew a lot of slang and
words, physical details

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:32.710
about how they lived, which really
made the work come alive for me.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.090
You know I'll know before a story
what kind of clothes they wore

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.950
or food they ate, you come across
a reference to an ash cake.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.340
It's like; what's an ash cake?

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.640
That sounds terrible.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.940
And then you read up on it.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.240
It's like; that's actually it's
worse than you really thought.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.560
[laughter] So, you
know, as I was going

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.100
through these oral narratives
I would just take out nouns

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.790
and adjectives, things that sounded
great, and then when it was time

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.030
to write I would have
this storehouse

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.790
of vocabulary to make it rich.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.220
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Winston Groom,
for you similarly; this is a period

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.220
of American history and a
region that people don't talk

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.700
so much about, these
border skirmishes

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:23.040
between Mexican revolutionaries and
American landholders, essentially.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.740
What kinds of materials
were available

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.380
that helped you understand
the period?

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.690
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Oh,
there's tons of it.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.500
It's not very much read.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.530
You know there's a
great big war going

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.650
on in Europe during
this period; 1916.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.370
That was the First World War.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.330
But the Americans had an army
down there of some sort --

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.890
not a huge army --
under General Pershing

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.080
and his assistant was a Lieutenant
George S Patton that made a name

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.090
for himself in World War II.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.490
And of course there's a
great deal on General Patton,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.190
a great deal on General Pershing.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.880
General Patton's diary
is terrific on that area.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.440
But I threw in some other
people just for the hell of it;

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.230
Ambrose Bierce who was a crusty
old guy who wrote something called

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.530
"The Devil's Dictionary."

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.830
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yeah it's --

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.160
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: And
he was down there

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.910
and nobody knows what
happened to him.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.160
There's many versions,
but I've got him --

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.780
I'll tell you what happened to him.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.080
[laughter] I made it up.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.380
That's good.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.680
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: But one thing is,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.160
when I was reading it
then I wasn't sure whether

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.930
to trust this character
that I was reading.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.260
I was like, "Did he
make this one up?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.580
Is this a real person?

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.290
How should I feel about this?"

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.270 position:56%
What's your view on kind of taking
poetic license with the [inaudible]?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.770
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: I got you
thinking about it didn't I?

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.070
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Yeah, you did.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.370
[laughter]

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.670
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: That's
the way to do it.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.970
I -- you know, once I get
these people in there --

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.590
there was the old cowboy actor,
Tom Mix, and he was just rumored

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.670
to have been there as a -- some
kind of guy with Ambrose Bierce.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.710
There's no factual proof of
it, but that's the good thing

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.030
about doing fiction and
I've done enough nonfiction

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.330
in the last 20 years.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.150
That's all I've written is history.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.090
It's fun to be able to
play with the characters,

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.480
so long as you don't get
them out of character,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.880
and I tried not to do that.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.250
I tried to -- for instance,
John Reed was down there

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:14.570
and he was a famous journalist who
became a communist and was exiled

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.590
from this country and went over
to cover the Russian Revolution

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.640
and he died there and
is buried there

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.220
with all the famous communists.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.930
But he was down there
covering that revolution.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.620
So, I sort of put them all
in a pot and mixed them up

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.400
and see how they came out.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.230
Sometimes it's like a cement mixer

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.560
and sometimes it's
like a smoothie mixer.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.170
[laughter] It's all good stuff.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: I sort of have
the opposite problem with your book,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.800 position:56%
where I thought; oh this is going --

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.220
I thought this was
going to deviate more

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.760 position:56%
from the history than it really did.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.480
In fact, it felt actually
super grounded in the history.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.310
And I just had a question;

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.470
when you're writing you
are world building, right?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.360
But when you're writing history,
that world is built already.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.880
So, how do you decide like;
okay, what's going to exist

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.600
and what's not going
to exist in this world?

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.990
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead:
Well, I had a few ruled,

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:06.190
I mean before the book takes
off into alternative histories.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.880
I want to have that first section
be as realistic as possible.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.440
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: And this
is life on the plantation?

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yeah, and so it
is very brutal, as you were saying,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.470
because that's the way
the plantation system was.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.500
And the more research I did,
the more horrified I got

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:26.620
as I was reading it with an adult
perspective on the violence.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.200
Just to pay tribute to my
nameless ancestors who went

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.280
through the system, lived
and died in Louisiana

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.120
or Florida or Georgia, who knows.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.000
Most of my family history
doesn't go back before --

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.980
it wasn't traceable -- before 1900.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.670
I wanted to make it as
realistic as possible and then --

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.350
also for just everyone who
went through that, you know,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.830
terrible experience
before I started playing

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.220
with history, playing it straight.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:00.670
And I guess -- and then once
things are altered my rule was;

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.150
I'll stick to -- I won't
stick to the facts,

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.740
but I'll stick to the truth.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.050
And so as the conversation
about slavery and race

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.470
in America gets larger
and larger chapter

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:19.080
to chapter I was moving
historical events around in order

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.870
to get to a larger truth.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.710
And so, you know, we're
talking about --

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.050
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Like what
[inaudible] sometimes you've got

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.850
to lie a little bit
to tell the truth.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.300
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Sure, yeah --
and the ability to make things up.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.520
Historians, hopefully are playing
it straight, and then sometimes --

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.270
you know the fun of the
fiction writer is being able

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.570
to break the rules.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: It's interesting
to hear you say, "Get to the truth,"

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.720
because I think with both of
these periods that you've tackled;

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.770
the sort of last throws
of American West mythology

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.380
and the many ways the story
of slavery has been written

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.370
and then rewritten and interpreted
depending on who's writing it.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.260
Kind of what is the truth, right?

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.160
Like as you're deciding; how
much do you police yourself

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.000
for a modern lens, right?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.820
When you're looking back.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.200
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Well,
I think you --

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.820
it comes down to me
to believability.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.020
If you get people to believe
it then you've got a story.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.710 position:56%
For instance, when I wrote "Forest
Gump" I didn't know what I was doing

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.120
and I got to the point where I had
him playing football for Coach Paul

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.530
"Bear" Bryant at the University
of Alabama and I thought,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.190
"If they will believe that a
perfect idiot could play football

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.340
for 'Bear' Bryant [laughter]
they'll believe anything."

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.670
So, that was -- I said, "I gotcha.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.040
[laughter] I'll do what I want to."

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.820
But it's the same way with this,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.650
I just tried to keep the
characters in character.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.000
A lot of characters in my
story who are nobody --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.340
I mean they're not well known
or historical figures --

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.290
and those are the main
characters, which is, I think,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.690
why I differentiate what I did

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.760
and what is normally
called historical fiction.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.380
Most of the characters --

00:14:53.380 --> 00:15:00.960
development of the characters is
an ongoing thing between these --

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.660
mainly Arthur, the
son of the old man,

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.520
Shaughnessy the rich railroad
baron and his grandchildren,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.570
this is his kids that
have been kidnapped

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.060
and he's not ready for the trail.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.870
He's a guy from Boston who is a
butterfly collector and he has

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.800
to undergo a lot of tough stuff --
and we see it all along the way --

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.120
before he finally faces
down General Poncho Villa

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.670
to get his kids back,
and he outdraws him.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.770
And it's that kind of thing that
I think it just keeps a reader --

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.890
When I do this I know how to do
it because I've done it a lot

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:41.000
of novels before I was a historian,
or a historical writer anyway,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.330 position:56%
and you've just got to keep the
story moving and you keep the reader

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.350
on the edge to say something is
going to happen here pretty soon.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.970
And then after it happens they
go back to being comfortable.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.460
As soon as they get comfortable
I make it uncomfortable

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.430
for them again.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.730
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: [laughs]
And for you Colson Whitehead,

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.170 position:56%
I mean when you take apart something

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.010
to put it back together you
learn new things from it.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.180
And in trying to understand
this period what did you --

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.080
how did it change the way you
thought of the runaway story?

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.410
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead:
Well, I think, you know,

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.710
it definitely did in
the first section.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.720
I was trying to make a
psychologically rich sort

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.420
of plausible account of
plantation life, you know,

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:25.050
for me as someone writing in
2015, I was writing last year.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:30.440
I think we have an idea of the
100 person plantation from movies,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.130
you know, obviously there are --

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.620
you could be a slave in a single
brownstone in Baltimore working

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.720
for a family or one of two
slaves on a small farm.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:48.500
So, for me it was -- I had my
own different interpretation

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.810
of history before I started.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.930
Sometimes you want to get
infected with other people's take

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.230 position:56%
on the subject, sometimes you don't.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.530
I am --

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.830
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Although, when
you use the word infected I'm going

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.130 position:56%
to assume that you don't -- [laughs]

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.430
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead:
It sort of depends.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.510
This time it was like, "Oh, I
haven't read 'Beloved' in 25 years.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.720
I haven't read 'The
Known World' in 14 years.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.020
I'll go back."

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.280
And the story of "Beloved"
again I was just like --

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.340
after 30 pages it's
like, I'm screwed.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.460
You can't beat Toni Morrison
[laughter] obviously.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.310
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: It's confirmed.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.610
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Duh.

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:25.060
So, all I can do is hope that,
you know, I have something,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.080
I have a unique take that
I can add to our idea

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.560
of what slave literature is or,
you know, plantation depictions;

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.900
no matter what you write.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.550
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: But
what was that idea, right?

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.600
I mean, for me when I
read the book I thought

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.880
that you took us inside the minds
of images we are familiar with.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.780
For instance, the image of
a hanging before a crowd

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.080
and there are all those faces.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.390 position:56%
Right? The black bodies hanging,
white faces looking into the camera,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.550
and in one of these chapters
of the book you kind of take us

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.780
into a community that would
have held such an event.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.420
Were you trying to get
us to think of some point

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.870
of views maybe that
we don't normally?

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.170
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Well,
I mean I don't think I --

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.070
you know the depiction of
the lynching in the book,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.360
which happens once a week as a sort
of entertainment for this town,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.290
isn't historically accurate.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.240
They weren't weekly gatherings, but
the idea -- but the truth is real.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.960
They were, you know, planned
entertainment sometimes.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.310
You would have the whole
town, bring out the kids,

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:34.450
and watch your scapegoat black
male lynched, burned alive,

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.880
take pictures, pose for the
camera, you know, you would --

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.070
there are big collections
of lynching postcards.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.130
"I wish you were here," you know,
"had a nice time at this lynching."

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:50.720
And so I'm making it, you
know, into weekly events,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.690
but I'm not pushing it that far.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.760
Whenever I thought I was
being a little too brutal

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.690
on the page I would go back to
the research and realize that,

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:07.630
no actually I was sticking to,
you know, to a version of reality.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.020
You know I'm one person
writing a book for a year,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.600
slave masters were watching their
fathers coming up with, you know,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.920
all sorts of sadistic
things for decades

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.500
and decades to keep people in line.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.820
And I can't really compete with
all the stuff that they thought

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.920
up because it was their job to
come up with these sort of --

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.710
to keep the brutal system in place.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: You know, both of
you have done stints as journalists;

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.950
[laughs] Colson Whitehead as a
TV critic for the Village Voice.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.250
Is that correct?

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.550
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: That's true.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.850
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: And
Winston Groom you were

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.150
at the Washington Star Newspaper.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.450
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: I was
at the Washington Star.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.070
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: So, how does that
affect how you go about your work?

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.030
What is it about that
particular discipline

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.960
that you -- still sticks with you?

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.260
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: It opens a door.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.220
It doesn't open it all the way.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.700
And I know that when I decided

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.700
to leave the newspaper I did
probably the bravest thing

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.000
in my life.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.300
I went to the editor and
said, "I'm going to resign.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.790
I'm going to write a book"
and it was because I knew

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.450
that if I failed I
would be too embarrassed

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.010
to come back to the papers.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.310
I got [inaudible].

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.610
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: You wouldn't
be the first journalist

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.910
who had made such an attempt.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.210
[laughs]

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.510
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: But I
started trying to write it

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.030 position:56%
in Washington and, you know, we had
-- we couldn't even clean up a quote

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.300
and I was beginning to feel guilty.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.220
And Washington's a very
political town, but --

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.550
and I'm starting to write fiction.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.850
I said, I can't do it here.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.990
So, I went to New York where
there were fellow writers.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.600
But I think the newspaper business
certainly teaches you clarity

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.900
of thought.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.480
It teaches you clarity of language.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.970
It teaches you gravity.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:45.660 position:56%
But the finesse that you have to do
to translate that into a novel is --

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.060
it's a juggling act
and you learn it.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.100
I learned it, but it took a
while before it didn't sound

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.400
like newspaper copy.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.960
Suddenly it starts -- zing.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.610
And that's fun.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: I was amused about
the TV angle of your gig because,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.560
this book in particular,
feels episodic.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.020
The way it's structured each
chapter is in a specific state

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.140
as this runaway slave is
travelling along their path.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.640
And I wondered if [laughs]
sometimes you sort

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.800
of have an eye towards
narrative in that way.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.100
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead:
No, not so much.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.290
I mean, you know, when I was a TV
critic it was early 90s and I'm

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.930
like -- it was really
embarrassing to be a TV critic.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.650
Now people are recapping
[laughter] and it's like,

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.090
you really engaged the pop culture.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.610 position:56%
Me, it was like the only gig I could
get and no one else wanted to do it.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.180
[laughter] And when I
watch TV now I'm very glad

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.540
to be a passive spectator and not
to have sort of grand theories

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.370
about why things are working.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.670
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Yeah, it had a

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.970
"Twilight Zone" feel
[laughs] a little bit.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: I have a question.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.570
Can I ask a question?

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.870
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Yeah, please do.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.170
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Colson,
what -- how --

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.070
these fugitive slaves,
how were they received?

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.370
And how were they -- ?

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.670
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Sorry?

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.840
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: I say, the
fugitive slave involved --

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.940 position:56%
I mean, would they have a trade when
they got out of the slave states?

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.240
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Sure.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.540
No. I mean --

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.840
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Were
they received nicely or --

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: This is a question

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.440
about how the slave narratives
were published and received.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.530
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yeah, well
they were political tracts.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:13.060
So, the ones from the 1850s
they were printed to get people

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.130
to abhor the slave system.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.580
And so printed by white
abolitionists in Massachusetts

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.600
and New York and disseminated as
testimony about the brutal system

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.540
in the South and, you
know, there was --

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.790 position:56%
it became ammunition to end slavery.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:36.530
The ones collected in the 1930s,
apart from getting people back

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:41.370 position:56%
to work, you know, I imagine part
of the impulse was just to preserve.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.490
You know nobody was keeping
track of the slave experience,

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.280
you know, prior to this century.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.820 position:56%
People were dying off and so you
want to capture it before it's lost.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.410
And I'm particularly
[laughs] very glad.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.050
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: That answered it.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.390
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Now this is
the portion of our afternoon

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.730
where we're going to take
questions from the audience.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.470
We have two microphones in the
center aisles here and we'll sort

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.970
of ping pong back and
forth between the two.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.590
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Do we
ask ourselves questions?

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.890
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Let's see.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.190
There you go.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.490
&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.960
I was just wondering about the
cross cultural aspects of both

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.430
of your books in the sense
of covering Mexican events

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.510
from a different perspective.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.340
And also just, you know, the nature

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.850
of the Underground Railroad
was a story that's of interest,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.090
not just to African
American communities

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.270
or just told during
Black History Month,

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.230
but it's of interest
to a wider audience.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.990
How do you honor the integrity of
the cultures that you're writing

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.550
about and, you know,
talk about that,

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.800
but also broaden what you're
writing about to a wider audience.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.100
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Right.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.690 position:56%
Winston Groom, in your book you were
seeing many chapters from the point

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:01.040
of view of General Poncho Villa
and from some of the people

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.900
who are working with him as
revolutionaries, although they seem

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.700
to question their role over time.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.620
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Yeah, well
I mean I don't do points

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.920
of view by chapters.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.220
I did it by scenes.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.280
And so I've got a lot of
people doing a lot of things

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.320
and thinking a lot of
things at the same time.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.880
It's a literary device.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.280
I remember once I was
stuck on my first book.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.020
I had a scene; it was too
long, too many people talking.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.570
And I went to see a friend
of mine, James Jones,

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:37.260
who had written "From Here to
Eternity," and among other books,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.220
and he was working
on his final novel,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.800
he was to die in a year or so.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.330
But anyway, I said, "Yeah, I just
can't seem to get this right."

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:48.000
He said, "I tell you what, I just
had that problem this morning.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.640
Instead of having one character
think what the other character's

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.150
thinking about, have the other
character think what the other

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.030
character might be
thinking about him too."

00:24:55.030 --> 00:25:00.200 position:56%
So, you have two or three things
all going on at one time and I'll --

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.130
but it keeps the reader on their
toes and I mean everybody --

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.110
I give everybody a point
of view, just about.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:14.650
That can be confusing, but I think
it's useful as far as the follow

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.920 position:56%
of the story because you want that
story to punch forward all the time.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.370
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Colson Whitehead,
what kind of cross-cultural --

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.630
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yeah, I --
you know the young gentleman asked

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.750
about the cross-cultural stories.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.480
I guess I don't think about
my work in that sort of way,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.670 position:56%
in the same way I don't necessarily
think of this as a historical novel.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.970
It's just a novel.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.270
And so I'm not thinking
so much about audience

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.920
or what I'm transmitting to --

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.570
from my culture or onto
different audiences,

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.670
a white audience or whatever.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.880
You know I'm trying to figure
out something about the world

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.630
in each book, or something about
myself, and hopefully do it

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.140
in a way that's artistically
cohesive

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.470
that other people can
come along for the ride

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:02.020
and I always feel fortunate
when that works out.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.350
--

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.720
&gt;&gt; Hello there.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.130
Thank you for writing your books
and my question for both of you is;

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:15.890 position:56%
of the historical characters in your
books, do you have a favorite one?

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.950
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead:
Yeah, I don't have any --

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.400
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: The question,
just for everyone here;

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.400 position:56%
their favorite character,
historical character, in their book.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.320
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yeah, I mean
I don't have any characters based

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.480
directly on people.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.590
Cora, as our protagonist,
is, you know,

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.840
partially inspired
by Harriot Jacobs.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.440
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: She's a
woman who wrote a slave narrative

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.890
about leaving her house at age
-- you know, in her teenage years

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.230
and hid in an attic for seven
years before she got passage

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.650
out of North Carolina.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.920
And the female slaves -- you
know, the dilemma she described

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.800
in her narrative motivated me
to have a female protagonist.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:04.900 position:56%
When you're a female slave, when
you hit 14, puberty, you're supposed

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.020
to pump out kids -- more
kids means more slaves

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.430
and more slaves means more cotton
and more money and you become --

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.040
you're prey to your master's
desires, desires of other people

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:27.000
on the plantation, and it seemed
compelling material to explore.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.440
And so while Cora's not
based on Harriet Jacobs,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.800
definitely reading Harriet Jacobs'
narrative 30 years ago in college,

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.010
you know, sort of bubbled in the
back of my mind for many years

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:44.040
and was a partial inspiration
for the book.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.300
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: You have a lot to
choose from in terms of characters.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.600
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: I what?

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.900
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: In terms

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.200
of characters you have
a lot to choose from.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.500
Is there a historical figure

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.820
that became your favorite
as you were writing?

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:59.180
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Well, I
kind of like the contrast

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.940
between Ambrose Bierce, the
"Devil's Dictionary" guy,

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.980
and John Reed, who was a communist.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.870
And as they go along the trail
they're constantly arguing politics

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.960
and that's -- it's a sideshow
in a way, but it gets --

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.460
it still moves the story forward

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.760
because you're building
the characters.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.310
So, the reader, at the end, they
will say, "Well, I kind of know

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.330
that fellow and I liked him."

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.610
And what happened to him,
you don't want to know.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.000
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: [laughs] Yeah,
I have to say, towards the end

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.180
of the book various
people are dispatched

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.240
in increasingly creative ways.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.240
[laughter] I did not know how
many ways there were to die

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.420
in the West until I read this book.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.720
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: It's
very Shakespearean.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.020
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: [laughing]
Yes it is.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.320
It is.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.620
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: A lot of murders.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.920
A lot of blood that won't
wash off hands and so forth.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.220 position:56%
Yeah. [laughter] Audie Cornish: Mam.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.600
Winston Groom: Perfect
night for a murder.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My question is for Winston Groom.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:55.380
Knowing Birmingham, Alabama and
having visited there a long time,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:01.170
I'm wondering to what extent
growing up in Alabama and --

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:06.790
has influenced your writing and
also where you went to college.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:11.800
I loved hearing about
everything that happened after it,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.730
but I think those two
factors often underlie some

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.320
of the writing that I've read.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.620
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: When
it comes to education

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.280
in Alabama isn't there
really only one answer?

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.580
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Roll tide.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.880
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Are you
allowed to give any other answer?

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.400
[laughter]

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.810
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Well,
I'd say I went

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:31.920
to boys' military school growing up
and then I went to the University

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.160
of Alabama and I was lucky enough
-- I believe my sophomore year --

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.150
to have an instructor
called Hudson Strode,

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:47.810
who had taught my mother dramatics
and literature back in the 1920s.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:52.280
And he had a small class
that he had of writers.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.470
It was above the library with
big velvet drapes and a bust

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.750
of Liabee [phonetic spelling]
in the corner and a long table.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.960
And everybody sat around
in that old Socratic method

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.660
of criticizing everybody
else's work.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.020
And that was -- it was
useful to that extent and --

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.280
but when I was in college
I was the editor of --

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.630 position:56%
first the literary magazine and then
the real prize was a humor magazine,

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:18.720
and I thought I was very well
equipped to go up to New York

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.380
and become the editor of Esquire
at that point or something.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.980
And Doctor Strode -- I had to go
to Vietnam first with the Army.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.830
And I got out of that and
I went up to New York,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.900 position:56%
he had got me appointments, and they
were all very nice and every one

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.950
of them said the same thing, "but
you don't have any experience."

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.410
And I thought, "Well, I edited
my college literary magazine.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.710
Isn't that experience?"

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.410
No. So, finally one
fellow, Don Erickson --

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.200
who later became the
editor and chief

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.960 position:56%
of the New York Times Magazine -- I
asked him, "Well, what am I supposed

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.260
to do to get this experience?"

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.670
He said, "Why don't you
go work on a newspaper?"

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:54.970
And -- okay.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.270
I'd never even thought about that.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.090
I mean we had -- journalism
was not really a subject

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:03.990 position:56%
that was taught well at the
University of Alabama in those days.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:08.760
As a matter of fact, Joe
Namath majored in journalism.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.330
[laughter] And the funny thing
was, when he got off the plane

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.680
in Miami all the sports writers
said, "Well, Joe what did you major

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.030
in at Alabama, basket weaving?"

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.410
He said, "No, the same
thing you majored in."

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.170
[laughter] But in any case I was
lucky enough to get on at the Star.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.830
I spent 10 years there
and finally I said,

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.970
"If I don't get a break here I'm
going to wind up with a, you know,

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.280
mortgage and a car payment."

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.440
And I said, [dissenting noise]
"I'm going to give this a shot."

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.490
So, that's basically -- that's
the short history of my life.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.790
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: [laughs] Colson
Whitehead we should ask the same

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.090
with you.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.210
I think we learn a lot from
writers in terms of the early years

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.060
in which they form their identity.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.360
So, high school?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.660
College?

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.990
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yeah, well I
think in terms of writing I wanted

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:53.790
to become a writer from reading
Marvell Comics and Stephen King

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.500
and Arthur C Clarke,
"Twilight Zone" --

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.550
watching "Twilight Zone"
and "The Outer Limits,"

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.000
and wanting to make things up.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.240
And I think later on in college
-- I was a freshman at Harvard --

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.330
I started reading Garcia Marquez
and Bora Hays, [phonetic spelling]

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.680
and Beckett and was
introduced to a different way

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.210 position:56%
of using fantasy; fantastic effects.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:18.810
You know different way of dealing
with vampires and werewolves

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:23.550
than say, the blasted
landscape of "Waiting for Godot"

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.280 position:56%
but using fantasy in different ways.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.150
And I think definitely with
this book and some other books

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.790
of mine I've been, you know,

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:37.650
still drawing from all the fantasy
literature I read when I was,

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.280
you know, in fifth grade and
sixth grade and find inspiration

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.700
and find different ways of
deforming reality to get

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.510
at that larger truth we
were talking about earlier.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.810
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: We can
feel you trying your hand

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.310
at each genre like -- [laughs]

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.610
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Sure, yeah.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.910
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: It's zombie time.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.210
You know? [laughs]

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.510
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: No I mean --

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.810
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: I feel like --

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.110
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: You
keep writing, you know,

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.410
and I like poker --
I wrote a poker book.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.060
If you keep writing I guess you get
enough time to address things you

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.900
like [laughs] and interests you.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.200
So --

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.630
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: We
have a question.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.440
&gt;&gt; This question is
for Mister Whitehead.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:16.760
About your novel "The Intuitionist"
and I'm curious where the idea

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.310
for that novel came from
and particularly what was it

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.640
about the image of an elevator
that is so central to that novel?

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.900
Kind of what is the symbolism of
that and where did that come from?

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.200
-- --

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.500
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Sure, yeah.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.800
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Do you want
me to try and give the synopsis?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.100
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Oh no.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.400
Yeah. [laughter] I can do it.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.120
It's -- the question is about, with
"The Intuitionist," how it evolved.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.640
Well, I'd written a book two
years before and everyone hated it

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.350 position:56%
and it got, you know, 25 rejections.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.620
So, I figured I'll do
something different

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.500
and maybe do a book with a plot.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.800
People like that.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.450
People like plots in books.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.520
[laughter] And so I
was going to take off

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.530
from a detective novel structure
and came up with the idea of what

00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:00.080
if an elevator inspector --
someone who inspects elevators --

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:06.410
has to become a criminal inspector
and solve a criminal case?

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.050
So, I went to the library
to see what kind

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.640
of skills an elevator inspector
would bring to the criminal case,

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:17.270
and the answer was none because
they [laughter] inspect elevators.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:22.360
And so the crime in the book
became an elevator crime

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.980
and then I had to build a world.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:29.250
And so I figured if they
were -- it's an election --

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.220
taken off from the
detective story --

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.150
it's an election year
in the department.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.540
So, there's sort of
republicans and democrats

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.720
and that became the
intuitionists and empiricists --

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.600
progressives and conservatives.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.330
If there's a school where they
learn how to do it there has

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.780
to be some sort of
academic in fighting.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.630
And so there's sort of
this building of a world,

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.980
like what's their school like?

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.180
Who's the main theorist
behind intuitionism?

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:59.510
And each time I would solve a
problem I'd have to, you know --

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.750
I'd have more questions I'd have
to answer, but it was usually

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.970 position:56%
about building a world in a real
kind of science fiction kind of way.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. This is for Mister Whitehead,
although I love "Forest Gump."

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.920
I always will.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:20.150
I'm like Audie, I read the
book, the first chapter,

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:25.270
and put it down for multiple
days because it was so intense.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:29.270
And the way you build
Cora out and her --

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.630 position:56%
she's the main character throughout.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:32.930
What was your intention?

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:39.390
What do you want the reader
to leave with other than pain?

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.690
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead:
Well, I think there's more

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.260
than pain going on with Cora.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.960
How do you -- you know, I think
hopefully when you're reading

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.000
that first section you're
thinking, "How could this go on?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.800
How did this brutality -- ?"

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.820
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: How did the
country countenance such depravity?

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.150
And then you think of;
how did they survive?

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:10.920
And how could any human being
endure such horrors intact?

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.850
And then once you set that
up, what does it take to take

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.090
that first step off the
plantation to freedom?

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.920
Would I have been able to do that?

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.880
To find that power within
myself to run North?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.540
I mean, you'd like to
think that you're --

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.520
have that kind of strength,
but most people didn't.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.660
The system was so brutal
you couldn't try it.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:39.070
If you did try it you
got caught, lose a foot.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:45.080
So, what kind of character can
go through what Cora goes through

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.490
and has that courage to run North?

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:51.220
And I think it starts there and in

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:56.250 position:56%
that first section there are a few
moments where I say, "The human part

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.830
of her outpaces the
slave part of her."

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.260
And that human part of her is what
animates her journey northward

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:07.380
and then as we get to these
different situations her movement

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.570
to a different kind of freedom.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.820
So, I think that sort of
answers your question,

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.360
but gets at my intent with Cora.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.900
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: We could
ask a similar question of you

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.230
because I think one of
the things that happens

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.750 position:56%
in this particular story is that
you see the way General Poncho Villa

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.610
operates as he moves through
the North from town to town

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:31.700
in really brutal ways in the
pursuit of his revolution.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.640
And what did you want people
to take away from that?

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.220
Because in some ways it definitely
undermines the hero aspect

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.400
of him, right?

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.370
&gt;&gt; Winston Groom: Well,
I don't think it --

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:43.790
what I have read about him,

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.630
and there's a great deal
that's been written about him,

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.730
and probably 40 or
60 percent is false.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.690
I mean, it's just totally
contradictory.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.700
There've been a couple of good
books about him and I listed them

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.660
in the -- somewhere in
the acknowledgements.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.460
But he was -- that whole
country was brutal then.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.100
It -- I mean it was a
horrible place to live.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.980
The Apaches and --
brutalized the people

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.970
and they had learned
from the Apaches.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.100
And Poncho Villa one
time -- and this was --

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.160
I presume it was a
true story -- he --

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.940
somebody bet him that he
couldn't shoot a man's eye out

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.000
and he shot the man's eye out
and then he felt sorry about it

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.750
so he gave his wife 100 pesos.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.540
That's brutality, but
they were rough times.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:29.660
And I mean he'd have you
skinned alive and so forth.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.290
General Fiaro, [phonetic
spelling] he was known

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.350
for some very bad deeds.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:38.270
They called him "the
butcher" and that wasn't just

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.270
on the Villa side either, it
was on the government's side.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:42.570
There was no quarter [inaudible].

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.770
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Question
over here.

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:51.190
&gt;&gt; Yes, my question is
for Colson Whitehead.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.510
I just wanted to say
I loved your book.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:58.170
I thought it was brilliantly
written, but I was kind of confused

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:03.270 position:56%
and really baffled by the ending and
I really didn't know what happened.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.490
I know you may not want
to give away the ending,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:11.510
but I was wondering what actually
happened to the slave hunter

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:16.290
and what ultimately happened to
Cora because I didn't quite get it.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.590
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Sure.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.890
Thanks for reading.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.190
It hasn't come up a lot.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.470 position:56%
I think most people have come to the
round reckoning with Cora's story.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:31.050
I will say this about Cora;
even if she gets to --

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:35.070
in an alternative story -- gets to
Massachusetts and wins a lottery

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.650
and wins three billion dollars,

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.980
she's still an African
American woman in 1850

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.250 position:56%
in America, which is a racist place.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:52.420
So, what is her best case scenario
when she lives in a racist country.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.140
So, you'll be able to get there.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.860
Maybe that can be -- work, I hope.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.160
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Yeah, but
it's an interesting question

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.400
because if you're talking about
brutal periods of history,

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.960
this is where you come up against
the rules of these worlds, right?

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.090
In terms of history there's
only so far you're going to get

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:12.390
in terms of these characters.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.690
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Yes.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:14.990
I mean --

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:16.290
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Necessarily
have a happily ever after.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:21.270
She'll have something, but it's
not a tied bow the way we would all

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.610
like I think.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.210
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank
you both for your work

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.890
because it is work and
it's very grueling.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:36.690
And my question -- it's a
statement and a question I guess.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:41.790
Your notions about the depictions
of history and the implications

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:48.780
of that are such that neither of
your books can be merely a book.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.160
They simply are not.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.910
And because of that depiction
of everyone I'm wondering

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.890
about the role, Mister Whitehead,
of resistance in your book

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.280
because the narrative is
that -- as you said --

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.670
people rolled over, basically.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.810
And that is not quite an
accurate interpretation

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.470
of the truth, if you will.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:17.590 position:56%
The truth is that there were over
400 rebellions on the Atlantic Ocean

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.460
and the Amistad wasn't
the only truth.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:26.160 position:56%
The truth is that there were a
million acts of resistance every day

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.470
because you don't have
to run away to resist

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.120
and your Cora did not
grow up in a vacuum.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:40.070
She was nurtured, and that energy
of taking that step was nurtured

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.060
and was affirmed so
that resistance --

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:51.400 position:56%
she resisted and that resistance was
rooted in community and in values

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.410
about "I don't think so."

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.710
So, in your -- I don't know --

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.010
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Well,
we can let him answer.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.310
Yeah.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.610
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:03.910
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: I agree.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:07.450
It's not -- it was a
statement that I agree with.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.750
So --

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.050
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Did you have
a question to add to this?

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.150
&gt;&gt; In your next work
are you going to talk

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:16.690
about resistance explicitly
and how that went on?

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.180
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Probably not.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.770 position:56%
Will I address that in my next book?

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.070
Probably not.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:23.920
I, you know, when I'm done
with a topic I like to move

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.710
on to the next one and the next
book takes place in a 1960s Harlem.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.850
It has a different sort
of striving in there.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.870
But you -- but I think
you're totally right

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:43.690
about our daily rebellions,
whether it's, you know,

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:47.990
in contemporary life; how do we
keep going and how do we stand

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.580
up to the forces that
raid against us?

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.210
Or 20 years ago; how do
we figure out systems

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:56.900 position:56%
that help us get it through the day?

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.440
And, you know, hopefully
in Cora's story

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:06.410
and in the supporting cast you
get different kinds of stepping up

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:10.370
and different ways of
overthrowing tyranny.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.000
Thank you.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.300
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.070
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: Unfortunately
that is our last question

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:16.370
because we're towards the end.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.260
I think it's a good question
to end on because it gets

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.890
at the idea of responsibility.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.120
Whenever you're tackling history
you embrace the responsibility

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.440
of interpreting that time.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.260
I want to thank everyone
for coming and I hope

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.890
that you'll consider donating

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.860
to the National Book
Festival via their App.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.420
There's also information
in your program.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.870
Colson Whitehead; author of
"The Underground Railroad."

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.170
Thank you.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colson Whitehead: Thank you guys.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.320
[applause]

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audie Cornish: And Winston
Groom; his book is called "El Paso."

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.530
Thank you.
