was a surprise the world of often abell

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
was a surprise the world of often abell
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.140
was a surprise the world of often abell
stated that the prices should be awarded

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
stated that the prices should be awarded
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.330
stated that the prices should be awarded
to those who have confer the greatest

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
to those who have confer the greatest
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760
to those who have confer the greatest
benefit of mankind so how does this

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
benefit of mankind so how does this
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100
benefit of mankind so how does this
price fulfill this criterion well I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
price fulfill this criterion well I
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.640
price fulfill this criterion well I
think these two discoveries are a really

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
think these two discoveries are a really
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.550
think these two discoveries are a really
good example of conferring the greatest

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
good example of conferring the greatest
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.370
good example of conferring the greatest
benefit to mankind because both of these

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
benefit to mankind because both of these
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.100
benefit to mankind because both of these
discoveries have led to therapies that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
discoveries have led to therapies that
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.480
discoveries have led to therapies that
are against parasites so camp a little

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
are against parasites so camp a little
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.020
are against parasites so camp a little
more their discoveries have led to drugs

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
more their discoveries have led to drugs
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.630
more their discoveries have led to drugs
that are used now to treat round worm

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
that are used now to treat round worm
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870
that are used now to treat round worm
infections and this is causing diseases

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
infections and this is causing diseases
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510
infections and this is causing diseases
like elephant tss and river blindness

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
like elephant tss and river blindness
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670
like elephant tss and river blindness
those two diseases are really

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
those two diseases are really
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.459
those two diseases are really
debilitating people have lifelong

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
debilitating people have lifelong
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.830
debilitating people have lifelong
suffering because of those diseases and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
suffering because of those diseases and
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.899
suffering because of those diseases and
this drug therapy now can reduce the the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
this drug therapy now can reduce the the
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.690
this drug therapy now can reduce the the
disease

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
disease
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.690
disease
you u2's discoveries have led to drugs

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
you u2's discoveries have led to drugs
 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.320
you u2's discoveries have led to drugs
against the malaria parasite and that is

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330
against the malaria parasite and that is
 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.630
against the malaria parasite and that is
also saved the lives of millions of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640
also saved the lives of millions of
 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.510
also saved the lives of millions of
individuals so within the idea of Nobel

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520
individuals so within the idea of Nobel
 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.120

I think we have examples here that have

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130
I think we have examples here that have
 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.740
I think we have examples here that have
conferred the greatest benefit to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750
conferred the greatest benefit to
 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.080
conferred the greatest benefit to
mankind you know these therapies they

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
mankind you know these therapies they
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.230
mankind you know these therapies they
save lives they prevent disability and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240
save lives they prevent disability and
 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.280
save lives they prevent disability and
they prevent the spread of infection and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
they prevent the spread of infection and
 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.670
they prevent the spread of infection and
they also improve the life well-being of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680
they also improve the life well-being of
 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.710
they also improve the life well-being of
individuals and economic growth so I

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720
individuals and economic growth so I
 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.810
individuals and economic growth so I
think this is a great example well Nobel

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820
think this is a great example well Nobel
 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.449
think this is a great example well Nobel
would have been happy and why we're

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459
would have been happy and why we're
 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.670
would have been happy and why we're
surprised amor de mal why do I this way

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
surprised amor de mal why do I this way
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.979
surprised amor de mal why do I this way
this year well you every single year we

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989
this year well you every single year we
 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.229
this year well you every single year we
start with a new plate and the committee

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239
start with a new plate and the committee
 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.580
start with a new plate and the committee
and the assembly have been working very

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
and the assembly have been working very
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.830
and the assembly have been working very
hard going through the nominations and

hard going through the nominations and
 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.740
hard going through the nominations and
we came to the conclusion that this was

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750
we came to the conclusion that this was
 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.590
we came to the conclusion that this was
the best you know constellation the best

here to talk about these laureates what

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730
here to talk about these laureates what
 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.120
here to talk about these laureates what
are the key breakthroughs that make

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130
are the key breakthroughs that make
 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.460
are the key breakthroughs that make
these laureates worthy of Nobel Prize I

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470
these laureates worthy of Nobel Prize I
 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.160
these laureates worthy of Nobel Prize I
mean who did what did what so you have

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
mean who did what did what so you have
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.340
mean who did what did what so you have
to think of it as two parts so Oh Maura

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350
to think of it as two parts so Oh Maura
 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.460
to think of it as two parts so Oh Maura
was working in Japan and he was really

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470
was working in Japan and he was really
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.810
was working in Japan and he was really
interested in identifying microbial and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820
interested in identifying microbial and
 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.539
interested in identifying microbial and
it might microbe antibiotics so he went

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549
it might microbe antibiotics so he went
 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.000
it might microbe antibiotics so he went
to soil and he had a hypothesis that he

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010
to soil and he had a hypothesis that he
 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.470
to soil and he had a hypothesis that he
would be able to collect soil samples

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480
would be able to collect soil samples
 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.840
would be able to collect soil samples
and they would have bacteria that would

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850
and they would have bacteria that would
 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.320
and they would have bacteria that would
ward off infection and so he collected

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330
ward off infection and so he collected
 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.240
ward off infection and so he collected
soil samples and cultured them in his

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250
soil samples and cultured them in his
 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.390
soil samples and cultured them in his
laboratory and he looked for samples

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400
laboratory and he looked for samples
 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.420
laboratory and he looked for samples
that had unusual properties and that he

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
that had unusual properties and that he
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.670
that had unusual properties and that he
then selected from thousands of cultures

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
then selected from thousands of cultures
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.490
then selected from thousands of cultures
about 50 of these samples that he said

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500
about 50 of these samples that he said
 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.110
about 50 of these samples that he said
on and Campbell could take these samples

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120
on and Campbell could take these samples
 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.400
on and Campbell could take these samples
and give them two animals two mice they

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410
and give them two animals two mice they
 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.130
and give them two animals two mice they
took life alized broths from these

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140
took life alized broths from these
 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.100
took life alized broths from these
samples mix them in the food of mice and

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110
samples mix them in the food of mice and
 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.560
samples mix them in the food of mice and
they could find that they had

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570
they could find that they had
 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.180
they could find that they had
anti-parasitic effects they could kill

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190
anti-parasitic effects they could kill
 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.729
anti-parasitic effects they could kill
parasites in mice Campbell also took

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739
parasites in mice Campbell also took
 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.240
parasites in mice Campbell also took
these compounds and he tested them in

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250
these compounds and he tested them in
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.460
these compounds and he tested them in
livestock in farm animals and cattle

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470
livestock in farm animals and cattle
 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.550
livestock in farm animals and cattle
poultry domestic animals dogs and he

extraction procedures and from that she
 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.029
extraction procedures and from that she
was able to identify an extract that was

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039
was able to identify an extract that was
 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.430

findings were presented sorta I think

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240
findings were presented sorta I think
 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.460
findings were presented sorta I think
that they know they were because they

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470
that they know they were because they
 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.740
that they know they were because they
were so efficacious so they were seen as

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750
were so efficacious so they were seen as
 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.010
were so efficacious so they were seen as
a breakthrough no um admittedly the work

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
a breakthrough no um admittedly the work
 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.580
a breakthrough no um admittedly the work
