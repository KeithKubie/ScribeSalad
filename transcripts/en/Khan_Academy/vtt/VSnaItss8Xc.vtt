00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.280
Problem number one.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.050
In the number 2,010, or 2,010,
the value represented by the

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.100
digit 1 is what fraction of
the value represented

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.060
by the digit 2?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.830
We have the number 2,010, or we
could rewrite this as 2,000

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.750
plus 0 hundreds plus
10 plus 0.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.700
And they're saying the value
represented by the digit 1--

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.690
well, the value represented by
the digit 1 is 10-- is what

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.130
fraction of the value
represented by the digit 2?

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.440
Well, the digit 2 represents
2,000.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.190
So the fraction is going to be
the 10 divided by what the 2

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.790
represents, 2,000.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.550
The 1 represents 10, the
2 represents 2,000.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.210
You can cancel out a 0 right
there, we get 1 over 200,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.920
which is choice B.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.770
Problem two.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.000
If P is a positive integer,
which of the following must

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.050
also be a positive integer?

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.349
Let's see, choice A.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.760
1 minus P.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.860
Well, if P was 2, 2 is a
positive integer, then 1 minus

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.850
2 would be equal to minus 1.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.180
This is not a positive
integer.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.315
This is a negative integer.

00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:18.200
So it can't be A.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.250
1 over P.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.712
Well, once again, I'm just
picking 2 at random, a

00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:23.060
positive integer.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.730
If P is 2, then 1 over 2 is not
a positive integer, so it

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.250
can't be B.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.550
Let me cross that out.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.980
Cross that out right there.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.830
Well, I'm going to keep running
with my number 2.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.300
If it doesn't work for number
2, it's definitely not going

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.380
to work for any positive
integer.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.010
So if P is 2, right here, then
the square root of 2, once

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.420
again, not a positive integer.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.100
And then finally P squared.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.250
Well, for 2, if I say P is equal
to 2, then P squared is

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.300
equal to 4.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.660
And in general, if I take any
positive integer and I square

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.630
it, if I multiply it by itself,
I'm just going to get

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.200
another-- it's definitely going
to be positive, it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.180
definitely going to
be an integer.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.910
So my choice is D.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.389
Next problem.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.095
Problem three.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:15.610
Let me switch colors,
just for fun.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.860
According to an article in a
financial journal, a certain

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.600
company earned 3.85-- now
why isn't it writing?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.340
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]--

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.450
earned $3.85 million
last year.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.120
Based on this report of the
company's yearly earnings, a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.390
person reading the article
estimates that the company

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.240
earned an average of
approximately $30,000 a month,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.520
and they're saying estimates.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.740
So we don't have to
do the exact math.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.970
Which of the following
statements best describes the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.900
reasonableness of this estimate
for the company's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.770
average monthly earnings?

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.380
So $3.85 million last year, and
then we want to be able to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.675
estimate how many monthly
earnings.

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:07.830
So we want to divide 3.85
million by 12 months.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.490
That's 3.85 million a
year, and we want to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.820
divide it by 12.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.725
We could do the exact number,
but we could say,

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:14.260
hey, you know what?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.030
This is pretty close
to 3.6 million.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.380
The reason why I'm picking
3.6 million is because

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.960
36 is 3 times 12.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.040
So if we do 3.6 million, we
could say that this is

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.340
approximately 3.6 million
divided by 12,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.620
which is equal to what?

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.300
If this was 36 million
divided by 12, we

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.360
would have 3 million.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.990
But it's not 36 million
divided by 12,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.430
it's 1/10 of that.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.620
It's 3.6 million
divided by 12.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.000
So it would be 0.3-- and you
could put a 0 out front-- 0.3

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.510
million per month.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.060
Or another way to write 0.3
million is 300,000 per month.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.530
Now, someone estimated that they
made $30,000 per month.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.290
So they were off, they were
too low by a factor of 10.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.310
You would have to divide by
this, the actual estimate, the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.519
correct estimate, by 10
to get their estimate.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.640
So their estimate is too
low by a factor of 10.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.220
That is choice B.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.180
Another way you could have
thought about this is instead

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.060
of writing 3.85 million, you
could have written that as

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.470
3,850K divided by 12.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.770
Or, you could have said, well
that's approximately 3,600K

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.550
divided by 12, and then
you would have

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.870
said, OK, that's 300,000.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.295
You would have gotten the same
answer, which is 10 times more

00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:46.220
than their estimate.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.750
Or their estimate was too
low by a factor of 10.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.900
Problem four.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.160
The mean distance from the
earth to the sun is

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.990
approximately 93 million
miles, or one

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.970
astronomical unit.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.820
The mean distance from Neptune
to the sun is approximately

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.790
2.794 times 10 to
the ninth miles.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.210
What is the approximate mean
distance from Neptune to the

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.080
sun in astronomical units?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.410
So essentially we want to divide
the average distance of

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:26.450
Neptune-- 2.794 times 10 to the
ninth miles-- divided by 1

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.750
astronomical unit, which
is 93 million.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.620
When you write it like this,
it's kind of hard to digest,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.740
or see what's going on.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.300
But what we can do is write
this guy, right here, in

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.960
scientific notation as well.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.890
So 93 million looks like that.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.330
We could say that this is 9.3
times 10 to the one, two,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.660
three, four, five, six,
seventh power.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.430
So now this thing, up here,
simplifies to 2.794 times 10

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:15.180
to the ninth over 9.3 times
10 to the seventh.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.980
Now we could just divide this,
but the way my brain works, I

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.240
would like, instead of this
to be 2.7, I would

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.810
like this to be 27.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.350
And the reason why I would like
this to be 27 is because

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.760
we have a 9 down here.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.950
Then we could say, hey,
27 divided by 9 is

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.160
roughly equal to 3.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.000
So we can rewrite the
top part of this.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.060
We could rewrite this.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.500
If we multiply this part by 10,
we would have to divide

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.680
this part by 10 in order to
not change the number.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.720
We don't want to actually
change the value of the

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:49.650
number, so we get 27.94 times
10 to the eighth.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.610
All I did is I multiplied this
part by 10, and to offset

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.360
that, I divided this
part by 10.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.390
10 to the ninth divided by 10 is
10 to the eighth divided by

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.230
9.3 times 10 to the seventh.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.820
And now you could say, look,
27.94 divided by 9.3, that's

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.870
going to be approximately 3.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.890
Remember, we're trying to find
the approximate mean distance.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.300
We can estimate a little bit.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.710
And then 10 to the eighth
divided by ten to the

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.110
seventh-- you could just
subtract 7 from 8 of the

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.670
exponents, and so that's
times 10 to the one.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.950
10 to eighth divided by 10 to
the seventh is exactly 10

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.620
times 10 to the seventh.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.350
So our approximate answer
is going to be 3

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.600
times 10 to the one.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.120
Or 3 times 10.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.330
Or approximately equal to
30 astronomical units.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.960
And that is choice A.
