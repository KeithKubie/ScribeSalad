00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.390
It always drives me nuts when people say “that
cost an arm and a leg!” - like, do you even

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.000
know how much an arm and a leg cost?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.550
Didn’t think so.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.070
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for a very morbid
DNews.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.310
Running a little short on cash?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.670
Well, you’re probably vaguely aware that
there exists a black market for body parts.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.779
Combined with legal medical demand, these
forces essentially set the price of your body

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.779
parts.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.150
In theory, if you could harvest every organ
and chemical - your dead body could go for

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.079
up to $45M. But Medical Transcription estimates
that the average price of a dead body is worth

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.430
closer to $550,000, and it’s only a few
key body parts that drive up the price.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.699
The most expensive LEGAL part you can sell
is your heart - it goes for almost $1M legally.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.360
And they say you can’t buy love...too bad
you’ll be dead then.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.160
Your liver goes for $557,000 legally, and
kidneys go for $262,000 each in the US.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.000
The reason why these particular organs are
so expensive is because of widespread diabetes

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and heart disease.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.680
Of course, on the black market - they’re
much cheaper, sometimes 10% of the cost.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.940
As for the rest of your body parts, the price
pales in comparison.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.090
Your skin - a measly $10 an inch, your stomach
- 500 bucks.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.090
And your eyes?

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.230
Only $1500 each.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.820
I spend more on making my eyes see than they’re
actually worth!

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.150
This whole black market thing is a real downer….

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.890
….In more ways than one.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.840
The black market for body parts cropped up
in response to worldwide organ shortages.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.450
In the US alone, there are currently 123,000
people waiting for organs - 100,000 of those

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.090
people are waiting for kidneys!

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.220
Meanwhile, there are only about 14,000 organs
are donated per year, mostly from the deceased.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.170
Every day, about 18 people die waiting for
a transplant.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.790
That’s a big gap between supply and demand
- and so became the black market.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.180
The black market’s organ exchange is populated
by organs from multiple sources - some are

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.150
very poor living donors trying to make some
money.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.930
Some are from prisoners (dead and alive),
others from looted graves, and another source

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.440
is paying off morticians.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.330
The organ broker will pay the funeral home
to take the parts out of the body and then

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.189
sew it up so nobody knows.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.560
It’s pretty dark stuff.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.060
While there’s not much you can do about
crooked morticians, we can all help to undermine

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.739
these crazy unethical practices by becoming
organ donors.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.330
All it takes is putting yourself down as an
organ donor for when you die, which you can

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.409
do at organdonor.gov.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.349
Currently, a little under half of Americans
are registered as organ donors.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.989
Which is a shame because the organs save other
peoples’ lives after you’re gone, and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.150
they also help scientists find cures for diseases.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.250
Thanks for watching DNews everyone, we’ll
see you next time!
