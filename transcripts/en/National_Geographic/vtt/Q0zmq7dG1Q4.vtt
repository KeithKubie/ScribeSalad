00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.770
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.777
- Imagine you're out in Africa.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.444 line:0%
It's night-time,

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:16.048 line:0%
you're sleeping in the
back of an open vehicle,

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:19.485 line:0%
and it's so hot that
you have no clothes on

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:22.055
and you're still sweating.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.990
All you can hear is the
distant call of a hyena,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.660
and an impala snorting close by,

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.063
and you're half asleep

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:35.034 align:start size:84% position:16%
but then your car
just begins to wobble.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:36.869 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're not quite
sure what's going on,

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.170
you tilt your head up,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.405
and you look down
towards your feet,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start size:88% position:13%
and all you can make
out is your clothes bag,

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.976
sort of on the box next
to where your feet are,

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:47.847 align:start size:84% position:16%
and just all of a
sudden it disappears.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.281
So, quite startled,

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.583
and you sit up and grab a torch

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.884
and you shine out
into the darkness

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.987
and all you can see
is a young male lion

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.855
running off into the bush,

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.456
carrying all your clothes.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.760
(audience laughs)

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.562
I grew up in the bush,

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.298 align:start size:88% position:13%
and now as a wildlife
filmmaker I can continue

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:09.736
to spend most of my
time out in the wild.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.541
We choose not to have a camp.

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.343
We like to move with animals,

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:21.514
and it keeps us close
to where they are.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.748
We sleep where they are.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.416
It keeps us in touch
with what is going on,

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
and the filming
vehicles that we've got

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.687
are modified for filming.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.089
We like to be able
to see and smell

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.824
and hear everything around us.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.860 align:start size:94% position:6%
We wanna be as
unencumbered as possible,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.995
so we cut off the cab,
we take the doors off,

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:39.231
and fold the windscreen down,

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.668
and the vehicles are
just completely open.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:45.004 align:start size:88% position:13%
This little bag
incident that happened,

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.506 align:start size:88% position:13%
happened last year to
us while I was in Savute

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.375
filming Savage Kingdom,

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.079
and it was the young male
lion from the Marsh Pride

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
that thought it would be
quite funny to sneak in there,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:00.052
grab my clothes bag
and run off with it.

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:02.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was quite a busy night,
you know, as you do,

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:04.290
you jump into the drivers seat,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.092 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you start chasing
after the guy,

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:08.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
and of course you're
completely naked

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.930 align:start size:84% position:16%
because now all your
clothes are gone,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.533 align:start size:88% position:13%
and we chased him around
for about 20 minutes

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:18.304 align:start size:88% position:13%
before we managed to
get all my clothes back.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.273
I've actually,

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.109
I've still got my bag.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.012
I still take it to the bush.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:26.913
I still use it.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.380
Quite like this bag,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.152 align:start size:94% position:6%
despite the sort of
holes that he left in it.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:42.562
I come from a long line
of Botswana bush people.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:45.197
My Great Grandfather was
one of the first up there.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:48.868 align:start size:84% position:16%
He was knocking around
all over the place.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.336
He was a hunter.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.971
He got mauled by a
lion at one point

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:56.642 align:start position:0%
and involved in quite a few
other misadventures, I believe.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:59.945
My Grandfather who
is that man up there,

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:03.449 align:start size:94% position:6%
he followed my Great
Grandfather into Botswana,

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.153
and was given the Okavango
as a hunting concession,

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:10.189 align:start size:84% position:16%
to shoot crocodiles,
specifically.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.492 align:start size:97% position:3%
He was quite an intrepid
guy; a bit of an adventurer.

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:14.693
Spent a lot of time on his own,

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:16.228
and he used to take
little tin boats

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.697
and carve his way
into the Delta,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:22.902 align:start size:97% position:3%
and basically shoot as many
crocs as he could find.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.872
He would go up there
with groups of guys

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:28.307
that would do all the skinning,

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
and prepare the
skins and salt them,

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.845
and get them ready to be
taken back to South Africa

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.281
to be exported off to Europe.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.483
But, he lived a wild life

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.386
and really explored a
vast part of the Delta

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:43.790
in the mid-50s and early 60s.

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:47.292
He was responsible for killing

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:49.829
probably about 20 thousand crocs

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.564
during his time as a hunter,

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:57.002 align:start size:88% position:13%
before he himself was
killed by a Black Mamba.

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:58.137
On one of his hunting trips,

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.039
he got bitten and died.

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:04.209
And now of course,

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.981
it's completely safe to
swim in the Okavango,

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.383
which is not altogether true,

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:14.286
but what it did is gave away to

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:17.590 align:start size:81% position:19%
another generation
of bush people.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.093
My parents then moved
up into the Okavango.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:24.497
They took over one of
his old hunting camps

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.899
and kind of broke the
mold a little bit,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.969
and instead of hunting they
decided to build the first

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.172
photographic tourism
camp in the Delta,

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.907
and that was in 1967.

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.547
A few years later, my
sister and I were born,

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:46.118 align:start position:0%
and we were born literally into
the bush and into the wild.

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:49.889
The story goes that my
mother had me in Maun,

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:53.692
a small village quite close to,

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:56.128
well, at the base
of the Okavango,

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:58.431
and she figured that it
would be safer to take me

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.732
out into the bush than to
leave me in the village.

00:05:00.732 --> 00:05:03.936 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, at four days
old she picked me up

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.871
and did this long boat journey

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start size:84% position:16%
up to the camp where
we were living,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.744
and as she arrived at the lodge,

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.612
or at the campsite,

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:16.148 align:start size:94% position:6%
she was getting out of the
boat and on to the land

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:17.983 align:start size:97% position:3%
and she didn't want to pass
me on to somebody else.

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:20.986
This is her baby; protect it.

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:22.855
And, climbing out she slipped

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:26.024 align:start size:88% position:13%
and dropped me straight
into the river.

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:30.196
So I was baptized into the
Delta at a very young age.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:34.900
The life, the next
four or five years,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.835
we grew up,

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
my sister and I grew
up on this island

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:41.507
out in the middle of the Delta.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.744
My folks used to go into town
maybe once a month at most

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:47.613 align:start size:97% position:3%
to go and get a few
supplies, get a bit of fuel,

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:48.448
and they,

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:52.251
we lived a sort of rural life.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:54.587
We lived in small reed huts.

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:59.592
You know, we slept on the
floor under mosquito nets,

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:02.294 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you know, bath
time was in the river,

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:04.863
because there were
no crocs at the time,

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:07.767
and in a tin bath
next to the fire.

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:11.870 align:start position:0%
It was very sort of rudimentary
and a great existence.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.540
My folks used to go
out and catch fish,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.311
and try and subsist
to a large degree.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.678 align:start size:84% position:16%
My mother had a little
vegetable garden

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:22.348 align:start position:0%
that she used to be at
constant war with the wildlife.

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.116 align:start size:81% position:19%
You know, fight
off the porcupines

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:25.317
that were trying to
eat her tomatoes,

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:28.087 align:start size:84% position:16%
or whatever she
was trying to grow.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:29.422
But essentially,

00:06:31.623 --> 00:06:32.825
we sort of lived off the land.

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:36.328 align:start size:88% position:13%
My dad got a POT licence
that he used to have

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:38.197
that he could go and
shoot a few animals,

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.364 align:start size:81% position:19%
that he could then
feed his staff

00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:42.602
or have food in the camp with.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:46.105 align:start size:84% position:16%
But that really
wasn't my dad's style.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:48.874
He didn't really like the
hunting side of things,

00:06:48.874 --> 00:06:53.145
and instead he used to
take this little yellow

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:54.514
land rover that we had,

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.815
and we'd go out,

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:58.617 align:start size:84% position:16%
track the lions
and find the lions,

00:06:58.617 --> 00:07:01.520
and then we'd sit on them
and follow them for hours,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.556
and eventually they
would kill something.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:07.826
A buffalo, or an impala,
or a kudu or something,

00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:09.027 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then he'd use
that little land rover

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:11.296
and push all the
lions off the kill,

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:12.731
help out and cut the leg off,

00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:14.700
or a shoulder or
a piece of meat,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.201
and then he would
take that home,

00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:20.139
and that's really how we got
most of our food and our meat.

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:25.644
You could imagine as a little
toddler how exciting that was.

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:27.914
That was a grand adventure.

00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:31.116
Looking back at how I grew up,

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:32.885
to really sort of,

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:34.820
it looks a little
bit like the Mowgli

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.924 align:start size:81% position:19%
and the sort of
Jungle Book story.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:40.125
It was a wild life.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.761 align:start size:84% position:16%
We grew up surrounded
by predators.

00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:44.930
We had lions, hyenas, leopards,

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.699
always around us,

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.668 align:start size:94% position:6%
and a lot of other
animals that can kill you.

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:51.737
Elephants, hippos, crocs,

00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:56.508
and even snakes like the ones
that killed my Grandfather.

00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:59.512
Growing up wild like
that sort of gives you

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.547
a sense of vulnerability;

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.116
you're not top dog.

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:06.685 align:start size:88% position:13%
You're living in a
world full of predators,

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:09.588 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it makes you very
aware and very vigilant,

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:12.091
and you're always very focused

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:14.560
on what is going on around you

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.863
and very perceptive
towards the bush,

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:21.367
and I think that's where
my love for the wildlife

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:22.901
and my sort of passion,

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start size:97% position:3%
and my understanding of the
predator world really started,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.610
began, where it
all stemmed from.

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:34.480
Very soon after,

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.382
I left school.

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:39.184
I joined two great people,

00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:41.520
which most of you probably know.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.955
Dereck and Beverly Joubert,

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:45.858 align:start size:97% position:3%
they're explorers-in-residence
for National Geographic,

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:48.226
and they lived in the bush

00:08:48.226 --> 00:08:50.529 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they lived where
I wanted to be,

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:54.033 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I started an
apprenticeship with them.

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:58.771
Up until this point,

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:01.873 align:start size:97% position:3%
the bush and the wild animals
was really just my life.

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:05.644
It was normal, I was
very familiar with it.

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:08.314
I sort of just moved
through life, you know,

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:11.350
not really appreciating
the upbringing I'd had,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.720
and Dereck and Beverly kind
of shifted that direction

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.455
and made me,

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:19.157
they sort of contextualized
the value of my upbringing

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:20.526
and the sort of understanding

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:24.297 align:start size:97% position:3%
that I'd naturally accumulated
by being out there.

00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:28.900 align:start size:97% position:3%
They allowed me to look at
nature in a very different way

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.235
and in a much more
philosophical way

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:32.038
and really delve deeper into

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:36.509 align:start size:94% position:6%
appreciating these animals
in the natural world.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:39.245 align:start size:81% position:19%
I was working with
them for about

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.847
10, 12 years,

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:44.349 align:start size:84% position:16%
it was the end of that
time I met my wife,

00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:48.387
who was at the time having her
own sort of mid-life crisis.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:51.857
She was giving up her life
as a lawyer in the big city

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:56.728
and decided to move out into
the middle of the bush with me.

00:09:56.728 --> 00:09:59.898
So, the two of us we
had a new direction

00:09:59.898 --> 00:10:01.367
and a new purpose,

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:05.304 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we were determined
that we were going to live

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.738
and stay out in the bush,

00:10:06.738 --> 00:10:09.074
and as it happens,

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:11.143
not long after we did that

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.912
we had some children,

00:10:14.112 --> 00:10:17.183
and we weren't going
to let that stop us.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.453 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we moved everybody
out into the bush

00:10:21.453 --> 00:10:24.289
and we decided to
live out there.

00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:26.525
We both really believe that

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.396
it's a gift to grow up wild,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.465
grow up in the bush,

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:34.900
and we wanted to,

00:10:36.368 --> 00:10:38.270
we had an opportunity to
give that to our children.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.840
So, we're hell-bent
on staying out there.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.276
We could slowly teach
them about tracking,

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.444
about the signs of the wild.

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:48.013
We could teach them about

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:50.115
how the bigger animals,
the scarier animals,

00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:52.952 align:start size:81% position:19%
are often the more
gentle animals.

00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:55.454
We wanted them to grow up strong

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:58.724 align:start size:97% position:3%
and have this intrinsic
sense of nature and animals

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:00.859
sort of embed into them
at a very very young age.

00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:03.428 align:start size:94% position:6%
Let them develop their own
intrinsic understanding

00:11:03.428 --> 00:11:06.732 align:start size:84% position:16%
and compassion
towards the wildlife.

00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:07.733
And luckily,

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:12.471 align:start size:97% position:3%
those tin baths didn't evolve
much in 25 years though.

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:13.472
Very useful.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.975
It's amazing how

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:21.046
we so often follow the
path of our parents.

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:25.217 align:start position:0%
This picture was taken in 1979;
that's my sister and myself

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:28.086
getting a few lessons in life

00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:30.623 align:start size:88% position:13%
right out in the
middle of the Okavango,

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start size:94% position:6%
and this picture was taken
just over a year ago.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.127
Andy took the picture.

00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:38.430
We're out there with our family,

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.631
living the wild life.

00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:42.601
Being out there in the bush,

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:45.504
just in a totally
different location.
