00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.410
SAL KHAN: We're here at Stanford
Medical School with fourth year

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.812
medical student Morgan Theis
and Dr. Charles Prober.

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:09.520
MORGAN THEIS: OK, Dr.
Prober, what are we

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.020
going to talk about today?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.686
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
So Morgan, I thought

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:16.050
we'd talk about bacterial
meningitis in children.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.929
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.470
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
And what I'd like

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.200
to do, in reflecting
on bacterial meningitis

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.140
is go back to some lessons
that we learned in "The Prudent

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.420
Prescribing of
Antibiotics," a prior video.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.960
And one of the things
that was mentioned

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.670
as a general principle
in that particular video

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.100
was trying to understand
where the site of infection

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.380
is in a child, in order to
pick the right antibiotics

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.390
and the right management.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.780
So in this case,
because I'm referring

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.570
to bacterial meningitis,
a question might be,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.940
what would make you think that a
child has bacterial meningitis?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.620
That is, what are the
signs and symptoms

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.539
of bacterial meningitis?

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.970
MORGAN THEIS: So this is kind
of thinking about the site,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.344
knowing that
there's an infection

00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:10.730
in the cerebrospinal
fluid or fluid

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.800
around the brain
and spinal cord.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.544
You have to look for that in a
variety of ways, as a doctor.

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:16.710
DR. CHARLES PROBER: Exactly.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.610
And one of the things which
will make a physician suspicious

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.040
that there may be an infection
in the cerebrospinal fluid

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.290
or that is, in the
central nervous system

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.790
is, a child may not
be behaving normally.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.460
That is, they'll have an
altered state of consciousness.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.820
They'll be very, very sleepy.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.536
Or they'll be very irritable.

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:43.240
MORGAN THEIS: OK, so
I guess I would say,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.000
the signs here--
irritable children.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
And what was the
other one you said?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.958
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
And I mentioned

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.200
they might be very sleepy.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.440
Some people might use
the word lethargic,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.700
as an altered state
of consciousness.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.110
And at the extreme of that,
the child would be in a coma.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.470
But that would be more
advanced in the infection.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.460
And then, the child
would almost invariably

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.880
have a fever associated
with it, with this illness.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.740
And on examination, when the
physician examines the child,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.980
they may detect what are
called meningeal signs.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.390
And those meningeal signs
include a stiff neck,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.074
especially if the child is
over one or two years of age.

00:02:30.074 --> 00:02:31.490
MORGAN THEIS: And
how can you tell

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.961
if someone has a stiff neck?

00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:35.210
DR. CHARLES PROBER: So what's
the physician will often

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.950
do is hold the child
behind the head

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.160
and try to flex the head on
the next, try to flex the neck.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.340
And stiff would
be literally that.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.130
The child's neck
would not bend, when

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.174
the head is elevated
from the bed.

00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:50.090
MORGAN THEIS: Oh, wow.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.410
So it just stays really linear.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.880
You can't really curve it well.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.150
DR. CHARLES PROBER: Exactly.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.580
The other meningeal signs that
may be present in addition

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.620
to the stiff neck
are the child may

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.930
have some seizures,
abnormal movements.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.380
The child might also assume an
abnormal posture, stiffening

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.610
of the body, so not just
the next being stiff

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.130
but the rest of the body
being stiff as well.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.720
And on examination of
the neurologic system,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.530
the nervous system,
the child may

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.900
have what are referred
to as focal. signs.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.960
That is asymmetry between
the two sides of the body.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.790
MORGAN THEIS: Oh, and
what kind of things

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.440
would you see that
were asymmetrical?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.990
DR. CHARLES PROBER: It could
be that one side of the body

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.880
is weaker than the other.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.850
It could be that
one side of the body

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.870
has different reflexes than
the other side of the body.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.230
So these are all
signs and symptoms

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.520
that may be associated with
bacterial meningitis, that

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.240
would make the physician
suspicious of the diagnosis

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.102
of meningitis.

00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:53.840
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.140
So we talked about
some of the things

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.190
you look for as a doctor.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.320
Now, just going back
a minute, you said,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.726
we're talking about
bacterial meningitis.

00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:03.100
Does that assume that there
are other types of meningitis

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.790
that we're not addressing
in this lecture?

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.873
DR. CHARLES PROBER: That's
a very important point.

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.730
So I am focusing on
bacterial meningitis.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.440
There are other types
of organisms, that is,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.250
non-bacteria that
can cause meningitis.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.269
And the most prominent of those
other organisms are viruses.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.220
So you can have a viral
meningitis, sometimes referred

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.710
to as aseptic meningitis.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.190
And that, in fact,
is more common

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.990
than bacterial meningitis.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.440
So it's very
important to consider.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.120
There are also some parasites
that can cause meningitis.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.190
And there are some fungi
that can cause meningitis.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.070
The fungi and
parasites are uncommon

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.840
in the general
population, but they

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.260
may occur in patients who have
an abnormal immune system.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.210
Viral meningitis,
on the other hand,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.590
is really, as I
mentioned, quite common.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.660
But for today, I'm focusing
on bacterial meningitis.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.160
So you suspect that the
infection may be present,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.530
based upon those signs
and symptoms that we've

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.870
spoken about.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.050
And then to prove or
determine whether or not

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.570
meningitis is present,
cerebral spinal fluid

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.140
has to be examined.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.175
And cerebral spinal fluid, which
is typically abbreviated CSF.

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:30.170
MORGAN THEIS: CSF is
cerebrospinal fluid.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.120
We already got that but OK.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.955
Sorry.

00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:34.780
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
And that's obtained

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.810
by doing something called a
lumbar puncture, by putting

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.115
a needle in the back
to obtain fluid.

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:42.370
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.140
Is that also what
a spinal tap is?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.473
DR. CHARLES PROBER: And that's
also called a spinal tap,

00:05:46.473 --> 00:05:49.140
exactly, a Lumbar
puncture or a spinal tap.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.820
When that's obtained using a
needle into the lumber area,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.870
the fluid is then sent
to the laboratory, who

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.490
will examine the fluid
in different ways.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.890
One is to look
under the microscope

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.150
and determine if there are an
abnormal number of white blood

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.060
cells present.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.380
MORGAN THEIS: So abnormal
meaning high or low?

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.830
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
Meaning just high actually.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.450
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.991
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
The normal number

00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.220
of white blood cells
in the CSF is 0.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.742
So high is something
greater than 0.

00:06:19.742 --> 00:06:20.450
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.533
DR. CHARLES PROBER: And
with bacterial meningitis,

00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:26.210
it tends to be really quite
high, 1,000 or 2,000 or more

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.740
than that.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.077
With viral meningitis, it
may not be quite as high.

00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:31.660
MORGAN THEIS: And
that's per some unit

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.635
of volume of this fluid.

00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:35.256
DR. CHARLES PROBER: Exactly.

00:06:35.256 --> 00:06:38.360
A glucose concentration
is also measured

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.210
when the fluid is
sent to the lab.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.670
And with bacterial meningitis,
the glucose in the spinal fluid

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.100
tends to be low, less than 40.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.015
MORGAN THEIS: Now,
why would it be low?

00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:52.410
DR. CHARLES PROBER: It's low
because with meningitis, you

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.090
have an abnormal penetrability
or lack of penetrability

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.839
of the meninges, which are
the coverings of the brain,

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.380
reducing the amount
of glucose that's

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.340
transported into
the spinal fluid.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.110
And then, most
importantly, the fluid

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.600
is examined with
something called

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.410
a Gram stain, a
special kind of stain.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.600
It's Gram with a capital
G, named after Dr. Gram.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.000
And a Gram stain can
determine whether or not

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.754
there are bacteria present.

00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:24.740
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.135
So you're actually
staining the bacteria.

00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:27.301
DR. CHARLES PROBER: Exactly.

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:29.630
And if there are sufficient
bacteria present,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.600
the Gram stain will
reveal those bacteria.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.690
And so with
bacterial meningitis,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.810
the second prudent principle
is to know the usual pathogens.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.240
So if a spinal
fluid is obtained,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.840
there are lots of white
cells, the glucose is low.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.080
Even with a negative
Gram stain, one

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.440
can guess the usual
pathogens, because the list

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.880
is short in normal children.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.810
And those bacteria, the short
list includes a bacteria

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:05.860
called Haemophilus
influenzae, type B.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.510
MORGAN THEIS: Is
there an A on that?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.510
I mean, an E at the end?

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.720
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
There is an E on the end.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.590
A second bacteria is
the new pnuemococcus.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.030
MORGAN THEIS: Now, that's funny.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.680
It sounds like it
causes pneumonia.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.305
DR. CHARLES PROBER: And it does
indeed cause pneumonia as well.

00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:22.440
But it also causes
bacterial meningitis.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.470
And a third bacteria is
called meningicoccus.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.030
And those are the
prominent bacteria

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.880
in normal children with
bacterial meningitis.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.510
The reason though,
we're not seen

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.929
as much bacterial meningitis
in 2011 as we were seeing 10

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.450
and 20 years ago is,
we now have vaccination

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.105
against each of those
three different pathogens.

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:49.415
MORGAN THEIS: All of them?

00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:50.498
DR. CHARLES PROBER: We do.

00:08:50.498 --> 00:08:54.150
We vaccinate against
Haemophilus influenzae, type B,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.561
starting at two months of age.

00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:59.580
And by the time the child
is about a year and a half,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.640
they're completely
protected against

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.470
that particular bacteria.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.270
The pneumococcus, we
also vaccinate against.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.452
And it's very successful.

00:09:08.452 --> 00:09:11.310
The vaccine is very
successful at reducing

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.370
the frequency of
pneumococcal meningitis.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.740
It also starts at
two months of age.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.380
And meningicoccus, the
vaccine is relatively new

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.310
and is used in children
who are a bit older.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.950
They're over two years of age,
under special circumstances.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.570
So that means that
we still can see,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.720
and do see, cases of
meningicoccal meningitis,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.255
because it occurs in children
under two years of age.

00:09:36.255 --> 00:09:37.130
MORGAN THEIS: I see.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.530
DR. CHARLES PROBER: But those
are the usual pathogens.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.790
And when you go to other
parts of the world who

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.560
don't use vaccines,
those are the pathogens

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.910
that will be prominent in
causing bacterial meningitis.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.380
And knowing those pathogens,
we go to the third principle

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.470
of antibiotic prescribing, which
is knowing what antibiotics

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.310
typically kill those bacteria.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.030
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.974
So what should I call that
category, like matching?

00:10:01.974 --> 00:10:03.890
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
That's called the pathogen

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.120
sensitivity, knowing
what antibiotics

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.374
work against the likely bug,
so pathogen sensitivity.

00:10:09.374 --> 00:10:11.290
MORGAN THEIS: Pathogen
sensitivity, OK, great.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.695
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
Sensitivity to the antibiotics.

00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:16.120
MORGAN THEIS: And I think
you were mentioning in you

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.840
last lecture, that varies
by the location in the body

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.235
and the location in
the world that you're

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:24.110
using the antibiotic.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.350
Is that right?

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.660
DR. CHARLES PROBER:
It varies according

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.924
to the location in the world.

00:10:26.924 --> 00:10:28.340
MORGAN THEIS: But
not in the body.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.839
DR. CHARLES PROBER: Not in what
part of the body they're in.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.720
And fortunately,
for the treatment

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.100
of bacterial meningitis,
to cover all three

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.080
of the bacteria that are
on the list of pathogens,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.370
two antibiotics cover
all three of them.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.990
And I'll just mention
their names as I end this.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.735
One antibiotic is cefotaxime.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.955
And a reasonable facsimile
of cefotaxime is ceftriaxone.

00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:54.330
They're very
similar antibiotics.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.816
So we give one or the other
of those two antibiotics.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.720
And because some of
the new pneumococci

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.915
are resistant to so-called
beta lactam drugs, penicillin

00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:10.000
and cephalosporins,
vancomycin also

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.220
is used to initiate therapy for
suspected bacterial meningitis.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.970
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.840
So we use vancomycin
if we think you

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.810
have sort of
resistant bugs, bugs

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.840
that are resistant to the first
two antibiotics you mentioned.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.490
DR. CHARLES PROBER: Exactly.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.680
MORGAN THEIS: And there's
some kind of lab tests

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.470
you might be able to
do to find that out.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.636
DR. CHARLES PROBER: Exactly.

00:11:28.636 --> 00:11:31.590
So those are the principles
of antibiotic prescribing,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.280
in terms of the diagnosis
of bacterial meningitis--

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.110
knowing the site
of infection-- that

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.090
is, the spinal fluid--
knowing how to diagnose it,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.910
what the pathogens, and
what antibiotics wold work

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.272
against those pathogens
at that site of infection.

00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:45.980
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.020
And just my last
question is, just

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.540
because we've learned
a lot about how there

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.160
is a tight barrier
between the blood

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.440
and the cerebrospinal
fluid, are these antibiotics

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.350
that you've listed here-- are
those able to sort of penetrate

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.890
through that barrier and get
into the cerebrospinal fluid?

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.890
DR. CHARLES PROBER: An
extraordinarily important

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.820
question, which got to another
principle of antibiotics, which

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.100
is, you have to make sure
they can be delivered

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.610
to the suspected
site of infection.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.420
And for those
particular antibiotics,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.385
the answer is, yes.

00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:15.240
MORGAN THEIS: OK.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.180
Thank you so much.
