00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For our second class problem in the final exam, we're going to talk a little bit more

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
about chaos theory especially in relation to the Lorenz Butterfly.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have some system in a state defined by x, y, and z.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now the solution that we might get for this system depending on how we define

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
different parameters within the equations could look something like this.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm not very good at drawing in 3D but this should look something like the classic butterfly image

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that Jorn showed you in the unit.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Remember that our solution has two wings. One over here and one over here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Both spiraling outward.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We can plot how z, this coordinate, varies as a function of time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And when we do this, we see a series of peaks that ascend and then descend

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and then reascend and so on and so forth.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This set of peaks of increasing height corresponds to spiraling outward along one wing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And then as you jump down to a local minimum to stepping upward again over here

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
corresponding to the spiraling outward along this wing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What we want to know is if we can predict the progression

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of this local maxima along the z axis.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can make a plot of the current local maximum of z

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
versus the previous local maximum and then take each of these maxima and plot them down here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So here's a preview of what you should get as your solution to this problem.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Up here we can see how the peaks in z vary with time.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Clearly, these zigzags are a little bit more accurate than mine were.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And down here we see how the present local maximum depends on the previous local maximum.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You'll know that you've gotten the problem right if something like this appears.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now in order to plot each local maximum we do in fact need to know

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the exact z coordinate of that maximum.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
One issue that we have when using approximation methods, however,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is that sometimes our time steps are not going to line up exactly with the locations of the peaks.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So if you look at this visual for example at step-1 we have this value of z.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
At step, we have this value.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And after one more time step, we've passed over the peak and downwards again.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We plotted this on its own completely ignoring where the actual peak is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and shows instead it's substantially lower.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In order to approximate better where this actual peak is,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we can pretend that there is a parabola connecting these three different points.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The vertex of the parabola will be our estimate for where the true location of the peak is.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
To find out the t coordinate of the peak, you can just simply use the quadratic formula.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Just a couple of hints for you. You want only one z value to be equals the maximum.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So think about what that means in terms of our equations down here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Also, think about how you could use the essential difference formula

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
when you're discussing this local maxima.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Remember that one way to calculate a, b, and c is to plug in information

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
about the points that you know.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Then you'll have these coefficients and be able to find the proper value of z and t.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's take a look at the code for a second.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Now the first thing that we want you to do for this problem is to use Heun's method, which you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
remember from section 2.9, with a fixed step size and not a variable step size for the Lorenz system.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Remember that Heun's method depends on the forward Euler method

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
so we've included that for you right here.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So again just to be clear, use Heun's method with nonvariable step size to figure out how x, y, and z

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
are going to change with each time step.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Once you do this, you're going to use the parabola fitting method that I just discussed

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to figure out better where the local maxima are.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Once you've done that, you're going to enter your estimate at the local maximum value.

00:03:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This should be a fun look into chaos theory. Good luck.
