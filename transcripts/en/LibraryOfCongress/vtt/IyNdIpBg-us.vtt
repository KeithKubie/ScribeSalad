00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:22.630
[silence]

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.060
&gt;&gt; PAM JACKSON: Good afternoon.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.560
Welcome, I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.820
I'm the Director of the
Center for the Book.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.450
We're here at the Library of
Congress as part of the national

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.240
and international outreach unit.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.770
And we welcome you here to
this afternoon's book talk.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.810
We're very excited to share
our passion and interest

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.020
in promoting a culture
of reading and literacy.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.560
And today's book talk and
today's author and our partnership

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.790
with the research reading
room that we have

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.000
as a co-sponsor is
really exciting for us.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.300
So, thank you.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930
I'll start just with a little
bit about the Library of Congress

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.590
that we are the nation's
first cultural institution

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.100
and it's our mission to
provide a very rich, diverse

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.830
and enduring source of knowledge.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.910 position:56%
And we do so with a particular
purpose, which is to have the nation

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.450
and the world rely on our
collections and the objects

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.710
and the books and the music and the
movies and everything that we have

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.110
to stimulate and inspire
intellectual creativity

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.090
and productivity.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.690
And at the Center for the Book,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.750
which includes the Young
Readers Center and Poetry

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.280
and Literature Center, we are
focused on promoting books

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.950
and libraries, reading and
literacy, poetry and literature

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.860
for the purpose of engaging and
supporting an informed society.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.250
We like to talk about being
the defenders of democracy

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.690
because we know that without
literacy, democracies can't stand.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.210
And we like to do so
fulfilling on partnerships

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.770
with really exciting
people and exciting books

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.470
and exciting authors,
which we have today.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.130
So, as part of our mission, we
have affiliates around the country.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.450
There's a Center for the Book
in every state and the District

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.820
of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.120
And we also have a network
of partners promote reading

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.970
and literacy promotion, nonprofit
organizations around the region,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.030
who partner with us and
affiliate with us in a variety

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.870
of programs and initiatives.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.410
Finally, the Center for the Book is
the administrator for the Library

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.990 position:56%
of Congress literacy awards program,
where we offer prizes in excess

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.170
of $200,000 to organizations
to support

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.650
and empower their literacy
promotion work.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.430
And we do invite you today and
those watching us at the webcast,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.740
visit us at read.gov/literacyawards
to learn more about that program,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.700
because the applications
are circulating now

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.350
and that period closes
at the end of March.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.590
But, to focus on what
we're here for,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.020
I mentioned that folks
are watching online,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.390
so we are webcasting today's
event and we want to let you know

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.150
that if you're interacting in
the Q&amp;A portion of our talk

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.570
that you are being
recorded and let you know

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.500
that you become a part
of the webcast.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.980
We also invite you at this time
to just take a look and make sure

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.330
that your mobile devices are
turned on to silent or vibrating.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.630
And we also can remind
you that or let you know

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.720
that read.gov is the place where
you find more than 250 talks

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.850
and author experiences like this
one that we're having today.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.700
Finally, as one last housekeeping,
today's author is available

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.290
for book signing and the books are
available on sale outside the door,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.880
so please make sure you
take time to get your copy.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.210
This is a really remarkable
set of works and information

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.890
and presentation that I'm just
really moved and inspired by.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.360
So, thank you.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.750
Now, the chief criterion for
deciding about books and authors

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.030
for the Books &amp; Beyond series
that is hosted by the Center

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.180
for the Book is that we're
focused on books that are authored

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.510
about the Library of Congress,
published by the Library

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.150
of Congress, or sourced using the
Library of Congress collections.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.270
We care deeply that the
public know what kind

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.320
of collections we have available,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.170
what kind of rich resources
people can create as a result

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.880
of spending time in our
research and reading rooms.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.620
And we definitely have that
to share with you today.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.880
So, today's talk I mentioned is
co-sponsored and we have two,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.130
the Daniel A.P. Murray Association
here at the Library of Congress

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.690 position:56%
and also the Prints &amp; Photographs
Division of the Library of Congress,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.750
are our co-sponsors for
today's talk and here

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.430
to introduce the author is Beverly
Brannan and who's the curator

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.970
of photography in the Library's
Prints &amp; Photograph division.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.110
Now her work in photojournalism
began in 1974 when she was hired

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.190
to catalog the Look magazine photo
collection over five million items.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.720
She's co-curated Documenting
America and the overview

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.200
of the Farm Security
Administration collection.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.000
That includes more than 170,000
photographs documenting the Great

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.090
Depression and America's
entry into World War II.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.050
Beverly has written
about the FSA photographs

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.640
in both English and French.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.590
And in 1995, she co-curated
the Library exhibition,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.970
"Women Come to the Front:
Journalists, Photographers

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.410
and Broadcasters during
World War II."

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.440
So, Beverly, I just
like to acknowledge you

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.400
for your extraordinary, personal
scholarship and creation is here

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.500
at the Library and with your
works, and to acknowledge you

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.360
as a great partner to
the Center for the Book

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.670
and an extraordinary visionary
in the work that we do

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.240 position:56%
in serving the public and
promoting the Library's collections.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.540
So, if you would join us

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.270
to introduce this author,
I'd thank you very much.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.070
Thank you for being here.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:17.910
[applause]

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.220
&gt;&gt; BEVERLY BRANNAN: I feel honored.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.740
The Library's documentation
of racial issues

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.650
in the United States is so vast

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.510 position:56%
that a single book can only
suggest how extensive the record is.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.510
Dr. Speltz's book, "North of Dixie:

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.800
Civil Rights Photography Beyond
the South," presents a selection

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.260 position:56%
of graphic images dating from the
1930s to the 1970s, with a reference

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:52.850
to 2014 to indicate that this is an
ongoing situation in this country.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.920
This presentation acquaints a new
generation and reminds an older one

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.710
of this aspect of our past.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.810
Dr. Speltz's writings provide
context for the images.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.560
A New York Times blurb for the
cover of the book said that,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.530 position:56%
"Dr. Speltz's work is needed because
standard histories have focused

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.430
on racial segregation in the
South as though it did not exist

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.560
in other parts of the
United States."

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.870
Also, journalism at the
time failed to represent

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.530
that racism extended
throughout the country

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.850
and that this book brings
together some of the documentation

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.020
of the pervasiveness of
racism in the entire nation.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.050
Mark Speltz is an author and public
historian who researches and writes

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.080
about the civil rights
era photography,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.250
vernacular architecture, and
Wisconsin culture and history.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:57.130
He's worked as a senior historian
at American Girl in Madison,

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.360
Wisconsin for the past 17 years

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.120
and will be joining the Wells Fargo
Family and Business History Center

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.160
in San Francisco next month.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.680
This, his third book,
"North of Dixie:

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.100
Civil Rights Photographs Beyond
the South," was published

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.990
by the J. Paul Getty Museum in
Los Angeles in November 2016.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.300
His book credits some of the
images to the Library of Congress

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.180
for which we are very pleased.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.510
So, Dr. Speltz, please tell
us more about your book.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:38.440
[applause]

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.890
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: Hello everybody.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.450
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.720
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: Good afternoon.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.000
Thank you, Pam, for that
lovely introduction.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.270
Beverly, thank you so much for that
and for all the work that you do

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.850 position:56%
in helping the Prints &amp;
Photographs collection be a resource

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.250
for people like me.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.010
Thank you, Guy and
everybody on your team

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.170
for making this event part
of Black History Month.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.980
I'm really honored to be here
and it's so nice to see you

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.140
and the crowd and a
few familiar faces.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.950
Thank you for coming.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.180
I'm so excited to tell
you about North of Dixie.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:22.680
I worked on it for truly 10 years,
but in the last four or five,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.380
it's almost consumed my life.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.810
So, to be able to share something
with people is a wonderful feeling,

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.350 position:56%
but I'm not going to read it to you.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.050
I'm not going to show
you every photograph.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.190
I want you to pick it up and feel
its weight and let your eyes linger

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.310
over the photographs and take
in the meaning, read the quotes,

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.740
and I want you to think about civil
rights photography a little bit

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.480
different after today and
after reading the book.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.840
So, I'm going to share some of my
favorite photos, tell a few stories

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.430
about its development,
highlight, of course,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.300
the Library of Congress images
in the book and the connections

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.190
and my research experience here.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.480
And then we'll have plenty
of time for questions

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.920
and a signing afterwards
just outside at the door.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.150
So, I've been deeply
immersed in this world

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.140
of civil rights photography
for over a decade.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.920
And every conversation since then
began with, "Why did you think

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.080
about civil rights
in the North only?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.190
Or why just north of Dixie?"

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.840
And it all started with these
two photographs in 2007.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.590
I was a graduate student in
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.380
in a visual culture
and photography class.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.960
The assignment was, select
a photograph and read it.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.660
Try to interpret it as a source.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.070
Tell us what stories it holds.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.640
Who's in it?

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.500
What we can learn from it?

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.250
And I knew immediately
I wanted to look

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.810
at civil rights era photography.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.330
I've always been deeply moved
by it, by the compelling images

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.770
that I saw as a student growing up.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.750 position:56%
So, I went to the Wisconsin
Historical Society and began to look

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.780
at photographs from
Little Rock, Arkansas,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.220
Daisy Bates' personal collection.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.400 position:56%
Snapshots from Freedom Summer, 1964,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.820
Mississippi-never been
published before.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.850
Then I, also, of course,
saw photos like the one

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.100
on the left that are truly iconic.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.230
Jackson, Mississippi, a
Woolworth sit-in, 1963.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:32.050
This one is used in history books,
children's textbooks, documentaries

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.370
and it captures everything we know
about civil rights era photography.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:43.740 position:56%
It accentuates danger, violence,
what the nonviolent activists faced,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.420
a sense of intimidation,
but they raised awareness

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.310
and generated sympathy
for the movement,

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:54.240
so they played an important role
in the civil rights movement.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.210
The picture on the
right, I looked at,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.630
but I had no idea how
to interpret that.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.950
Sort of an urban scene,
interracial group marching through,

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.580
a police officer staring
straight into the camera's eye.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:14.610
Well, 2007 was the 40th anniversary
of when that photo was taken.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.980
It was taken on the second night
of 200 straight nights of marching

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.810
for open housing in Milwaukee.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.220
So, 200 straight nights would take
you through a Wisconsin winter.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.150
I'd call that dedication, but I
didn't know how to interpret that.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.700
I didn't know anything about the
movement outside of the south.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.810
Didn't know anything
about it in Milwaukee.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.290
I really had to begin
to learn about it

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.360
and that's how this project began.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.820
My advisor said, "People
have written extensively

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.430
about the one on the left.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.720
The one on the right, not
many people have looked at."

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.950
Think about that.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.540
These were the types of
photos I was familiar with.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.950
And when I say the words civil
rights movement, they're the types

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.200
of images that pop into your mind.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.990
Perhaps you've seen them yourself.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.300
They're used over and over again.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.310
They're downright famous and
iconic and they're important.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.080
There were important moments.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.730
They document important
speeches, confrontations.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:23.970
So, I knew I need to understand how
they came about, why they matter,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.930
who took them, and how
they've influenced how we think

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.120
of the civil rights movement today.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.010
The one on the bottom left
taken by Charles Moore

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.590
for Life magazine, I had seen that.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.390
What I didn't understand was
the context behind the photo,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.200
what it documented,
how it came to be.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.750
Dr. King and the SCLC were hoping

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.480
for photographs like
this in Birmingham.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.800
They wanted to confront
city leaders,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.420
city commissioner Bull
Connor to overreact,

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.210 position:56%
to create a dramatic scene like this
that could end up on the front page

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.640
of the newspaper, international
newspapers,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.660
and the nightly news,
and shock Americans.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.620
Call attention to what
was happening.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.890
Put pressure on Birmingham to
help begin desegregating the city.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.310
And it did help.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.890 position:56%
As I continue to learn about these
iconic photographs, I found very few

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.060
from the North and the West.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.050
And I knew that these images
only told a part of the story.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:35.270
The most iconic pics are usually
emphasizing southern violence,

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.670
the southern movement,
brutalized black bodies,

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.990
charismatic male leaders.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.320
They overlook and make invisible
the actions of ordinary Americans.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.060
So, I came to understand
what was being left out

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.900
and that there was a need for
a book like North of Dixie.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:58.910
North of Dixie is a small
effort to shift this perspective

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.340
to recast the visual narrative.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.390
It's a visual exploration of
the movement beyond the South,

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.710
the best known individuals,
and the most iconic locations.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.520
The goal of the book is to
make visible lesser-known

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:19.610 position:56%
but equally inspiring stories from
L.A. to Harlem, from coast to coast.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.240
The selection of a hundred
photographs from the late '30s

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.600
to the '70s capture the breadth
of the movement and the diversity

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.870
of issues that activists
challenged in their communities.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.510
So, everybody asks, "How did
you find all of the photographs?

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.810
And did you ...

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.870
How'd you select them?"

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.150
Well, I began by searching
for online galleries,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.030
working through the Library
of Congress' website,

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.270
going through every photograph book
I could find from the movement.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.800
Then I began reaching out to
photo archives, photographers,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.450
collections, and reading widely
about the movement in cities

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.920
like St. Louis, Chicago,
Philadelphia, and Seattle.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.920
I visited the Chicago
History Museum.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.620
Worked with curators
at the Schaumburg,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.010
at the New York Public
Library in Harlem.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.500
I went out to the Getty and looked

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.550
at the top left photographers
collection Charles Brittin.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.240
Charles Brittin was a CORE
photographer with the Congress

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.770
of Racial Equality in
LA among other things.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.750
As you can see, those
are context sheets

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.180
and you can see markings
in red grease pencils.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.110
It allowed me to get inside of a
photographer's collection rather

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.720
than seeing the three most popular
photographs that were published.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.680
So, I was able to understand
the ones he liked,

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.470
where he would maybe
crop something out.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.470
The papers, his personal papers,
allowed me to see the ephemera,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.890
the pamphlets, the booklets.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.940 position:56%
So, how CORE used his photography,
what newspapers published his works.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.970
So, it was more than
just an image or two.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.590
It was really understanding,
providing a lens

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.970
into how an activist photographer
within an organization worked.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:08.860
In the end, I collaborated with
photographers nationwide- some

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.050
who worked in the North and
the South like Bob Adelman,

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.160
who recently passed away.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.160
He sent thousands of
unpublished works from cities,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.650
about 15 different cities in
the North where he worked.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.100
So, I got to pick through those.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.880
And believe me, looking through
2,000 photos to find the seven

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.810
that I can use in a book
is really difficult work.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.400
It's heartbreaking actually.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.630
I was allowed to look through
Gordon Parks' unpublished works

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.060
with his foundation, the images
from Life magazine from his essays,

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.700
and selected two for the book.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.880
So, that was a true joy.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.840
In the end, we included 50
different photographers.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.570
Out of a hundred photographs,
50 different photographers.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.320
Not all art museum-quality work.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.470 position:56%
Some are photojournalists,
activists, archivists, and amateurs,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.030
and even police photographers.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:06.370
But, of course, my most favorite
research trip of all was to here,

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.630
the Prints and Photographs reading
room at the Library of Congress.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.370
I was lucky to spend two full days,
which is, of course, not enough,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.700
but two full days for a
researcher is a lot of time.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.550
It's an incredible resource.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:24.130
After scouring the website and
materials available from outside

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.940
of the building and working
with the archivist in advance

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.890
to make sure I was going to have
the most efficient research trip

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:36.300
possible, I came and I began
to hold those prints in my hand

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.710
and flip them over and read
the captions, find out whether

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.250
or not they were used,
who took them.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.450
Suddenly, I had access to
all of these lesser-known,

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.170 position:56%
rarely published, if at all, images.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.970
The images we haven't seen before.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.750
I spent hours in the U.S. News and
World Report magazine collection,

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.520
the New York World Tribune
and Sun newspaper morgue.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.560
I was stunned to hold these
contact sheets and pore over them,

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.070
looking for new stories, new
angles, different insights.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.730
I also located crucial
selections from the Library

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:18.140
of Congress' NAACP visual
materials collection.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.580
There are so many photographs
that were collected.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.650
And I don't know how they came
in, but there are snapshots

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.750
that people took and then
might've loaned to the NAACP.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.460
They were press photographs,
studio photographs.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.760
Some had captions.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.690
Some had nothing, but it's
an incredible collection.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.180 position:56%
I can remember cranking through them
on the microfilm and it was the end

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.930
of the day of that my
eyes were hurting so bad.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.360
You know and you press
one more photocopy

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.400
and you go home barely knowing
what you have and then the joy

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.520
to see those photographs
come in crystal clear.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.360
And I'll show a few
on another slide.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.690
But, this one is one that I
found from 1942 and it's one

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.800
of the earliest and the
strongest photographs in the book.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.520
You can see what the St. Louis
NAACP was concerned with-

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:12.650
stopping lynching, victory at home,
victory against racism at home,

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.000
victory for democracy abroad.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.530
And then the more famous
1936 photo on the right.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:26.320
You can tell that racial violence
nationwide was clearly an issue.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.170
These were among the
strongest photos in the book

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.940
and I couldn't imagine
North of Dixie without them.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.190
They exposed the routes
of the activism

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.440
and they're a treasure to have.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.260
My favorite collection, and this
was not planned at the Library

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.280
of Congress, was the
Look magazine collection.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.910
It's a true gem.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.950
How many people remember
paging through Look magazine?

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.250
All right.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:57.810
It's just like Life- large format,
glossy pages, color photography.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.090
There was strong coverage
of the northern movement,

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.260
perhaps most memorably of Selma.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.490
But, Look also covered
discrimination in the North.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.670
Once I found an article in
the magazine or in the index,

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.080 position:56%
I would set that aside and know that
there would be 15, 20 photographs

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.600
for each article that was never
used, sometimes even more.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:24.390
But, one of the best ones that I
came across filled an entire page

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.080
and a half in the magazine and
it was taken by Bob Adelman

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.150
in the Brooklyn neighborhood
of Bedford-Stuyvesant.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.250
And he said it captured
for him what it was

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.240
like to live in that neighborhood.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.690
The whole article was what the
different residents face whether it

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.190
was in the schools
or working nearby,

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:51.500
paying high-priced rent,
dilapidated housing.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.800
And the photographs was
one of his favorites.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.640
The funniest story he told me ...

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.260
I can still remember sitting in my
office talking to him on the phone

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.560
and he said, "You know that ...

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.880
That photograph was
stolen by the Russians

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.300
and it was printed in Pravda."

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.920
I was just kind of
write that down, like,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.400
another story that a
photographer will tell.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.000
Well, sure enough, I was able
to track it down in Pravda.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.730
Couldn't read anything on the page.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.430 position:56%
Couldn't tell you how I found it,
because it was word searching to get

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.840
to it, and I eventually found it.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.760
I sent that to him
and he was so pleased

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.500
to corroborate a story he's
been telling all these years.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.950
And you have to remember, this
is a point in American history

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.060
where we were very concerned.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.750 position:56%
We were wondering and worrying about
what the Russians thought of us.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.940
So, a picture like this
was in stark contrast

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.750
to what we were promoting is
being the strongest democracy

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.530
in the world.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:54.430
By now, you're probably wondering,
"Well, what are differences

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.740
between the photos in
the North and the South?"

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.160
And I'm embarrassed to say,
after four years of working

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.180
on this, there really isn't.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.030
I was not able to come up
with a really great definition

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.330
of how they different.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.980
And sadly, they're the
same kinds of photos.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.050
It's just how they were used.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.720
There was no shortage of dramatic
confrontations, racist actions

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.000
or inspiring moments,
speeches and marches.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.250
The northern media preferred to
downplay and bury local concerns.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.720
They cast them aside in favor

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.890
of covering heroic
nonviolent southern protests.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.920
But, when northern movements and
stories of local activism blew up

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.770
and deserved to be
on the front page,

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.020
they could no longer be ignored.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:46.530
Photo editors had that same
insatiable appetite to use violent,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.460
active, dramatic scenes
on the front page.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.910
Yet when they covered them or
wrote about them, there was never

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.810
that same moral clarity when
they were condemning the South.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.450
That sense of conviction
was not there.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.960
So, the photos and many

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.290
of the stories were
largely forgotten outside

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.320
of the cities in which
they happened.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.010
The southern stories fit
a comfortable storyline.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.640
They were easier to
frame, point a finger.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.930
It was always easier
to shift the blame.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.380
But, seeing northern photos of
endless marches and burning crosses

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.600 position:56%
or kids in Chicago waving
Confederate flags complicates how we

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.690
remember the civil rights movement.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.080
The North was not the
racially benevolent place

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.210
that our historical
imagination suggest.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:42.070
It was not the northern promise
land that most hoped it would be.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:49.320
Believe it's critically important

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.130
to bring these northern
stories into view.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.370
Dr. King often reminded people,

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:59.160
"America's racial issue was not a
sectional but a national problem."

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.630
Yet, northern activism is absent
in the way we characterize,

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.400
teach and remember the era.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.410
So, if we want to understand
the full story of one

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:13.170
of the most important social
movements of the 20th century,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.990
we can't just see half the story.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.750 position:56%
Racism and discrimination were often
more hidden and subtle in the North.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.550
There were not signs for separate
drinking fountains, buses.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.460
Photographers had to work hard to
make this discrimination visible.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.930
You had to march into a
white Chicago neighborhood

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.280
to call attention to the issue
like on the left, or you had to lay

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.050
down under a steam
shovel in Cleveland

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:46.570
to slow school constructions that
would further segregation there.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.820
People struggled against
pervasive forms of discrimination

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.570
like housing segregation,
redlining, racial steering,

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.080
neighborhood boundaries
protected by force.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.340
The top right photograph is from
the Look magazine collection.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:06.560
And this family spent every Sunday
touring the edges of Philadelphia

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.110
where they could find housing.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.460 position:56%
And this particular image shows them
looking at a house that they fell

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.800
in love with, but also
realizing that it was

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.130
in a whites-only section.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:23.560
The article was called "Jim Crow
Northern Style" and ran in 1956.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:33.390
One of the benefits of looking
beyond the most well-known stories

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.950
is we're better able to identify

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.210
and appreciate lesser-known
grassroots movements

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.110
that were conceived of, built by,

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.890
and waged locally by
ordinary Americans.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.310
We see a woman here kneeling on her
protest sign to block a dump truck

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.390
at a construction site in Brooklyn
that refuse to hire black workers.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:59.050
We see activism and agency.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.930
We see men and women
in San Francisco

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:06.790 position:56%
in 1955 picketing a cab company that
wouldn't hire a single black driver.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.030
This is one of those
photographs that I came

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.980
across in the NAACP collection.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.540
And the photocopy I made
was sort of rough-looking.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.360
I had no idea how clear
it would come through.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.650
When it did, it was just gorgeous.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.780
I mean, you could see the details
of the women holding the signs

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.480
with their white gloves on,
how well-dressed they are

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.160
and you couldn't see any of that.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.420
This photo's so strong
that it's been used in most

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.170
of the press accounts and it's
probably the strongest image

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.940
in the press pool.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:46.790
And I think it really stops
people in their tracks.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.940
With these photographs,
we see so much more

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.210
than brutalized black
bodies and violence.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.220
We see people making change, not
waiting for it to come to them.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:01.570
That agency is important and I
think young people today can see

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.460
that they weren't waiting
for Dr. King to come

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.430
to their city to lead the movement.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.980
They were there ready to lead.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.280
Average citizens refused to wait.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.590
They asked what they could
do to make America better.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:21.620
We also see images of proud and
determined youth and active,

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.580
engaged citizens in the North.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.800
Both of these images come
from the Library of Congress.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.860
The one on the left is from
1957 and went unpublished.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.310 position:56%
Blacks were engaged in local
politics, even working at the poles.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.560
This picture stands in stark
contrast to the scene in the South

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.050
where blacks were shut out
off the political process.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.120
The image on the right
depicts a successful sit-in

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.210
or as the typed caption
notes at the top,

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:52.190
"A sit-down in an Oklahoma
city drug store."

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.850
Most Americans are vaguely aware
of the southern sit-in movement

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.810
that started in Greensboro,
North Carolina in 1960.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.110
In fact, you see a section

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.950
of the lunch counter right
here in D.C. and the stools.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.780
But, few know about earlier
sit-ins such as 1942, Chicago,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.720
one's in Baltimore;
Wichita, Kansas, in 1958.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.520
In fact, the 1958 Wichita ones
are what inspired this group

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.820
in Oklahoma City.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:29.000 position:56%
Clara Luper was an NAACP leader
there who led kids as young as eight

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.940
up to 16 into the desegregation
over a period

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.970
of about four or five years there.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.740
They did about 20 different
places in Oklahoma City,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.860
yet very few people know that.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.470
So, the stories and the views and
so much more that are left out of

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.860
that traditional narrative
that we tell every February,

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.880
that we tell in grade school.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.680 position:56%
There are more reasons to celebrate,
more things to think about,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.800
harder questions to
ask, and it's important

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.780 position:56%
to re-examine what we think we know.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:07.390
A lot of the pictures
upend long held assumptions

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.090
about the movement
and turbulent era.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.900
Most popular accounts of the
movements suggest that the struggle

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.110
in the civil rights movement came
north only when Dr. King came

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.560
to Chicago in '66 to
march, to end the slums.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.410
The story then in those
books continues

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.710
that the movement floundered

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:29.920
in the urban concrete amidst
fire, rebellion, black power.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.100
That's the beginning and
the ending of the movement

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.080 position:56%
in the North in a traditional story.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.440
In reality, what historians have
shown and what the photographs

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.390
in "North of Dixie"
illustrate is that the routes

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:47.460 position:56%
of the campaigns nationwide reach
much further back often before World

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.400
War II.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.030
The top right picture is taken in
Chicago and it's a protest outside

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.500
of a roller-skating rink in an
African-American neighborhood.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.900
The skating rink was
called White City

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.570
and blacks were not
allowed to skate there.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.740
So, CORE, the Congress of Racial
Equality, which was founded there

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:10.680
in about 1942 took up the cause
and picketed every Saturday night.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.050
And they didn't make too
much of a dent in business

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:19.160
until they began to, they
innovated and began to do stand-ins

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.950
where they block the ticket booth
on the busiest night of the week.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.220
And they were losing
more and more business.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:31.450
But, what really cracked
the straw here

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.300
and made a difference was
they recruited volunteers

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.830
that had military service.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.870
CORE recruited members to come
out, hold signs that said,

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:47.500
"The draft boards did not exclude
Negros and wear their uniforms."

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.290
And that began to make a big
difference, because the individuals

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:54.700 position:56%
who fought for democracy abroad, yet
couldn't skate in their own backyard

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.820
and were enduring a
second-class citizenship,

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.370
that made a huge difference.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:04.310
And they ultimately desegregated
it within a series of months.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.190
Now the picture on the left
shows how photography made issues

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.340
that weren't always visible.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.980
From the street, visible.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.510
In this particular case, a member
of the NAACP with his arm band

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:22.390 position:56%
on is standing near it, a janitor or
a resident pointing to the ceiling,

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.650
to the huge plaster
piece that had fallen.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:30.900
There's leaky pipes above
that caused that to fall.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.130
And often these landed on
men, women and children

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.190
who lived in the residences.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.170
And you would see them in the black
newspapers wearing a big bandage

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.120
with another story about this.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.460 position:56%
"Aren't you sick of falling plaster?

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.510
We sure are," the headlines
would say,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:50.330
or they would say,
"Rats as big as cats.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.810
Holes in the kitchens where
rats could come and go."

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.990
These conditions inside
of the living residences

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:04.870
in dilapidated housing, overpriced
by landlords, preying on families

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.520
that couldn't move out
of the neighborhood.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.430
So, these photographs
made it visible.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.560
And I think that the
pictures helped challenge

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.900
for the average reader the
assumptions that demonstrations,

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.150
riots, and rebellions, they
didn't come out of nowhere.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.450
They didn't explode on their own.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.540
They were often decades
in the making.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:33.490
And the issues stacking up like
unsafe housing, poor city services,

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:38.890
unequal schools, overzealous
policing-

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:43.650
these are protests to inaction.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.120
Complacency in silence.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.030
So, the escalating tactics
through the decades,

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.290
the more determined
protests they call attention

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:56.460
to the issues look different when
you see 20, 30 years of photographs

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.420
of protests before a
riot or a rebellion.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:08.010
One of the chapters focuses
on activist photographers.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.310
And one of the earliest

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.750
and best-known activist
photographers is Danny Lyon

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.900
who took the photograph
on the top left.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.850
He was a college kid
from U of Chicago,

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.400
who brought his camera south ...

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.890
Southern Illinois, I should
say Cayro to a Snick protest.

00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:26.190
On the poster on the far left,

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:29.510
you can see congressman
John Lewis kneeling.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.270
Danny took this ...

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.430
This was his first
protest photograph ...

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:36.950
First protest he went to.

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:41.310
A group of high school age kids
were protesting at a city pool

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.500
that wouldn't let them swim
there, African-American kids.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.600
They were forced to
often swim in the rivers.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.710
And every year or two
that somebody would die

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.360
and this issue would boil up again.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.880
And Snick had admired
their bravery and strength.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.890
They had been beaten
with pipes and arrested.

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:59.740
They were doing, I
think, a hunger strike.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.460
And they went down to support.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.150
This photograph tells that story,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:09.550
but it also captures Snick's
emerging sense of leadership.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.910
They were a youthful group.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.810
They had men and women.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.600
They weren't putting forth
one charismatic male leader.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.890
So, they used this
photograph and this poster,

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.580
as you can see the
words at the bottom

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.580
and their name, to advertise that.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.660
They also innovated by making it
into a poster that they could sell

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.440
and they printed 10,000
copies at a dollar a piece.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.650
So, they began to use
photography in a multitude of ways.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.220
And the activist photographer
played important roles,

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.250
but it also inspired
other photographers

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.790
such as Bruce Hartford
down on the left.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:52.610
He was involved in
a group called NVAC,

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.850
Nonviolent Action Committee,
in Los Angeles.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.200
And the fuzzy little photo

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.650
on the left captures
their guerilla tactics.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:08.210
What they would do is
put on their placards,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:09.510
wear them around their neck.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:13.440
And in this case, it says, "Don't
buy Van De Kamp's bakery products."

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.830
So, they were protesting this
baking company that was alleged

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.160
for not hiring African-Americans
at their factories.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.340 position:56%
And they would march into the
grocery store singing freedom songs,

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.020
throwing pamphlets out and
calling attention to the issue.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.350 position:56%
They would take all the baking goods
off of the shelves and put them

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.600
in those carts and then push
them up to the checkout counter

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.680 position:56%
and just walk out and create a stir.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.020
Then they would go to the next door

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.720
and do a similar thing
and the next door ...

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.080
Of course, the police
eventually caught up to them.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.290
So, it wasn't the strongest tactic.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:50.910
What he was trying to tell me is
they would use these photographs

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.210
on their brochures.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.860
As you can see the next image over,

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.090
they were doing a sip-in
at a coffee shop.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:03.720 position:56%
He knew by watching Snick and others
that photography meant immediacy.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.990 position:56%
It helped them dramatize the issues.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.700
And that's how they
wanted to use it.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.470
He was not a professional
photographer.

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.250
He carried a little Brownie camera
that he had from when he was a kid

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:20.150
and snapped these little pictures,
but they knew that they helped.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:25.180
The other very powerful
photograph comes from Detroit,

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.980
from a massive collection
of Detroit NAACP photographs

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.700
at Wayne State University.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:37.040
Detroit's NAACP was the
largest branch in the nation.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.640
They had a strong black middle
class because of the auto industry

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.020
and had more members
than anywhere else.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.680
And they came up against school
and equalities, textbook issues,

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:51.100
hiring discrimination, and
of course, police brutality.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.820
This picture was taken by
the director or a volunteer

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.040
and then sent to newspapers-
black and white.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.000
It helped make a very
invisible issue.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.960
And I say "invisible," because in
Detroit, between 1956 and 1960,

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.930
the Detroit NACCP investigated
150 different allegations

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.480
of police brutality.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.870
And over one-third
happened in the privacy

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.760
of a precinct office
away from the public eye.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.920
They weren't recorded
as they are now.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.200
So, they used the camera
to make that visible,

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.580
to provide evidence of a beating.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.940
And of course, they sent it to
the black and the white presses.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.260
The black press would occasionally
run a photo with this story,

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:43.090
but the white press
never covered the issue.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:49.980
The fourth and final chapter
in North of Dixie is built

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.110
around the concept of surveillance

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:56.210
and this is an issue that's not
been written about much in relation

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.930
to the civil rights movement.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:02.870
So, I was very happy to be able
to find some photos and cover it.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:06.420
The camera turned out to be an
incredibly powerful weapon during

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.340
the civil rights movement
as I've kind of showed

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.010
and others have written about, but
it was also turned around and used

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.710
against the movement
by law enforcement.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:21.350
You can look at beautiful civil
rights marches and photographs

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.500
and exhibitions, and once
in a while, along the way,

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.580
you'll see a police photographer

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:31.700
in full uniform standing along
a dusty road snapping pictures.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.540
And rarely, do we stop and think
about what or why they were doing.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:41.490 position:56%
In this particular case, I found the
gentleman on the top right in Cayro,

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:46.000
Illinois, Illinois state
highway patrol documenting the

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.980
marchers there.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.280
Often times they were practical-
how many people are out?

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.690
What are the routes that they took?

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:58.500 position:56%
How can we prepare in the future to
better contain or control a protest?

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.050
But, more often than not,
they were for surveillance.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:09.150 position:56%
The top left photograph was taken
in Seattle by a police photographer,

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.950
but I didn't know that at first.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.910
I just saw a really great
open housing protest.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:19.900
And when I went to the Seattle
Municipal Archives' website

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.060
and looked at two dozen
of these photographs,

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.550
I began to recognize a theme.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.080
People would kind of
cover their face

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.250
or they would put a peace sign up.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.470
And then there was at the last

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.540
of the images one little
brave 10-year-old boy

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.450
who was his tongue out
at the photographer.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:40.560
And it hit me finally that they
did not like that photographer.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.790 position:56%
They didn't want to be photographed.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:46.970
Through the help of a incredible
archivist there who kept digging

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.290
for me, she found a document
related to these photos sent

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:55.480
by Sergeant Noble who took
them delivered to the mayor,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.640
to the mayor of the whole city,
detailing who was the march,

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.610
what their license plates
were, how long it lasted,

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:07.280
how many pictures they took,
and all of that information.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.570
Others were much more secretive
like the Chicago Red Squad.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.030
There were red squads in most
major metropolitan areas,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.160
but they would photograph
and document

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:21.850
and build surveillance files on
anybody deemed against the state-

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:26.520
protest groups, black power
groups, communists, gangs.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.050
And what I found fascinating
about when I looked

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:32.520
through their collections is
there would be a number one next

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.610
to somebody and their
name on the back,

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:40.080
which I've included one
of those in the book.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.000
This massive collection was
used against different groups.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.030
When CORE march was part
of the school boycott,

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.740 position:56%
reporters were tipped off in advance
who was against this and that

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.040
and they were covering it.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.660
Police were able to arrest
and use it against them.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.270
The contact sheets on the
bottom left come from New York.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.570
The three ...

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:03.870
I know you can't see them.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.760
The three are from Selma ...

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.060
Excuse me ...

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.430
A protest in New York related to
the Selma marches and beatings.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.180
And the police were there
just kind of documenting,

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.080
monitoring who was there.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.490
The next ones over are from
the Black Panther rally.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:19.390
And these ones really struck me

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.020
because one photographer
took six rolls of film

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.850
of one Black Panther
rally in one city related

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.940
to one issue on one single day.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.240
So, give me a feel for the size,
the massive amount of surveillance,

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.510
imagery that was taken
that exists out there.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.440
It is hard to get your hands on.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.810
Most groups do not
want to give it up.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:47.120
These collections came about
through lawsuits and are protected.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.530
But, I think that it's an
important way to understand

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.880
that the camera was both a weapon
for the movement and against it,

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:02.530 position:56%
and there's a lot to be learned, and
it's very relevant today, of course.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:03.970
So, my last slide ...

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.300
As you might imagine working
on a book during the past two,

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.680
three years has been an
incredibly powerful time.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.740
And with each issue, each
tragic police killing,

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.780 position:56%
each college protest, it became more

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.030
and more relevant,
more and more timely.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.550
And with each photograph
or gesture coming

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.470
up in the news, we were able to ...

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:31.650
You were able to sort of
harken back to an earlier time

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.730
to visual imagery you've
seen before.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.990
And it became apparent with the
cover that is incredibly powerful

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:43.230
from 1967 in Newark, taken

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:47.680
by the first black photographer
for the New York Times.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.490
That it was powerful then.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.880
But then with the hands-up gesture,
it became even more relevant now.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.000
And the photographs that we
see now, whether they come

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.190
across our cellphones, or
actually printed in a newspaper,

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:10.170
are going to harken
back their conversation.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.260
And then we begin to wonder which
ones are going to be the images

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:19.530
that will be iconic
50 years from now?

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.560
Which images will tell the story?

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.790
Which handful will be used
to represent our time?

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:33.090
One of the things I like to
ponder and I'd love to hear kind

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.090
of what the Library of Congress
is doing with digital images

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.860
that might be coming in,
because it's a huge challenge.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:45.350 position:56%
But, there are efforts to preserve
tweets, digital media from Ferguson,

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.500
from Baltimore, and from St. Paul.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:53.210
But, will we be able to
find them 50 years from now

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.780
if somebody wants to do a book?

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.070
It's kind of a scary time.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.340
I worry about my own digital media.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:05.160
What will happen with the way
we're preserving things now?

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.650
But I do want to end with one
quote in the preface that speaks

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.390
to the time that we're in.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:19.040 position:56%
I think when the wonderful historian
and photographer, Deb Willis,

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.610 position:56%
who wrote the preface, sent it to
us, I can still remember where I was

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.170
when I read it and
how moving it was.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:30.760
I don't know how she did it, how
she picked it, but she chose words

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.920
from James Baldwin
who wrote in 1961,

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.760
"Bobby Kennedy recently made me the
soul-stirring promise that one day,

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.160
30 years if I'm lucky,
I can be president too.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.660
It never entered into this boy's
mind that perhaps I don't wanna.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:56.210
What really exercises my mind
is not this hypothetical day

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:01.230 position:56%
on which some other Negro first will
become the first Negro president.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.010
What I'm really curious
is just what kind

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.230 position:56%
of country will he be president of?"

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.510
Thank you.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:18.260
[applause]

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:21.960
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: Welcome any
questions and if you don't want

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.800
to be recorded, I understand.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:38.340
There will be plenty
of time afterwards.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.640
Yes.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.820
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.540
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: Sure.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:55.830
In all honesty, I was searching for
anything I could get my hands on.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:57.530
Chicago, for example, in order

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:00.520
to even view the Chicago
Red Squad collection,

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.420
you need to sign an affidavit
and then when you go,

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.940
you can look through them.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.390
But, in order to publish any
of them, you need permission

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:10.300
from the person in the photograph.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.230
Or if they've passed away, you
need permission from their family.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.480
So I used four of them and
it took probably two months

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.380
to get all of those permissions.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.450
Just myself and of course that
was their verbal permission

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.100
and then the publisher
reached out to them as well

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.350
to confirm that in writing.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:29.930
But, that was an incredible
challenge.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.600
Other places, the New York
City municipal archives,

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.580
somehow they got that collection.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.420
The problem there was they were
in the process of taking them

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.570
from negatives and scanning them.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.640
So they were they just inching
their way along through the years.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.500
Some they said, "well they're
not indexed in any way.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.480
They're by date so can you send
us what you are interested in?"

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.570
So, at that point I had to think,
ok, what were the major protests

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.430
or events that the police might
have been paying attention to?

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:04.290
So, I kind of worked that
out and sent them that list.

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:08.270
And then they went through and
found whatever they could find.

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:12.390
And I found a really nice archivist
who digitized them and sent them

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.220
to me and then I asked a few
questions here and there.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.060
But, it's amazing what they have.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:24.130
In fact, one of them was
around the 1964 Harlem riots

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:30.610 position:56%
and they had a picture of the police
officer who shot the young boy

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.960
which kind of started it all.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.920
They actually scanned
and sent me pictures

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.260
from the morgue of the young man.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.510 position:56%
It was incredible stuff that exists.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:45.130
So, there's a lot to be
done with that angle still.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.650
And I was just doing the North,
so anything from Mississippi,

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.130
anything from the South where
there was even more surveillance

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:56.110
photography, you know, literally
a government agency to track

00:48:56.110 --> 00:49:03.500
and disrupt, that would be a
fascinating project, I'm sure.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:13.410 position:56%
Not sure it's going to be me though.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.710
Beverly. [inaudible]

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:21.030
&gt;&gt; BEVERLY BRANNAN: I
should say something

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:24.550
about the way the library
acquires digital photographs.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.380
It's pretty difficult for
us to do because we have

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.230
to maintain standards
that are higher

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:32.490
than the commercial standards.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:37.030
So, when people try to send us
things, we have to go through a lot

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.700
of gyrations to get
it up to the level

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.310
that we can put it on our website.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:47.950 position:56%
We don't have a good delivery system
in place yet for digital images.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:51.160
So, we have worked with
the few photographers

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:59.450 position:56%
who send us hard drives because
none of the other commercial methods

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:04.980
of sending things seems to work
with the security systems that are

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.370
in place here at the library.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.210
So, they send us a hard drive.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:12.200
We download the images and
send them back the hard drive,

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:17.280
which sounds pretty
clunky and it is.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:21.580
We also work with photographers
on the rights.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:27.430
They have to sign a form telling
us exactly what rights they own,

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:31.180
what rights they retain, and which
ones they give to the public.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:36.820
And a lot of people are off
put by having to declare this.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:42.040
So, that is an educational
process we have to go

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.960
through with each photographer.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.040
So we try to get multiple
photographs,

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.250
multiple digital photographs
from individual photographers

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:55.390
so that it's not going
through this process

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:58.290
with each person who
sends a picture.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:04.080
So, we're kind of in a slow
clunky mode of acquiring.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.360 position:56%
But we do acquire digital images and
when possible we put them up online,

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.650
up on the website now, but a lot of
people want to retain their rights.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:18.730
So, the images are not
available at present.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:26.280
And, so we have to keep updating
the digital images until such time

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.730
as the people are willing
to let us release them.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:31.840
So, that's a little
bit of background

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.810 position:56%
about how we acquire digital images.

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.380
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: Thank you for that.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.860
Incredibly complex,
no doubt about it.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.160
Yeah?

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.720
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.640
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: What
surprised me the most

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.950
and it shouldn't have
been a surprise,

00:51:52.950 --> 00:52:00.040 position:56%
was that 97 of the photos were going
to focus on ordinary Americans.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:04.130 position:56%
That's usually one of my main
points besides the movement happened

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:09.820
down south is who lead and fought
and you know did the daily work

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:13.950
in the movement and I think that's
also the most inspiring part.

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:15.610
You know, we don't need to wait

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.770
around for anybody,
change begins with one.

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:25.320
But, I think that that
seeing that on the pages was,

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:29.460
shouldn't have been surprising,
but it was a really good reminder.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.930
Out in San Francisco,
I'm going to be working

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:35.440
with the Wells Fargo Family
and Business History Center,

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:39.160
so doing corporate history of
the company and then working

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.790
with families who are clients.

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.790
Yes?

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:46.090
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.860
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: Well, I do think

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.030
about the surveillance
photography a lot

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.100
and I always keep my
eyes out for that.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.650
Any historian or author knows

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:12.970
that you're always gathering
material for the next projects.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:16.120
I'm also incredibly
interested in the photography

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.970
of Malcolm X. I spent a day in
New York a couple weeks ago,

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:25.000
going through his 3 to 4,000
photos at the Schaumburg Center,

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.050
so some pictures taken by him
during International travel- nation

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:33.990
of Islam photographs, things
that he took during court cases

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.330
with the n action of Islam.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:37.350
So, I think there's something
to be done with that.

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:42.480
But, that's you know a big
project and books are three

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.200
to four years of your
life, you know?

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.360
I don't brew beer or make change.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.670
I do history in my free time.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:54.970
Yeah?

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.810
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.570
&gt;&gt; MARK SPELTZ: Yeah.

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:17.870
I didn't specifically
come across them.

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:21.230
I also wasn't looking.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:24.800
It's amazing, even though
the book has 100 photographs,

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.370
you know that's not a lot
in a photography book.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:31.660
We had a binder about three or
four inches thick, and when we got

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.890
down to 150, cutting
those last 50, 25,

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:40.330
like you know incredibly painful.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:46.340
And then when you cast that net so
wide and you're working full time,

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.980
you can only visit so many places.

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.690
So, you go to the best
repositories that you know of.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.810
But, that's not to say that
you can't sometimes get lucky.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.370
I worked at the National
Archives and I worked

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:00.180
with an incredible archivist there.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:04.230
The Black Panthers were
investigated in 1970

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:07.790
in a Congressional investigation

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:12.500
and so they published a big thick
document, book detailing everything

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.330
and there are photographs
in there as evidence.

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:19.250
And I got really curious, well
where are those photographs now

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.230
from the Congressional hearings?

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:24.040
And sure enough somebody
was able to turn them

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.140
up at the National Archives.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.500
And there were photographs that
somebody had taken locally,

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.060
documenting where the free
breakfast centers were,

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.640
where the Panthers were located.

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.030
There were some other thigs
related, evidence of a bombing

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.160
or somebody's car or something.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.700
And then there were
press photographs

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:48.020
that the investigation
got from the local press.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:51.690
And then used to identify
everybody in it.

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.220
There were police mug shots.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:59.370
So, this archive was squirrelled
away somewhere and it wasn't

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:02.750
that the actual prints from the
evidence that I was able to find,

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:06.430 position:56%
it was actually able to get them
through the publication of the book.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:08.630
So, they were the book files.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:09.930
You know, which was just crazy

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.910
and you would never
think to look that way.

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:16.780
So, often times you
might start on a search

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:19.450
and then you get lucky
finding it elsewhere.

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:21.200
And if I had started out looking

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.150
for the book publication
files, they'd never exist, so.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.670
Yeah, great.

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:32.730
&gt;&gt; PAM JACKSON: So, we'll
have to be our last question.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.480
I just want to say
thanks again, Mark.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:39.300 position:56%
Your presentation, your materials
are vivid and striking and engaging.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:43.270
Very much appreciate your work
and I think that one of the things

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.710
that I love about the opportunity
to be here and share this

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:49.500
with you all is that our hope
is that it opened your minds

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:54.340
and your hearts and makes us
curious and I want to learn more

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:58.280
and make sure that you know
our empathy is present.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.760 position:56%
And our history is known and that we
can be the kind of people that make

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.800
that change, as you
mentioned versus wait for it.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.370
So, thank you so much for
being here and sharing with us.

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:10.000

and acknowledge,
