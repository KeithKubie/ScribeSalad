[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.657 --> 00:00:07.240
PAUL DAVIES: I'm
probably the only one

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.060
in this room old
enough to remember

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.940
that when you wanted
to use a computer,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.560
it meant a 15-minute
walk across town.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.590
In my case, from University
College London, where

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.520
I was a student, to
somewhere near Senate House,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.240
where in this entire
building was housed, I think,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.850
it was an IBM 360 or
something like that.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.150
And you'd go with a pocket
full of punch cards,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.910
and hand them across a desk,
and sign all sorts of forms,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.150
and go back the next day
to see what had happened.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.570
Now, the astonishing
increase in processing power

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.930
that has occurred
during my lifetime,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.020
encapsulated in the
famous Moore's law,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.610
is due almost entirely to
the properties of quantum

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.350
mechanics, quantum systems.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.470
Whether it's
electrons or photons.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.200
And the architect
of quantum mechanics

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.730
was one Ervin Schrodinger,
who put together

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.210
what we would now understand
as the fundamentals

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
of this subject
in the late 1920s.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.400
And at a stroke,
quantum mechanics

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.350
explained the nature of matter
all the way from atomic nuclei

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.130
right up to the
structure of stars.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.960
It's the most successful
scientific theory we have.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.830
So it's not just in
the computing industry

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.910
that it's had an impact.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.550
It's really right
across technology.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.500
And more than that,
quantum mechanics

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.930
provides us with
our deepest account

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.812
of the nature of reality.

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:38.270
It's not just the
nature of matter,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.600
but the nature of
reality as well.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.040
And it's a subject
that continues

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.620
to intrigue and baffle
mainstream scientists.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.030
Schrodinger was a giant
of theoretical physics,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.360
and this was a very
difficult subject,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.920
and he is rightly given the
credit along with Heisenberg

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.530
and Dirac for founding it.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.740
Now, fast forward about 10
years, and the scientific scene

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.889
took a turn for the worse with
the rise of Nazism in Europe,

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:14.560
and many people fled, some to
work on the Allied war effort.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
Schrodinger, who was
Austrian, also fled.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.260
But instead of joining
the Allied war effort,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.940
he settled in Dublin.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.300
Ireland was neutral
during World War II,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.290
and he made a home there with
his wife and his mistress,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.570
living under the same roof.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.600
Apparently, he still
had many affairs.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.860
It didn't prevent him.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.030
And he turned his
attention, I suppose,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.440
having sort of got out of the
mainstream, to whatever it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.580
was that interested him.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.630
And he decided that, having
cracked the problem of matter,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.690
maybe he could crack
the problem of life.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.120
And he delivered a series
of lectures in 1943,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.280
which became a very famous book
published in 1944 by Cambridge

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.020
University Press
called "What is Life?",

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.110
asking that basic question.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.150
And you might say, well, what
is so special about life?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.780
I think all of us
have that impression

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.730
that living organisms
are in a class apart,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.470
that they are unlike any
other complex systems.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.630
They have rather
extraordinary properties,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.740
and indeed rather
baffling properties.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.170
And what Schrodinger
was interested to know

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.530
was whether life,
living organisms,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.060
could be explained by physics.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.530
And then the question
was, could it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.530
be explained by known physics,
or did it need any new physics?

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.440
Might there be some
sort of laws of life?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.750
And Schrodinger was
open minded about this.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.460
He said that one
must be prepared

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.250
to find a new type of
physical law prevailing in it.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.460
So notice that it's not
just a new physical law,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.560
but a new kind of law.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.290
For many, many years,
I was skeptical

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.300
that we would need new
physics to explain life.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.530
I just thought our difficulty
in understanding living systems

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.730
was due to the fundamental
complexity of living organisms.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.470
But over the last
few years, I've

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.140
become convinced that we
do need some new physics.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.250
And so we might think of biology
as the next great frontier

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.760
of physics.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.310
I think there's new physics
lurking in biology which

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.690
could have sweeping implications
across the whole of science.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.620
Now, a contemporary of
Schrodinger, Max Delbruck,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.140
I think, expressed very
nicely the puzzlement

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.710
that we all feel when thinking
about living organisms.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.350
Let me just quote
what he said here.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.500
"The curiosity remains
to grasp more clearly how

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.140
the same matter, which
in physics and chemistry

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.710
displays orderly and
reproducible and relatively

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.110
simple properties,
arranges itself

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.570
in the most astounding
fashions as soon as it

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.720
is drawn into the orbit
of living organisms.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.480
The closer one looks at
these performances of matter

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.900
in living organisms, the more
impressive the show becomes.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.040
The meanest living cell
becomes a magic puzzle box,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.400
full of elaborate and
changing molecules."

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.538
And to condense this message,
what Delbruck is saying

00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:16.580
is that when we're dealing
in the level of atoms,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.930
it's just known physics.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.170
But at the level of cells,
it seems like magic.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.110
And what is the
source of that magic?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.560
What I want to tell
you today, briefly,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.850
is that that wall of
secrecy or mystery

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.500
that is surrounding the nature
of living systems, I think,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.120
there is a chink
in that, and we can

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.940
begin to see where
the answer lies

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.450
to explain the astonishing
properties of living things.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.820
Now, let me just enumerate
some of those properties

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.610
and their implications.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.970
Organisms seem to have a
sort of inner motive power.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.160
They seem to be
self-propelled, something

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.270
that goes right back to
Aristotle wondering about that.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.840
They operate as if they
have a project, or a goal,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.460
or a purpose.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.760
Obviously, human beings do,
but even a humble bacterium

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.760
pokes around,
seemingly knowingly,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.400
looking for food or something.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.920
They seem to know
what they're doing.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.360
Unlike most systems, they
create order out of chaos.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.720
There is a natural tendency--

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.910
I'll talk about it in a
moment, the second law

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.600
of thermodynamics-- for systems
to degenerate and become

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.800
more and more disorderly.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.290
It's easier to break
it than make it.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.120
Anyone here with
teenage children

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.340
will know exactly
what I mean when

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.840
you inspect their bedrooms.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.040
Living systems are
self-organizing,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.720
and they evolve in
an open-ended way.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.790
You cannot really
predict in advance.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.180
If you got in a time machine,
went back three billion years,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.370
and there were just these
sort of boring bacteria,

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.300
if you tried to predict the
future of the biosphere,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.240
there would be trees,
and bees, and cacti,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.750
and so on, you couldn't do it.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:05.060
It's an open-ended and seemingly
boundless possibility space.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.310
Living organisms, I
suppose, their most

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.290
characteristic feature,
at least the one

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.850
that intrigues me, they achieve
seemingly impossible states.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.580
That is, they achieve
states of matter

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.280
that could not arise
in any other way

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.570
from non-living systems.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.700
And I give some
examples later on.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.950
And this raises
a whole question,

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.820
when I decided I would write a
book about what is life, about

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.090
the nature of life, a
lot of my biology friends

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.230
were a bit baffled by that.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.480
You know, what's "the problem?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.110
We study life."

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.500
And of course, biologists
study what life does,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.390
not what life is.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.780
And the big issue
for a physicist

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.700
is that all this wonderful
life, which once it gets going,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.410
keeps going, it all
works very well.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.040
It perpetuates itself.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.550
So once the system is up and
running, it's fine, but how

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.700
did it get started
in the first place?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.630
And that's a really
important question,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.770
because everybody, I
think, wants to know,

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.610
are we alone in the universe?

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.700
And the answer hinges
on just how likely

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.060
it is that life starts
up from non-life.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.900
What is it?

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.590
What is the process that, if
you like, animates matter?

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:24.470
What is the process that makes
normal matter living matter?

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.240
We don't know, but
if this is something

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.320
which is incredibly unlikely,
if the chemical pathway leading

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.860
from a mishmash of chemicals
to the first living thing

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.450
was very long and
convoluted, it may

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.990
have happened only once in the
entire observable universe.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.549
In which case, we are it.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.620
There is no life anywhere else.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.690
Alternatively, if
this is something

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.700
that is, this
process, this pathway

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.870
is built into the fundamental
nature of the universe,

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.600
then we could expect
that life will

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.570
come wherever there are
opportunities, wherever

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.750
they are earth-like planets.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.292
The universe will
be teeming with it.

00:08:59.292 --> 00:09:01.610
So this is a really
important question.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.360
Now, we're hampered in this
entire discussion about life,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.500
because we don't
have a life meter.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.420
This is what it might
look like, if you had one.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.150
What we would ideally like to
be able to do, particularly

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.630
in searching for life elsewhere,
is to send a life meter off

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.580
to Mars, or Titan, or wherever
you happen to think life may

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.760
look, and it will
come back, hopefully

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.440
with a reading showing
yes, there is life there.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.080
But we also feel
that the transition

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.700
from non-life to life isn't
going to be an abrupt thing.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.770
It's not just some amazing,
gigantic chemical reaction that

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.090
just sort of happened one day.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.720
There's going to
be this pathway.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.550
We don't know whether it's a lot
of jumps or just a slow rise.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.300
We don't know what it
was, because we have

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.640
no idea what that pathway was.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.010
But wouldn't it be nice if
we could go to somewhere

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.950
like Titan, sample the
atmosphere, which we know

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:57.680
is full of organics, and this
life meter would say, well,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.817
nice try, Titan.

00:09:58.817 --> 00:10:00.650
You've been there four
and 1/2 billion years

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.080
trying to cook up life,
didn't quite get there,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.050
but you did get 83.7%
of the way there.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.680
Come back with "that
was almost life."

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.670
Would we know almost
life if we saw it?

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.550
We know life when we
see it, but can we

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.270
tell the difference between
something that is living,

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.260
something that's almost
living, something that

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.600
was living and no longer is.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.240
Now, this seems like a very
sort of academic exercise,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.430
and it's the type
of question we love

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.990
to discuss in the Beyond Center
at Arizona State University.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.140
And we sit around, and we argue
about this, and define this.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.110
And we think we've got
our own approach, which

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.860
I'm going to talk about
in a moment, based

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.293
on the informational
properties of these systems.

00:10:38.293 --> 00:10:39.710
But there's a very
practical sense

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.560
in which it would be nice
to know the answer of how

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.910
to build a life meter.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.090
And we had a conference
a couple of years ago,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:52.000
and present in the meeting was
Chris McKay from NASA Ames.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.730
That's an astrobiology lab.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.160
And we were trying
to convince him

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.940
that a true definition of life
was a software definition, not

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.280
a hardware definition.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.980
A definition based on the
patterns and organization

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.220
of information should be
substrate independent.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.970
What we would like is a
universal definition of life

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.090
that would apply whatever
the chemical basis.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.190
And we've got some
ideas about that,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.670
and a little bit
abstract, and so on.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.170
Chris's response was,
well, this is all

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.330
very exciting and
well and good, but I

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.800
have to tell NASA headquarters
by April 24th what we're going

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.970
to put on this spacecraft.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:35.370
And the spacecraft is going
to go to a moon of Saturn

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.430
called in Enceladus.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.800
Some people say enchilada.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.550
And you see that from
the surface of Enceladus

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.800
this plume of
material coming out.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.140
Now, Enceladus has an icy
crust but a liquid interior.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.670
And the Cassini spacecraft
measured organic molecules

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.750
coming out in that gas.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.350
So as Chris says, it's
almost like Enceladus

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.610
has put up a sign saying
"life, free samples."

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.970
And so what they'd like to
do is fly a spacecraft--

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:07.790
there we go--

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.510
through that plume, and
put a life meter on board,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.580
and tell us, is there
life there or not?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.370
But what as soon as
you start thinking

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.980
about exactly what do you
put on that spacecraft,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.000
you hit what I regard as the
fundamental problem of trying

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.570
to understand what is life.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.420
If you ask a physicist
to describe life,

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.450
then you're going to have-- or
a chemist, you're going to have

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.320
a description in terms of
forces, and molecular shapes,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.660
and affinities, and binding
energies, and entropy,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.280
and energy, and all
that fun stuff that you

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.220
learn in physics degrees.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.030
If you ask a biologist, you
get a very different narrative.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:54.900
So biologists will describe life
in terms of coded information,

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.150
instructions, editing,
transcription, translation,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.510
signals, all of those
sorts of things,

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.430
and to summarize that
in terms of information.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.090
So physicists talk in
terms of hardware stuff,

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.870
biologists talk in terms
of software or information.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.520
And very much in the news at
the moment is gene editing.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.940
So it cells will
edit their own genes,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.280
but now we can do
it artificially.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.830
We can intercede.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.240
And so we have
two very different

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.860
conceptual descriptions
of the same phenomenon.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.300
And you might think,
well, that's a problem.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.980
But one of my scientific
mentors, John Wheeler,

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.620
was fond of saying that
revolutions in science

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.130
owe more to the clash of ideas
than the steady accumulation

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:47.700
of facts.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.480
And so when you see something
like this, twin narratives

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.050
but completely different
conceptual basis,

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.192
that's where progress in
science is likely to come.

00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:00.150
Now, if there are any
doubters in the room that

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.450
think information is not
terribly relevant to biology,

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.470
let me just run through
some obvious examples.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.527
The DNA in your bodies is packed
full of coded information.

00:14:10.527 --> 00:14:11.610
It's not just information.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.590
It's encoded.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.530
So the Book of Life is
written in this four letter

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.020
alphabet of AGCT.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.180
Genes don't act in isolation.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.690
They tend to form networks,
sometimes of great complexity.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.400
They switch each
other on and off,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.770
and information swirls
around these networks.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.530
We've been studying that,
the patterns of information,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.180
the way it's stored, and how
the network architecture,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.080
its topology, the wiring
diagram, if you like,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.530
affects the behavior
of that information.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.340
And what is very
clear from people

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.690
who study biological networks
is that if you apply things

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.120
like scaling laws,
that they're very

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.680
different from random networks.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.440
In other words, evolution
has honed the topology

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.570
and the architecture
of these networks

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.840
to have certain properties.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.140
And when we think
of life, there is

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.510
a sort of reductionist
tendency to attribute

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.185
biological functions
to specific genes

00:15:09.185 --> 00:15:11.310
or maybe collections of
genes, but we should really

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.515
think in these network terms.

00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:18.570
And if we want to either
reconfigure life or cure

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.490
some disease or
something, we really

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:26.413
need to think at that network
level, the informational level.

00:15:26.413 --> 00:15:27.330
It doesn't stop there.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.190
Individual cells
signal each other.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.560
They transfer information.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.870
Even bacteria can form biofilms.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.030
They appear to be
very clever when

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.470
they're acting collectively.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.490
But of course, once you get up
to the level of social insects,

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.820
then collective decision
making via information transfer

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.260
becomes a really
important subject.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.640
We have a group, a
big group at ASU,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.353
working on how
ants get together.

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.520
I mean, that looks like
they're having a conference,

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.010
but they do have a very
complex repertoire of behavior.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.210
But individually, each
ant is pretty stupid,

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.480
but collectively,
they're pretty smart.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.660
So birds in flocks,
that's another example.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.810
And anyone who's
read today's papers

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.680
will probably know that bees,
which are also very clever,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.930
can not only play football,
but apparently they

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.660
can do arithmetic.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.480
So all of this has to do
with information exchange

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.430
and collective decision making.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.910
Probably the most
dramatic example

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.150
of information deployed
in the service of life

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.140
is the development of the embryo
from a single-celled zygote.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.040
The exquisite choreography
that is involved

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.790
in getting all the
right bits in the right

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.910
places at the right time.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.500
And it's still not
fully understood,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.050
but Alan Turing, as
a matter of fact,

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.260
had a great interest
in this, and developed

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.450
a mathematical theory
about how morphogens,

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.380
these would be at that
time unknown chemicals,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.200
might diffuse through a system
and sort of set up a three

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.680
dimensional grid against
which, as we would now

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.329
say in modern language, the
genes would express themselves

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.513
in the appropriate way.

00:17:10.513 --> 00:17:12.180
What this is really
saying is that there

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.619
is a dynamic chemical network
and a dynamic information

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.349
network, and these networks
are coupled together,

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.630
and there's complex
feedback loops,

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.670
and the whole thing
operates to give

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.760
this astonishing
developmental pathway.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.880
And then, last but
probably not least,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.070
is what's between our ears.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.120
This is perhaps the best
example of the power

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.070
of information in biology.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.860
Once it leads to
behavior, an understanding

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.620
at the level of
human beings, then it

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.860
becomes truly spectacular.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:53.130
One last point about this,
just last week, my colleagues

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.800
published a study in which they
looked at over 28,000 genomes.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.200
And this is a
planet-wide network

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.780
of organized information
that they've mapped out here.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.260
I won't go into the
details, except to say

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.790
that the biosphere was the
original worldwide web.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.320
And it's a web of
information exchange.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.880
Now, this idea
that life is really

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.500
about information, and logic,
and information processing

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.330
is certainly not my idea.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.790
It didn't start with me.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.730
There was a very
visionary paper in Nature

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.060
by Paul Nurse, the former
president of the Royal Society,

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.900
called "Life, Logic,
and Information."

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.660
And again, I'll just
read what he has to say.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.840
"We need to describe the
molecular interactions

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.000
and biochemical
transformations that

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.250
take place in living
organisms, and then

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.580
translate these descriptions
into the logic circuits that

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.980
reveal how information
is managed.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.930
This analysis should
not be confined

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.600
to the flow of information
from gene to protein,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.200
but should also be applied
to all functions operating

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.930
in cells and organisms."

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.990
And so what he's saying here
is that we should perhaps

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.720
think of life as a little
bit like electronics,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.140
where you have these modules,
each of which has a function.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.760
These may just be
logical functions.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.180
There are many examples of
logic gates in bacteria,

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.568
for example, in gene regulatory
circuits, that just operate

00:19:17.568 --> 00:19:18.860
and they can be wired together.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.060
And they just operate like
logic gates in computers.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.030
And so this enables
even simple organisms

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.030
to carry out really very
sophisticated computations.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.440
Now, a lot of this was
presaged by the co-inventor

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.390
of the computer, Von Neumann.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.970
So Turing came up
originally with the idea

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.830
of a universal computer.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.890
So that is a machine that
could compute anything

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.980
or could output anything
that was in principle

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.180
computable, given long enough.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.840
And Von Neumann
drew a close analogy

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.090
with what he called a
universal constructor.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.480
A universal constructor
would be a machine that

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.750
could take parts, if it's
provided with enough parts,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.790
and it could assemble
them into anything

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.640
that it was programmed
to do, including itself.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.160
It could make a copy of itself.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.290
So he was interested
in the concept

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.005
of a self-reproducing machine.

00:20:11.005 --> 00:20:12.380
Is it possible,
he said, to build

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.550
a machine that could construct
any physical system, including

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.600
itself?

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.600
And in carrying that
analysis through,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.380
he preceded the
logical architecture

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.070
that we now know
life on Earth uses,

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.500
that life is really an
information replication

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.490
and management system.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:37.710
And in particular, he
foresaw the dual role of DNA.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.220
When I say dual role,
there are two things

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.450
that can happen to DNA.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.880
So it sits there, this
famous double helix,

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.620
and it's got instructions
in the form of genes.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.260
These can be read out.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:52.310
So it can be, as it were, a
database for the life project.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.170
It could be read out.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.530
And in that sense,
it's in active mode.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.550
It's sending that
information out.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.347
But when the cell comes
to divide, that stops.

00:21:03.347 --> 00:21:04.430
Actually, it doesn't stop.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.860
The two things can go on
together, but never mind.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.710
It flips to the other function.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.790
It then is just not information.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.250
It's not a database.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.160
It is then just a physical
object, a physical structure

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.840
that gets replicated.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.390
So two quite separate
things happen to DNA.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.590
One is, it gets read out.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.080
The other is, it
gets replicated.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.270
Nobody quite knows exactly how
cells toggle between these two

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.950
different functions of DNA.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:35.590
But in his notion of a
self-reproducing machine, Von

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.660
Neumann, he spoke of something
called a supervisory unit,

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.285
which would basically say,
"OK, make this, make this, make

00:21:44.285 --> 00:21:45.065
this.

00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:46.310
Then stop making anything.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.230
We'll just copy the
instruction set,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.510
and take that instruction set,
and put it in the project."

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.860
And to have what life does,
true self-replication,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.240
DNA has to have that dual
hardware software function.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.290
Now I'm software.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.450
Now I'm hardware.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.850
It's a really important insight
into the fundamental logic

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.570
that runs life as we know it.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.340
And Von Neumann was
absolutely right

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.860
that this is the way that
life does organize itself.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.500
Well, now let me
move on, because I

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.360
don't have too much longer.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.270
All of this raises the question
of what is information.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:24.580
I've been using that in a
very sort of colloquial sense,

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.320
but I'd like to tell you
a little bit about how

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.610
we need to think of information
not so much as something

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.550
to talk about, but as a
physical variable that can

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.870
enter into the laws of physics.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.157
Because I provocatively
said at the outset,

00:22:38.157 --> 00:22:39.740
I agree with
Schrodinger, that we need

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.240
a new type of physical law.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.220
And I think it's a
physical law that

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.310
will embed information
in a fundamental way

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.480
in the laws of physics.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.760
These will be new
laws of physics,

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.105
but it will be
physics, not magic.

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:54.980
To do that, you have to
quantify information.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.630
I'm sure most of
the people here know

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.040
that this was Claude Shannon,
who developed information

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.220
theory in the late 1940s and
defined the binary digit,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.930
or bit.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.210
If you don't know this
story, one bit of information

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.710
is what you get
if you toss a coin

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.430
and then see whether it
came down heads or tails.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.570
But Shannon defined information
in terms of reduction

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.220
in uncertainty.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.620
You've got a 50-50
chance, heads or tails.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.330
When you look and see,
that uncertainty goes away.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.370
And that's just one
bit of uncertainty.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:32.190
So that is all standard
stuff these days.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.970
But what I'm going to ask
is, can information, which

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.650
seems to be a sort
of abstract concept,

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.120
can it actually
have physical clout?

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.010
There's an analogy
here with energy.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.080
So as you're all
aware, information

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.520
is something that can be
instantiated in a wide variety

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.170
of physical systems.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.350
If you want to copy a file from
your computer or a flash drive,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.070
you can do that.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.170
You keep the information.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.990
You can then send it down
optical fiber as photons.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.490
There's any number
of different ways

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.660
you could store
that information.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.040
The information is conserved.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.980
It's independent
of the substrate.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.850
Just like energy, you can
convert electrical energy

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.340
into mechanical energy,
or gravitational energy,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.640
or chemical energy.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.390
The energy stays the same,
but its manifestation

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.960
or instantiation can be passed
from one thing to another.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.100
So just as energy has a sort
of independent existence

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.230
but is always tied to
matter, so information.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.960
we talk about it
as if it's a thing

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.450
with an independent
existence, but it is always

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.830
tied to matter.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.440
So to fully understand
how information operates

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.570
in living systems,
we have to understand

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.420
how information
couples to matter,

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.050
not just as a way of speaking,
but in a law-like manner.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.110
And it turns out that the
answer, the beginnings

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:53.220
of an answer, were already
there in the 19th century

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.510
with the work of James Clerk
Maxwell, and Maxwell's demon.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.390
Now, let me just
explain this concept.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:03.330
So Maxwell, who unified
electricity and magnetism,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.290
also made seminal contributions
to the theory of heat.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.960
And in a letter to
a friend, I mean,

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.900
this was what physicists
call a thought experiment,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.860
he envisaged a tiny being,
soon to be called a demon, who

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.370
could perceive individual
molecules in their paths,

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.750
and then sort them into
fast and slow categories.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.950
So what you see there
is a shutter mechanism,

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.920
and the wily demon
will open the shutter

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.150
to let fast moving particles
go from right to left and slow

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.020
moving particles go in
the other direction.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.220
And Maxwell argued
that that could

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.070
be done without any
expenditure of energy.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.260
In principle, it
was just a matter

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.190
of letting the
molecules move through.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.410
And if you do that,
because molecular speed

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.690
is a measure of
temperature, you end up

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.760
with the left side
hot on the right side,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.260
and then an engineer
could build you

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.740
a heat engine that could
do useful work to run off

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.920
that temperature gradient.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.460
So this was a device,
Maxwell's demon,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:07.680
of converting information
about the molecules

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.750
into work, heat into work
without any further ado.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.248
And that's in flagrant
violation of the Second Law

00:26:15.248 --> 00:26:17.040
of Thermodynamics, the
most fundamental law

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.490
of the universe.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.820
And that's the law that
we think of when we

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.440
say heat goes from hot to cold.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.400
For example, if you
put a snow person,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.610
I guess we should call
it, next to a fire,

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.423
the snow person melts
and the fire loses heat.

00:26:33.423 --> 00:26:34.590
It doesn't go the other way.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:38.100
You don't find that there's
more and more snow on the right

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.900
and the flames get
hotter and hotter.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.640
So that's very familiar.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.220
Nobody really would contest
that, except some of you

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.030
might be thinking, well, hold
on, what about my refrigerator?

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.580
Doesn't that take heat
from the cold interior

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.440
and put it into
the warm kitchen?

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.120
And the answer is
yes, and you pay

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.910
an electricity bill for that.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.640
In other words, given
energy, yes, you

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.440
can make heat flow
uphill, or backwards,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.260
or reverse the arrow of time.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.190
However you want to think of it.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:09.010
But Maxwell's demon, it's not
plugged into the national grid.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.110
Maxwell's demon
does it for nothing.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.330
But not quite for nothing,
because Maxwell's demon

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:18.490
is using information to gain
a thermodynamic advantage.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.980
And that says that
information is a type of fuel.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.000
And sure enough, it
is a type of fuel.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.840
And in the last
three or four years,

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.850
there have been a flood
of papers and experiments

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.220
making what are called
information engines.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.460
These are engines that run
on information power alone.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.777
My favorite one is in Finland.

00:27:35.777 --> 00:27:37.610
This is an information-powered
refrigerator.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.120
Yeah, you can actually do this.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.350
It's got an efficiency
of 75% of converting bits

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.850
into work, or into energy.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.710
And it's not really going to
spark a kitchen revolution

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.835
in the near future, because
this is nanotechnology.

00:27:56.835 --> 00:27:59.050
This is on a nanoscale.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.770
But nevertheless, it establishes
the important principle

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.890
that Maxwell was right.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.750
So this is a Maxwell demon.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.390
There's one just a couple
of months ago reported

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.080
in Korea that has more than
98% conversion efficiency

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.870
of information into work.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.710
But it was a couple
of giants of the field

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.600
of the theory of
computation working

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.210
at IBM, Rolf Landauer,
and then Charles Bennett,

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.253
who really put all this
together about 20 years ago.

00:28:27.253 --> 00:28:29.170
They were interested in
the fundamental limits

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.790
of computation.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:35.080
What I often say to people
is that this machine here

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.960
is a laptop, but you know, I
very rarely put it on my lap.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.190
And I think these days,
people tend to not do that.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.730
But if you do put it on
your lap, it gets hot.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.410
And that heat is wasted.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.750
In fact, I read somewhere
that the entire heat

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.210
output from the world's
computing industry

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.180
is more than the power
requirements of Denmark.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.600
And increasingly, a lot of
that is going to Bitcoin.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.150
Bitcoin is costing
staggering amounts of energy.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.360
Now, you know, why do you
expend energy like that?

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.180
And so what Landauer
was interested in is,

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.390
how do the laws of computing
and the laws of thermodynamics

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:08.560
interconnect?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.720
And they do, because every time
a bit is flipped or erased,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.820
more to the point, you
generate a little bit of heat.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.150
And that could be
reduced enormously.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:26.200
And I just ask you to think that
your brain is like a mega watt

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.050
supercomputer, but it runs on
the equivalent of a light bulb,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.370
a small light bulb.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:35.350
So it's possible to greatly
reduce the amount of heat which

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.240
is expended.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.740
Landauer, and later
Charles Bennett,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.573
were interested could
it be reduced to zero?

00:29:40.573 --> 00:29:44.195
Could you have genuinely
reversible computation?

00:29:44.195 --> 00:29:45.320
And all that's in the book.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.420
I won't get into it here,
Don't have enough time.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.910
But what they
identified, at least

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.220
what Charles Bennett
identified, is

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.090
that you're not getting
something for nothing here.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.400
Maxwell's demon looks like it's
some sort of perpetual motion

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.150
machine.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:02.030
It's really not, because
you get a little bit.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.990
You can always grab a little
bit of thermodynamic advantage.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.900
But if you wanted
something for your kitchen,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.300
you'd have to go on doing it
again, and again, and again.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.380
You'd have to have a cycle.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.530
And in order to operate a
Maxwell demon in a cycle,

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.490
the poor thing gets its brain
clogged up with information,

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.270
because remember, it's got
to observe, store, act,

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.517
and then that's in its register.

00:30:24.517 --> 00:30:26.350
And that register will
fill up, and fill up.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.510
And so at some stage, it
has to be cleared out,

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.470
brainwashed, reset,
and started again.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.950
And that act of
resetting the register

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.620
generates as much entropy
as you have gained.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.690
So overall, in the universe,
the Second Law is still obeyed.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.930
But nevertheless, at the
level of nanotechnology,

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.780
you can gain an advantage.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.100
And here, as a matter
of interest for the more

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.010
mathematically inclined, is the
Second Law of Thermodynamics

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.210
that explicitly
includes information.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.230
So if you put an information
term in, measured in bits,

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.710
put an information term into
that equation, the books

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.120
balance.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.732
Now, you might be
thinking, well,

00:31:05.732 --> 00:31:07.690
this is all well and good
for nanotechnologies.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.510
What's it got to do with life?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.580
And the answer is, well, life
is all about nanotechnology,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.820
that we're full of
molecular machines.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.150
Many of them are Maxwell
demons, chattering away,

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:20.700
doing the business of life.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.700
There are many examples.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.940
You can read about
them in the book,

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.430
but I'm just going
to give you one

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.040
to give you the flavor of this,
because I need to wind this up

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.720
in a moment.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.450
What's going on in
your heads, as I

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.570
hope you're paying attention,
is that your neurons

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.220
are signaling each other.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.830
These signals are a little
bit like electrical wires,

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.330
the axons in your brain.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.510
But it's not like a flow of
electrons through the brain.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.290
What happens is that
there's like a wave

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.020
of polarization,
electric polarization

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.510
across the membrane of the axon.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:58.080
And there are these holes in
the membrane that are gated just

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.217
like Maxwell's daemon.

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:01.050
They can be opened and
closed, and the brain

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.670
does open and close them.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:06.390
It gets information from
the neighboring pattern,

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.190
electrical pattern,
makes decision

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.470
to open and close them, and
lets through sodium ions

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.140
in one direction and potassium
ions in the other direction

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.570
with great fidelity and
almost no energy expenditure.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.240
Which is why all this can
happen with just a light bulb.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.500
And so that's one
great example of life

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.350
using a Maxwell
demon type of device

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.070
in this case in our heads.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.240
I want wrap this up by talking
about how did all this stuff

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.740
happen in the first place?

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.130
Well, Darwin famously gave
us a wonderful account

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.120
of how life had evolved over
billions of years on earth,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.570
but he refused to be drawn on
the origin of life, the problem

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.000
life's origin.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.072
Mere rubbish, he said.

00:32:45.072 --> 00:32:46.530
Thinking of this,
one might as well

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.020
think of the origin of matter.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.820
When I was a
student, the feeling

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.100
was very much
summed up by Crick,

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.560
"life seems almost
a miracle," he said.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.680
So many other conditions
for it to get going.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.190
This didn't stop some people
like Stanley Miller attempting

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.580
to cook up life in the
lab by, in this case,

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.510
putting some common gases
and sparking electricity

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.860
through them.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.660
This whole probiotic
synthesis enterprise

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.190
continues to this day.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.283
They've got a bit further,
but not very much.

00:33:19.283 --> 00:33:21.450
And I think there's an
absolutely fundamental reason

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.480
why we're not going to
solve the secret of life

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.240
by mixing stuff up
in a chemistry lab.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.190
And the answer I've
stated all along

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.940
is that life's
distinguishing feature

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.490
is the way it organizes
and manages information.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.790
And no greater example can
I give than the genetic code

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.090
itself.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.380
The information on your
DNA is coded information.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.780
It's got to be decoded
before it means anything,

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.060
before it has biological
functionality.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.630
And of course, what we'd like
to know is how did this come

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.310
to exist in the first place?

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:58.860
From some sort of molecular
milieu and random forces,

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.620
how did a genetic code arise?

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.850
How can molecules write code?

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.390
It's very deeply baffling.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.614
I think we're a long way
from understanding that.

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.239
But to truly finish,
I want to tell you

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:12.733
that it goes much beyond that.

00:34:12.733 --> 00:34:15.150
And so I'm going to finish on
a sort of lighthearted note,

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.179
but it's actually very profound.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:21.730
Which is that information in
biology goes beyond the gene.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.639
There's a whole field
called epigenetics

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.250
which recognizes that.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.570
But the particular epigeneticist
I like best, Mike Levin

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.719
at Tufts University.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:34.460
He's got the Allen
Discovery Center there,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.400
where he likes to work with
these worms called planaria.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.810
Teachers love these, because
they have a head and a tail,

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.310
even have a little
brain apparently.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.389
You see the eyes at one
end, tail at the other.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.560
The great thing is, if
you chop them in half,

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.710
then the tail makes a head
and the head makes a tail.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:52.469
And so children
love that, you see.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:53.960
There we go.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.362
You can get two of them.

00:34:55.362 --> 00:34:56.570
And you can go on doing this.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.840
You get more, and
more, and more of them.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.660
And I asked Mike, do
they ever have sex?

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.310
And he said, well, they do, but
they prefer to be chopped up.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.960
Now, what Mike can do is--

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.260
what is he's discovered is
that when you chop them,

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.457
chop through them, the
electric polarization

00:35:14.457 --> 00:35:16.040
across the membrane,
that's what I was

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.080
talking about with the axons--

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.070
all cells have that.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.445
They all have a potential
difference across the membrane.

00:35:21.445 --> 00:35:22.950
They pump protons
out to keep that--

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.570
that gets altered
around the wound.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.540
So there's an electrical
pattern there.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.730
Now, he can muck around
with that pattern

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:35.330
with drugs that sort of alter
the ionic concentration and so

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:35.980
on.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.550
And when he fiddles
around like that,

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:45.140
he can end up making two-headed
and two-tailed tailed worms.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.810
And again, I ask him, are the
two-tailed one's really stupid?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.102
And he said it doesn't seem
to make a lot of difference

00:35:50.102 --> 00:35:51.650
where they had a head or not.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.390
But, and this is the
mind blowing thing,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:57.470
if he chops up a two
headed worm into halves,

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.260
you might think that would
restore the original phenotype.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.660
But no, it makes two
two-headed worms,

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.480
and the same thing with
the two two-tailed worms.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.390
The point is, they've
got identical DNA.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.000
So a visitor from
Mars might think

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.400
these are different species,
but they've got identical DNA.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.750
So this is epigenetic
inheritance, it's often called.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.840
So this is a way
that the information

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.940
about the phenotype,
about the physical form,

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:27.297
is propagated from one to
the next, not in the genes.

00:36:27.297 --> 00:36:28.880
And we don't know
how it's propagated.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.672
We're working with him
to try to figure out

00:36:30.672 --> 00:36:33.740
where is that information being
stored and processed and passed

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.420
on.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.500
It raises this
entire question about

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.040
electrically encoded software
and bioelectric memory,

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.110
and where does it come from.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:48.860
A postscript to this is
that he took a lot of--

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.520
and his colleagues, he has
a large research group,

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.610
took a lot of these worms,
chopped the middles out

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.910
and sent all these middles
off to the space station.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:59.840
There it is.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.620
And when the middles came
back, about 15% of them

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.530
had two heads, you see.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.210
So they basically lost
the head down on Earth,

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.460
but came back with two.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.710
And this was much publicized
in the press a couple of years

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.210
ago.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.830
Here in Britain,
it was described

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:22.450
as two-headed flatworms stun
scientists, boffins baffled.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.650
Mike Levin has no
idea what a boffin is.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.350
I had to explain all this.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.070
But whenever boffins
get mentioned,

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.028
they're always baffled.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.970
So this takes us beyond the
gene to epigenetic control.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.850
Mechanical, electrical,
and gravitational effects

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:42.110
can all determine what genes
are switched on and off,

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.870
and therefore
informational patterns.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.980
And that leads us
to questions like,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.370
is there an electrical
code to go alongside it?

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.750
Can we use this
electrical leverage

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.810
to cure things like
cancer, or birth defects,

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.460
or repair tissues?

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.920
We came into this-- or
I came into this lecture

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.770
with quantum mechanics.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.940
And I would like to leave
it with quantum mechanics,

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.330
because I think that the
true answer to finding how

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.000
information couples to
matter in biological systems

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.510
will probably come
at the same interface

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:20.160
where we're into large molecules
that have quantum effects.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.720
But some people suspect
that these quantum effects

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.020
will become modified when
they're sufficiently large.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.530
And there's an entire field
of quantum biology struggling

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:35.120
to get out, where people are
conjecturing that if life

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.800
is so clever at
manipulating bits,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.440
can it manipulate
qubits as well?

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.070
And of course,
quantum computing,

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.340
Google is invested in that.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.850
This is a billion dollar
research, multibillion dollar

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.890
research project
around the world,

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.050
to build a quantum computer.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.440
And somehow I feel that
if quantum computing

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.040
is achievable, which
surprised me a great deal,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.980
if that was the first
human technology that

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.470
had never been found in nature.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.520
Everything else we've invented,
nature got there first.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.770
Is quantum computing
to be the exception?

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.020
I somehow don't think
so, and I somehow

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:16.490
think that quantum biology
and the convergence

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:21.410
of nanotechnology, chemistry,
physics, information theory,

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:24.500
in that realm, which
still lacks a name, that's

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.810
going to be the next
great frontier of physics.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.280
And that's my last
word on the subject.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.420
Thank you.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.090
AUDIENCE: You were talking
about information as fuel.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.670
Does that imply that
in Maxwell's demon

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.150
information is being destroyed?

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:50.890
PAUL DAVIES: Well, I did
explain that step but perhaps

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.590
rather quickly, that when
the register is cleared

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.720
to repeat the
cycle, that's where

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.620
the information is destroyed
and the entropy of the system

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.850
rises.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:06.070
So it's limited to basically
the storage capacity

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.620
of the demon's register.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.180
And so this entire field is
still not absolutely completely

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.820
worked out to
everybody's satisfaction.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.330
People say, well,
supposing you had

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.270
an infinite supply of
demons, or supposing

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:24.040
you stored that information
not in any energy

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.410
landscape but some
other physical variable?

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.570
Might there be some way
of getting around this?

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.270
It's all actively
under investigation,

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.730
but the key point is
that the information is

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.060
used to gain a thermodynamic
advantage to convert heat

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.313
into work, but in
a small amount,

00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:41.230
and that if you go on
doing that cumulatively,

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.572
sooner or later,
you have to erase

00:40:43.572 --> 00:40:45.280
the information in
the register, and then

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:49.690
you get back the entropy, you
get entropy disadvantage that

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.010
compensates you for the
gain that you've had.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:55.210
So it's not a free lunch,
but if the name of the game

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.900
is to play the margins of
thermodynamics on a nano scale,

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.660
then that's certainly
what life is doing.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.190
But I didn't have time.

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.510
Life is doing much
more than just

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.610
playing a thermodynamic game.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.490
It's also doing this
complex organization,

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.590
encoded information
management, and so on.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.530
And all of that has to come
in any true understanding

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.490
of the nature of life.

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:18.730
And so the game of
chess I skipped over

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.910
would have been, if I'd have had
time and attempt to explain how

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.490
I think we can
capture that concept

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:28.330
of functional or meaningful
information in a context,

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.870
in a new type of physical law,
which was what Schrodinger

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.550
was suggesting.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:35.880
It would be a sort of top
down law, in which the-- just

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.120
to give you the words, in
which the dynamical update

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:44.080
rules, if you like the
evolution of the system,

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.138
will be a function of
the state of the system,

00:41:46.138 --> 00:41:47.680
quite unlike any
law of physics we've

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.420
had so far, where
the laws are fixed,

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.200
the states change with time.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.040
We're advocating that the laws
are a function of the state,

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.520
and that gives whole new
pathways to complexity.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.420
And we've done some computer
models to bolster that claim.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.320
So that's why I think the new
type of physical law comes in,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.140
but this is still
a work in progress.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.813
AUDIENCE: Do you think physics
can explain consciousness?

00:42:11.813 --> 00:42:13.730
PAUL DAVIES: Ah, well,
there's a whole chapter

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.460
of the book on consciousness.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.740
Thank you for mentioning that.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.910
I, for most of my life,
have been a cosmologist.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:24.710
And so I've been interested
in the origin of the universe.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.770
And then, as is
obvious, more recently,

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.420
I've become interested
in the origin of life.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.930
And I like to say there are
really three great origin

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.790
problems-- the universe, the
life, and then consciousness.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.790
I think we've cracked the
problem, more or less,

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:38.040
of the origin of the universe.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.290
That's the easy one.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.430
The origin of life
is very tough,

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.210
but I think we're on the case.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.980
The origin of
consciousness, we don't even

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.200
know how to frame that.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.410
However, that hasn't stopped
me writing a chapter about it.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.730
This is a chapter in
which I, more or less,

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.948
outline what all the problems
are rather than come up

00:42:56.948 --> 00:42:57.740
with the solutions.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.200
But there is one
thing that I warm to,

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.812
and it's part of this
power of information.

00:43:02.812 --> 00:43:03.520
There's a whole--

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.530
I should say not just
biological networks,

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:08.180
network of researchers,
who like these things.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.240
And one of these
is Giulio Tunoni.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.340
He's a neuroscientist, and
he's defined something called

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.110
"integrated information."

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.240
And so it's often
said that the whole

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.150
is greater than the sum of
its parts, and never more so

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.330
than for consciousness.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:28.510
And this is a way of attempting
to mathematize that feeling

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.880
that the collective
system has greater

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.740
power than the components.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.500
And he can demonstrate that
for certain types of networks

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.460
with certain types
of feedback loops.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.760
So in principle, if you
believe his definition, which

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.988
very few people do,
but it's a heroic try,

00:43:42.988 --> 00:43:45.280
you'll be able to say, well,
is a thermostat conscious?

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.038
That's a famous conundrum.

00:43:48.038 --> 00:43:49.330
You know, is a radio conscious?

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.260
Is an ant conscious?

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.860
And he could give an answer.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.710
He actually has a way of
defining a consciousness meter.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.910
Not just a life meter,
a consciousness meter.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:02.130
And it all depends
on the architecture,

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.760
the informational
architecture in the network.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.860
So that's something
that I do describe.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.700
And I should probably
say at this stage,

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:13.510
having mentioned that there
is a network of collaborators,

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.840
almost everything that I
write in my book originates

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.420
with my young
collaborator, Sarah

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.680
Walker, and our magnificent
group of students and postdocs.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.210
And Sarah is so
gracious, she said,

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:32.230
but everything I tell you I got
from you in the first place.

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:35.110
But she is very smart, and
so a lot of these ideas

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.020
are actually hers.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.850
AUDIENCE: In the
last few years, I've

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:41.600
been hearing about the free
energy principle, which

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.790
tries to define life as being
something that can mirror

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.160
its environment, and coming
up with a definition of life

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.800
as a system that's capable
of mirroring its environment.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.550
And I was wondering
if you'd heard of this

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:55.457
and what your
thoughts are on it.

00:44:55.457 --> 00:44:57.540
PAUL DAVIES: So is this
the work of Jeremy England

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.650
you're referring to?

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.490
AUDIENCE: Yes, I am.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:02.980
PAUL DAVIES: Yes, and his stuff
does get a bit of a mention

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.480
here.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.820
Not as big a mention
as in Dan Brown's book,

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.260
but he certainly gets a mention.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.568
And it's connected.

00:45:11.568 --> 00:45:13.110
I mean, it's this
whole point about--

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.090
these pathways are often
very complex in biology,

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:22.650
of going from here to
here, and how much--

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:26.070
So I should just get
technical for a moment.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.010
The word "free energy" has
a very specific meaning

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:29.820
to a physicist.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.530
It doesn't mean it's
energy for free.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.510
I mean, "it's available
energy" is probably

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.830
a better way of looking at it.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.140
And the F that appeared
in that equation

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.180
I showed that had
the [? I ?] term,

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.820
that is that the free energy.

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:44.070
And information has
to come into that.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.802
And so it is very much
connected with the same thing.

00:45:47.802 --> 00:45:50.010
There's something called
[? Yashinski's ?] inequality

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.300
that goes into this.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.020
And in the book, you will see
[? Yashinski's ?] contraction

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.370
that can turn
information into work,

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:59.190
and it looks like
a child's mobile.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.330
It's a thought experiment.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.533
But as I say, these things--
not that particular one,

00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:05.450
but these sorts of things
have been built now.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.228
This is part of technology.

00:46:07.228 --> 00:46:09.270
AUDIENCE: So I just have
a clarificatory question

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:10.950
regarding the Maxwell demon.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.630
So I think I don't
understand why

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.200
the demon's information
content, as it does its job,

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.970
is going up.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.670
You know, I would have imagined
that the demon just decides

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:22.902
on a certain speed threshold--

00:46:22.902 --> 00:46:23.610
PAUL DAVIES: Yes.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:25.027
AUDIENCE: --In the
direction, then

00:46:25.027 --> 00:46:29.030
lets every molecule approaching
it at a faster speed than that

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.560
through.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.140
So it just has one
bit of information

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.753
that it is maintaining.

00:46:32.753 --> 00:46:34.170
PAUL DAVIES: Ah,
no, but the demon

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:38.040
has to be able to
observe and assess

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.630
the speeds of those molecules.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:43.420
And then is this one
coming fast enough?

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.290
And then yes, open the shutter.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:50.310
You see, so the person who
analyzed this in great detail

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:55.530
in the 1920s, Leo Szilard,
he simplified everything

00:46:55.530 --> 00:47:00.900
and had a single molecule in
a box with a movable screen.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.310
It's called Szilard's Engine.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.590
It's much discussed in my book.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:09.272
And the demon would then ask
the question "is the molecule

00:47:09.272 --> 00:47:10.480
on the right or on the left?"

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.590
And then insert the screen
and extract the work.

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.620
But then in order to
repeat that cycle,

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:19.200
it would have to eliminate the
information from its register

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.220
or accumulate it.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.820
And then if it accumulates,
if it's a finite register,

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.400
then eventually all this
would grind to a halt.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.035
But I mean, you're right
to say, well, you know,

00:47:30.035 --> 00:47:31.410
what about this,
what about that?

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:35.100
Because this is still a
subject which is picked over.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.440
So Charles Bennett,
who in my view

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.950
settled it to my satisfaction,
has his detractors that say,

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:44.370
but what about if you did
this, and supposing that?

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:49.650
But I think overall, the key
message is that it's not the--

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:52.492
Szilard thought it was
the act of acquisition

00:47:52.492 --> 00:47:54.450
of the information, that
in order for the demon

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:56.240
to know what the
molecules were doing

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.033
would have to expend energy.

00:47:58.033 --> 00:47:59.700
And that energy would
raise the entropy,

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.470
and that's where
the books balance.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.980
It wasn't at that stage.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.100
It's at the clearing
of the register stage.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.930
So it really is--

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.570
this is where thermodynamics
and computing really

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:10.890
do mesh together.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.130
Because it's not the
physics of sensing.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:17.050
It's the physics of computation
that saves the second law.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.050
So there's very,
very deep connection

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:23.070
between the world of computing
and life, which I think

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.830
is sort of increasingly
obvious to everybody.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.260
Here we see it boiled
down to it's essentials

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.200
in Szilard's Engine and
Bennett's resolution

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.372
of the demon paradox.

00:48:33.372 --> 00:48:35.330
AUDIENCE: Maybe I will
have another crack at it

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:39.750
another direction on the
topic of consciousness.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.930
If we can kind of
unify everything

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:44.830
into physics about
biology, the information,

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.090
what does it say about free
will of the individual?

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:51.450
PAUL DAVIES: Right, you've
raised a vast subject,

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:51.950
of course.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.180
And I could stand here for
a very long time talking

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.070
about free will.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:57.100
I can't do that.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.320
I have no choice.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.310
I have to go off and
do another event.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.010
But just very briefly, and
of course I do allude to it

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:10.455
in the book, let me
just cut to the chase

00:49:10.455 --> 00:49:12.320
and tell you my own
position on free will.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.510
Free will, I think, is
a feeling that we have.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.200
More to the point, and
this comes out in the book,

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:23.010
that free will is closely
connected to our sense

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.610
that time is flowing.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.870
Now, a physicist will
tell you time can't flow.

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.560
That's an illusion, but it's
a necessary illusion for us

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.800
to live our lives.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.440
We live our lives
as if time flows.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.376
It doesn't flow.

00:49:36.376 --> 00:49:38.590
There are simply intervals
between events and states

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:39.980
of your brain.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.910
So I think that the
illusion of the flow of time

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.690
is because we convince
ourselves that we have--

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:50.040
I have to use the word, we
have selves, conserved selves,

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.983
that I'm the same self as
I had when I was a child.

00:49:53.983 --> 00:49:55.900
In other words, that the
self stays unchanged,

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.950
and the world changes around us.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:59.950
That gives us an impression
of the flow of time.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:02.200
I think that's back to front.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.770
I think the world
doesn't change.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:06.280
There are simply
successive states.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.540
Time isn't flowing, but
at each successive moment,

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.110
you're a slightly different
self from what you were before.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.290
So a lot of mutual information
between today's self

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.910
and yesterday's self,
but it is different.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.180
You're a different person today
from what you were yesterday.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.540
So I think our sense of
freedom has to do with getting

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.430
that back to front.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:25.510
Anyway, read the book.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:32.650
AUDIENCE: On the last slide on
quantum computation and quantum

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:38.590
biology and the link, are any
proposals for a physical system

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:42.970
that, inside biology, could
do useful quantum computation

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.070
in the sense that
how will a qubit

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:47.470
or coherence of a qubit
or a a bunch of qubits

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.540
be maintained in a--

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.900
temperature, moisture, etc.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.130
PAUL DAVIES: Right No,
no, that's all right.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.380
So first of all, that's the
biggest subject in quantum

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.450
biology generally.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.900
Can biology deploy
any quantum effects

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.790
involving things
like entanglement

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:02.200
and tunneling and so on?

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.170
The answer to that is,
almost certainly yes.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:08.920
And I give four examples in that
particular chapter in the book,

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.770
while having to do
with in photosynthesis

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.950
the transfer of energy
from the light harvesting

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:18.260
center to the chemical
reaction center.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.990
Now that has to do
with bird navigation,

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:24.890
extraordinary thing,
olfactory response of flies,

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.740
and some other things in there.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.810
The one that really strikes me,
because my colleagues at ASU

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.780
are doing experiments,
is the way

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.140
that electron tunneling
through organic molecules

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.090
can be dramatically different
according to the sequence,

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.810
say, if it's a protein,
the nucleotide sequence.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.720
A colleague of mine said,
change one amino acid,

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.220
and it's like an on/off switch.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:49.000
So it looks like
biology has fine tuned,

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.660
by natural selection, fine
tuned these organically

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.890
functional molecules to have
special quantum tunneling

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:56.390
properties.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.890
So I think there's
very little doubt

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.600
that quantum mechanics is
playing a role in biology.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.910
What's not clear is
whether this is just

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:07.960
a few quirky little
things that life

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.880
has stumbled across
and taken advantage of,

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.940
or whether it's the tip
of a quantum iceberg.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.560
But your question
specifically was,

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.620
can there be qubit processing?

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.880
There was a claim by
Apoorva Patel from India

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.610
that that indeed
was taking place,

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.300
that it was actually Grover's
Algorithm being implemented

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.980
in the genetic code.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:33.092
He's backed away from that
claim in recent years.

00:52:33.092 --> 00:52:34.300
So it was a sort of nice try.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.040
It gained a lot of attention.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:36.890
I agree with you.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.348
In that warm, wet
environment, it's

00:52:38.348 --> 00:52:42.257
very hard to see how decoherence
wouldn't kill this stone dead.

00:52:42.257 --> 00:52:44.590
But that would also be true
of some of the other quantum

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:45.170
effects.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.770
And again, there's
a lot of work being

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:51.580
done to see how the
quantum processes could

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.850
be screened, could screen
out the environmental noise,

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.170
and so on.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:58.210
And so it could be
that biology has

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.190
got a trick or two
to teach people

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:01.610
working in quantum computing.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:02.985
There's certainly
some people who

00:53:02.985 --> 00:53:05.960
do work in quantum computing
who are aware of this.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.770
But this is all very
much the cutting edge.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:10.850
I think we'll find out
in the coming years.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.850
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very
much for coming, Paul.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:15.175
That was thoroughly,
thoroughly enjoyable.

00:53:15.175 --> 00:53:17.802
Yeah, thank you very
much, Paul Davies.

00:53:17.802 --> 00:53:19.010
PAUL DAVIES: OK, my pleasure.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:22.060
[APPLAUSE]
