00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.440
WILLIAM MOUGAYAR: Thanks,
David, and hi, everybody.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.540
And thanks very
much for inviting

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.630
me to talk to you
about the blockchain,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.580
arguably one of the most
innovative technologies

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.540
since the internet in terms
of impact, scope, potential

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.220
benefits.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.160
And if you look back over
the last 20, 22 years

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.930
and you think about
what the internet did

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.830
for us-- for our businesses,
our societies, our cities,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.800
our world-- and then you
can imagine this new force

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.300
that is coming on the
horizon, and that is really

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.590
the blockchain.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.220
And that's the impact
that we are expecting

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.280
in terms of the magnitude
of the potential benefits

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.810
of the blockchain.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.690
So it's kind of strange that I'm
speaking about the blockchain

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.030
at Google here.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.210
It kind of reminds
me a little bit--

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.880
this is like talking about
e-commerce to Walmart in 1995

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.540
before online
retail was popular,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.480
whereas Amazon had been
already founded a year before.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.620
And I'm saying this
because visibly,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.810
there doesn't seem to be
anything that Google has said.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.780
Or maybe you're doing something
that we don't know about.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.250
And actually, I was
in Paris last month

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.810
speaking at a conference,
OuiShare Conference.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.530
And specifically,
one of the questions

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.890
was, how come we don't hear
from some of the big players,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.260
like Google, Facebook, Amazon?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.040
They don't have any visible
involvements with a blockchain.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.030
And they asked me why.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.130
I said, I'm not sure yet,
but I was invited at Google

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.760
to talk next month.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.260
And at least that's a good step.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.240
So we'll see what happens.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.220
So the blockchain
novelty started really

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.420
as a melding for the
first time of the three

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.700
fields of software,
engineering, cryptography

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.390
science, and gaming theory.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.280
And this all started with
the paper, the famous paper

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.640
that Satoshi Nakamoto has
written in 2009, where really,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.690
all he described was a
peer-to-peer system for sending

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.600
money.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.200
So he described an
electronic money system

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.930
that allows cash to be
sent from one person

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.780
to another without the
presence of any intermediaries

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.830
in the middle.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.210
So that is really the essence
of the bitcoin innovation

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.240
which started in 2009
as a white paper, which

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.750
was then implemented after all.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.960
So this is very important.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.240
It's a fundamental element.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.050
If you understand that, then
you understand all the benefits

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.440
and the potential implications
of the blockchain.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.680
So you might think, well, what's
the big deal about sending

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.560
electronic cash from
one person to another

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.220
without the presence
of intermediaries.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.430
Because you might be
thinking, well, the banks

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.800
are allowing us to do that.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.070
But here is the difference.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.190
The banks really are doing this
because they have databases.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.400
So suppose I deposit
$1,000 in my bank account.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.656
All they are doing is updating
a record, updating the database,

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.530
and there is a record
that points to the fact

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.610
that I have the $1,000.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.700
And if I want to send,
let's say, $10 to David,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.760
then the two databases are going
to synchronize with each other,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.230
and they'll take
$10 from my account,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.370
and they'll put that
$10 in David's account

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.570
or in your account.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.360
But really, what
this transaction

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.130
is all about is about
updating two databases.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.020
And hopefully they
are synchronized

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.530
so that when the $10
leaves my account,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.130
then I don't have it
anymore, and David has it.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.590
Unlike the fact that if I took
a picture with my smartphone

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.030
and I sent it to somebody
here in the audience,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.750
I still have a copy.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.240
But with money, obviously,
we cannot do that.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.070
And this is what is called
the double spend problem.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.650
And what bitcoin as an
innovation and the blockchain

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.750
technology behind it
did-- for the first time,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.110
it solved that
double spend problem

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.910
without somebody in the middle.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.230
And that is really
the innovation,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.750
is without somebody
in the middle.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.040
That is so key and so important.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.080
Because it is supposed to do
that, to allow us to do that,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.480
without the banks
being in the middle.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.250
So then we evolve this thinking.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.300
And we said, well, this
is just something digital.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.260
When we're sending money,
it's a digital token.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.270
So we thought, well,
why not send anything

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.800
that's a digital asset?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.490
Because if I can
send money so quickly

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.430
from one person
to another, so why

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:14.690
don't we send bonds, financial
instruments, ownerships,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.930
titles, licenses?

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.210
Whatever has a digital
form now can be sent,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.150
because it has digital value.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.745
So now the blockchain
becomes a rail.

00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:28.100
It becomes a new
rail, a new kind

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.720
of internet in terms of
passing not just money,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.530
but passing any digital asset.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.961
And that is really the
future of the blockchain.

00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:40.460
Some people have called it the
internet of value, because we

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.400
are now sending value between
us, each other, peer to peer,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.880
without having anybody in
the middle, not just money.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.830
And then we said, well, how
about if we program this money?

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.400
Because really, it is
programmable money.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.180
Now, it's all based on software,
so we can program the money.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.040
And how about we add some logic
to how we program the money?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.000
So then we said, OK.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.140
Let's program some business
logic-- if this, then that,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.920
and these kinds of scenarios.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.390
And this is where
what is commonly

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.690
referred to now as smart
contracts is coming along.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.600
So smart contracts
is just another way

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.580
of saying it's business
logic that is often

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.900
tied in with contractual
terms that often has money

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.390
in the middle changing hands--
if this, then that, and then

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.760
the money changes hands.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.150
So this is really the
essence of the blockchain

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.029
as a starting point.

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:39.070
Now, there are other ways
to view the blockchain.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.540
And I like to always
describe the blockchain

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.980
in three different ways-- a
business way, a technical way,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.410
and a legal way.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.330
And we can have three
different definitions

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.660
about the blockchain
specifically.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.420
If you look at it from
a business perspective,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.680
you think of as an
exchange network

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.900
for moving value between peers.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.550
If you look at it from
a technical perspective,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.980
you would think of it- it's
like another kind of a database.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.870
It maintains a distributed
ledger that is open.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.980
Anybody can check.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.350
And thirdly, because it
has legal implications,

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.040
you have to look at it from
a legal perspective as well,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.720
because it's a transaction
validation mechanism

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.690
without anybody in the middle.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.810
So when these transactions
are actually validated,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.420
then they hold.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.250
They are true, and
they are respected,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.909
and that is a
legal aspect of it.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.890
So really, you want to
think of the blockchain

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.380
as a combination of
business, technical,

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.304
and legal innovation.

00:08:42.304 --> 00:08:43.970
And only when you
have the three of them

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.760
together that you really
have the true power

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.080
of the innovation.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.810
And I'm saying this-- it's
a very important aspect.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.720
Why?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.760
Let's look at what the banks
are doing, for example, when

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.566
they are implementing
the blockchain.

00:08:57.566 --> 00:08:59.690
We cannot talk about the
blockchain without talking

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.300
about what the banks are doing.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.150
There's lots of activity
within the financial system

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.900
right now, because it is
about money, after all.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.390
So what the banks do is
they look at the blockchain

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.995
and they say, well,
the banks, as you know,

00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:13.590
are very much regulated.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.260
So their starting
point is regulation.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.110
So they start by saying,
well, we are regulated.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.220
We're not going to
touch regulation.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.590
We wanted to live within our
own regulatory environment.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.029
So let's not touch that.

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:27.570
And then they look
at their business,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.176
and they say, well, we've been
in business for 100 years.

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.950
The customers trust us.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.610
We're not going to change
our business model.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.980
So they strike out
the legal innovation.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.289
They strike out the
business model innovation.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:41.830
What is left?

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.996
Technology.

00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:44.620
And then when you
implement technology,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.910
then it starts to look like
just another IT project.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.470
Yes, it's going to
maybe allow you to have

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.210
some processes that are faster.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.887
You may be able to
save some money.

00:09:57.887 --> 00:09:59.720
But really, what you're
doing if you're just

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.270
looking at it as a
technology is you

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.770
are just implementing
something without a database,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.790
and you're having the
blockchain there in the middle

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.910
replacing some parts
of the database.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.130
Because the blockchain
maintains its own ledger.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.820
It doesn't need, necessarily,
a database, two databses

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.920
to reconcile a transaction.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.520
It is only one ledger that
everybody has if you want.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.020
So that is really
the innovation.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.390
Again, remember, the
old way was one database

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.580
talking to another, so
we need two databases

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.400
and we need two
owners, one for each.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.444
Whereas the blockchain
is only one ledger.

00:10:35.444 --> 00:10:37.110
And once you write a
line on the ledger,

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.840
it's just like any
accounting ledger.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.720
You cannot erase
the line above it.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.080
You just write a new
line, and then you

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.520
have a chain of history.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.470
And everything is recorded,
and nothing can be erased.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:55.130
And the only owner of the
ledger is the blockchain itself.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.227
So the network
self-polices itself

00:10:58.227 --> 00:10:59.560
in terms of updating everything.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.190
And that is really a
very important aspect.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.580
So unfortunately,
some of the banks

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.050
have a lot of activities
going on right now,

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.780
but they are really looking
at it as a technology

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.280
and not really innovating.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.470
But you have to think of
the innovation potential

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.260
beyond just the technology.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.730
I like to describe the
blockchain in terms

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.590
of its many facets
in the same way

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.279
as the internet today
has many facets.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:27.070
And if I ask each and
every one of you what

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.370
does the internet
mean to you, depending

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.490
on what your focus is, you might
see it as a publishing platform

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.160
if you are very
much into blogging.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.970
Or you might see it as
an e-commerce platform

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.160
if you are selling
or buying something.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.146
You might see it as a
development platform

00:11:42.146 --> 00:11:43.520
if you are a
developer developing

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.530
some kind of web application.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.840
You might see it as a
social media platform

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.400
if you are just focused on that.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.430
So everybody started to
have their own version

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.170
of what the internet is.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.550
Because the narrative over
the internet was so strong.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.100
Well, the blockchain, we're
still in the early days.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.910
But the narrative
of the blockchain

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.840
is very strong as well.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.960
And I like to describe it
in many different ways.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.580
It's like 10 different things.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.320
It is not just a
cryptocurrency, although that

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.210
is a prevalent thing that
everybody thinks about first.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.180
If you're a consumer, if I
say blockchain or bitcoin,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.250
you going to think
cryptocurrency.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.990
And if you're a
business-- specifically

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.320
a bank-- if I say
blockchain, you're

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.050
going to think
distributed ledger.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:26.760
These are fine.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.290
These are good definitions.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.040
And yes, it is cryptocurrency.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.680
Yes, it is distributed ledger.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.290
But it is more than that.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.150
It is a computing
infrastructure.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.040
The bitcoin blockchain
has about 6,000 nodes,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.260
computers around the world.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.070
The Ethereum blockchain also
has about 6,000 computers

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.840
in the world.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.180
So it's already out there.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.430
It's in the wild.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.650
It's almost like having a thin
layer of cloud-based computers

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.420
all networked together.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.410
It is also a
transactional platform,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.480
because we can
validate transactions.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.550
It is also a
decentralized database,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.990
because you can store
information on the ledger.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.567
And the ledger could have
many different usages.

00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:10.900
Yes, it is a distributed ledger.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.775
We talked about that.

00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:14.490
It is a development platform.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.900
Arguably, it is the next
development platform

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.030
after the web.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.600
Today, web applications
are very prevalent.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.990
Obviously, everything is
on the web more or less.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.160
And we have close to 10 million
Java, JavaScript developers

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.280
in the world.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.050
Java was an
incredible advancement

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.250
when the web arrived.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.170
As a comparison--
I'm not sure how many

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.880
would want to
guess-- do you know

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.690
how many blockchain developers
do we have today in the world?

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.680
Approximately about 5,000 only.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.510
So compare that-- 5,000
blockchain developers,

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.766
10 million Java web
developers at least.

00:13:49.766 --> 00:13:51.140
So this is where
we are, and this

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.290
is where we need to
be in terms of being

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.030
able to have blockchain
applications everywhere.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.480
It is open source software.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.310
All the innovation, whether it's
Ethereum, whether it's bitcoin,

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.170
or other blockchain out there,
it's open source innovation,

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.420
so it means there
are many contributors

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.000
and many developers around
the world that add to it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.460
It is also a financial
services marketplace,

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:19.330
because now we can buy and sell
and transfer value and assets.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.580
The capital markets is very
interested in the blockchain,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.720
because they can speed up the
clearing to settlement time

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.680
frame.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.930
And then it's obviously
a peer-to-peer network

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.130
from a technological
perspective.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.310
And it's also a
trust services layer.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.410
And I'll talk about
some of the services

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.680
that we will expect to see
on this new layer, which

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.820
is called the blockchain.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.850
If you look at it from an
applications perspective,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.460
you want to think
of the blockchain

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.950
as being at par with the web.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.930
So if you think about it,
the internet came first.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.960
And then the web came after.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.770
And the web was a protocol that
sat on top of the internet.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.310
And the blockchain
and the blockchains

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:11.130
are another protocol that
sit as well on the internet.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.760
So technically speaking, you can
write a blockchain application

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.530
without needing the web.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.416
You just write the application
straight on the internet.

00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:24.020
And I'll give you some examples
of that in a few minutes.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.200
So technically, the web is
not needed for the blockchain.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.880
However, what is happening--
we have a reality.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.180
We are users of many
web applications.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.430
So the reality will be that
we're going to have a mix.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.420
We're going to have some
pure native blockchain

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.360
applications that just go
straight on the internet,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.760
and we're going to have
some hybrid ones that

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.470
maybe have a foot on the web
and a foot on the blockchain.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.330
So it might take
data from the web

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.370
and take some data
from the blockchain

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.020
and put it all together.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.270
And then since we have
public and private networks,

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.040
as a matter of
fact-- for example,

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.450
the financial
networks are private,

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.750
so we can expect
to have variations

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.100
of native and hybrid
block chain applications,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.730
both in public settings
and in private settings.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.530
So think about it that way
in terms of going forward.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.610
Some quick basic concepts
to just make sure

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.140
that we all understand
them-- these

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.010
are the basic tenets
of the blockchain.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.900
Number one is the concept
of smart property.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.670
And a smart property is
just a thing or an asset

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.270
that knows who its
owner is, really.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.240
So now if the stock
knows who the owner is,

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.040
then you can trade
it peer to peer.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.340
It knows when its
ownership has changed.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.500
So that is an element.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.750
That's what we call
smart property as part

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.440
of the blockchain concept.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.380
Time stamping is a
very important element.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.821
Because once you time stamp
something on the blockchain,

00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:50.320
that's it.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.620
It's immutable.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.894
You cannot change it.

00:16:52.894 --> 00:16:54.560
So think about the
implications in terms

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.820
of proving the
existence of something

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.470
or proving that
something happened

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.960
at that particular time.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:10.440
You can say that-- you can check
the time of a particular event

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.849
or a particular
validation of something.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.579
So this has enormous
implications as far

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.020
as the services that
can be mounted on top

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.329
of this time stamping element.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.670
It's a very important
aspect of blockchains.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.430
Thirdly, multi-signature
transactions--

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.310
and if you think about it as
an-- the equivalent today is

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.850
like when you sign
a document, there

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.470
are some documents sometimes
that require three signatures,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.770
let's say, not just two or one.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.690
And it is that, really, but
applied on the online world

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:45.160
and applied with encryption
in a way that is validated.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.820
So when there are
three signatures,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.290
let's say, on a particular
piece of transaction,

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.180
where maybe there are some
rules that say if this, then

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.744
that-- if we have
three signatures,

00:17:54.744 --> 00:17:56.910
then you can do this, or
if you have two signatures,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.220
then you can do that-- then
that's a powerful element.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.410
So we don't have to do
this with a paper anymore.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.850
But now imagine if there
is contracts behind it,

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.080
if there is money
changing hands,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.900
if somebody verifies something,
and two other signatures

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.370
go on top of it, and then money
gets transferred right away.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.950
So that's a powerful concept.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.590
Smart contracts--
I mentioned that.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.400
That is a very basic
tenet of the blockchain.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.580
It's really about programming
logic, business logic

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.420
with money, with
rights, with contracts,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.110
with values changing hands.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.690
Oracles is a new concept.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.740
Oracles are like
information sources

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.220
that the smart contracts
could be using.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.140
For example, there could be
an oracle about the weather

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.597
with weather data.

00:18:42.597 --> 00:18:44.680
So I could write a smart
contract that says, well,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.020
if the temperature is over 90
Fahrenheit, then open the door

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.370
or start the AC.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.740
This all could be programmed.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.040
Or pay me $10.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.840
Or there could be an oracle
that's tracking NBA scores.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.065
And if I have a wager
between me and somebody else,

00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:01.940
automatically it's going
to check the scores,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.860
and whoever wins,
then the money will

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:09.920
be transferred automatically,
all invisibly by just putting

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.320
the rules in, and as
soon as the game is over,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.400
then the money is transferred.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.360
And the concept of state
machine is important.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.450
Because really, blockchain
are really a state machine.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:24.310
That's what it is-- state
being it's either this

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.760
or it's either that.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.730
But it maintains these multiple
states very efficiently.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.670
And it's been said
that-- people will ask,

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.160
what is the blockchain for?

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.060
And you have to
think of the fact

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.300
that not everything
is for blockchain.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.330
It is not a replacement
for databases.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.270
It is an enhancement.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.834
It has its own uses.

00:19:44.834 --> 00:19:46.500
And one way to answer
this question very

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.510
simply is by saying if you
can do it on a spreadsheet,

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.880
then don't use a block chain.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.850
Because it's really about
tracking states of information.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.570
And that's really the
concept of blockchain

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.950
being virtual state machines.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.020
Now let's talk about the
banks for a little bit

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.970
and what's happened in
financial technology,

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.020
otherwise called
fintech, and how it is

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.150
going to relate to blockchain.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.910
So if you think about
what happened with fintech

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:23.240
and the banks, arguably fintech
was a response to the fact

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.000
that the banks, for the first
10 years of the internet,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.340
did not do too much, really,
in terms of innovation.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.310
What did the banks bring us in
terms of when the internet came

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.670
along after 10 years?

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.420
We have online banking.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.590
We have online brokerage, so
we can buy and sell stocks.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.720
And we can pay some
bills on the internet.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.200
So OK, we're
licking less stamps.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.340
That's good.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.050
And then if some of you
have some advanced features

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.100
depending on the
bank, now some of them

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.510
allow you to take
an image of a check

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.650
and deposit it there
without visiting an ATM

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.230
or going to a branch.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.520
And then my question
is, why are there

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.880
the same number of
branches as we had before?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.200
Why do we still
have so many ATMs

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.620
if the internet was
supposed to really

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.236
be that innovation platform?

00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:17.610
So the banks did
not do too much.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.110
They did the strict minimum.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.290
As a result, as a response,
a bunch of fintech companies

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.440
started to spring up.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.320
And the most famous
of them is PayPal.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.840
PayPal exploited the payment
aspect of the internet

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.550
and what it allowed, and now
PayPal is a huge company.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.850
Alipay in China is
bigger than Paypal,

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.640
and they are doing
the same thing.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.550
There are companies
that let you get loans.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.950
I can get a loan of $20,000
to $30,000 in three minutes

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.110
just by checking-- they
check my profile quickly.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.620
And I would challenge you to
go and sit, go talk to a bank,

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.391
and get a loan in three minutes.

00:21:57.391 --> 00:21:59.640
You won't make it through--
it will take you that long

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.310
to enter the bank
branch, perhaps,

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.780
and get an appointment.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.780
And some companies now are
using robo investments,

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.170
like wealth simple, wealth
[INAUDIBLE], and so on.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.260
So the point here is
that a lot of companies

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.940
exploited the technology
of the internet

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.110
in ways that the
banks could not.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.290
And the same thing is going
to happen with the blockchain.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.150
And all these startups
start small so they

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.440
don't bother the banks
too much, and then they

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.030
get big before you know it.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.010
And the same thing is going
to happen with the blockchain.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:38.410
These are 300 or so companies,
blockchain companies

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.680
in the financial services only.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.950
I made that landscape
a few months ago,

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.030
and I update it continuously.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.000
So basically, if you're not on
this chart, you don't exist.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.640
That is the landscape
of blockchain companies

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.960
in the financial services.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.050
And yes, many of them are
small and many of them

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.480
will not make it.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.380
But some of them will make it.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.590
And some of them
are going to emerge.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.650
So really, in terms of looking
back and looking forward,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.426
where are we in terms of phases?

00:23:11.426 --> 00:23:13.300
We are really at the
beginning of a new phase

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.750
here, perhaps lasting 10 years,
perhaps lasting 20 years.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.770
And the last 20 years of
the internet-- and what

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.610
gave birth to big
companies like Google

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:28.500
and others-- were really
about publishing information,

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.140
personal communications,
e-commerce,

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.970
and social interactions.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.480
And now we can say that
the new phase is really

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.410
the blockchain promise now.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.320
It's really about the
decentralization of trust.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.990
Because trust can
happen between peers

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.670
without anybody in the middle.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.770
And that value can flow.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:47.830
It's not just money.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.290
It's any kind of digital value.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.380
So that is the next 10
years, the next 20 years.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.982
And I'm not wanting
to hype this.

00:23:54.982 --> 00:23:56.440
I'm not saying it's
going to happen

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.440
next month or the next six
months or the next year.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.560
This is a long term phenomenon.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.240
And I would caution
anybody to want

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.120
to rush what we can
do with the blockchain

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.310
and to hype expectations.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:17.350
Because some of you that
were around and involved

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.910
with the internet
back in '99 and 2000,

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.230
what crashed the internet in
2000 is that we rushed it.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.540
Some people wanted to rush it.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.373
They wanted everything
to happen right away.

00:24:26.373 --> 00:24:28.470
They wanted public companies
to go become public

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.560
without even having revenues,
without proving their business

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.430
models.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.360
VCs were pouring money
without checking things,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.170
and the whole thing crashed.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.880
Arguably, maybe we
could not avoid it.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.570
Because Carlota Perez has
this paradigm shift model

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.680
she analyzed.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.220
She's a big thinker
that analyzes

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.130
the technological cycles.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.820
And she figured out that
for the last 100 years,

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.210
there are two phases when
new technology happens.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.620
There is the installation
phase and there

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.510
is the deployment phase.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.977
So we install the technology
first, and then we deploy it.

00:25:00.977 --> 00:25:03.060
And you know what happens
between the installation

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.190
phase and the deployment?

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.130
A crash happens.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.720
There's always a
correction that happens,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.830
and then everything
moves up again.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.980
And that's what happened
with the internet in 2000,

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.150
and then everything
went fine after that.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.869
So I'm not sure
where we are, when

00:25:17.869 --> 00:25:19.160
we're going to have that crash.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.326
But we're still in the early
days of the blockchain.

00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:23.750
So we are definitely going
to crash it at some point.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.610
Because we are pushing the
envelope in certain things.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.310
Like some of you have
heard of the DAO,

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.410
the D-A-O, Decentralized
Autonomous Organization

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.980
hack that happened
last month where

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.430
a hacker siphoned some funds.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.420
And there's a long
story behind it.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.730
But we were pushing
the envelope.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.800
And now we're learning a
lot from what happened,

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.900
and then we go
forward afterwards.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.880
Here's an easy way to
remember the main aspects

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.450
of the blockchain.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:58.020
I came up with this acronym
ATOMIC, A-T-O-M-I-C.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.280
It's really about assets.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.470
It's about trust.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.780
It's about ownership.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.950
It's about money.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.500
It's about identity.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.990
It's about contracts.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.920
Identity is going to be
a very important aspect

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.090
of the blockchain.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.798
Because right now, if
you think about it,

00:26:12.798 --> 00:26:14.570
who owns our identity online?

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.750
If you're on Facebook,
Facebook owns your identity,

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.750
because you are using Facebook.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.890
And in some cases,
Google owns my identity,

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.190
because I use Google to sign
on everywhere in other things.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.170
But potentially, identity
could be decentralized as well.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.560
But identity has to come
in with applications.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.120
It's like having a passport.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.500
What good is a passport
if you don't travel?

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.480
It sits in your drawer.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.660
It's useless.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.920
So the identiy-- e-identity
or blockchain-based identity

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.850
need applications as well.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.040
The travel is the
application for the passport,

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.920
and the airport are part of it.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.010
And applications are
an important aspect

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.610
in terms of the identity.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:59.290
Now, all of this
comes with a warning,

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.150
because there's lots
of responsibility.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.440
When things are peer
to peer, it means

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.890
there's nobody in the
middle that oversees this.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:08.910
So you have to
trust the network,

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.230
and you have to
trust the protocol

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.280
so that accidents don't happen.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.290
That's why there's
lots of testing.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.250
And we're trying to
push the envelope

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:24.120
in terms of what two entities
can do when it's all up to them

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.360
to agree on contracts
and with money.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.530
We cannot talk about the
blockchain without talking

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.300
about the innovation potential
and what happens in regulated

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.470
or unregulated environments.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.470
Because it is about
money, and money

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.280
is regulated all over the world.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.915
There are regulatory
entities in every country.

00:27:47.915 --> 00:27:50.290
And there are maybe more than
200 countries in the world,

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.510
and there are more than
200 regulatory entities.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.250
Imagine if each one
of these entities

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.150
were to regulate the
blockchain in their own way

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.620
or interpret it
in their own way.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.740
200-- that's more than
the flavors of ice

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.780
cream that I could name.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.470
And then imagine if
that would happen,

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.892
then it would be very confusing.

00:28:10.892 --> 00:28:12.600
So there are lots of
regulators right now

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.016
that are looking
at the blockchain

00:28:14.016 --> 00:28:17.440
and trying to see what kinds
of changes they have to make,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.310
what kind of regulation
they have to impose.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.960
And we are warning them right
now-- people like me and others

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.910
are saying, well, let's
wait a little bit.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:26.840
It's too early.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.470
It's too early to
regulate a new technology.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.210
Let it become a little bit
more in the adult stage

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.140
before regulating it.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.230
It's the same thing as if we
had regulated the internet back

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.370
in '95 or '96.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.090
It would have been disastrous.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.500
We would not have
allowed it and the web

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.780
to prosper and to
evolve in areas

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.940
of e-commerce and other things.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.250
So we have to wait until
the blockchain evolves,

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.630
until the blockchain
matures, and then we

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:57.180
can see what updates we
can do to the regulation.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.900
So my challenge to regulators
is usually I tell them,

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.820
why don't you innovate
instead of regulating?

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.550
Because blockchain is
technology innovation.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:10.020
So innovation needs innovation
on the regulatory side as well.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.410
And it starts by being
permissionless as an innovation

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.840
to the blockchain.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.890
Anybody can get on it.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.640
Anybody can get on board it.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.170
So we don't want to make it
too restricted initially.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.300
And that is the
challenge of regulation.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.180
That's why the most
innovative applications

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.170
of the blockchain in the
financial services industry

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.530
are going to happen
outside of the banks

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.880
in areas that are
not regulated yet,

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.140
in areas that can experiment,
that can try things.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.080
And then we can
see what regulation

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.690
needs to be adapted to it.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.460
So I talked to you about
proving a lot of things.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.350
That's what the
blockchain allows.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:53.000
So in the book, I have
this pyramid of-- I

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.490
call it the proof pyramid.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.910
So at the very bottom
on the technology side,

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.150
it's a proof in a consensus.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.030
Because the blockchain
is about consensus.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.820
The proof of work is really
the consensus element

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.200
of the blockchain.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.210
It's really proving that the
transaction is validated,

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.950
that you are the owner,
and that you are sending it

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.900
to this other person.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.520
So this is all being proved
in the consensus itself.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.050
And there's many ways to
have the consensus done

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:19.800
on the blockchain.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.050
I'm not going to go into that.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:24.780
And then above that, there
could be a proof as a service.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.870
And above that is
proof in a service.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:30.090
So the more you go higher, the
more it's a business thing,

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.170
and the lower is
more technological.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.790
So here are some examples.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.330
And this is also in the book.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.310
But these are the
kinds of services

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.060
that I'd like us to see now.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.720
And this is where
some of these services

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.870
would be potentially possible
on the blockchain-- proving

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.330
of an asset, the
proving of ownership.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:54.600
And I wrote an article two
months ago in "Tech Crunch"

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.540
talking about the
fact that-- saying

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:01.310
what is going to be the next
Google of the blockchain.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:05.510
And the argument
was today, we google

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.602
for information for everything.

00:31:07.602 --> 00:31:08.685
We google for information.

00:31:08.685 --> 00:31:10.390
We google for products.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.170
That's the starting point.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:16.090
Where are we going to go in
the future to prove things,

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:20.280
to prove services, to prove
ownerships, to prove receipts,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.250
to prove provenance
of something,

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.060
to prove physical
address, to prove things?

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.880
Maybe it will be
another form of Google.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.200
Maybe it will be
another way of doing it.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.500
But this is the promise.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.830
This is where we should be
going now, is developing

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.780
these kinds of services
where we can go and check

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.730
things on the blockchain.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.270
And this is one of
the promise elements

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:46.990
of the blockchain in terms
of services going forward.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.850
Here's an example.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.570
I mentioned to you
earlier that there

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.340
are some blockchain applications
that do not need the web.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.780
And this is one
called OpenBazaar.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:03.110
OpenBazaar is a peer to
peer protocol for commerce.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:06.870
Think of it as
eBay without eBay.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.820
So it's a protocol and a
platform that allows anybody

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.240
to buy and sell anything from
anywhere around the world

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.160
without having to go
through licensing fees

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.395
and without credit card fees.

00:32:18.395 --> 00:32:20.020
Disclosure-- I am on
the board, and I'm

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.330
an investor in OpenBazaar.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.490
And they've recently launched.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:25.710
And this is an example.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:29.350
If you download the
client, basically, you just

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.350
use the application
from that client.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.020
You don't use the browser.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.160
You don't use the web.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.550
You just use the client
itself, and then you're

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.920
connected peer to peer with
others anywhere in the world.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.161
So that is an example of
a blockchain application

00:32:47.161 --> 00:32:48.035
that is peer to peer.

00:32:48.035 --> 00:32:52.220
It's arguably one of the largest
right now in terms of scope.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.560
It's on top of bitcoin.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.330
And here is the benefit.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.920
Here's somebody that's
done close to 20 purchases

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.730
on OpenBazaar.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.600
All it cost him was $1.40 in
terms of transaction fees.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.630
That's it.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.060
So that's really the promise.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.110
It's free commerce.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.180
What the blockchain
is about is really--

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.680
if you look forward
now, it's really

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.150
about reconfiguring trust.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.400
And that is a big
word-- changing trust.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.670
It's really about having
humans, us people,

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.800
machines-- it's a combination
of humans, machines,

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.950
and regulations.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:33.150
I'm not implying that
regulators are not humans.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.950
That's not why it's a
different part of the slide.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.960
But regulation is
a fact of life.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.350
So we have to account for
it, because otherwise,

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.190
some bad things will happen.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.040
So it could be self-regulation.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.910
It could be new
types of regulation.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.120
It doesn't have to be the
old way of regulation,

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.320
but it is legal.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.160
There is some legal
aspect to what

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.590
the blockchain wants to do.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.660
When we send money
back and forth,

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.700
money is not just a game.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.220
There's lots of
stake when you're

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.060
moving assets that have value.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.690
So we have to keep that in mind.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:12.440
And it's really about
decentralization.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.320
What the blockchain has
enabled is decentralization,

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.870
if you think about.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.920
The blockchain is a
technology, and now we

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.300
have decentralized services.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.880
And that is the focus
of my next research,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:32.550
is to really go deeper into the
types of decentralized services

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.139
and the impact, whether
they are distributed

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:40.380
autonomous organizations
or other types of services.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.429
It is really about
wealth creation.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:43.989
There is a new
economy out there that

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:48.320
is being created based on
cryptotechnology services.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.409
And information is
also part of it.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.460
So now the new types
of applications

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.350
that are decentralized--
everything

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.850
is encrypted from day one.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.730
So security comes first.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.580
And peer to peer
encryption comes first.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.710
It's not an after the
fact kind of thing.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:09.380
So there are platforms now,
like Enigma or [INAUDIBLE] that

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.370
allow you to write
applications, and everything

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.990
is encrypted, from the
user to the databases

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.910
through the
application, anywhere.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.059
And that's part of it.

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:21.100
So that's very important.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.840
And the blockchains are a
key piece of this technology.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.000
What does decentralization
look like?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.030
Just some elements-- it
has no intermediaries.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.480
There is no permission required.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.760
Anybody can come in.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.040
It's no overhead,
flat structures.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.270
The trust is built
inside of the network.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:45.910
There is resiliency
against attacks,

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:49.320
because there is not one
center that you can attack.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.850
There could be 5,000 computers.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.890
What if you attack four of them
or 10 of them or 1,000 of them?

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.590
The others will keep humming.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.700
There is no central
point of failure.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:03.820
Governance is done via consensus
according to some framework.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.000
And it's really about peer to
peer from a technological point

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.200
of view.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.030
So what's going to
happen going forward?

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.660
Again, in the book, I draw a lot
of analogies with the internet.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.930
Because I was there.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.580
I wrote another
book 20 years ago

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.272
called "Opening
Digital Markets" that

00:36:19.272 --> 00:36:20.480
basically did the same thing.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.120
It explained e-commerce
and e-business at a time

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.010
where businesses could
not see clarity with it.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.850
And for some of you
that were there,

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.380
it took us a good three
years for everybody

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.150
to really understand
the internet.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.950
And we're maybe in the first
of those next three years

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:35.900
with the blockchain.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.983
So what's going to happen?

00:36:36.983 --> 00:36:39.370
We're going to have a new
companies and new behaviors

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:40.940
that will spring out.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.679
There will be new companies
that will be blockchain giants.

00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:45.970
We don't know who they are yet.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.450
The same way as the internet
changed companies inside,

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:55.070
the blockchain is going to
change companies inside,

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.080
whether they are banks or other
types of industries-- energy,

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.850
for example, or health
care for medical records.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:04.780
That's a big
potential application.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.350
Some industries were
threatened or transformed,

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:12.190
like the publishing industry was
transformed with the internet

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:15.290
or the retail industry was
transformed with the internet.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.800
So we're still
waiting to see what's

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.370
going to get transformed
with the blockchain.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.220
I can guarantee you
the financial services

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.560
will get transformed
by the blockchain,

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.520
because that is a very
key element of it.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.500
Maybe the role of the
banks will become more

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.240
as a back end service.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.930
And we're going to have a lot of
front end services ahead of it.

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.650
Like when you use your Apple
Pay, you tap your phone.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.670
It's drawing money from your
bank account or from your card

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:41.360
automatically.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.943
You're not touching
your bank account.

00:37:42.943 --> 00:37:45.210
It's being done for
you automatically.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.100
Same thing if you have an event
and you connect Eventbrite

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.160
to your bank account.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.460
When they pay the
tickets, you can

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.980
put that money in
your bank account,

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.140
and you haven't touched it.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.320
It's all done via linkages.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.760
And then fourthly, the
technology-- the internet

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.020
is a development platform,
and the blockchain

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.700
is going to be a
development platform.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.760
So in closing, I just offer
these 13 generic ideas.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.560
This is for companies that want
to implement the blockchain.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.480
So these are generic ideas,
like where do you start.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.620
Well, think about
intermediary functions.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.150
If you're doing something
that has a trust component,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.010
maybe you can change that.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.500
Maybe you can put the
trust in the network

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.120
and maybe have value added
services on top of it.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.300
We're not saying that
all the intermediaries

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.690
are going to go away.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.800
But what we're saying is
that the roles will change.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.590
And the key thing is
to identify that change

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.090
early on so you can
change it yourself

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:48.450
as opposed to having somebody
else change it for you.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.930
Anything can be bundled and
rebundled and bunduled and then

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:53.450
reconfigured on the blockchain.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:56.090
There's a new flow value.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:59.680
So maybe we can earn
some cryptocurrency

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.980
and then spend them
in a specific service

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.700
within what I call a
crypto-based economy.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.110
There's an app called
La'Zooz that is supposed

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.956
to be a competitor to Uber.

00:39:11.956 --> 00:39:14.850
You download the app, and
then you're driving around,

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:15.860
let's say.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.760
And La'Zooz is just
collecting data

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.381
about your driving patterns.

00:39:19.381 --> 00:39:20.880
Because it knows
where you're going.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.440
It knows what's going on.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.950
And then you earn Zooz
points, for example.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:27.530
And then the next week, let's
say now you want to ride.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.090
You can use your
Zooz points that you

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.420
have earned to then take a ride
and pay with those Zooz points.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.690
So think about it here.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.700
We haven't touched any
dollars or any real money.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.330
You've just done some work.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.784
It could be active
work or passive work.

00:39:40.784 --> 00:39:42.200
That work could
have been a bounty

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.240
on a-- you might have
written a program,

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.230
and maybe somebody
gives you some tokens

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.310
that you can reuse
to buy something.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.850
So think about those elements
in terms of something

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.470
we earn can be spent
in a transaction,

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.460
and it's all done
via cryptocurrency

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.380
within the same ecosystem.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.690
So we're going to see a
lot of these examples.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:04.850
And new legal frameworks,
updating the legal frameworks.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.790
Creating and issuing
digital assets, the banks.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.820
It all starts by
having a digital asset,

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.720
by having smart properties.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.390
So either you create it at the
beginning or you convert it.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:22.130
And then it can be
transported on the blockchain.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.620
You have to embed trust
rules and transactions

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.690
now-- if this, then that,
business logic with money.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.950
Implementing digital signatures,
multi-sigs, verifying records,

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.620
transactions, processes,
verifying authenticities.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.660
Am I who I say I am?

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.020
Do I live where I say I live?

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.650
Do I have these credentials?

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.140
Have I really taken
those diplomas?

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.600
So all of this could be
verified on the block chain.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:56.770
And then enabling smart things
to transact automatically.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:00.170
The internet of things is a
big aspect of the blockchain.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:03.870
There's a company in
Germany, an energy company,

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.980
that's putting a device
in electric cars.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.980
And when the car is
stopped at a red light,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:14.240
it starts to draw some energy
in micro transaction levels.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.090
But it's all paid by
via a cryptocurrency.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:18.810
And that one is
based on Ethereum.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:23.470
Another example is there's
a street in Brooklyn where

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.110
residents are buying and selling
energy between each other

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.840
because on an Ethereum
blockchain as well.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.911
So excess energy is being
traded on a peer to peer basis.

00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:35.910
These are some examples.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.410
In closing, I have to
ask you some questions

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.450
and ask us some questions.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.990
I know you will
have some questions.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.890
So we have to think
about who will

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.500
be the next Google
of the blockchain.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.700
We still don't know.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.200
And I'm not picking on
Google because I'm at Google.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.390
The same question
applies to other things,

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.700
like who will be the next
Oracle of the blockchain,

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.110
the database.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.345
Who would be the next
Netscape of the blockchain?

00:42:03.345 --> 00:42:06.690
If you think about it, what
Netscape did-- at the time

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:10.367
when the web arrived, all the
pieces were very disconnected.

00:42:10.367 --> 00:42:12.200
And they were the first
to come up with what

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.680
was called a web server.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.980
So they put a bunch of
technologies and tools

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.530
and libraries and all
of that into one server,

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.660
and they said you want to be
on the web, take that server

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.580
and buy it.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.150
Actually, the company
that sponsored the books

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.440
that you'll be receiving
at the end, Block,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.790
could be that-- Netscape
of the blockchain.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:38.140
Because they've assembled all
of these tools into one server.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.550
Today, we're still at the Home
Depot stage of the blockchain.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.179
If you want to start and
get involved and develop

00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:46.220
on the blockchain, it's
like going to Home Depot.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.420
You have to buy the nails.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.640
You have to buy
the two-by-fours.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.100
You have to buy everything
and assemble it yourself.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.110
We're not even at the Ikea stage
where you can just get it all.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.730
But that's where we need to be.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.550
And there's an
opportunity there.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.040
Who would be the next x?

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.170
Fill in the blanks.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.120
Who would be the
first large bank

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.820
to accept cryptocurrency or
bitcoin for a matter of fact?

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.120
And I predict some bank
will do that this year.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.710
When are we going to
cross the $1 billion

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:19.160
mark in terms of assets
traded on the blockchain?

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.600
I predict by the
end of this year,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.300
we're going to have
$1 billion traded

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.110
in terms of assets in
the capital markets

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.020
on the blockchain.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.450
It's going to happen.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.610
There are some decentralized
clearing networks

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.230
that will be emerging.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.680
And some of the existing
clearing houses, and the NASDAQ

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.500
others, are working on it.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.280
And then finally,
when are we going

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.340
to see the first
cryptocurrency-based

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.284
businesses, like the
example I gave you

00:43:47.284 --> 00:43:49.200
where you're earning
something and then you're

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.459
spending it on a transaction
in the same ecosystem?

00:43:52.459 --> 00:43:54.000
I'll end by making
three predictions.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.279
Maybe it could be a little
unconventional or contrarian.

00:43:58.279 --> 00:43:59.820
Cryptocurrency
payments is not what's

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.360
going to disrupt
the existing world.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.419
It is not about payments.

00:44:03.419 --> 00:44:04.960
The blockchain is
not about payments.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.020
It goes beyond just payments.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.260
Your Visa card works well.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.640
Our payment system works well.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.140
It's not going to
disrupt that so quickly.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.590
So let's move beyond that.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.420
And then the second
one is more or less

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.760
a message to those that
think that the distributed

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.520
ledgers are really everything.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.140
It is not.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.050
Distributed ledgers
are about improvements.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.880
blockchain as a whole
are about innovation.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.810
And then you heard
me say this more than

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:34.780
once-- the cryptoeconomy
is where the value is

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.060
going to be created.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:41.170
It is not about us moving
$1,000 into a bitcoin account

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.380
or just moving some money
and buying cryptocurrency.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.700
It's about creating
new cryptocurrency,

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.390
creating new value out of
nothing, by just doing work--

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.100
by doing active work
or passive work,

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.780
and then creating
this new economy.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.750
So that's what I want
to leave you with.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:01.750
Thank you very much.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:07.330
AUDIENCE: Could you
speak a little bit

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:11.100
about the Ethereum
DAO hacking issue that

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.490
happened-- what
happened, actually,

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:17.622
and then what the effect was
on blockchain technology.

00:45:17.622 --> 00:45:18.580
WILLIAM MOUGAYAR: Yeah.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:25.799
I wrote last week a 3,000-word
analysis of it in terms of what

00:45:25.799 --> 00:45:27.840
I thought happened and
what we can learn from it.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.840
I think what happened
is unfortunate.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.040
It was a hack.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.890
I don't know the details.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:35.920
It was a hack.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.070
Somebody exploited a weakness
in the smart contract

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:43.380
that the DAO had implemented
which allowed that hacker

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:48.810
to move funds to a
child DAO for no reason

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:53.030
than just being a bad person.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:57.450
And I think what we
can really take away

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:01.220
from it is really the lessons
more than what happened

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.290
and should have happened.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.170
And the lesson is
that it's not easy.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.100
It's really about money.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.860
Programming money is not
for the faint of heart.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.810
It is not a trivial thing.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.130
And the biggest lesson
is that, again, we

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.270
have to walk before we can run.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.820
So maybe there was too
much money in there.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.820
You don't need $150
million to do an experiment

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.000
on whether you can do
autonomous funding of companies

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.390
and projects.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.470
You can have-- $1 million is
enough, or maybe $10 million

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.760
is enough in small chunks,
and giving away half a million

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.900
at a time.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:47.052
So by taking all that big
money, it raised the attention.

00:46:47.052 --> 00:46:49.510
If I walked into this room and
I told you I have $1 million

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:56.975
in my pocket, I won't feel safe
walking outside on El Camino

00:46:56.975 --> 00:46:58.830
if everybody knew
I had $1 million

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.550
in my pocket or somewhere.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.900
So it drew attention,
unfortunately.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:10.380
Now, the good thing is that it's
calling now for more lessons,

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.730
for more best practices.

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.165
Fundamentally, Ethereum is fine.

00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:16.390
There's nothing
wrong with Ethereum.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:22.070
It just happened-- this is
like a micro manifestation

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:27.690
of the Carlota Perez principle
that we always overshoot,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.860
and then we retract,
and then we're good.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.970
Because we don't know
what the boundaries are.

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.340
And the DAO was like,
we pushed the boundaries

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.931
a little too hard, and we
hit a wall, and we got hurt.

00:47:38.931 --> 00:47:40.430
So now we know
there's a wall there.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:41.592
Let's not go there.

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:43.550
And we're going to do
some things a bit better.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:48.420
So that's what-- I always look
at this in a positive light.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.060
AUDIENCE: It's hard to formulate
exactly what I want to ask,

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:55.500
but you touched
on the regulations

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.630
for the blockchain
technology, and you mentioned

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.170
that internet was not
regulated strictly

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.950
when it appeared first.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:08.530
So now I think blockchain and
bitcoin are regulated very hard

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.799
in some countries, but there
are not much regulations

00:48:12.799 --> 00:48:13.590
in other countries.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.340
So do you think there is some
risk for the countries that

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:23.420
are not regulating it,
and what are those risks?

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.730
I don't know much
about blockchain,

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:33.140
but for me, it seems
having a regulator

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:38.790
kind of destroys the idea
of the decentralized place.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.640
If there will be a
regulator, then it's

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.600
not decentralized anymore.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.050
So could you please
elaborate on that?

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.549
WILLIAM MOUGAYAR: Yeah, very
good question about regulation.

00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:50.270
So I think there's
two aspects to this.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:53.320
One, you have to think about
regulation in the consumer

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.430
sense, for consumer
markets, consumer usage,

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.700
and then there is
the business aspect.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.600
And there is already
a bit of regulation,

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.000
because it's really
about money transfer.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.350
So in the US, it's fin-syn.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.820
In Canada, it's FINTRAC.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:10.754
So there's-- an exchange, a
bitcoin exchange s regulated

00:49:10.754 --> 00:49:12.420
the same way as a
money trader would be,

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.032
because they are
exchanging money.

00:49:14.032 --> 00:49:15.740
So they want to make
sure that they catch

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.950
money laundering, for example.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:19.550
So that's fine.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:23.250
Bitcoin should not be the
vehicle to facilitate that.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.410
And by the way, it's
not the great vehicle

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:26.570
for money laundering.

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.820
You're better off putting
some green bills, US dollars,

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.580
in a suitcase if you
want a money launder,

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:35.400
because that's really the more
preferred way for doing it.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.360
So then there's the
business aspect.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.287
The business aspect--
the regulation there

00:49:40.287 --> 00:49:41.120
needs to be updated.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.610
For example, in the
area of capital markets,

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:48.510
they have to recognize that
if a transaction happened

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.460
on the blockchain, that
that record is valid.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.710
They have some standards.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.810
There's the ISDA.

00:49:55.810 --> 00:50:00.330
It's the Security Standards
Association for derivatives

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.010
specifically.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:02.350
And they have standards.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.710
So they're in the process of
updating their standards so

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:11.130
that they can accept blockchain
transactions as a record that

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.380
is accepted.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:16.290
So that's one example of
how the relation can move up

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.050
without really constricting it.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.820
To the second part of
your question about

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.380
it's better if there's
no regulation, well,

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.280
to some extent.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.680
Regulation is good if
it's done properly.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.700
Consumer protection
is important,

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.480
so you want to be protected
as a consumer as well.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.630
But we're still in
the early stages.

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.310
So if there's no
regulation, that's fine.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.670
Let there be more
experimentation.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:45.230
And then even if we fail,
even if we make mistakes,

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.630
the mistakes and the
costs will be small--

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:51.050
except for the DAO,
which was a big one.

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:55.860
But it's OK to fail
in small-- not falling

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.920
from very high levels.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.410
We're learning.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:02.030
And then in two years from
now, we're going to look back,

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.435
and we're going to have so much
experience and best practices.

00:51:05.435 --> 00:51:07.810
And then we're going to have
the right type of regulation

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:13.042
updates and ones
that do not impede

00:51:13.042 --> 00:51:14.250
the growth of the blockchain.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.240
But there could be
some regulations

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.480
that would encourage it.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:22.440
If a government says yes,
blockchain transactions

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.080
are good-- and there
governments that are doing that.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.840
In the UK, for example,
specifically the issue

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.120
they had was in issuing
grants, government grants.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.000
There was some fraud
associated with it.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.142
So they are now
saying-- they're going

00:51:39.142 --> 00:51:43.310
to use the blockchain to
issue government grants

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:44.960
and eliminate fraud.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.900
Because the blockchain has that
trust factor in there that you

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.420
cannot really cheat too easily.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:58.410
In Asia-- I think it's in
Hong Kong or Singapore--

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:01.330
there was some fraud with China.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:02.290
It was in China.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:05.120
There was some fraud
with some invoices.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:10.350
So somebody defrauded the bank
by sending multiple invoices.

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:14.060
And they solved that by putting
the process on the blockchain

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.390
and doing unique hashes
for every invoice.

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.220
So when a second invoice
came in from a hacker,

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.560
let's say, with the same
information, more or less,

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.200
the system knows, because
the hash is unique.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.210
And then they are now catching
the fraud with invoices.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:33.840
So these are some examples.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.030
And these are good
signals that show

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:39.770
that there are lots
of applications

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:41.130
for the blockchain.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.660
AUDIENCE: So how would
you compare the Mt.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:48.130
Gox issue to the DAO?

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:51.920
WILLIAM MOUGAYAR: Well,
one way-- one comparison

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.380
is that Mt.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.010
Gox losses were gone.

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:58.400
It was very difficult.
It was impossible.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.670
Even up to today, the
funds were not recovered.

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:03.910
The DAO is still ongoing.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:07.070
It's an unraveling story, so
we don't know the ending yet.

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:10.400
But it appears that we can
recover the funds, at least

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.940
by preventing the hacker
to take them away.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:21.020
So from that
perspective, the damage

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.500
seems to be containable
at this point.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.715
So that's all I can say.

00:53:24.715 --> 00:53:26.340
And we're still in
the learning stages.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.790
Obviously, it's a bit of a
challenge from a marketing

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:32.040
perspective, from a
market perspective.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.810
And we have to hold our breath
and see how it's going to end.

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:38.710
So I'm not speaking on behalf
of the foundation specifically.

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:41.250
This is just me as an analyst.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:45.110
I think they are--
that being said,

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:48.000
there are lots of
efforts and work

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.260
being done to make sure
that this hacker does not

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.000
keep the funds.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.500
AUDIENCE: I recently
learned there's

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.900
a coffee shop in Palo
Alto that accepts bitcoin,

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.964
so I was excited.

00:53:57.964 --> 00:53:59.880
I can see the value from
a business standpoint

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.270
in order to bypass
those interchange fees

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:05.970
and adopt bitcoin or
cryptocurrencies in general.

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:08.870
But from a consumer standpoint,
for me to buy into--

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:12.810
or the mainstream to buy
into cryptocurrencies,

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:16.320
they have to have confidence in
the valuation of the currency.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.310
And as you have
seen, the valuation

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:20.030
has jumped all over the place.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:24.580
So what's your view on when
this is going to stabilize

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.932
for the mainstream to jump in?

00:54:25.932 --> 00:54:26.890
WILLIAM MOUGAYAR: True.

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:30.370
The question is about
the fact that there

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:33.294
is lots of fluctuation
and speculation

00:54:33.294 --> 00:54:34.710
and lots of
volatility, basically,

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:39.230
on the price of bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:41.750
This is kind of expected because
we're in the early phases,

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:43.060
unfortunately.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.780
And there's been lots
of ups and downs.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.290
At one point, bitcoin
was close to $1,200.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.600
And it went down to $200.

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.520
Now it's back to $600,
$700 more or less.

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.400
So it's not for the
faint of heart yet.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.850
And it's kind of risky, if
you think of it, that you're

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:00.120
using it for something.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.240
I think it's going to
stabilize over time.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.850
That's what I would expect.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:07.280
Unfortunately, there
are speculators.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.690
But I would expect
it to stabilize.

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.450
And think of it not
just as bitcoin.

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:13.460
There are many other
cryptocurrencies.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.680
Ethereum is one of them.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.000
There will be private
cryptocurrencies.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.370
So there will be hundreds if not
thousands of cryptocurrencies.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.150
Any company can issue
its own cryptocurrency.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:26.370
And it could be tied into some
value or to some kind of work

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:29.430
that they are doing
to some services.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:33.330
So right now, it's
not for the masses.

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.770
That's why I'm
saying that I don't

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:39.550
think that bitcoin is-- that
the killer app is not payments.

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:43.380
And we're still
in the early days.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.940
Eventually, it's
going to stabilize

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.860
when there is more balance
between demand and supply.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.160
But we haven't still issued
all of the bitcoin that

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.770
still exists out there.

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.600
We're still mining it, so we're
still in the very early days.

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.600
DAVID: All right, great.

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.350
Thank you for coming.

00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:59.516
WILLIAM MOUGAYAR: Thank you.

00:55:59.516 --> 00:56:01.935
