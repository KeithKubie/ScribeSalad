Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. Yep, that's a rainbow.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.050
and ah.. yep, that's Machu Picchu.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
And of course, that's a lama. So the reason I haven't uploaded a video

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.140
lately is because I'm down in Peru on multiple adventures, and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.190
we've got Jeff, a high resolution photography expert from PeruNature.com,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.220
Gordon, he's the guy that does the sound for Smarter Every Day,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.270
and we have very little internet, so it's time to leave cause it's raining now

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.300
but we're gonna go try to figure out how to upload this video.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.320
Also if you have any suggestions for what I should do next week with a high speed video

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.320
camera in the jungle, the Amazon rainforest, let me know via SmarterYouTube

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.330
you can tweet me, or a facebook message. That's it.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.658
You're getting Smarter Every Day. Stay tuned.
