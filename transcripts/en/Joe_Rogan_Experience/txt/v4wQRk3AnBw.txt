Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Hello sweet bitches. We're back. That's right. [inaudible] this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by ting. And what Ting is, is a no bullshit cell phone company. They have the same service that you'd get of you sprint, but they have it set up where they have no early contract termination fees, no contracts at all, in fact, no early termination fees. And they also have a, an early termination fee relief program. So if you come to Tang from somewhere else, they will give you credit for 25% of your early termination fee up to $75 per device device. This is the thing that cell phones companies are doing. They're, they're selling you a cell phone for like 200 bucks, but they're not really selling you a cell phone for 200 bucks. They're selling you it for what it really costs, but they have that money factored in to month by month bills so that when you try to cancel your service, they say, well, you owe us x amount of dollars.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       And what that is is because you're really not paying 200 bucks for your phone, you're getting fucked. It's weird. It's kind of deceptive. It's sneaky shit tings trying to avoid that and they have every step of the way done an awesome job of doing that. They, they charge you for what you use. Only minutes, text data. There's no overages, there's no nothing, no add on charges. And they have the best android devices that you can buy if you want to buy HTC one, if you want to buy the HTC one, I think it's called the mega. They're awesome one or what I have with the Samsung Galaxy note three. You got that too. Now you're sexy bitch. So does Doug, Darren. It's also fuck yeah bitches. It is really an awesome cell phone company. And again, they use the sprint backbone. So all the bullshit that you would have to deal with if it was a small company, you know, like bad service you don't have to deal with, but all the bullshit that you would have to deal with.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       If it's a big company you don't have to deal with. Um, what they do is give you an, an ethical cell phone company to choose. I love it there. One of my favorite sponsors, one of the reasons I love it is we've had zero negative response from people that have signed up and started using ting. Uh, our friend Chris Ryan used it. Lots of our friends use it. You can use it to go to rogan.ting.com and you could save 25 bucks off your first ting device. That's rogan.ting.com. Can't say enough good things about ting. We're also brought to you by WHO's this today, Lumosity. Oh yeah. We're also brought to you by Lumosity and Lumosity is, let me pull this up. Lumosity is, is uh, sort of like a gym for your mind. That's what the idea behind it is. Lumosity has it set up. So if you go to their website, Lumosity has all these different options and um, you sign up and they provide you with games and these Games essentially are designed to just make your, make your mind work and they're very specialized.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       Like, can we turn on the AC in here? It's hot as fuck in here. One of our camera guys loves that. He's always dinking around with Lumosity. It's great. Yeah. He swears by it. Well, because you can use the Massetti and here let me pull up their, their spot. Get around. That's what he said. Is that okay with you Brian? Tinker. Okay, so I got to thinking around. Yeah. Steve's one of the few guys that will say frickin when he doesn't have to be out in the woods. Yeah. He's this fricking thing. I can't hear myself on my hair from the, the, the, there's not even a chord on those.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       You're not even plugged in. Oh wait, hold on. We'll figure it out. That's really not important right now though. What's port right now is Lumosity exercise because exercise is good for us. Ladies and gentlemen, we go to the gym, we take care of our bodies. And um, new Lumosity allows you to do that same thing for your brain. Now they've, they've shown during in numerous studies that, uh, lots of different things, uh, are, are good for, uh, for your mind, for exercise. Uh, chess in particular is, is excellent for it. And um, the idea behind Lumosity is that they give you a work, they give you things to do but they get it sneaky. They design it in a way that it's, it's like a game. And as I said, these games are very specific to what you want to achieve. If you go to the Lumosity website, you could see all the different options that they have available.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       If you go to the lumosity.com, um, you can see like they, uh, you cleared the deck, the get started now button, they have memory, all these different options from memory, remembering patterns in locations, associating names with faces, keeping track of multiple pieces of information. The more you do these things, the more those are areas of your mind will be exercised at tension. Um, there's many options for speed decision making quickly recalling recent information flexibility, which is a very interesting one. Quickly adjusting and shifting, uh, problem solving, using logical reasoning. All these different options are available. Excuse me, Kung Fu. And he come for one. There's no Kung Fu in this, Brian Cowen. I just get everything from confident. Um, it's, it's basically a gym for your mind. That's the best way to look at it and you can also get them for your iPad, your iPhone, there's a free Lumosity APP.

All Right, ladies and gentlemen, Doug during Steve Rinella, n Brian Calendar here. Cue The music. Let's get there.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       That shit. Real good experience.

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       Try my day. Joe Rogan walk, gas, boom. Ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       in late 2013 we went to the farm of one Douglas Duren in Upper Wisconsin. Actually south.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       It's all the same. Anything up in Wisconsin. So it's not like we're like, wait, this is southeast. I love southwest Wisconsin. No, because there is a difference because these guys in Wisconsin, what they go by is that bottom quarter, that bottom quadrant, the bottom left quadrant. Sure. Is the, they call it the driftless area because it didn't get demolished by glaciers. Yeah, that's a good point because for folks who've never been to Wisconsin, you think it was constant as being like this flat area where you know, the reason why those areas are flat was because they got smushed. Yeah. There's a guy I know who lives up in the northeast and um, he, he makes Maple Syrup and he always makes a point to put on there from the drifted area of Wisconsin. Like he's trying to, he's trying to use it. The shoes came over and smashed it and flatten everything out. What we reword was all hilly and beautiful and you know, all the landscape is varied. That's because it didn't get smushed. It was like a little median in between the lanes of glaciation. Yeah. It could've been minors. Yeah. They just, they built it up, girl. Good thing. We're in Montana. We were driving Brian's like, oh, this is all mining large

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       scale mining. What the fuck are you talking about? Minus a river through here. Like the, at a mining expert. Apparently I'm a mining expert. I can tell by the topography at least you don't really believe what you're saying from you just start saying something and you just go with it for a goof. I'll commit, I'll come in. But you know, you don't commit with your ego. You don't, you don't really attach on. No, just my mind is changed all the time. I talk about being a libertarian. I had this guy, William Bernstein, he's written all these books, you know, on my podcast. And he started going, well, yeah, but they started giving me examples of how being libertarian wouldn't really help you if you, you're hoping that your kid isn't wearing something toxic, you know, they're, they're certainly, when you get on a plane you want, you want there to be an f, f, d uh, you know, whatever it is. Yeah. Whatever it is, standards, federal standards for flying. And so I was like, yeah, yeah, you're right. I back off everything I've been saying here.

Speaker 5:          00:09:44       Well, being a libertarian up to a point is not a bad idea. Of course, the problem with any ideologies you get lumped into, it's too rigid. They're making coffee in there at the house. Like we used to call it, we used to call it bulletproof coffee. Now we call it the Robb wolf blend. Uh, but anyway, uh, Doug Durans farm, you were so gracious to have us up there to film mediator and we appreciate it very much. And you know, as I said on the show, uh, you can have a different time but you can't have a better time. We had a fucking fantastic week there with your friends. You got a great group of guys that you go hunting with every weekend and just a great group that represents what hunting really should be. A bunch of cool people having a good time doing something that's fun doing it ethically and you know, getting some great meat out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       Yeah. Got It, got it. Talk about how I met dog. Sure. Cause it speaks of dog. I'll just sit here quietly. Doug's a very big man by the way. Yeah, Doug's a good guy. A lot of bone. A lot of bone alone. Well I met Doug after I wrote my buffalo book dog, you know, wrote me a letter and usually like letters. I don't mean, I don't even want to say what I was going to say. Why not? You look at it, you know, letters. I love to get letters. They're fantastic. You know what I mean? But a lot of times it's like people you can't tell if they want to. Yeah, you can't really get it. It's hard to determine sometimes what they're after and I'm sure you get tons of, Doug wrote me a letter that made me actually be like, I am going to, I want to contact this person.

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       It was just kinda like, I like your book and I heard this and here's what we got going on at my farm. We started emailing back and forth and dog, I don't know what year this was, invited me to come out to his cold asked farm. And every time it comes out, it's cool. So it's his fault. So I just went out there and I didn't know if I was going to get molested. I didn't know the guy by those big hands. I know it's like big, you know, Hans molested me out that place. I left the note, I left the note. Tell him my wife, like if I don't call an next hours, like call nine one one what have no must must've been called Cazenovia nine version of nine one one a note. This must have been to, it was a buyer. You already know it's like a moving. No. So I've never done anything like that

Speaker 5:          00:12:00       that ever, but I did and went off the dogs called farm and we was real cold.

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       And then I came back. I was [inaudible]. Did he meet you at the door and a robe and a warm he picked, no, I think he picked me up at the airport. I did and we got to, we got a sack of cheese curds. I took him to my house. He met my wife so he could see everything was legit, that I wasn't going to take him up to the woods right away.

Speaker 5:          00:12:28       That's fine. And so you became friends and I first saw Doug on your show, mediator best, uh, best show on television. And, uh, I first saw the first time that you guys went on, you went on a, a deer hunt and you shot some rabbits and you made some rabbits stew and it just looked like a, a great hangout. You know, you guys had a really good time up there. So when Steve said, hey, uh, you want to come to Doug's farm up in Wisconsin and hunt deer, I was like, fuck yeah, that sounds nice. I'll go on record right now and say that beaver might be the best meat. Everybody your fucking mind. And I'm not kidding. You funded it was good. It's not as good as Venice. So tend to add here, bitch, that little rodent

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       that the, can you do like a thing? You know, you'll have a different meal, but you'll have a pill, but you want to have a better [inaudible] for better beavers. Very good. But what I like about Venice, as

Speaker 5:          00:13:23       soon as you eat it rare and you get that taste of the real blood, the animal [inaudible] disguised in a meal, you're eating the venison. I just couldn't believe how Tinder viva was. You will, the way Steve cooked it. Yeah. It's real tender. Yeah. I mean, you know, you really know what you're doing. You know, when you, you got to cook it a long time and you wouldn't be able to just take like a hunk of beaver meat and grill it. No. Well, I've been doing that with that pig that we shot in to hone ranch. And that's tough. It's delicious. But it's tough. Yeah. Even if the Loin, even the cook the lung, because first of all, you got to cook it all the way through. It's gotta be, you know, it's gotta be like medium because it's pork, you know? But it's not like venison.

Speaker 5:          00:14:03       Venison is just like so soft and delicious. Pork is good, man. Pork loin is damn delicious, but it's definitely tougher. It's definitely tougher. Right. So how did the, the mule deer venison compared to the white tail? Um, the whitetail was so damn good. I don't think you can get better tasting meat on the planet. That whitetail venison that we made in your kitchen when we cooked up those bags. [inaudible] good man. That's the best meal I've ever had. I don't think it gets any better than the way you cooked it with the butter and garlic salt and a hot flame p. Oh my God. We got to use butter and then get that grill good griddle, really hot and just cooked that bitch for just not even like 30 seconds each side and then beaten it up with the beard. Smash it down. Yeah. Smash it down with a beer. So he cut like,

Speaker 6:          00:14:52       you know, an inch thick, cute, you know, a slice of the, uh, the, the loin pounded down so it's kind of flat. And then when you throw it in there, it'll seriously 30 seconds each side. Max crackle, crackle, and then, oh, it's so good. I was pretty amazing. I'm the, I'd love elk. I've had, you know, elk, that's just about as good as any meat I've ever had in my life. That I think, but that those, the backstraps cook that way, it's just, it's hard to fuck with. And plus those deer that we shot at your farm are so fat and healthy. Those are some health corn after corn fed young also. They were also young. That's bad there. Yes. The bad part. Well how much different do they taste? If they're really old? It's a bit of a difference with you ever. What's the oldest dear you've ever shot?

Speaker 6:          00:15:37       You think? Uh, that one buck I shot was, he was at least five and a half and it gets hard to tell after a while though. Right on the age they do it by their teeth. Take it to a, like a DNR station and they'll look at it and they'll tell you, they say it's two and a half. It seems like it's like every two years. Two and a half years old because they can't make a mistake there or something. But, um, I guess that when it at five and a half just based on the teeth and then I shot one, uh, with Mike Arkins, uh, or hutches he's affectionately known by Steve. Um, a couple of years ago that wasn't an older deer than that and it was, that was a little little gaming game. He is the wrong word because Cameron Hanes, I don't think white tails ever gave me. So Kevin Hanes was on the podcast and he shot a water buffalo that was 20 years old. Yeah. And he said he had a piece of meat that he put in his mouth there at the camp and uh, he was practicing with his bow is steady practice with his bow for half an hour with the same piece of maintenance mountains like Pac man trying to break it down.

Speaker 7:          00:16:37       I killed it. I killed a blackberry that was 17. They do a two sentence thing. 17 year old bear. How long do they live back? Blackberries about that. Want me to get a little older? But he was 17 but he and I sent his tongue. They're like the Montana State University used to run a program where, um, you could send a chunk of the tongue in and they'd do a test for trig analysis on the tongue, cause it cons like I guess you get a good concentration. I'm the tongue, good concentration the shoulders. So I butchered this whole thing and it was funny as hell as we went down to my room and I was in school and my roommate was cotton fish at this uh, bailo grocery. Okay. And he's like, well shit, let's just take that barrier down and grind at after hours at work, you know.

Speaker 7:          00:17:20       So we go down this thing and look like we went down there and run it through the grinders. We had those little, you know, little foam things. They get meat on this stuff look like, I mean my freezer looked like someone had just went and raided a grocery store cause I had it all those foam bottom things to Saran wrap, just look perfect man, like stacked up like bars of gold. And then we got done. I met, we cleaned, you know, we clean, but I started wondering about the depth of clean we did because a couple of weeks go by and they sent me this thing like, yeah, your bears trick. Knowles is positive. I know you can go in and throw the bear out if you want, but we won't reissue you a new bear tag. So if you, you now have the right to like, you can get around because it's illegal to waste Gamey, right? So it's one wastes law. They said you're exempt from wanton waste on that bear, but you can throw it out, but we won't give you a new tag. And I just went down and bought a meat thermometer. I had a hundred this bear was, you couldn't even think about even moving this bear. You know, I had a, I think it was hundred is either 130 or 160 pounds. A fricking ground meat off that bear. Damn. I ate it to the bitter end,

Speaker 6:          00:18:20       man. They're fricking meat thermometer. I'd be out in my yard like with breaking bear burger meat thermometer. I do say Frickin, yeah. My Mom's listening to a certain degree, but mum was talking about before, before the podcast, sorry we were saying the Steve's one of those guys that says Frickin when he doesn't have to, cause I know that my mom, my mom likes to listen to your show man. So, so what's the temperature that kills chicken? Awesome.

Speaker 7:          00:18:51       Yeah, we're just look this up there. Day One 15 no it's one 55 or one 50 I remember one 54 different gangster trick and just change it like three you know the Usda just lowered pork. Really? He goes well cause like USDA inspected pork. They, I mean 90% of the trick gnosis cases in the u s are coming out of black bear meat. That's incredible. I heard that on your podcast. So they control how they feed pill. They lowered the temperature on port because what they were, what they think, what they eventually found out is the way people were used to be able to fatten pigs. A restaurant slop in restaurant slop had rats and mice in it, in rats and mice are picking up trick gnosis by eating flushing. Nothing's born with trick gnosis. It has to get it through consumption of an infected animal. And when they got it figured out enough where they know what's going into the miles of inspected pork, they don't have any more. Now they say you don't need to cook pork to, it can be rare. You get a rampart. It's like they serve it medium. I can't believe Doug's not. Doug's like always fact checks. Everything you say as you say, I can't leave him

Speaker 6:          00:19:50       my phone off, so I'm just going to go, uh, you know. However, do you ever hunt wild pigs, Doug? I have never done it. You should come with us. All right. This is a place up here, the, the um, to hone ranch. They're infested. It's incredibly, I lot of them, oh, they're everywhere and they're, they're wild man. We were me and Steve and the Cody, Cody, the guide. We were walking down this road and I'm telling you like where that curtain is, there was some pigs duking it out. We couldn't see them because they were in the bush and we're sitting there like waiting for one to pop out. But it's like you're in a monster movie or something. Like there's some gremlins. They carry it out and carry on the brushes. Shame had no idea. We live in a show before they come out. I had no idea we were there. So they were just making all this crazy noise, right. 15, 20 feet away. Maybe she's just plain gray. I was hitting the Austin

Speaker 7:          00:20:41       and I and I, when I came on stage, this guy who was introduced to me and my buddy used to be at this Delta Guy, Delta Force Guy. So this his buddy

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       was a seal seal seal team six guy. So we've got to know each other and talking and, and uh, he said, look man, I'm, I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan's. Uh, he and I think alike and he said, if you guys ever want to come down to Austin, we'll, we'll throw you in a couple of small birds that would be helicopters and you guys can shoot pigs with a bell fed machine gun.

Speaker 5:          00:21:06       Sounded like he doesn't know me that well. I don't have any desire to, to that. I like hunting pigs, but I I, you know, I felt weird about doing it out of a truck. Right? I felt weird about driving around in a truck and jumping out and bang. You don't want to pull a Ted Nugent. Well, it looks like fun for sure. And if it was my farm, don't get me wrong, if I had a giant farm, these pigs are fucking up my farm. I would absolutely hire Ted Nugent and pig man to fly around and shoot nuclear weapons at though. But the reality is that's not what I want to, I'm not going to fly down to Austin strap into Ellicott seems like it would be a lot of fun, but it might turn on an area of your brain that you don't really want. Turned off.

Speaker 5:          00:21:47       My delta force buddy literally goes, oh, I'll teach you. I'm really good at shooting from a helicopter. I'll teach you all about that. A lot of guys don't know how to teach you. I'll teach you exactly how to do it. Not a skill set. I necessarily, I don't really need it. You not, I don't plan on it. I was like, all right, well thanks. I guess that pig man, dude shot a pig from a helicopter with a bow and arrow. What? Yeah, yeah. You got to compensate to compensate for the downdraft. You know you have to shoot like way over the pig's head aero drive. That's impressive. We shot from about 20 yards too. I mean it wasn't like that close. So there's 20 yards with the downdraft and you got to like gauge it all and try to figure out that. That's crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:22:26       But he also killed like 400 of them that day with a machine gun. I'm not kidding. 400 pigs. They've done it twice. Him and Ted Nugent had done it twice. They call it a pork lips. There's a pork lips one and it was a pork lips too. I mean it's, it's basically like apocalypse now. That scene in apocalypse now. Look, look, look, look, look, look at the screen. Look up, look up. If you're going to eat it, and you know, look, he's got a fucking bear looking at him. He's going to bear bow and he's sick and he's going to shoot this fucking pig from a helicopter. Look at this shit.

Speaker 5:          00:22:59       Look at that. That's incredible. Boom. Oh, that's impressive. That is very impressive by the way kind of bed there. Wow. Wow. What do you expect pigs running things in the helicopters. A lot of shit going on there and here is all I'm saying. Did the pig pile up? No. No. Piglet pick looked like it didn't even know. I've never found that pig. Oh yeah, they got that pig. They got them all. I mean they, they killed 400 pigs that day. I mean I'm not, I'm not exaggerating when I say 400 pixels. When you see big like that are those, those are not indigenous to absolutely not. No Man there from there. You're Asian. They used to be all over from north North Africans, British isles. So they, they are, are they were they were they domestic pigs and now they are wild pigs. It happens a whole bunch of ways. How do, can I, am I loud but yeah, every pig one.

Speaker 7:          00:23:46       I just wanted to get in like a geeky pig thing. No, no, no, no. Please go ahead. So thought it's a secret or something. Oh No, no, no, no. I got confused like, oh, like every pig, every pig and whether it's in a farm barn yard, feral, wild, okay. Eurasian bore razorback, whatever the name you hear applied to it all is like sue scrapper. It's all the same species. So prior to domestication by humans, this species was found all over Europe and Asia. Like, I mean they were in the British isles, North Africa and the Middle East all over. You know, what does not Russia. Okay. They were everywhere. Europe. Um, we'll slowly over time different people in different areas domesticated and develop domestic strains off of this, this, you know, sue scrap off the wild pig and they then spread it around the rest of the world where it didn't exist.

Speaker 7:          00:24:43       Like Polynesians brought wild pigs to Hawaii perhaps 1100 years ago when they showed up there. Right. But then at the same time you've made, there's maintain like the actual ancestral population in certain pockets where you really have like the actual wild pig that became the basis like what we got the cow from as an animal called the oryx, but the oryx went extinct and now we can't look back and go like, so what was the cow? Right? Like what did we make cows home? But we know in this case what it wasn't. It still exists out there. So we had where people brought these domestic strains around and inevitably they go feral. Okay. So just Sodo release pigs inadvertently released pigs in, you know, in the new world hundreds of years ago according to Charles. Man. That's kind of one of the reasons that that might've been. What, what caused the plagues about that book?

Speaker 7:          00:25:31       1491 yeah. I might've been the reason that they, they did a lot of the native Americans died in such massive numbers from typhus and all kinds of, cause they gets it because like pigs share so many diseases. But then at the same time what would start to happen in the late 18 hundreds early 19 hundreds is people started going and catching the ancestors, like the ancestral pigs, undomesticated ancestral pigs, taking them as wild creatures and cutting them loose. So in California, lot areas in California, you go there and the pigs resemble and there's some integration probably from domestic strains, but they really like, you look at them, you're looking at like what we now call like a Eurasian board. They got long snout razor back. I mean everything about them like straight tail, everything. A bottom screens like wild pig and you're kind of looking at like what is the wild pig in other places you can go on there just as wild what? They're feral domestics. Oh okay. How big is the, is the original bore? How big do those guys? They get there, you know, it was funny there. They get big, they get, you know, they'll, they'll shoot ones in the wild. That can be four or 500 pounds. Wow. I mean that's, I think that's pretty, that's like a big board, but they get to be bigger than how much of that is muscle. Oh yeah. But that pig was such bs, that whole Hogzilla thing. Total BS.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       Well, it's a perspective issue for sure. Well, yeah. Well guys, like he sees one of these Hogzilla short, he goes, I sold that guy that pick a week ago. [inaudible] he turns up and he's got a picture up in the back of his truck. Which guys? A few of those Hogzilla is out. Yeah, those are domestic strains. Okay. And every hogs, like every Hogzilla in his past was sitting there on the court, was on a corn crib. It's not unusual to make an 1100 pound domestic. So that guy before by livestock than any almost put together. Let's hold that makes sure up again. So that guy basically just cover that thing in dirt. No, listen, you can take it. The mastic, you could take a domestic pig. Okay. Leave them intact or whatever. Give them all the corn he's gonna want and you're going to, you can make giant pigs.

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       Then all you do is you take it out and do a pen to place, turn it out on the pen location, go shoot, and then you go like hunt it in quotes. Yeah, that's interesting. And they're just buying them and putting out there. Now that thing has hair all over it. You know Nugen runs those things. He runs things where that he runs like these little pen facilities where they got like, like suppose the wild pigs in a pen. Dairy and people come out and pretend to hunt for them and it's like one of these pods. Zillow's that turned up. It wound up, there's a picture of it. There's a picture of the guy with it in the back of his pickup. That's hilarious. Well, we would want to be that. Some guy bought it for his kid to shoot. Oh, cut it out. He cut it all out on some little parcel of land. But when you get a wild boar that's 500 pounds, how much of that is muscle? They got a high yield man. Speaking of that, a lot of game animals, like 40% yield, I mean pigs out of high yield. I mean on a wild one it's gotta be 50% yield Manga Vanilla

Speaker 5:          00:28:24       and I, okay, we shot this pig. It's five 15 okay. 5:15 PM it gets dark at five 30 and the pig is probably like 200 pounds. We take this pig and a, I shoot it and it rolls down this fucking hill. I'm going, this hill is like really steep. I mean Riddick like hard to walk up like really steep to just walk. You kind of have to crawl up, right? So we have to figure out how to get this pig out. We try to drag it up with this guy's cord. He tries to pull up this truck, but it's a good word for that road. Yeah, it's of course the court keeps caching on rocks and snaps and snaps twice. So we're like, fuck, what do we do? So we're trying to figure out what to do. I said, frick. Yeah. So Steve says we should cut it.

Speaker 5:          00:29:07       We should. We should butcher it, cut it up and then walk up the hill with it. Yeah. But Cody, the guide says you guys should kick it down to the bottom of the hill. There's a creek bed there and you'd be like pushing it the whole way and then at the end of it as a street and uh, I'll come get you this treat. Well I guess he was a little off and it's fucking typography. I didn't really recognize how fucking far the hill goes down. Right where we were. And by the way, pushing a 200 pound pigs. I like it has wheels. We tried it. We tried to push this thing for like, I dunno, like two or three hours. First of all, I, yeah, you'd roll it just wind up in the, in like some hell hole. And then we wound up in the hell hole somewhere down the stream.

Speaker 5:          00:29:46       So we're down there. It's, we're at the bottom now. We're nowhere near close to the road. We're fucking miles from the road. Okay. And we've got this pig and it's pitch black out. I mean in pitch black, you could see stars in the sky. We're hearing twig snap behind us because there's only like 50 mountain lines up there. And to hone ranch, it's one fucking waterhole. They have, he told us we have pictures of 16 different mountain lions at this one waterhole. It's a huge ranch. This ranch is shit. This ranch is 270 plus thousand acres. Yeah, California banned Lion Hunt. Yeah. So let me got, you know it was a lot lighter. They're all over the place. So Steve says, look, we gotta, we gotta cut this thing up. There's no way we're going to get this thing out of here. What? Cut it up.

Speaker 5:          00:30:25       We'll, we'll, we'll put it, throw each throw half over our shoulders and we'll just carry it out. It seems most reasonable, right? We're cutting this thing and Steve's joking. Oh there's line. Mine is, I hear a line cause we hear like snap crack, we hear like twigs snapping and we're out there with blood all over our hands pulling hearts out of this fucking that same client base. Then we have to carry it and we carry it for what, another two fucking hours or something like that. And it's starting to get really sketchy because it's super steep. It's dark as fuck. Can't see where we're going. I'm slipping all over the place and I'm like, I'm going to, I've twisted my knee up, kind of fucked up. Not Bad, but I'm like, I'm gonna fucking break my neck like this is, this is kind of crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:31:04       We finally get to the bottom after he like, who knows how many fucking hours Cody needs to stay. We want them hang in this pig up. But where we came to just so happened to be an ancient shack that they had that they had built during prohibition so that Hollywood people could come up there and drink booze. They had a still build out a native timber with fire fireplaces made out of native rock. The most amazing places. I'm going to put it, I'm going to F for folks who listen to right now. I'm going to throw photos of it on. I'll throw it up on Instagram while we're doing this podcast. Incredible. Like, he can't even imagine the work that went into this place, man. Yeah, it was really fucking, it just ran. It's just into the ground is not here. You can't even, you can't drive to it.

Speaker 5:          00:31:43       So it's run down and just sitting there and it's beyond. There's no, there's no saving, Huh? Yeah, it was really incredible. So you get to that thing? Yeah, we just hung it up off of, we hung it off overhead. Like hanging over a drain. Yeah. This is the, this is the shack. So, so, so let me ask you this. Are there any danger of a mountain lion coming in? Well we were armed. No, but I'm going to be coming and getting the meat over night. No, I mean I, any danger of getting attacked by a mountain. Oh Man. In the last, what, 80 years in the last 80 years has been like maybe more than 80 years has been six or seven line fatalities and Mommy's and Washington state yesterday and 11 year old girl shot a mountain line that was going after her brother. You want to talk about it? A little gangster cat? Yeah. Pull up that story. Hold on. 11. Yeah, this was, yesterday was a 50 year old cat. Apparently the cat was, or 50 pound cat. Apparently the cat was like real skinny and they were saying that was probably just starts hurting. That's a small cat. Yeah. Yeah. But

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       I mean, it kind of drives me nuts when people act like lions are, you know, any more dean, I mean, will you said after all, they're not as dangerous as yellow jackets are. Ground nesting Hornets scared all of them too. So they're out there. We're going to go fuck themselves. They're all through with the, with the, I mean, they're feeding on these, these hogs at this place. Paul to gotta be cleaning house on man. You know, come on, you can run them down to, oh, look at this little girl and they got a picture of the cat. It's fucking little girl. She's 11 years old. Shot a fucking mountain line. That's shot. Shot that mountain lion. No, there's no, no, no. It's a picture. There's a picture of the glass. Like it must not have been too stressful of a situation. Well, the girl, um, she's apparently she's a hunter and her, her whole family hunts.

Speaker 6:          00:33:24       And so she knew how to use a gun. Like there's a picture of her with a raccoon that she killed that's available online. She knows how to use a gun. And this rack, this, uh, this fucking panther was coming after her brother and she shot it. That's a crack shot for an 11 year old. That's great. A fucking mountain lion. So find the article. Can I go back to the machine gun out of the helicopters? Yeah. Cat. So needless to say, well maybe I will say that that's not something that I, that I have any interest in, but what I do have an interest in is, uh, uh, talking about what good is, how good a shots you to where I was just amazing. My favorite topic right now, well, the cashmere killer. Yeah, exactly. I've learned from Steve Vanilla, I learned from the best well in.

Speaker 6:          00:34:08       And what was so gratifying about the way you guys hunted in the way you were there and in, and I'm just thinking about Brian and how that deer came down through the woods and you know, he's honest and he's on it and it's like, Yep, I've got it. Boom, one shot down. It went. That's in my book the way it ought to be done. They call me game. I of course, it wasn't that far away, but I appreciate it. You know what, man, I'm telling you. Ever since I started practicing archery and practicing with bows and arrows and I've been doing it for a few months now. You really like about shooting Amy with a rifle when you can actually rest the rifle down on something and look through a scope. God Damn is that easy in comparison to a bow and arrows effective way more effective. It's fucking hard.

Speaker 5:          00:34:49       Like to aim at something more than 30 yards away with a bowling out. Yeah, especially like a live animal matter. It's hard to stand with a scope and try to shoot. Yes. I don't think you'd ever do that anyway. Right. Well, I've been doing that. I've been doing that. The range. Really? Yeah. I've been doing almost all of my practice, right. Whole different ballgame. The sitting, even, even sitting, doing almost all my practicing at the range locked into my shoulder because I remember when we were, um, we were pig hunting. I had one shot, the one pig that I missed. I was trying to rest up against a tree and I'd never done it before. I've never taken, I was like, I don't know what I'm doing. This is a weird thing, but try to put the gun up against a tree. It felt awkward. So I've been practicing just like this, just sitting there like this with my elbow up against my body. Practice with your knee up. Yeah, just it's way, it's a whole different thing. Just even I did a few standing. It's fucking hard. Yeah. I don't know many,

Speaker 8:          00:35:38       I don't know many serious hunters who've been in a lot of situations. You take even a hundred yard shots without having a rest. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:35:46       Yeah. I probably wouldn't matter what it, than less somethings like

Speaker 8:          00:35:51       heading out. Well that, yeah, generally, yeah. Generally you'd, you'd want to, I mean, free hand shooting out to certain is real deadly all to a close range. But you know, you imagine the trajectory of that thing and you know, and if you're an inch off that 10 yards, you're two inches off at 20 yards and on and on and on, and then you run the risk of an injury in the animal. So, you know, you gotta be careful. Yeah. Or not are not good. You don't want to take,

Speaker 9:          00:36:18       when you're hunting, do you get the chance to shoot, uh, you know, as we would off the bencher when we were just practicing in our place. So you do need to be able to, you know, adjust and lean off of something. And that was the other thing you did when we first got in the blind. I was thinking you were kept pulling it. I mean, I just don't do that, you know, pulling the gun up and pointing it out the window and he's just like pointing in different places and I'm like watching him.

Speaker 5:          00:36:43       Okay. Why is that bad? No, no. I mean it was, he was moving a lot, does move a lot. I'm Connecticut and I kept trying to look through, I go through these weird games where I'm like pretending I'm, I'm whore and I'm looking through my scope for the enemy is wrong with you cause I'm cause I'm talking about here's all the war. I'm pretending I'm such a bitch. I had, I had a warm thermos in my tummy and I had all those heating pads. I stayed

Speaker 9:          00:37:07       very toasty. But the point is is that he then, you know, took the rest, made the shot twice. Yeah. And uh, uh, I mean shot two different deer and, and I guess what I was going to say about shooting is that if you are in a situation where like, uh, I don't know if I missed a buck on that last day that we hunted and jumped him and he ran. And you know, I had, I took like three steps down the hill and he wasn't very far away and cleaned mist. And, um, but I will, I practice shooting that way. I mean, I don't shoot a lot, but I will actually practice, you know, free hand. But I'm not, you're right, I'm not gonna shoot a hundred yards or 150 yards at something, but 50 or 75. I mean, I've killed a lot of deer are really close.

Speaker 5:          00:37:53       Well, because they get up and running. How when you get that deer in your sites,

Speaker 8:          00:37:58       you know, like everything goes away, right? I mean, it's just like, it almost feels, it's almost like that's the rush. Thinking About Your Chore List and now Instagram, do you have an Instagram? No. Oh No. What is it? Meat Eater. Tea Country TV. TV. It's Steve's at Steven Rinella. Okay. Um, I've been doing videos on my Instagram was Brennan show. We're not asking about you are we? I was going to, well, I'll show it to you. Let it remind me. I'm not really interested. Oh No, you are. I want, you know, I want to make, I want to, I want to have Doug talk about like the, like the, the like hit

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       the deer on his place and all that. But one thing that's just really bugging the hell out of me is last time I was on here I uh, I said something wrong. Oh, okay. I was talking about to hone ranch and I said they have to [inaudible] which is a native elk in California. It was like, you know the Elgar divide like rocky mountain note to Lee's Roosevelt's, no saying they had to release which is the native California out onto home. They don't, there are some real close to there but those are rocky mountain.

Speaker 5:          00:39:02       Thank God you cleared that up because it's been bugging me nuts. But no, it is important because the Tulio Carne is big. The rocky mountain elk or unusual for that area and the only place in California that has them is to hone ranch and then they bought the free from some guy had a captive facility into Boston free 50 years ago now run wild out there. It's incredible. We only got to see a few of them but we tankers man huge because they don't have a winter problem like a lot of the elk in the mountains too. Like, I mean, there were snow while we were up there, but it's not snow where they don't have food. They're getting food. They're probably putting fat on right now. He's fucking elk were GI in there, Joe, we saw, we saw some cows and we saw one bull from a distance, but Steve picked up a shed that was like a fucking limb on a hundred year old oak tree.

Speaker 5:          00:39:48       It was, it was huge. It was longer than both of my arms. No, they, they, they, I mean they regularly, you know, what do they weigh? Oh, thousand to 1200 pounds. That's a horse. A horse. They're huge out there. I should tell everybody that's interested. You can hunt at that place. They were, so they were kind enough to bring us up there and let Steve and I hunt there. But you know, anybody can go hunting there. You hire a guide and you pay for it. It's not cheap, but it is a game rich place. If you're good a pig man, you know, I mean, that's, yeah, but the most of that, can you, can you find elk up? There are no, yes you can.

Speaker 7:          00:40:23       They do it. Yeah, you can. And they do a very, I think that they're saying they, I mean they kill like honestly, they kill a handful of elk off that place every year. They kill, they kill thousands of pigs out that place every year. It's really aggressive dude. Really aggressive pig calling. Please. I heard you can't shoot your way out of a pig calling pro. They picked up. They keep a handle on me, but they, they, they, I mean throughout the year on average they're killing like many, like several a day just to keep, uh, just keep grips on it. You know, I look at Gels, look at that. That's the peg that is, that looks good. It's got a long snout. Is that a, is that a wow pass. Very raw. It's very Russian looking Eurasia. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:41:04       To hone ranch. If you're in La and you're looking for a place to hunt, that is a game rich environment and it's only an hour and a half outside of La. Real Nice folks who run that play. Dude. Cody plank is solid. Yeah. Very, very nice. Cause I'm like Tom, I thought there were solid, very nice guys, both of them. We had a great time. Cody was your guide. He took us out, showed us every, I mean the place is gigantic. We saw it at least 50 deer. We saw at least, I don't know how many fucking pigs. Hundred easily, easily a hundred pigs in the two days we were there, we saw about maybe seven

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       or eight elk. We saw Turkeys, we saw about a dozen Turkey hill. We saw everything. I got a buddy in New Mexico whose body works out there like at an administrative level out there. And he kept telling over the years, and this guy hunts like a lot of, you know, serious back country honing my friend in New Mexico. He kept saying, man, he gotta go out and see this to homeplace you would never in a million years guessed that sitting there never. And then you'd get up way up high and there's like Cedar, it's like there's a ton of different bio types there. You know you get way up behind her was like cedars and it just like, you couldn't imagine that you can then like drive out of there and go down to lax and fly. Yeah an hour and a half. I mean it's crazy. It's so bad ass. Not only that, it's a private ranch so there's not that many people up there.

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       How big is not fence to like when you say we told you you weren't paying for it. Acres millionaires accordingly. If he's not, if he doesn't get to talk he doesn't listen. No, I'm not good with numbers but I do want to get something because I didn't want to bring up something like management, you know, so they, they work really hard out there. They work hard to keep a grip on the pigs because pigs it hard on ground nesting birds for instance, there used to be a lot of quail out there. They suspect and turn be a lot of turkeys out there and antelope, they suspect it. They've seen a, they suspect that one of the things might be going on with quail out. They're just pigs, you know, cause they hammer eggs. They like the ground nesting birds. So they do a lot to do that. But in Japan, but I want to bring up, I want to bring up deer like oh I want to talk about deer in southwest Wisconsin. Look at that place. That's the pig ranch. Before we talk about,

Speaker 9:          00:43:02       here's the other thing was the two pictures. You had the one of the Hogzilla and that looked like a domestic pig that, I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       yeah man. We used to raise on the farm when I was a kid. We had shorts now as opposed to the one that I chose the erasion and that was in multicolor front ones. But then you go to New Zealand, I hunted pigs in New Zealand and every one of those pigs looks like something just walked off a farm. They look, they look great and then you throw them in the crick and get the mud off them and they'll be like black and white and brown man. Crack is correct if it has no crick crack a crick as a crick according to Patrick McMahon is if you can find automotive parts in it. [inaudible] it's clean. It's a creek. And this is most certainly quick, like if you went up and down you'd find a spare tire making it a crip.

Speaker 9:          00:43:48       But the other thing about pigs too is when I was a kid, we had picked out you were here.

Speaker 2:          00:43:54       I keep trying, I keep trying to tee, I keep trying to cheat it ours time and I'm in the media. Give him a break. I'm trying to t dog off talks about his damn phone. So let me talk about the farm for a minute please.

Speaker 9:          00:44:05       Uh, we raise pigs when I was a kid and uh, had, you know, there were chickens on the farm at one point we had dairy cattle and all that kind of stuff, but the pigs were never anything. When you say domestic, you could see where, where as soon as the fence is open, they're gone. You know, they aren't, they're not like Holsteins or even the herds that you saw or the angles that I had there that'll, you know, they'll come around and he'll just stand by and stuff. And pigs were, they were pretty quick.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       [inaudible] not here. I'm going to eat that song

Speaker 5:          00:44:38       really naturally. Far As let's just go to the woods.

Speaker 9:          00:44:40       Right. And, and his, his uh, Steve's comment about, uh, about the eggs or the quail and the Turkey makes complete sense because they're there, what are we calling it written around in the written,

Speaker 5:          00:44:52       the routine, the routine take about

Speaker 9:          00:44:57       and, and that's what they do. So they're always, you know, tearing stuff up. So anything that's a ground nesters going to be, of course it's going to be in harm's way. So it makes complete sense that that's an issue much against the pig. And one, one sow pig has, you know, 16, you know, between 10 and 20 little ones. Each time they, they,

Speaker 2:          00:45:15       I wonder how, I know Craig out multiple year. Meanwhile a deer's putting off wondering

Speaker 5:          00:45:19       to fall back to the darn deer again. Rights activists feel about pig hunting because that is clearly an animal that you have to control their bodies.

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       Yeah. Like that's the thing in one went to New Zealand. All the animals in New Zealand are not all, not all the animals, but you know. Oh yeah. The game man was around and introduced and there the um, the guys that like to hunt there are always complaining about the greenies, you know, and their complaint about the greenies in New Zealand is the greenies want to kill all the animals. Oh, that's hilarious. They want to preserve something. Why preserve native? They want to preserve native ECO systems. So like these damn greenies would like to get up in the helicopters and shooting all the animals. The opposite. They're greenies are done. Well, you're allowed to do crazy shit. They're like, you can have Canadian goose with a rifle. Right? Oh, you do. Lot crazier now. I mean there's no, they have acted well. They have active programs. They have active programs where there's like government shooters who are just shootings. They have no predators. Well, they can't introduced predators. They can't do that. No, because they have, they have the sheep is a huge, well they didn't like sheep caused a major problem with pollution. Apparently paid their take on is they're not going to introduce a little, they're not going to have to gas. Methane gas like grabbed me. Great.

Speaker 5:          00:46:39       Literally was a problem. Smog was a problem in New Zealand. We looked this up. It was a prophecy from, from there. Yes, from their forest. From the methane gas. But I don't think methane forms the smog. It does some form of smog and it's, it was a major issue in New Zealand. Methane gas was a major smog problem and I don't know if it still is. I doubt they put devices on their asses too. You know, I heard the equipment, they put the bags so dark. This place you got right. But I'm curious about this lead sheet. Flatulence. Oh my God. Solution Law. I believed him because he said look it up. Yeah. Other times he just says he doesn't bullshit. No, I just count and talks a lot, but he doesn't bullshit now. I know what I'm saying. That's incredible. And that amazing. Well that's an issue in California too. I knew it was an issue in Pennsylvania. Parents used to live in Harrisburg and there was an area that I used to drive when I was living in New York. I'd drive to Pennsylvania. There was an area where you could not roll your fucking window down. You couldn't do it. You wouldn't die. My newer pools, just like the little ammonia. Yeah. So bad. It's stocked so horribly. It made you not want to eat meat. It really does.

Speaker 4:          00:47:48       And when, when we, I went to China, uh, when I literally in 1985. Okay. I think it was, in fact, it was 1983 I was with my family once the mainland of China. And I dunno if I were to tell you this, there's one, we go to a restaurant in Canton. Where is that doesn't matter. Oh, you told me about this. And underneath the restaurant we're pigs. So underneath the restaurant were pigs. A lot of pigs. The pigs were eating the shit that, so you, you would take a dump and it would come down and the pigs would eat the shit and then, no, we don't eat all the slops from the restaurant, but they were eating human feces and then they were eating those pigs and then they're reading those pigs.

Speaker 5:          00:48:30       The roads are that joke. It's like that joke. The punchline is, I had lunch with them two weeks ago. Monday, no joke. No, no, my mom. But that was that. That was always like, no, I wasn't that always the job of up of pigs. Didn't they eat really grow stuff like my dad, my dad is always say, you lay there long enough and you'll eat you. That was like is, oh they will. That's the number one animal that kills off life livestock that kills farmers. Oh really? Yeah. Guy died recently. They say he might've had a heart attack, I think it was in Washington state. He fell into is a pigsty and they just fucking devoured him. They found his clothes, like parts of his clothes left. Yeah. They say that the mafia in Italy would fit in that movie snatch. Remember the movie snack and it's in the deadwood. They spoke to the cargo. That's right, but it's true. It is. There it is. There's a scene that lead to your head.

Speaker 4:          00:49:19       Everything. Huh? There's a scene.

Speaker 10:         00:49:22       Clean it up. That guy was awesome to do is feed them two pigs. You've got to start off the picks for a few days. Then the side of a chop top body would look like Carly to a peer side. You've got to shave the edgy a bit button and pull the teeth up for the sake of the piggies digestion. You're cooked through this afterwards of course, but you don't want to go sit in for the pig shit now though. Yeah, they will go through bone like butter. You need at least 16 pigs to finish the job in one setting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through our body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression as Grady as a plague.

Speaker 5:          00:50:16       It is that guy freaking [inaudible]. Those are great character that what a great vines realize. I've never seen that movie. I've never seen snatch. No. Really. Our scene, fucking tremendous

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       guy. Ritchie's masterpiece. Wow. I got to see that. That's a great movie man. Lock stock and two smoking barrels. That's the you, so you never saw the Brad Pitt character. I saw lots of that where he's a boxer. Yeah. Accent. That was what people say. See? Oh yeah, Gypsy is, what's the word? Cock. Cockney what's not cognitive? It's like I talk to me. He's not tipsy accent. They have like a jibberish sort of a way of talking where you really can understand them. It's really difficult. They use rhyming slang and stuff. I've, I've heard it and you can't understand the thing they're saying travels worldwide. I won't lie to you. I travel a great deal. What were we talking about right before the podcast started? Where we're talking about said you have to bring this up on the pilot. About about, um, so I did a podcast today with a guy from crack.com Dan O'brien wrote a really funny book called how to fight presidents.

Speaker 4:          00:51:18       He literally took every president in the history of America to see who is the baddest ass, who is the one guy you wouldn't want to fight and who would win in a fight if they were pitted against each other. It's like it's in some ways the greatest book of all time. And like I said, I go, this is the, this is going to be the greatest podcast of all time. It was the funniest thing because we got into a heavy heated argument about who would win in a fight and you got to put a cup of presidents up at the top of the list. You got to put a blanket cause he was renowned for his physical strength. There it is. It's about he fought vampires to right. Well he did it but he used an ax. He used an ax, but Abe Lincoln was six, four and had, what's that?

Speaker 4:          00:51:54       That disease where your arms are longer, you have really long arms, like longer than your body had crazy England. And he was, he was known to be really strong and, and very, very tough. Like he was, I'm sorry. I think you also have to think of people that lived during that era. There were a lot tougher. They grew up doing everything with their hands, right. Building things. Andrew Jackson was a gentle, I mean, he committed a little something called genocide buck. And you talk to historians, they're like, well, he, he killed a great deal of native Americans with extreme prejudice. So He, I dunno what, he's not a, I wouldn't, that's a strong word. It's a strong EU thing. It's a strong lung disease. I don't think disease transmission counts. I agree with you. Is that what lead he did? He was a soldier and did, I mean he was, uh, he, he clearly probably killed a lot of men with his bare hands.

Speaker 4:          00:52:44       I would've, I mean that was barons, but certainly with a gun or a knife. I mean, he was a pretty warlike fella. Yeah. And in fact challenged. He had a number of duals. Historians are actually, he got shot and live most of his life with a bullet in his rib cage. Shitty guns back then, but he had it cleaned through. He had there. There's a debate how many duals he actually hat when you have, when there's a debate on how many duels [inaudible] president, you're a bad mother fucker or you're an idiot, right? Keep getting a Doula. Well, he got shot because he let the guy take the first shot. He goes, take the first shot guy shot him, and then he shot the guy and live that way for the rest of his life. He had, he had a gaping wound that would cause problems periodically. Anyway, take the first shot. You got to Andrew Jackson, who was six to probably George Washington, six four who was a tough guy. George Washington was six. He was, people weren't that big that I know. He was a giant. I'll tell you six for Jesus Christ. George Washington was as big as George Washington could've beat dog gone money on Doug. George has wooden teeth. He's got a fucking goofy wig on. You pull that wig off, he's all insecure.

Speaker 4:          00:53:55       Yeah, you build that wig off. He's not gonna know what the fuck to do is. You're going to search for his wig. You kicked him in the Dick. Next thing you know, you're pulling out his wooden teeth and beating the shit out of him. There it is money on. But then there was Lyndon Johnson who's also six four but Teddy Roosevelt who practice, who boxed, wrestled and practice judo with the guy who brought you out to the United States, the first judo guy, and was obsessed with all things wrestling and fighting. He was about five, 10 and very thick, but very sickly kid. Died of heart disease, had a weak heart. So I don't know, my thing is Gerald Ford played football and could have played for the bears as a middle linebacker. That says a lot when you play in the NFL. So I might have to go with, we had a huge discussion about this for a good hour with Brian Cowen show and a, it was a good time.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       I got Lincoln. So no, that's not what you're taught. So then he said, I said, what about Barack Obama? And he got quiet. It Dad's a comedian, really good guy. He got quiet and he said, well, I can't be like that. You know, I, I'd rather leave that alone. I said, why? He said, well, I tried not to, you try not to include any living presidents because it caused too much trouble. I said, what do you mean? He said, well, I went through sort of a thing about how, you know, Barack Obama's not that tough a president and it'd be easy to kick his ass. And uh, you know, I was doing it tongue in cheek, you know, you'd probably kick him here and he's kind of skinny and you could take, and he gets a call from the secret service because he posted it as a blog.

Speaker 4:          00:55:19       You Post it as a blog on [inaudible] dot com well, he said the reason the only blog that's not up there anymore is that because he got called down to the federal building, I believe. I think that's what he said. It's on my podcast. And he had to go line by line with these agents on what he meant by what he was saying. And he was like, well, I said, you know, I said Dick Tornado instead of a penis cyclone because it's kind of funnier. He was trying to teach them a humor. These guys were totally fucked with us. He got all nervous. He was like apologizing. He made, they made him take it down and it was a chapter that was somebody from the book I believe so that I was like, we live in America now. You have to be careful when you've threatened the president you will get called. But guys, guys, come on, come on man. I mean, and he took probably can't, they probably can't. Well they tend to probably no way to go. Like yeah, they probably knew. Of course he's joking, but there's a thing that you set in motion a certain size. What happens because they said we will subpoena everybody that made a comment on your on blog, like

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       kick his ass and, and, and, and Dan said, well it's a bunch of 14 year olds. Have Fun with that. And the, the main guy had called him first. He goes, look, I know you're kidding. I know you've got a sense of humor. You've got to go down and talk to these guys. It's just the way it is. Powell had shotgun animal in my bag one time going through the TSA line and Anchorage and they were like, you got shot, go in and I am on your bag. And I'm like, Hey, so I know my brother or I didn't know my brother were Ptarmigan hunting this morning. I kind of like, and they say, and it was like, of course, that makes sense. Of course we know that that's true. Yeah. But no, because you did this, we know. Got to act a certain way and run through a whole set of things and it's really annoying that you had that shit in your bag. Dumb ass. You know,

Speaker 9:          00:57:08       same thing happened to me when I was going up to Alaska last summer. I had three rounds, three or six rounds in a glove pair of gloves that I just threw in the bag at the last minute. And, um, yeah, they, they took that real seriously. They get sniffing around. There you go. There's the no live rounds in your bags or a night. I was, I had no idea. That can be a problem. Yeah. But without the rifle or a gun, they shoot him on. What was I going to do? Hit uh, hit them with a nail biter

Speaker 2:          00:57:36       but you can't even, you can't fly with a shotgun choke. I just got a new icon. Choke. That's the thing like what a shotgun barrel on the end of the barrel. Like there's a monitor, there's constriction or not. And so when you talk about like you hear the term full choke. Okay. Full show cause like tightly constricted anyways. Now they make shotguns. I have a thread now they made shotguns threaded end. Oh yeah. Full choke partial. Cause I always go for the full chunk sodas like improved cylinder, modified cylinder, full show, ski joke. So they make a trend, they make it threaded fitting. They make a threaded thing on the end and you can put in variable chokes. Okay. That one in the middle has a variable show. Okay. Why do I have a boner right now? That's so weird. You call the one on the right as variable choke.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       Oh, I see. So yeah. Fix. All right. So anyways, you can't fly the choke and I just think that's ridiculous. But then I started realizing what have you in like 20 of your buddies all has some dinky little shit gone the part and you're all waiting in line to get on the plane. That's right. You're like, well, it's just a barrel just to barrel on that day. I was like, I just got a trigger. That's why. That's what dad does. National Security. They always talk about now with three d printers that the threat of being on the print your own gun. That's a big, yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:58:49       I was just talking to someone about that. Yeah. I got pulled out a line, uh, flying to Washington DC from Madison or no, from Green Bay, uh, with, uh, some friends lived in the DC area and it was going to help him with a patio. They say, we'll pay for you to come out if you want to help us with this patio. So I'll put that out there if you ever need any patio work, that kind of stuff. And I was late getting to the plane and so I didn't have a, I just had both of my bags. I'm was going to check one and I a Mason's chisel

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       in a stone hammer in there. Okay. So you can't go on there and say, I'm thinking to myself, oh, Hastings chisel and hammer stone here, man. Yeah, you're big enough to actually kill an entire lane, which has two weapons. I know it's weird. Arbitrary about that. Like you can't bring a pool cue on, but you could bring a skateboard. And if I had to fight a guy and he had a pool cue and I had a skateboard, I will fucking, skateboards are really hard to break in there. It'd be hard to land a shot. Well, the pool cue on a guy who's got escape or by the trucks pull cues, break defendant, pool cues break. They break pretty easy. I've seen guys break, get mad at her, a shot and whacked her stick and snap even the, but then you can break the bus. So he could put, just put some kind of rod inside there and make it really tough pool cue.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       You could do that. You could do that, but I'm assuming they're going to actually understand where you're calling from. I mean it's gotta be, but they'll take to let you take deer antlers on. If you've covered the times, you can wreak havoc. I put [inaudible] run show gave shit through the fucking now, by the way, by the way, at the head, there was this story about this huge, this huge, um, there's a story he played in the NFL for a long time as a defensive end. He's a giant man. Are you going to name drop? No, I don't know his name, but he got crazy on the plane. What? Cause he had an, he has, but he's bipolar. He's a, he's not tried to pull the door off the plane. Mid Flight. So he's trying to pull the door off this child. He's 270 pounds. All muscle played in the NFL and nobody knew what to do.

Speaker 4:          01:00:52       He was having an episode finally, I think instead of attacking him because everybody would have died, the stupidest talked him down to sit down. He ended up going to jail for it. But I think about how scary that would be with a giant trying to pull a door off a plane a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. That's scary shit man. Because if you get a plane full of cowards, you really fucked. You know, if you get a plane full of cowards are people with asthma or something and you didn't go real situation going on now, but cowards bowling's nothing probably emboldens the playful of cowards. Quite like so new. Trying to rip the [inaudible] fear overrides the other feeling how long it takes to open up a door. It doesn't take that long. And you know it's actually ready vacuum and turning the law. You can't, you basically can't do it in mid flight.

Speaker 4:          01:01:42       Physical power. Has Anybody ever done it? No. I'll never heard of it. You can blow a door off, but you can't. You know, so, Oh and also everything Brian Collins says just getting validated, unless Brian writes makes all these [inaudible] USB drive flow is a little documents. Here's a really cool piece of trivia. Here's a crazy, I just found out this is a crazy piece of trivia. If you shot a 30 odd six at a plane window at the cockpit window, it would, it would stop it. The window. It stopped. I didn't, that's a problem I should say. I mean yeah cause to stop. Good. Cause you could potentially hit something at four or 500 miles long. That's how thick it is. It actually would stop a really fucked is that they go down because of birds. Like that's a real common sucking in the engines. Yeah. Yeah. That dude to land in the Hudson. Do you know how they keep birds away from runway hunters up higher peep they poisoned them and shoot

Speaker 11:         01:02:41       [inaudible] what do you mean to say is like no, in addition to that? Well for [inaudible] say no the fucking guys. Right. Well, in addition to that, in Afghanistan for example, when you know where they went, how boom in Kabul and then come to heart, where were they? When they, when

Speaker 4:          01:03:04       they're always taken off, right. So how do they keep birds away? They had a lot of them. Do you know if they do take one guest? Come on. Think that's kind of why I did better than taking guests. I just named a litany. But you're, but you're a liar. So here's the thing. No, you're right. But here's what they do. They get Peregrine Falcons, they get to peregrine falcons and they literally fly the Para Peregrine Fly Falcons in a circle around the earth and they stay the fuck away from, yeah, they stay away from the, from the, from the Falcon I, which was surprising to me that all of them to see the Peregrine Falcon, they're like, I want to stay away from that. And all the birds stay down [inaudible] transmitter on the falcons. So Nolan's sucks at news engine. Well I don't, but they, the guy had it on his arm and that's how they did it. So that's pretty surprising. I didn't know that time of European contact, we had x number of whitetail deer living in this country and they were nearly decimated at a point in time. Now we have 100 million deer, far, far, far more white tail deer live here now than at any time in history. Doug will jump in at any point. When Doug was a kid, what was a big deal, Doug?

Speaker 9:          01:04:17       It was a big deal to see a deer around our area.

Speaker 11:         01:04:21       Wow. I mean, he would run home and tell him hello Dan

Speaker 9:          01:04:23       car and drive out and mean you go out in the evening. I mean, we still drive, get out in the evening and drive around and look for deer. But you know, you're really disappointed if you don't see any. But, uh, you went up north hunting my grandfather.

Speaker 12:         01:04:34       MMM.

Speaker 9:          01:04:35       Yeah. According to my dad who never makes anything up,

Speaker 12:         01:04:39       uh,

Speaker 9:          01:04:40       hunted deer would go over to the Baraboo hills on the edge of the driftless area and that was the only place that were white tail deer. And I, as a kid, I just don't remember seeing that many deer. My Dad used to go up north deer hunting and they would bring dear back from up there. But then when I got to be 14 when I was in, um, you know, in high school and started playing basketball and whatnot,

Speaker 12:         01:04:59       uh,

Speaker 9:          01:05:00       we couldn't go away for opening weekend. We went to north the first couple of years, so we'd go up north and hunt like crazy to see one or two deer and, and not get one. And uh, so then when I was 14, um, we started hunting on the front and I'm like, wow, look at all these, I got a deal right away. Um, but, but you're absolutely right that the management of the, of the white tail deer in Wisconsin is a real success story, even though, you know, newspaper articles and, and whatnot to the contrary that it's been such a,

Speaker 5:          01:05:31       well, some would argue too much of his success cause it wasn't till I was like the, for the last few years, you couldn't shoot a buck until you killed a doe.

Speaker 9:          01:05:38       Right. Um, we had a thing called earn a buck. In fact, we still do. After you shoot your first buck, um, Kinda got into that whole thing about how many tags can you get. And it's like, well, in our area you can get as many, you can choose as many deers you have bullets for. Um, but you're absolutely right and there's such an adaptable creature. My sister lives up in the town, a city called ash caution on it. It's a, they live kind of on the edge of town on that. Really, I'm that much to the edge of town, but there's a little a quarry there and uh, armory and whatnot. And they have wildlife problems there. A deer and Turkeys both. Um, and they've had to do a whole thing where they brought in, they bring in snipers to shoot him because there were a bunch of bow hunters that said that they would do it. Well, just let us come in and we'll

Speaker 5:          01:06:25       do it. We'll be like, well, why would we have the public do it when we can pay government [inaudible] government officials as a private private snipe? Why? Why would we have the public pay to be able to do it when we could just pay someone else to come in and do it real discrete and quiet. That's what's going on right now in the Hamptons. The stories coming from the Hamptons, they have a huge deer problem in the Hamptons where all these multimillion dollar estates and China houses up there and they're going to hire snipers. Yeah, they're dicking around with trying to give the deer a conscious contraceptives. Higher numbers of dollars are going to spend trying to eradicate these deer with birth control and with snipers. Wow.

Speaker 9:          01:07:01       I had a landscape business in door county, which is the thumb of Wisconsin and you know, so it's a lot of folks from Chicago and Milwaukee and Madison. We have places up there and one person would want to raise hostas and all these exotic flowers and whatnot and the next one would want to see deer. So

Speaker 5:          01:07:19       exactly. I mean you pull into places and then you'd be laying right in the bed. My mother in Connecticut, she spent like literally like, I don't know how long planting this beautiful garden. I remember getting like flowers and then the minute they bloom man, literally it was just a decimation of deer came in and just ate them all. My mother went to the store to go find a crossbow cause I want to apply a crossbow and the guy goes for what? She goes, cause I want to kill all the deer on my, uh, on my property. She had a garden. It wasn't a big, it wasn't like it was a yard and the guy goes, you can't kill a bunch of deer. It's not legals. He goes, I don't care. I'm going to kill the deer. And then he had to explain to her like what kind of line. It was a little more involved or more involved in that, but she literally was going to kill, you know, she never shot across pope, but she was gonna. She thought it'd be easy. The client

Speaker 9:          01:08:03       and door county, uh, uh, older woman that um, like the deer, but she really liked all her, her different gardens and whatnot as well. And somewhere along the line she got this idea that if you buried wine bottles upside down, sticking out of the ground in a perimeter around your place, that the deer would hit those and then they wouldn't, they wouldn't come in and

Speaker 7:          01:08:23       for blow their mind and they'd be like, no way am I going in there

Speaker 8:          01:08:26       glass. So she was, yeah, so she was, she was drinking a lot of wine to surround that place too. But uh, which I may have been a part of the skews, but you'd go into here what they got going on in this area.

Speaker 7:          01:08:38       Where are we on it in November is you know what's going on in the state of Wisconsin, a bunch of other states that you have CWD they cause chronic wasting disease. Chronic wasting disease is the deer and elk aversion of mad cow. So it's with, with Kyle, we say mad cow or like with Jacob. Jacob. And then you have, and sheep scrapey deer and elk, they call it chronic wasting disease. So how are they so far they haven't found it. And some people say like, we wouldn't know yet, but they haven't found where any human has contracted, you know, hasn't contracted mad cow from, well it's Jacob Christ felt in the human, has a contracted from deer. No, it hasn't happened yet, but a lot of states are taking measures to try to get a handle on this and they're, they're taken where you can't move some, some states you can't move deer bones from other states into the state.

Speaker 7:          01:09:30       You can't move to your bones out of the state. Um, one thing that could be driving the transmission of this is just having way too many deer. Another thing that drives transmission of, of, of deer diseases, bringing them into like an unnatural proximity's is baiting dear. So you go out and put a bunch of corn down, you get eight deer standing, their nose, the nose, the nose. I'll eat eating corn. It's not, they're not configured in a way that's really replicable in a natural setting, like dear tend to graze a little bit further apart and they're not sharing. Swapping spit quite so much in Wisconsin. Got The CWD area where they're trying to Cole knock back numbers.

Speaker 9:          01:10:06       So we're on the northern edge of what they call the CWD management zone. And actually right before I came out here, I check the map to see how close the deal they test your, obviously they test here for um, and it, the, the latest ones are about three miles south of the farm. So next year, um, everything's getting tested. Um, you'll send the heads in to get tested. But actually what they did, the friend of mine actually has a check station now. And um, I, and I didn't know that, um, this year, but uh, she's, she was trained to take the lymph nodes so you don't have to take the head and do all that kinds of stuff. So it's much simpler process. But the thing is, no one really knows what it means yet. Well, right. And, and they have all these recommendations. You guys remember when, when we were butchering, we were, other than the front legs, everything was boned and you're staying and you stay away from the spine and

Speaker 8:          01:10:56       that's where you get it, right? So if you eat them, if you get the meat, you know, the preop, like the pre ounce concentrate in the brain and brain and spinal fluid, spinal column. So even if it was a deer that had it

Speaker 9:          01:11:07       by not, you know, messing with the spine and whatnot, you'll be okay. That's the,

Speaker 7:          01:11:13       okay. Because the way they were bumping it from animal to animal is, you know, it was like bone meal. So yeah, that's, that's how your transmitter on. And one of the big arguments against Penn raising livestock to have like full hunting facilities is that CWD jump to our wild herds from captive animals. Um, I think the ground, the ground zero was in Wisconsin or Minnesota since the first time at jump.

Speaker 9:          01:11:40       Yeah. Uh, uh, south of us. And if you in Wisconsin. Yeah. So, um, on the, on the south side of the Wisconsin River, and it was interesting because you were a specular, had some information that I hadn't heard before about how it had been transferred and whatnot, but raising a whitetail deer as a, uh, as a, as a domesticated animals actually become fairly big. One of the big things is antlers.

Speaker 7:          01:12:07       Yeah. Cause he can grow bigger antlers if you've given them all this

Speaker 9:          01:12:10       and whatnot. And you know, it's in Wisconsin that is regulated by the Department of Agriculture, trade and consumer protection. Whereas wild dude, so those are domesticated deer in wild deer are the purview of the Department of natural resources and the two don't. So the, the, the deer farmers want to stay in the Department of Agriculture and the DNR would like to have a little more control over that.

Speaker 7:          01:12:38       Yeah. Because if you cause like the, the wildlife that's held in the public trust is that detriment from a lot of that deer. That's exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:12:45       Well, yeah. I'm, I'm always, I'm actually amazed in the two times I've hunted how, well, and maybe I'm wrong about this, but how well the government does in conservation efforts and in policing, you know, the whole hunt game.

Speaker 7:          01:12:59       Look what happened when we didn't, man, you got up in the 1920s 1930s and we will, we were not just running out, I mean we are gonna run out of a lot of game animals. I mean it was on the horizon that we're going to lose many, many species of dogs. We're going to lose the wild Turkey. I'm going to lose dear. Lose the elk, lose the big horn sheep all to hunting on, on on. Yeah, the perfect storm of things. Unregulated market hunting being one of the, I'm not trying to downplay the role, one of the principal factors, but it was going on in conjunction with a lot, you know a lot of habitat destruction north things, but yeah, just shooting it and selling it. Unregulated. Hunting what animals and then not even like not regulating what kind of weapons you use. You could set charges, pack with ball bearings up in trees.

Speaker 7:          01:13:40       The blow roosting turkeys out of the trees. So he's just like, it was a free for all. And it was Daniel Boone man. He killed 108 hundred 16 bears in one year. One time. Hold on. The big on the Big Sandy and Kentucky. So wow. Unregulated. Mark did cause a lot of damage when it came to 1920 to 1930s that's when we got this idea where we were going to get aggressive and we didn't do it a second, you know too soon. And we came up with certain things like we have hunting bag limits seat like a a ban on the sale of game wild game. So when you're, when you go into a restaurant, when you go and do a wild game restaurant in the US, you're getting imported meat or you're getting farmers where they're taking out taking d, You're raising them on the farm, killing them, run into as a livestock model on wild animals and settlement and you're not getting like, I didn't know that hunter killed while game unless they're importing it, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:14:35       But then even now they used to import a lot of stuff from New Zealand. But even now, most of that when you, when you're getting red deer, which is like most, the most common Venice and sold in restaurants is red deer often from New Zealand, sometimes from Scotland. Even the stuff from New Zealand now they're just, it's just farmed. They used to sell some wild stuff, but the, but the industry's changed so much. Is there an animal that is still in danger of being extinct in this country? As far as like grizzlies or not? There are many, many animals that are endangered or become an extinct. But no, not no game animals, no game animals. There's a game animals. I mean most of them are expanding or stable and the states under mandates. So there's lots of, there's like little understood. I mean there are many like frog species, all kinds of things that are in huge trouble. Bird species that are in big trouble. But right now with game animals, I take that back. Not in the danger of being extinct, but in danger of being big trouble. Sage grouse because of many manufacturers. Um, sage grouse are, are hurting right now and are, some people are starting to I at four for endangered species protection. It could have. What about eagles? Like there's, I mean, they're not a game. Animal. Eagles are kicking it. You mean Bald Eagles? They're the new cro.

Speaker 8:          01:15:44       Oh Man. Yeah, that's, that's a huge success. The new cro, that was something that was really a big deal to see when I was a kid. Bald Eagle. We have them come through the farm all the time. Ddt Man, all they had to do. What about Golden Eagles? Hold on a second. DDT, DDT was killing eggshells too thin. They crushed, crushed, crushed her own egg. So that was what they were using for pesticides. Just turn it, turn it shit

Speaker 7:          01:16:08       around so fast. Yup. Yeah, yeah. Wow. Not like would docs, will they realize the wood ducks? We almost thought we were going to lose woodchucks. Well they realize with darks, old dead trees like wood ducks are cavity nesting doll. It's kind of a funny, odd idea. But this wood duck like lands and damn tree walks into a hole in the tree and as the cavity Nestor, various, you know, factors at play. We lost a lot of these big old cavity trees. We people brought the wood duck

Speaker 8:          01:16:33       backed by. This guys are like the hunt darks, going out and building these little things to look like a mailbox on a post. We had a couple of them up. Well we weren't by those places. But then even in our forestry program on the farm, we leave wildlife trees. Um, and Mark O'Neill, you mark them with a big w and just got all the guys in it. If it's got a kv one, it's not worth a shit anyways probably cause you're gonna cut a nude and it's gonna be rotten wood to wildlife habitat. But you make these fake ones by putting a mailbox on a pole, take some sheet 10 and tack it on her. So raccoons can climate and all of a sudden, like overnight, boom, wood ducks are back. No pesticides, certain

Speaker 7:          01:17:06       pesticides, uh, being, uh, a problem with bees. Are they doing

Speaker 13:         01:17:10       anything about that? Same with colony collapse disorder. Yeah, they've got real issues. So funny you bring that up. Um, one of the things that I'm going to do when I get back to Wisconsin is too, um, there is in the, in the latest farm bill, uh, some funding for encouraging farmers to plant bee friendly Forbes in their, in their pastures. Um, I again, right by where Ryan and I were hunting out in that open field, there's, I planted about two thirds of an Acre of, of pollinator habitat. Um, what does that mean? Like, like bring even flowers particular, yeah, pretty, you know, so that there's, there's flowers at different stages of the season. Um, you know, how much is two thirds of an acre going to do? I don't know. But since I'm putting so much of the farm back into, into a conservation reserve program, which means we're planning it to grasses and Forbes and whatnot, um, when I get back, I'm really going to look into this and cause a lot of the interesting things, a lot of like Alfalfa and clover and those are things that deer like too.

Speaker 13:         01:18:13       And Turkey's like and other wildlife like, and then during the flowering time, of course, the Beazer part of it, but it's kind of cool in this most recent farm bill in the conservation measures, it's, I mean it's not, it was like $3 million for the entire driftless area or the Midwest. I'm sorry, not just the driftless area, but um, you know, when you start to parse that up into bags of seed that people would go into the other, I'll overseed my pasture with it or yeah, that mixed in with my CRP and whatnot and hell, I'll do that without them paying me to do it. So That's interesting. You know, what I've heard is that there's also some connection to genetically modified crops at some crops have been genetically modified to make them more resistant to certain bugs and that this is what's fucking up bs is that well, truth in that.

Speaker 13:         01:18:56       I think there's truth in that. The GMO is certainly could have a part of it. We were talking about her daughter at your daughter before and my daughter who's 17 who's taken the biotech class right now. That's one of the things that they've been talking about. And I, my hackles go up when you say GMOs. And interestingly, she kind of talked me down from it because she's, you know, on both sides of the, of the thing. I honestly think that the, um, pesticides probably have more to do with it than anything. I mean, we're using insecticides on everything, you know, and the idea that, you know, in our area you saw it who were, the crops are essentially two things, corn and soybeans. And so you've got these monocultures and you know, there's, and they're all, those are all GMOs. Roundup ready. That's the big, you know, the big thing, what does that mean? Roundup? Roundup herbicide glyphosate, which is a nonselective herbicide means it'll kill everything. They recommend it,

Speaker 8:          01:19:52       but not to cry because it was regarded as having the toxicity of coffee.

Speaker 13:         01:19:56       Yeah. It's

Speaker 8:          01:19:57       like if you, if you went to drink the stuff, you know, but [inaudible] been what that's been, what people have said for a long time later. Roundup has always been the friendly herbicide because doesn't it, when it

Speaker 13:         01:20:08       hits, it does his job on the plant and it goes into the plant and the plant dies down and dies. The, the, um, doesn't it grow itself to death in some way or like, well, that's right, but the chemical then, um, doesn't translocate in the soil. There's chemicals, herbicides and whatnot. I was just spraying one, um, a couple of days ago that I'm real careful with it. I'm out in the woods spring, um, uh, basal bark applications to kill undesirable trees. And you're careful with that stuff. Undesirable trees. Yeah. What kind of trees are undesirable in this case? Red Maple. I remember the woods where we walked, where all it was just the big giant trees where it opened up and it was, I'm trying to regenerate red and white oak in there and they're red and white oak are a sun loving species, so they, they, that some needs to hit that hit the ground.

Speaker 13:         01:20:56       They're real. They w oaks don't grow real fast either. And the first, their first two or three years, they spend all their energy sort of building the root system. And then after about their fifth year, they'll take off. But in between all this stuff has grown over the top of them, the, um, the, you know, the perennial stuff like burdocks and that kind of stuff don't seem to bother it too much. Um, because they're gone, you know, quite a bit. But it's the shade of the, of the other trees. So it's a fast read. Maple is a faster growing tree, so they'll get up over the top shade out the oaks, and if you don't control that, the red maple, not sugar maple red maple will take over, kill the oaks off. And now you've got red maple. So were wrong with you. Get into the deer thing too though.

Speaker 13:         01:21:39       I mean the deer effect on red. Yeah. And the deer, the deer, the deer effect on, um, on red and white oak is they like white oak acorns. In fact, they prefer white oak acorns as do turkeys, but they like to browse on red oak seedlings. So the oaks just don't stand a chance. Part of the reason why we're trying to kill somebody dear. You wanted to know why, why you love Red Oaks? Don't like the bagels in the driftless area. It's the area drifted the glaciers and mining really flattened area. I'd keep going down the, in the driftless area, it's a pathway from migratory songbirds. First of all, and migratory songbirds come up the Mississippi River and that's that. They're traveling long distances, the oaks or one of their favorite nesting areas in that sort of thing. So, um, oaks were a big part of our forest for, for quite a while.

Speaker 13:         01:22:35       Um, because of things like fire and that sort of thing, which we don't have anymore. So what's happening is there, the percentage of all kinds of landscape is a lot less. So when you have an opportunity or what we're encouraging land owners through this network of forest land owners that I work with, when you have an opportunity to regenerate, okay, you have a good spot to do it. They're not every spot where oak is growing now isn't necessarily a good spot to regenerate oak, but when you have a good spot to do that you should because it's disappearing from our landscape and it's affecting wildlife, it's affecting all those sort of things, but also the migratory songbirds. So it's really interesting how it's all kind of together. It's fascinating the management aspect of that, that people have decided to take a concerted effort to make one plant grow and make another plant dye and encourage you know, you to reduce deer population because the deer hammering the seedlings,

Speaker 7:          01:23:27       it's an, it's an advertent effort to correct an inadvertent wrong, I mean so much of our self as like we have, we live in disturbed ecosystems now. Like in debt that disturbance brings about the radically transformed, you know, biome that we live in.

Speaker 13:         01:23:41       Right. Why do we have so many white tail deer? Well, because we have all these, we have everything that they need. They have crops that we have crops. So we have covered, we have water, we have all that. You know, you made the comment, um, I don't know if it was on a podcast or when we were just talking. You said they're like, deer here are so different than the mule deer. They're like farm animals that you have to shoot. Yeah. It's kind of, you know, that's kind of right. Um, yeah. Deer, Geese, Turkeys, crows. They really, you know, because of farming. There they are. And there are some, there are so many of them. So to my mind it's sort of a bonus, but the, you know, that we have that, but at the same time you can't let it run. You can't let any of those species overrun things.

Speaker 13:         01:24:20       So it's uh, you know, it's a balancing act. And so on our 400 acre farm, even in just a little over 200 acres of woods, I have like 16 different, um, uh, areas where we're doing different kinds of management based on what is there that a hundred years ago you wouldn't have to, had to have done that. We didn't have invasive species, which is one of the huge issues that we have. You know, you get to close turn off, you buy that stuff called multi flora rose. Um, invasive species are a big problem. Um, encouraging the different kinds of, of, of trees and therefore encouraging different kinds of wildlife. It's all in, it's all a part of it. Um, unfortunately, you know, Brian was saying before that he thought that the, uh, uh, the government agencies are doing a great job and you know, I'd probably get sick, I'll probably get skewered for this, but I think that is the case.

Speaker 13:         01:25:17       The Department of natural resources in the state of Wisconsin does a heck of a job. They're horrible at public relations, but they're really good. They're really good at, um, counting and understanding numbers and, and you know, what are carrying capacity and it's an inexact science. It's not our friend pet Stephen, my friend Pat Dirk and writes about this a lot and one of the things he says are our hunters out there who think it's like a bathtub. Like you can turn the water on to get more deer and then you shut it off and then you can pull the plug in. That's not really the case. And you'll hear grumbling hunters talk about how the dnrs killing all the deer. Well, I, you know, honestly, I've never seen the department of natural resources.

Speaker 7:          01:25:55       Yeah. Every, yeah, every state's got it. So you get like a department of fish and game department, fish, wildlife and parks or

Speaker 13:         01:26:00       the government agency that's controlling, um, hunting in each, in each place. Could you elaborate though when you were saying this, cause I want to know how are they bad at public relations? Um, when CWD start, when CW, the chronic wasting chronic wasting disease, um, was discovered in Wisconsin. It's only really only been in the last 12 years. Let's, yeah, in the early two thousands, um, one of the things that they came out with was we need to eradicate the disease. In order to do that, we have to kill all the deer in this area. Well, if my farm was in that area, I'm not going to be, I'm going to say, well, I don't know if we need to. I mean you said there's a couple of sick dear, do we need to kill all the deer? And then they kind of went into this sort of heavy handed government attitude of here's what we really need to do. Um, whereas you, you probably realize this, that you were here, you weren't, we weren't really following government regulations on our farm. Look at that deer, deer, that's a deer with CWC dam and that, by the way, by the way, by the way, Mr [inaudible] that came from from farms, correct? Like that came from Deere farms, right?

Speaker 7:          01:27:04       Well, I came across some livestock. It's alive. It's a Eurasian livestock diseases cross to, um, got into some wild herds or I'm sorry, got into some domesticated deer. Hurts. Yeah. Domesticated deer kept kept captivities captivity but was not originally on a commercial facility. It wasn't like a guy out there trying to sell fo hunts. It was a research facility and there were deer coming up and smelling knows what the deer inside his research facility. And that's what they think. Correct me if I'm wrong. This is, this is everywhere on the web for you guys.

Speaker 13:         01:27:38       Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hold on a second. That, so the, the, there's a fence between the, the domesticated deer and the wild deer and they touched each other somehow or another. There's a fence. I don't, I really don't have knowledge of that because it's, I, I've, I've asked a lot of questions about where, how did this start in Wisconsin? There's a lot of people don't seem to have the answer and you don't get that answer from the government guys. And then you talk to the private guys. But if you go into southwest Wisconsin, there's a area, um, um, uh, county there, and the town that I'm thinking of is Hollandale. And if you look at a CWD map, you'd just, it just, it was just massive. So there was a, you know, sort of ground zero, um, and I don't know

Speaker 7:          01:28:18       how many states is it in Novo?

Speaker 13:         01:28:20       Well, it's in Illinois now too, but they speculated this came from out west is, I mean the thought really well because he had been in, there you go. Yeah. Yeah. So, wow, that's crazy. Our farm is up where the CWD or some other states have had some CWD farm is where the, the top part of the D is on CWD behind the thing and they're right in there. Yeah. So that's where it, um, so that's six, 10 in 2005. And if you were to find a, uh, a more recent map in the DNR has, has those out there. Um, it, it, it's just spreading and it's being spread. And I, this makes sense to me that there are so many deer in some areas that they're, especially young bucks are getting pushed

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       out because you know, big daddy doesn't want them around and so they get pushed out and they're the ones who are um, there you go. This scary disease man. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:29:12       we don't know. But that's the thing is like we don't know if it is or not because there are all manner of wildlife diseases, some imported, some, some that have always been here that periodically come through and wipe out. You know, 70, 80, 90%. You got blue tongue tularemia in rabbits, all kinds of things like now. And then you get a bunch of animals, the animals get sick, a ton of them die. You have some disease, disease tolerant individuals and it comes back. One thing we try to do when I say we, like I worked for the government. One thing that, that our wildlife model generally tries to do is take out some of the peaks and valleys, you know, um, I'm impatient with people who get to easily overly critical with state fish and game agencies. Whereas I think in the United States of America do a pretty phenomenal job considering, and when Doug talks about like bad public relations is you make some management decisions and the way guys find out about the management decisions, they open up the rule books.

Speaker 7:          01:30:08       There's no explanation of why. It's just like, it might be that, you know what dude, you can't kill. You know, used to be able to kill a doe. Now you can't kill a don't county. Everybody gets really mad. And they could go down and be like, why is that? And there'd be some really well thought, scientifically based decision about, wow is a bad idea for this year to do it. But people just see it and they go like, oh, it's the, it's the right wing is the left wing. It's the Cuckoo's, you know, [inaudible]. They don't really even bother to really put forth like why we're making these decisions we're making and insurance companies, insurance triple a, I shouldn't point out one individually. Insurers are generally a force for wanting less Deere agricultural interests. I'm generalizing agricultural interests with Jerilyn, your force running less Deere guys that want to go out and hunt or generally forced one more year.

Speaker 6:          01:30:55       But I heard that the, that, that the biggest pollution source of pollution I may be wrong is not even cars or anything. It's agricultural runoff. Like that's, that's the big threats. Hog farms are bad, right? Am I wrong about that? Fertilizer, phosphorous in the fertilizer going into the water source, you know, those sort of things that cue nitrates in the, in many years in the water yet in that, that's a huge concern. I mean, yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:31:17       Can you tell that story about that trout stream in that God had all that frozen knurling and out? Can you tell that story?

Speaker 6:          01:31:22       Well, so, uh, south of us there's a class one trout stream and a guy names like titties, trout fishing. Yeah. Well for southwest Wisconsin. Anyway. What does that good, good. Oh, titties Michigan in Michigan for two. That's an expression. But it's hilarious. Titties lady. Like that car is Cherry. That stream is titties. I haven't heard that. I've heard Cherry. Yeah. But if it's chuck full of fish, if you're feeding your car with chuck this, you'd be like brushing their titties in Michigan. Apparently in Wisconsin. It's nobody says no Steve or analysis titties. He's he like my wife's nickname, man. I'll pull it up. Saved like that on my phone. Nothing wrong with that. So, uh, what are we talking about? Oh, tell him the story about boat. Like a, just a, like a, like a occurrence, you know. Okay. So what happened

Speaker 9:          01:32:17       that was, uh, their, their uh, storage maneuver, storage, uh, regulations and whatnot in times when you're supposed to spread manure times when you're not, and then we get these huge megafarm, it's like, you know, again, when I was going to be, you saw that barn and that milk cows, we milk 40 cows in there. Well, 40 cows in the barn during the wintertime. You know, once a day you'd go out with a load of manure and spread it on the fields and you know, it wasn't that big of a deal. Now you're talking about thousands of cows in a barn, liquid manure going to these huge storage facilities and there's semis driving this stuff around. Well, in this instance, this wasn't, this was like sort of a medium sized Pharma but 500 milk cows. So the guy was doing things pretty much right, spread manure, but he spread it on, on frozen, uh, snow and ice and whatnot with a buffer strip back from the trout stream. But it rained and melted into the trout stream that went and wiped them out.

Speaker 6:          01:33:16       All those fish went tits up, such as I was still tits, tits up. So did some justice. I'm learning so much. Yeah. So,

Speaker 9:          01:33:32       you know, one would argue, well, let's, we should be regulating that. Well, right. But then there's the concern that while we're regulating things to death, and this sort of goes back to the deer hunting thing, um, you know, in the eighties and nineties, the deer population went, just peeked in Wisconsin. Is just huge. I mean, you saw, you saw, you thought you saw a lot of um, do your opening day and by the way, you didn't,

Speaker 6:          01:33:54       by the way, by the way. Yeah. I mean there were days when I would see 75 year opening day they would come running through a group would come running through. Yeah. Um, and, and it's not good though, right? No, it's not good. That's the point. Somewhere in between is, is there's a balance. You guys get pretty used to that guys get used to it. That's exactly right. I'll go out and sit and while I want to see it here, when I go out, I'm on the shoot

Speaker 9:          01:34:18       on every time. Well, you know, then they call it shooting and killing, not hunting. You know, you

Speaker 6:          01:34:23       know, it's interesting during this podcast I put up a picture on Instagram or that pig that I shot and I have had a fucking tidal wave of people mad at me. Is that right pig? Not cool man. Dude. I mean, I don't know how many of them are cause you shop all day because you shot a non native animal that these guys have been eating their entire fricking life in bacon form and had the audacity to like actually come face to face with the animal. Yeah, I mean the, the, this, the fucking comments on, on Instagram, it's quite hilarious. Just tap tapping way

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       over their self righteous shit. Heads come on. [inaudible] you need a filter thing. Like where you can filter out everyone who's not vegan and then like at least go like, okay the vegans, you know, they have some moral right. Some consistency, you know, I don't even think it's sad. I mean it's just like people just don't want to see a dead animal. They don't want to see it. It's this weird disconnect that we have that we talked about on your show. We this weird disconnect that people have about their food and they feel, even if they're, they're meat eaters and if they're wearing leather shoes, they feel like they can take the moral high ground and say there's something wrong with you posing. Especially because apparently people don't like the fact that I'm smiling. I say, you're going to me. You're glad you're, aren't you glad?

Speaker 5:          01:35:39       Because it just got all kinds of pork. Yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy. Grin. I got 200 pounds of pork and a I shot at at five 15 we have 15 minutes left in the day. It was the last chance of romance. No, you should. You should apologize for being happy about having a windfall of me. It looks like a good shot. It was a great shot. I'm sorry, I'm picking, never knew what was going on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shot a pig perfectly. 160 yards and I didn't cry and I'm crying. I'm coming over to eat some of that today. Come on. I've got a smoker, man. I bought a beautiful western smoker. I'm brining the pig as we as we speak and brining a ham. Nice. Why don't we, why don't we farm venison the way we farm cows? Paying attention. [inaudible] I know we do, but I I, but we don't do it a lot is what I'm saying. Like, well, I'm surprised that we don't, it's such good meet. Why don't we do it as much as we do with calcium

Speaker 7:          01:36:29       problem with, um, one thing is prom with disease transmission. We've been talking about and there's the, there's a thing where there's an aesthetic issue and there is that, I mean there's, there's a demand for it. The demands met, there's arguments to be made before. One of the arguments against it is we have like an obligation to protect native wildlife. Right. All right. So keep it native and there's, and there's a heritage of having these animals as wild animals of some people feel, myself included, is some people feel is that there's a, that these ants, there's a sacredness of these animals as wild creatures, you know, and we try to like foster their wellbeing. And

Speaker 13:         01:37:15       from a practical standpoint, um, you know, I don't know how much you guys noticed, but there's some fences around the, the barnyard and whatnot at our place there, four strand Barb wire fences and it kinda mediocre fences is what I would put, the cattle won't bother. They just walk over to him as long as cattle got hay in the, in the band and whatnot is what kind of walk over and you might get the occasional ones like ah, I think I wanted to get out today.

Speaker 5:          01:37:39       Yeah, like the one that destroyed almost ended your marriage cause they your wife's guard. Yeah. Well I left the gate open so it wasn't really that, that almost ended your marriage. It's fucking shaky. Is that ground you're saying? [inaudible] it was, yeah. Well it was a beautiful car,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Huh? He was a hanging garden. There was a hanging garden. I should say something about my wonderful wife. Most feature's actually really cool. Yeah. She was very understanding of the whole thing after her. You have to understand that she puts so much time and energy and love into that garden. You've, you want to see my wife smile, call her name when she's in her garden and her head will come up and she'll smile. That she just fucking fun. It's good for you man. Much like hunting in a way. There's a primal sort of a connection that we have to gardening. We grow our own food in my house, we grow tomatoes, we have cucumbers, Broccoli, and it's delicious. We Cook it needed. It's a some really satisfying about growing something and put your hands in the dirt and it's equally satisfying hunting your own food.

Speaker 1:          01:38:40       Yeah. You know, I know a lot of people don't like that cause the hunting park cause they connected to cruelty, but uh, it's, it's a primal thing. It's a primal thing. Oh, I should point out that even though a lot of people have been angry at me way more people are supporting me, I should say that a lot of people like to focus on the negative way more positive comments. I've, that picture went up 10 minutes ago is 3,950 likes already. Yeah. So it's more positive than negative, but there's just a lot of hypocritical bullshit out there and you got to take the hit in order to sort of get that subject out there. It's one of the things about it that I, I find a men now it's up to 4,000 as we speak. One of the things that I think is important is to take that hit is to get that conversation going and I think a lot of people that said the negative things, then they, it's a knee jerk thing. It's because we've been shielded from where food comes from. We've been shielded from how do you get meat, but you don't get meat from a seed. Okay. You get get meat from an animal and it has to die in order for me to, and the seat you're sitting in and you and your shoes, you're wearing no shit. Right? I got these motherfuckers at office depot. How many cows had a die for this? Nobody has a problem with me wearing a murdered animal. Animal Skin.

Speaker 5:          01:39:52       If you got a photo of you smiling with the new leather couch noted, give a shit. Right? That's so true, right? No one's smiling from your cash. You're really, you're on cow skin. Have a steak from the supermarket and you're smiling. I'm cooking. I've put up a hundred pictures of me cooking on the grill with a big smile on my face. No one cares. You have one picture of the actual intact animal and you can see his face. It's like, I have this joke about how you, you can kill an animal but you can't fuck it. But what you can do is kill it and cut it into a bite size portion, meal size portion and jerk off with it. You can use that to wrap it around your Dick and jerk off. And no one could really say anything because we have this weird, we have weird disconnect. You would not going to jail for that. Can't go to jail for jerking off with a chicken cutlet. But if they call you, caught you in the middle of fucking a chicken, most likely a cop's gonna fucking take you down and have a talk. At least at the very least, they're going to go with the fuck is wrong with you. I'm tired of my hands. I want to call my friend right now as a common San Francisco caught yet, dude, fucking at this picture. Here's

Speaker 6:          01:40:53       another thing that Steve Vernella and I had a conversation about the other day about, about people who complain about hunting. But every fucking restaurant except for a tiny percentage serves me like you're, you're dealing with murder houses all over the country. I mean, essentially animal murder houses every fucking burger king, every McDonald's, every other, almost every regular restaurant, Coco's fucking Red Barn, whatever it is that you're serving food at. Those are murdered animals. But we have this weird disconnect. The, this is a picture of me with duck in the window. No one complained. No one complained. Why? Because I didn't kill those ducks. That was you and I when we were in Toronto. Ooh, yummy. We're going to eat Chinese food. No one gives a shit. Oh, that's great. I love the Anthony Bourdain show. He goes and eats it a bunch of places. He eats murder. That's what he's eating. He's eaten murder everywhere. But we are shielded because we're a bunch of fucking babies were shielded from that.

Speaker 13:         01:41:50       Well, there's certainly a hypocrisy to it. Um, one of my, uh, uh, an old friend of mine, uh, was eating veal ordered veal one night. And, and I'm not a big fan of Villanova because I've been a part of raising them. We had a neighbor who he used to raise the braised veal and honestly it was, to me it was inhumane. And, uh, anyway, uh, I said to this friend of mine, Geez, you know, you know about how veal is raised and how it's handled and everything. He took a cut out of it, put his mouth, said this one is already dead.

Speaker 6:          01:42:21       So tell these guys about that. Tell these guys about that, that time you, uh, did that cost them slot or for that person gave him a picture of the thing?

Speaker 13:         01:42:31       So, um, uh, some, some years ago, um, we, uh, I, I gave some relatives a half of a beef for a present and uh, so I delivered some of the meat already and we are bringing the rest of it. And they were going to have this big meal while they had just beautiful steaks and roasts mean they made several things, wonderful cooks, and they invited the neighbors over and here's, they bring their couple of daughters along. And, and on the farm we had a pen that we always raised. This one, we had a lot of cattle around where we always were. We always raised, I'm the one that was going to be slaughtered because in those days we weren't doing the grass fed thing. We're giving them corn and whatnot. And the, the catalog had the same name was dinner. And so I had taken a Polaroid picture of this steer before I had it butchered and wrote on the bottom of it dinner.

Speaker 13:         01:43:28       And so in presenting the meat at that dinner that night and these neighbors were there with a couple of young girls that grow on was maybe 10 and the other one 12, um, you know, we're about to begin eating and I make the presentation and I hand him a picture of dinner. And so the girl, and that's all they, you know, they didn't think anything of it, just pass it around the table and one girl would need it. And last I heard she was still a vegetarian. She couldn't do that, um, connection or no, didn't, couldn't believe that that's what you're doing. On the other hand, my, I wanted to say something about this whole thing with people eating meat and, and not, you know, being a part of it and whatnot. So I live in Madison, Wisconsin, which is a very liberal town. And, uh, the east side of Madison is particularly, but there's a food co op over there that our friend Carl, our friend Carl Malcolm, uh, did a learn to hunt program through.

Speaker 13:         01:44:19       Yeah. And it was wildly successful. Um, and so in Madison where I know an awful lot of people and most of meat meat, very few of them hunt. But none of, I can't think of anyone who has a problem with me doing it. In fact, they'll ask about it and whatnot. So even the vegetarians and vegans that I know are pretty, you know, they're pretty okay with it. My, my comment is eyes. I don't have any objection to what you're doing. And I re read pollens article from the New Yorker they posted the other day and it was, was just a wonderful, it was a long read. But um,

Speaker 1:          01:44:59       intelligence, the intelligence of plants and how they adapt. And so wait a minute, you know, it's just a different Darwin vegans, just because they don't have a brain doesn't mean they don't have a certain kind of intelligence. Not only that, it's been proven that plants actually can make calculations. Cotton plants are not as simple as a rock. You know, we'd like to think that in eating a plant, you're not eating anything that's alive, but you are, you have to eat life, life consumes life. We just have this ability to differentiate between the life of an animal that we believe has emotions or we'd think has feelings and plants. They can get roots to grow toward the sound. The sound of running water. Yeah. Wow. They'll steer in that. There's a type of intelligence and plants that we don't understand and that's also bad fertile sons of bitches.

Speaker 1:          01:45:44       A friend of mine read that article and he goes, man, I just never thought of how stressful most people, when I fire up my lawn mower [inaudible] when you take mushrooms, it's one of the things you experienced is this weird connection with that fungus and you know, obviously a fungus is not quite the same as a plant. In fact funguses or actually more closely related to animals and the art of plants, but there's some weird thing that's going on while you're eating a mushroom and part of you know, the, the psychedelic Glor. What people believe is that you're communicating with is this plant by eating it. They also believed that about Iowasca Iowasca the common atory plant beverage that everybody goes down to Peru and Brazil to take and have these visionary experiences. They believe that you're experiencing some sort of intelligent connection to the spirit world through this vehicle. This plant vehicle plants aren't as simple as, you know, everybody likes to think that, oh you eat broccoli. It's so Karma free. You know that might be the only way to eat Karma free is to eat shit. All right. If you want to go around eating shit, that might be Karma for what organisms you would

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       switch to eating. What are the next step is you would switch to eating like non terminal productions for plants. Mila, you need apples. You wouldn't eat, you wouldn't eat rubella. But that Jane's, the Jane's like those fierce yoga is like those, those sacks with eat. They will never eat onions or potatoes and things because that's the route to life source, the light source. So what they do is they eat everything that grows above the ground so you are allowed to eat anything that will regenerate so you can eat. Leave leaf is actually, I had an aunt who was fucking crazy. She's funny. She's not my aunt anymore. They got divorced. She's fucking crazy. And she's a fruitarian. Oh, nice. She probably has no blood in his body. How should I? She on his Ip, she was so, but she was one of those really fucking annoying people that like you couldn't have a ham sandwich around her.

Speaker 5:          01:47:36       She would just start talking shit about, do you know how they treat those animals? You knew that you have to murder in. Oh, fucking Christ. It was just this craziness. But the bottom line is the what people don't want to take into account. What they want to say is, hey, you shouldn't kill an animal and eat it. Okay. Should we ever kill animals? No. Okay, you should never kill animals. What are we going to do with all these animals? Fucking, yeah, we can stop that from fucking, are we going to control the population? What are we going to do about predators will, well, you know, let nature control on it. Do you know how nature controls populations? They fucking eat them while they're alive. All right. Coyotes. There's a, there's a video that I found online. It's a crazy video. Maybe you could find it, but these two D or get locked up, they were battling and they were national horns together.

Speaker 5:          01:48:20       Then they got locked up and while they're locked up, a lot of times they can't get unlocked because the horns are organic. They flex, the antlers are organic, they flex and move. And if you hit it the right way, they can get connected. The point it's really difficult to get untangled. So while these two deer, we're going at it and they got locked up, coyotes ate one of them a lie. Wow. So one deer is like gutted and its legs are half missing and the other deer is like connected to him. Fucking freaked out and these hunters came along and disconnected these two. That's what you're going to get if you don't get hung up just that bad though. Well not bad to people because people aren't involved in that. But I'm saying I'm not like I don't go like, oh we need to get rid of predators cause there's still mean to animals.

Speaker 5:          01:49:02       But I feel like it's a treat to watch it. When I watched the two deer here, I don't know if that's the very specific video, but there are situations also like in certain indigenous cultures where you can't grow anything. Tell Eskimos to be vegetarians. You're basically, you have to eat the animals in parts of the Middle East where you're not growing anything in on the topography of the land. You have to live off animals. You've got to let them off the milk of your camel in the bond to belt in Africa, you have to basically live off. It's very hard to grow stuff there. You basically have to live off of, you know, game meat, you know, try living off of, try growing something in the, it is the video. The support here is connected to this other deer that's pretty just alive. And the hunters found the coyote eating it. The hunters found the coyote

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       eating the one deer and this, you're like, mother Fucker, let me go and he can't get go. I can't let go. And the, the other deer is just like half of his body is missing. So they had to hold onto them and look where they are. Farm country starts please. Yeah, it's Doug's house. I owed his hands in his pockets going, hey, what's going on dude? If I lived in your house, man, that, that whole area, you know, we've talked about me buying land in your area and I'm still really interested in now because there's something so fucking cool about that area, the driftless area and there's something so fucking cool about just your house. We could go out of your house in the morning, go for a walk pit, pitch up a tent and fucking hang out and wait for someone to come by. Yeah, I mean it's, it's really an amazing spot. Well

Speaker 13:         01:50:30       thanks. Ah, you know, I've, I feel really lucky to be the one who gets to take

Speaker 8:          01:50:33       clearly that is the driftless area for this generation. Beautiful. That place as he looks like in the summer song. Seriously. Yeah. We can say we keep saying you saying Doug's place, but dogs. Oh, thank you Steve. I want to point out it's Debbie. Doug's family's place in Doug's. How long

Speaker 13:         01:50:50       you got or it's been in my family 112 years.

Speaker 8:          01:50:53       Yeah, 112. He, yeah, he had a relative loses sound bits on the next generation. Went Back [inaudible] I told you that in confidence. [inaudible] what happened was during

Speaker 13:         01:51:04       the, uh, depression, my, my great grandfather, um, so when I say it's been in my family 112 years, there was a little, there was a couple of months

Speaker 8:          01:51:12       listen, so we don't

Speaker 13:         01:51:14       qualified to be a century farm or something. But, uh, uh, my great grandfather had a railroad that went from Cazenovia to Laval, which is seven miles away. And the depression came and then there was a flood and wiped out all the bridges. And uh, then he had this one. I can tell it my dad would be okay with this. So one of his uncles, I guess always had these harebrained ideas that he could talk his father into financing him on. So, um, he mortgaged our farm. So our farm is not, it's been in the family that long, but it's not the original family farm over where, by where we were duck hunting. I pointed that out. Um, that's where the, um, the homestead was anyway

Speaker 8:          01:51:55       in every guy in his area is Doug's, Doug's got cousins he never even met. They're like down the road. Yeah. Pop out of the woodwork when November rolls around. Cousin. Hey, let's go Emily.

Speaker 13:         01:52:07       Yeah, I think folks are on kids know, you would say, well, some people would say that, you know, I wouldn't get that fucking driven.

Speaker 8:          01:52:15       There's a dude that ran at hunter. There's the dude next to me. Yeah. That ran that uh, that, that hunter recruitment program out of that whole foods places

Speaker 13:         01:52:24       as a co op. Yeah. And uh, Carlos, just one of those guys, you know, he's just wonderful, uh, advocate for the outdoors and uh, yeah, that was the, that was our first time, I guess the first time that we did together cause Durkin was there. So there was no, that was the second time you hunted on my farm. Been this is the fourth time anyway.

Speaker 8:          01:52:47       Huh? What was I talking about? Hunting? No, you're old man. You're all [inaudible]. So, yeah, railroads. And so anyway,

Speaker 13:         01:52:54       uh, it came to a point where we'll, we've got to have some, something's got to give. So he gave the farm what let the farm go back to Northwestern mutual life is what my dad said. And uh, and my grandfather had, interestingly, it didn't make sense for him to buy it from his father. He bought it from the insurance company, had the paper on it. So there was like a few month period of time where it was in no man's land, but no one else has owned the place for 112 years. That's the alarm.

Speaker 8:          01:53:23       Is it a ministry of foreign man? It's amazing spot. It's a beautiful, beautiful spot. Well, there've been people

Speaker 13:         01:53:27       well taken care of it for a long time. I give my father an awful lot of credit for, you know, his, um, vision on the whole thing in my, my grandfather was a really interesting guy too. And, um, you know, they, Eh, I didn't know my great grandfather obviously, but, uh, but yeah, I mean it's just, I, it's just my turn right now and I happen to have four brothers and sisters who are very, uh, uh, willing to, uh, sort of let me be in charge and, and uh, we're all partners in the thing. Um, and my folks are still heavily involved but are as they always say, we control the purse strings like there.

Speaker 8:          01:54:02       Yeah. Like they're the house of representatives or something. I wish you had a picture of the standard that we could put up on the thing there, man. Yeah. I don't know where you find one of the standards. Yeah. Douglas Standard. Dot. Yeah. Don't kill the one time killed a giant. Well, you have pictures of that on your first time here. Don't know where there, Joe dog killed a giant buck became known as the standard, as a standard on that property. It's a really funny story. I feel like I'm, I feel like this is like Mary Ann [inaudible] going to tell him. Doug, tell him about this dog. Tell me about that dog. Why don't you tell him Steve Youtube to the standards of funny story without a picture. I got a lot of people die and watching anyways. They're listening. Tell the story a fair enough. Tell us story about the standards. Do you want me to, are you curious about here to start? Yeah, absolutely. What I like about the standard story is, um, how I went up there with the tractor and set this whole thing on the part. I like, this is never gonna work because the part I like is when you tell when you took it down to the Oh, oh yeah, yeah. Okay. Took it down to the guy. So, so, so here's what happened. I like two weeks before,

Speaker 13:         01:55:06       uh, this early, it was an early gun season. It was actually during bow season. At that time it was very controversial, but you can earn a buck. So this is like the end of October. So rod is just kicking off. And my nephew a shot a doe with the night before and had never got into deer and, and um, in fact he shot one earlier that day. And, uh, I said, well, go ahead Sam, you know, got it out. He said, well, I didn't go. I don't know how to do it. And they said, well, if I got that deer, I'm gonna tag it so that I could have the buck tag. Two weeks before this day, my wife and I were driving down through the farm on that road that comes down through there in this just enormous buckets up out of this brush and goes just lumbering into the woods.

Speaker 13:         01:55:44       And my wife who doesn't get excited about deer is like, oh my God, look at the size of, but she got excited. So later that day I went up with the tractor and a brush hog, you know, and nothing going on here. I'm just driving through cutting the trails on the farm and left the tractor idling, jumped down off the tractor, grabbed a, I had a tree stand along, strapped it to a tree, um, got back in the tractor while it was, you know, just as I said, let it run the whole time and then drove out of there. Two weeks later, I had this buck tag and shoot the deer 10 minutes. Unfortunately, it's not one where I can tell a long story about why can make any story line apparently. But, um, along story about hunting the steer and all that, it showed up 10 minutes after I got into standing boom shot yet. And that's the standard. So, and this thing is just enormous. I mean it's just one on your wall. Yeah. That, that rope and it was just a huge deer. Besides how much did it weigh? Let's think. I Dunno, I go to 65 or, or something like that, maybe to 70. And I'm,

Speaker 8:          01:56:42       well the thing is like, it's like, uh, it, you know, it had to be as quick as did here. You get into like how many inches of antler. So it was a hunter.

Speaker 13:         01:56:48       It was almost a 200 inch deer in the Antler, but it was an enormous body dear, besides, so, um, never shot anything like that before. So I call this tax the dermis and said, so I want to bring this deer in. And he said, well, how big is it? And I said, well, I have size 13 shoes and I can put both of my shoes between the antlers. Oh, well you didn't want to get that in here real soon. And you know, so the skin doesn't, the high doesn't slip and all this stuff. So, um, my dad's got this little Chevy F's 10 pickup. We dropped the thing in the back so it looks like an elk in the back of this little tiny pickup. And we drive it to the taxi type. And by the time we get to the texts and stuff, there are two or three vehicles behind us cause they want to see where it's going.

Speaker 13:         01:57:27       We pull into the place and I walk up and there's this, this texted them shop where they also registered dear. You guys had the experience with places where they registered dear. It's a madhouse. And uh, so we pull in there and I walk up to the guy and said, oh, by the way, I'm the guy who, who called and you've got the buck with. They said, oh, can I see it? And they've got trucks are backed in there and they're unloading Dyrand skin and amount and doing all this stuff. And my little dad's a little s tennis sitting down at the bottom of the hill and he walks down there and he goes, all right, everybody get all these vehicles out of the way. We're back in this one up in here right now. So we back it up there and they'd get it out of the thing and uh, out of the back and they, they do a quick skin of it till they get it to the, to the head. And so I, and he's got a guy who all he does is surgically removed, you know, do the Cape and whatnot. We go in there and guys start chucking $5 bills into a, or $10 bills into a hat and start writing numbers down. So they're guessing as to how many inches of horn there is. So every big deer that comes in, that's what they were doing. But it was just a, the whole scene was how many inches was, it was 192. That's a big, the one that you got was like 1218

Speaker 8:          01:58:41       what is that right

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       there? That mule deer. How big is that? Oh Shit. 110 that's how big fucking animal you had then. But it is, it's just like something happens kind of magically when they get up into that. They just started, I mean genetics, genetics, food. There's a big one right there. That's a mule deer though, isn't it? It's not even type in 200 inch whitetail. Well, I've seen some of them they have that looks like they have trees grown out of their heads. Yeah. Type in 202 whites and you'll probably hit like 220 now Alberta is the place where I came here and has the big ones. They got big bodied. You're in for a long time. They were the reigning. There was like, there was a place to go if you wanted to shoot a huge racked. I mean just besides body, you get the body to think.

Speaker 2:          01:59:22       We talked about that. Bergman's principal bought why animals in the north are big. What the fuck? That's crazy. That's big. That's big. That's insane. So it's very elk like, uh, for Awhile Alberta was the place to go if you wanted to kill it and they still got plenty of who's deer. But then all this stuff started happening and Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, and they're just killing fricking tankers now. Wow. Like tech for awhile. Like Texas was the man. There you go. That's ridiculous food plots. Right? Soybeans make. So for awhile, like Alberta was the man in Texas was the man right now the Midwest is just crank and huge. If big huge antlered white till all your thing and you want to shoot one. I didn't ask you that. You want to shoot one in the wild and not like shooting one that some guy raised on, reared on offense, reared off his fricking study animal.

Speaker 2:          02:00:14       Well I watched this one show where it was about a deer farm and they were showing all these d or that they had genetically raised and these deer farm and it's ridiculous. I mean they, they, they have trees growing out of their head and there are only two years old, two year old deer and the got fucking these weird crazy antlers you can't trust. You can't trust white tails. If I walk into dude's house and I walk into a guy's house and he's like, check out that Greg Whitetail, I'm like, you know, I, I can't even start even kind of pretending to be impressed until I knew the backstory. I, as far as I know, you shot it up behind a fence. You walk into guys' place, he's got a big tank or like big horn. He's probably got something. If he's got a big tank or mule deer, there's a group.

Speaker 2:          02:00:53       Very good chance he's really got something, a big tanker elk. I'm like, God, I'm going to have to know what was going on. So elk, you were saying this before the podcast. There are elk that are behind fence. Oh Shit. Yeah. Tons of man. Where tons of lots of, I mean, you could probably, there's probably, there's more states that do it, but no, I should say it was more that do it then don't, but like, I'll rattle off a bunch to do Texas and it'll, Pennsylvania has got a bunch of high offense places. Missouri's got high fence places. Idaho is high fence places for out. There's something about an elk in a high fence that kind of offends me. You get to do three, 4,000 bucks. I mean, they'll drive you out and you pick the one you won out. I've seen ads we say like, it'd be like, um, someone needs to hunt this elk now. $3,000. Isn't that a good picture? The other day? Something about an elk that's a mythical sort of a mystical,

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       majestic creature. I hate, I hate to see them. I hate to see him. I'd argue the same thing about a whitetail deer. I just can't imagine going behind, uh, you know, going into a fence and she's one of those places in Texas. Well, I mean, they haven't been Wisconsin too. There's a place called gonna. I don't want it went to a place in Texas. It's 10,000 acres. Is that okay?

Speaker 7:          02:02:01       Yeah, I know you get into weird, you get into the, you get into a thing where it's become, I mean, there was a big thing you see Hans advertise on, on a 300 acre chunk of ground. It has no fence on it or I'm sorry, no tree on it. Right. And you get a nice things where someone might be doing this amazing wildlife management, you know, and doing a really good management job. And for whatever reason, it could be any number issues. They for their own management purposes, fence, a gigantic track, Landon and you get into, so is that legit or not? And it's kind of like, who's that guy that said, I only know I know porn when I see it.

Speaker 5:          02:02:33       I know I can't define pour, but show me a picture on tape. It's porn or out. But that was the supreme court justice who said, I don't know how to define it, but I know when I see it. So it's insanity rules. But, but what I'm saying is that what if you're, there's something about being out in the middle of nowhere, like the Missouri breaks. That is, that feels more challenging.

Speaker 7:          02:02:52       Yeah. It's a luxury though too, because a lot of people don't have people. Like when I was growing up, man, it was B, we own the farthest we'd hunt from our house. We typically have between two and eight miles from our house. We were going on a big ass trip, a big ass trip to drive 40 miles up and hunt this place called peacock in, uh, in Lake County. I didn't grow up thinking, I mean, we grew up hunting what we had around us. Man. I, you know, now I lose sight of it now because I have, you know, I have such a, like a kind of fell into such a fantastic occupation where now I'm like, Oh yeah, you know, we'll go here and go there for all these wild hunts and like, you know, the real way to hunt is this and that and the Alaska in mountains.

Speaker 5:          02:03:32       You're talking about Alpine hunting, like when you're on the swallows. Yeah. When you're up in the mountains and and you're, you're having it really literally bring everything with you going up and down a mountain. That feels a lot more challenge.

Speaker 7:          02:03:43       Yeah, you get into a ton of physical challenges, but it is a luxury in most of the people. I mean more hours are logged deer hunt in the near cut, logged hunt whitetail deer ears and in your kind of

Speaker 5:          02:03:55       the number one killed thing is what doves are co doves. I think number one is killing me. That's a real issue with people, man. That doves, they go crazy. It's the symbol of, in Michigan you can dumps piece. Camper mentioned we used to, we used to. We used to when we were kids, we hunted them on the sly. You guys shouldn't cut off branches either because them and adults together equal piece. He said good heating or tubs that tastes very good. Dark, flush, dark flavor, flavor. Fast is the best. Don't say it. Don't look pheasant, but I mean look at us. Here's why tops, but pigeons are okay. Not, Doug's apparently chickens, chickens, pigeons and dogs have

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       a lot in common. But a dove is better morning doves business. All right. This dark

Speaker 13:         02:04:43       liver colored. Yeah. So I'm the exact opposite of Steve though. I mean, I've, I've hunted to other places than our area in my entire life. I'm 55 years old. I hunted the boundary waters, uh, deer hunted up there four or five years ago and last spring and went down and hunted, uh, Twinkies. What's the boundary waters? Boundary waters in northern Minnesota. It's the boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota. It's very wild.

Speaker 2:          02:05:06       No, it isn't. It thought isn't the boundary waters. It's Canada minutes. I'm sorry. Canada, Minnesota. Yeah. I don't even need to look that up. My New Internet.

Speaker 13:         02:05:15       Yeah. So, um, but so most of my hunting, you know, and I've been doing it since I was 12, so it's a lot of years, um, has been done on that farmer in that area and, and really not, you know, elsewhere. I guess I hunted a little bit when I was in, when I lived in New Hampshire for a few years too. But, um, you know, sort of the, um, the optic opposite experiences of, of Steve. Um, but nonetheless it challenging. Yeah. I don't disagree with you at all. Whitetail deer hunting's really accessible. It's becoming because of guys like me I suppose, um, a little less accessible because I don't necessarily just when I was a kid you could pretty much go hunting anywhere. I mean we just get in the car on a Saturday morning and just go and go into that woods and you know, not deer hunting something.

Speaker 13:         02:06:06       But when I was a kid, deer hunting, you had to put four guys together in like August or September, fill out a form, send it into the DNR to get a tag to shoot a doe. So that's the whole idea. So one dough for four, four guys, everybody else had a buck tag. So, and that was the idea was that there was the, to bring the population up, well now it's exactly the opposite where we're encouraging, I mean, they have earn a buck rules that kind of got shot down, but earn a buck is, is in place that Steve asked me the other day, well how many deer could you shoot on your tag? And I was like, there's no limit that

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       I'm just trying to calculate the cost, the hunting during Wisconsin, it's like what you buy a tag for 18 bucks. It's good for in your area.

Speaker 13:         02:06:47       Yeah. In our area. Um, you get a buck tag, a doe tag, a second doe tag, and then every time you go in they'll give you another paper tag. That's

Speaker 2:          02:06:58       interesting. That's off a permit. The cost of what?

Speaker 13:         02:07:02       Well, it was $24.

Speaker 2:          02:07:03       $24. Yeah. That's crazy. That's a good way to get meat for cheap if you, yeah, man, it's a, it's like if you're, if you're hunting local and it's economical

Speaker 13:         02:07:11       and when I was, yeah, yeah. And when I was a kid, if, if a deer got hit on the road, people stopped and picked it up and put it in the back. But now it's like now because of the snow, we've had a big melt recently. You see the big drifts or the snow piles along the edge of the road and here's deer carcasses turned it on.

Speaker 2:          02:07:31       You can't eat them. You can't pick them up too late now. But it depends on the states, the Galtee. But you know

Speaker 7:          02:07:36       like now, now in Montana you can, you can now it was illegal. Now you can pick up certain species. You can, you can salvage them. You've got to let the state know. We used to just have to call, you said call nine one one they'd give you a permit for deer were coming back one time. Mile man hit a deer with his bow. Okay. We all go out to blood trail of deer blood trail dear till one, two in the morning. Never followed the deer. Never recovered a deer. I can't remember where he hit it. Probably hit it in the paunch or something. Never found it coming back. He's got me, my brothers now. Little little like I was so little that me and my other brother, we got left behind and he left us to sleep in the woods and our land and ran out of gas.

Speaker 7:          02:08:12       So I light was out and we fell asleep and so he couldn't find us. And they're running around and goes, Dave Dad, cause you'd have to get close enough to yell and wake us up. Two in the morning, we're coming home finally driving a jeep AMC eagle or dry GF, AMC Cherokee. And by him hit this deer. So it's, you know, everyone's tired. I'm sleeping up front. My brother was in the back seat, mailman gets out, grabs his deer and throws the on bits and back of the jeep Cherokee on a tarp, sticks in Arrow in it. Nope. Start on down the road. And all of sudden my brother was in the back flipping out like freaking. And we turned around that somebody just standing up,

Speaker 11:         02:08:50       oh no.

Speaker 7:          02:08:52       Slams on the brakes, gets out in the halls head, you're out of the bat, cause its throat weights come and stills it back in there on a tarp and continue on our way home.

Speaker 11:         02:09:01       That was a hard man. Oh my God. For Life. You guys sleep in the woods. You fucking pussy. Here's a lantern with three ounces of fluid in it right now. Go to sleep. I came back, I gave the kid a compass, whatever. No, he was, he was,

Speaker 7:          02:09:16       um, he was, uh, he was a hard guy, man. Yeah, I guess, yeah, I guess that sounds like a hard guy at the time. Like it up until, you know, it's funny cause it's like there's this, uh, there's a, there's like this music, I don't even want to name her name, but she's got the song like I'm not angry anymore. Like my dad's been dead. Like my dad died in 2002, 2003. I'm just now, I just turned 40, a couple, like a week or two ago. I'm just now getting where I'm not so angry at him and I'm starting to go like a lot of what he did made sense and love it has to do with, I have a three year old now. Oh yeah. And now I'm like, you know what? Maybe he wasn't like, so you know, it just looked like, look, I look at it through that angle now having a little kid and I see like you want that person to be just like able to fend for themselves and know and to be capable and know how to fix stuff and know how to take situations in their own hands and know not to complain about stuff.

Speaker 7:          02:10:15       You know what I mean? Well, you came out pretty good. I mean, yeah, but most people disregard everything they learned from their parents. Even if they turned out really good. Like you could have a whole slew of siblings all be turned out great. And in every one of them will be like, do the opposite of what their parents did. What do you think you were so angry about? I mean, what was the thing?

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       I don't wanna get you to me in a hard ass. Yeah, Megan's work all the time. All the time. These pads, he used to have a longer one and he start making chores and he wouldn't like suck. He would just keep going until he had two columns down to the bottom. My Dad would do that but then you get on your first day of summer break and he'd be like, you know, can you believe this shit that's going to take you through August two that somebody didn't have any staying power like he was. He would write up list. I, I crashed my car, this car and it cost him like I don't know how much it's going to cost some Vegas. You're working for this, you're working for this boy. I'll tell you that much right now. Hope you hope you think, I know you had plans for the summer cause cause you can kiss those plans, go back cause you're going to be working or not.

Speaker 4:          02:11:11       And he was so mad at me. Meanwhile I knew he wrote this long Lizzie. I knew he just kind of forgot about it. It just means it never had any staying power. He'd get busy and I'd be like, see, you later dropped this list and it wasn't I supposed to mow the lawn. Sorry, I've got a trick niece. No, you probably know dad. I'm going to grow up and be a comedian to my mother. My mother used to, my mother used to change my grades. I would get my report card and it sucked and I knew my father, my father, I need to change it for you. Oh my God. I couldn't go to my dad with a d in math and I was just, I mean, you know, you don't think I listened now can you imagine you fucking in fucking high school. Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          02:11:53       Was I a mess? What did your parents think when you said you wanted to be a comedian? My father grew up really poor, so when I told him I wanted to be an actor, not even a comedian, an actor that we just told them first. Yup. I was 2122 I remember, I remember he looked at me and his face, I remember his face, the worry and the regret and the dread, but you know what? He's like, I should've never even [inaudible] a drone in when he was little, he was so, he was so to see, right. He was so depressed because he, he just wanted me to be, you know, he just want to be, he loved me. He's wanting to be safe. So he just looked at me and he goes like this. He goes, well, why are you asking me if I'll support you?

Speaker 4:          02:12:33       I mean, you want some money for your rent? I go, I go, no. He goes, well, you're going to need it because you're not paying your way around with acting, so you're good. We have to talk brass tacks. You, you can't live in New York without my help. And I never forgot that about him. He, he, he, he kind of, he just, you know, he said, oh, well he's a dreamer. Here goes nothing. But then when I got my first job, when I got mad TV and I called him, it was the greatest thing in the world. He goes, what are you doing in la? And I go, ah, I'm on a TV show. And he goes, what do you mean when I go, I'm going to be on a TV show every week and he got commercial, I don't know, commercial. I'm going to be on a TV show, use. I can turn the channel on and you'll be on the show. I go, that's right. And he goes like this. There was a pause and he goes, Oh my God, I've got to call your mother. And he hung up. And then my mother called and my cousins call, everybody called and he just, he didn't know how to even deal with the emotion of it cause I was, I was ultimately the first time you don't,

Speaker 5:          02:13:31       but, but forget all that bullshit. What, what ended up bringing us really close, because we didn't really get along that well, was how, how well I kept my head up during the fact that I wasn't working. I spent a lot of time and you know, for years not working as an act, you didn't say quit. I never quit, man. And I never got down. I never got down. I would just go, well here goes another one. I just never fucking game. I don't give him wait way. We will. You didn't spend that much time not working because what? I'm to you, when I met you, you were like 26 yeah. And you were working. Yeah, but I went a long time without the fuck. I'm saying, I mean TV show from college to not working. What does that work? A little bit probably doesn't mean you're making about being an actor, like all the years of not getting jobs.

Speaker 5:          02:14:10       And about how long is that? If you were 26 well, from the age of when you get out of college, how old were you? 21 so you five years? No, I worked at a bank for two years. And so five years. Five years from school? No, I'm talking about, it's not like, it's probably not like a [inaudible] magazine Articles, magazine articles 2000 but it was, it took me five years to get it. I can be like, yes, I'm a publishing writer. I'm a writer. Writer. Right, but he was on mountain talking about a match after that work a lot like [inaudible] I'm doing gay comedy, whatever dirt. No, I was insisting on doing, I'm doing acting. Joe would be like, Dude, stop with the act. I'd be an acting class. We get in these huge arguments. He'd be like, just do stand up just to stand up with this acting step.

Speaker 5:          02:14:53       I would freak out and pilot season. I'd call him up. I didn't get a job. This pile. Why wouldn't you want to be autonomous when you could be? I just didn't understand the greatest. Like when I was on news radio, my, the producer actually said to me, he goes, why are you still doing standup? You're an actor now. I was like, oh, really? Like, oh, I get to get the fuck away from you right now before. This is contagious to be a stand up for stand up. The most beautiful thing about standup is you've got everything with you. You, you, you're, you carry your equipment. You are who you are. You go to a club and you don't need anything to turn on the microphone and we'll do this. Turn the lights off, turn on the microphone. We're good. The last thing you want is to stand up is to have to check in with a bunch of other people.

Speaker 5:          02:15:35       If you got to do what you have to do as a standup, what you have to do as an act or like go to producers and writers and the network, get everything approved. It's a fucking disaster. Which is one of the reasons why it's so hard to get a good show on television. That perfect storm of good writing and good acting and all that stuff coming together. It's incredibly difficult to play practically impossible and let's be honest, we have the greatest job in the world. Am I right? Well, it's also the most fun to me when I'm a con, when I'm an audience member, I would way rather go see Brian Cowen do stand up. Then I'll go see you in a movie and then go see you in a movie. And you can see Brian Cowen to stand up in San Francisco this weekend, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at the punchline.

Speaker 5:          02:16:14       Yes. See you and you're very funny doing stand up, but you know the odds of you getting a role that represents you the same way it does your, your standup. It's not only that, like you, when you go to see a good comic, the laughs that you have in an hour and a half, like you get out of there, your fucking stomach hurts. Yeah. You know, you're, you were howling laughing when we went to see you. I remember I told you, my wife said, might like my arms and my face hurts. If you go from holding that like big smiley thing for whatever, 15 minutes, Joe Rogan or you see bill burr, you see these guys, let me tell you something. You take the funniest movie in the world. The hangover, any movie, I don't care what it is. They, there was no way that that audience is going to laugh as much at the hangovers last per minute.

Speaker 5:          02:17:00       It's not gonna happen, you know, and there's a real problem with the way it's expressed on television too. And I'm having an issue with that now. Um, my new special bar, the word comes out, uh, this, this Friday night on this Friday night on comedy central. They're, they're airing my, not my latest. I know that my last special, yes. Live from the Tabernacle. Uh, the special that I did I guess was about a year and a half ago and now I'm doing a new one. I'm going to film a new one in June because I this special, if you see this special, there's none of this is on my new comedy that I'm doing now. So over the last like year and a half, I've been putting together my new hour. It's done now and I'm probably going to film that most likely in Denver, most likely in June. We're at piecing it together. I want to do it at the comedy works cause I love that cloud.

Speaker 5:          02:17:43       If I can do it there, I'll do it there. If not, I'll do it. I want to do it at a club. I'm trying to figure out how to represent con. Like when you see a comedy show on television, I'm sorry, it's just not as good as seeing it live. There's something he miss. There's something about the person's saying that shit right in front of you. That's just way better than someone saying that shit on a video. It's like watching the concert. It's like watching a concert video. There's nothing more painful than watching the concert video. True.

Speaker 13:         02:18:13       When I saw you recently in Chicago, one of the neat things is, you know, sitting there with a friend but, but the people around you, like what struck somebody else says just like gut wrenching, you know, busting funny. Um, yeah, that's funny. But, but then the thing that would get me would be the other people are kind of chuckling and I'm just roaring, you know? And it's like that shared experience I think as a part of it.

Speaker 5:          02:18:34       I think it is too. There's something about going and and I, and I think the shade experience somewhat gets diminished when there's like more than 3000 people. I've had great times like when we did a Toronto, what we do. Would you to Denver with me when it came out as me? Yes.

Speaker 11:         02:18:48       Oh Great. [inaudible] I had them introduce of Calvin goes out there and they're all looking at me like, wow, pretty cool. Let's get to get that reception. I felt like the Messiah and then I could see the front row going on.

Speaker 5:          02:19:03       Joe Looks, he looks thinner. I

Speaker 11:         02:19:06       Scott Eight [inaudible] tall, gained three inches, lost 50 pounds. Joe Rogan light. There it is. Oh yes. This is actually the video.

Speaker 3:          02:19:21       Just come walking out. How high were we then? We thought this was a good idea to in Toronto is amazing. Yeah. 3000 people. Well this was, this was Denver. I wasn't a Denver. This is several thousand haven. Well you hear the like, well what time you fucking freaks. That's what Joe says. What's that you fucking phrase? No, what the fuck dude?

Speaker 2:          02:20:09       One of the best things about seeing, like you talk about that experience of being an audience. When I, when I saw you recently in New York, it was like you brought up the, you kind of launched into the duck dynasty thing. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's some dudes in the audience. I could see a lot of guys in the audience. They started getting real excited because they're like awesome because now he's going to start bashing the queers. Like now we can talk really bad about gay people. Don't charge something like come on, talk bad about queers. I can't wait. And then Joel like solely turns it on its head and it's most vicious way and like the palpability these dudes disappointment that it wasn't going to be that. We were talking about like how much we hate gay people and they of, they're kind of like, yeah, bring it, bring it in in a, in a does like just shot him down in the worst way and they're kind of getting this little like Yoda, I think this pissy little mood and this whole thing's playing out right in front me. Like, no one would ever know to send you your wife and these guys get like, aw man, I thought I was gonna be more fun than [inaudible] gets crushed.

Speaker 5:          02:21:07       Well what it is is that you know, they, they think that you're going to like support his freedom of speech. You know, cause that's like the big argument that you see on, on Facebook. What about freedom of speech? What about his, his Christian beliefs about supporting his Christian beliefs? You know, my point on all that has always been why would you care what gay people are doing? Like what's going on at you care about gay people. And if it's the Bible, if you're, it's, you're really fucking cherry picking. If you go on after the game, like your Cherry, Cherry Creek, you should go after people that were two different types of cloth because that shit's in there too.

Speaker 2:          02:21:39       Yeah. But the whole premise of the show is like, did they made a boatload of money? But isn't there a line in the Bible like a rich man has as much chance of getting into heaven as a camel passing through the eye of a needle? That's what Jesus said. Yes, that's exactly what you're more worried about whether reality TV stars get

Speaker 5:          02:21:52       to go to heaven. Well, you're a liar if you're doing that show and you're not telling people that it's scripted, you're a liar. So that that is an issue and that's a real issue with those reality shows. They are not reality. Those shows are fucking scripted. So most often you have to sign a nondisclosure. If you work for duck dynasty, she worked for a lot of those shows. If you're a camera man, if you're a sound guy, you have to sign a nondisclosure so that you can't go out and tell everybody that it's all bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:22:20       Yeah. That, that's, that's like one of the most basic things I get is this, like how it comes that when you look at what's going

Speaker 7:          02:22:26       on in the world, the bad things are happening, the world, starvation, abuse, the children, all these things go on in the world. And you and you hone in on like what's going on in some guy's private life, whether or not there's like

Speaker 5:          02:22:40       point, by the way, all the problems that really are affecting people, you, you, you're, the problem in this world really is homosexual two dudes having brunch with disposable income Sunday, who gives a fuck? It's, it's very weird. We're very weird about that. We're very weird about what we decide to get upset about and what we don't decide to get upset about it. It's, it's a strange thing. And what we should be upset about. We're not. And on a show like that, well you should be upset about it as a fact. They're fucking faking it. That's not a drama. It's not like watching, you know, fill in the blank fucking game of Thrones where you know, it's scripted. This is a show. They're pretending this is their real life and it's not. One of the things that I really appreciate about your show is that it's 100% legit above board all the way.

Speaker 5:          02:23:26       If you don't get an animal, you show the whole fucking show and you've had several shows. Well you don't get an animal. And one of them that I really respected man was that episode this year where you had that bear in your site and you just decided not to shoot it and you had, this is a very unique episode because you're fucking bear hunting and you are a hunter and you've killed, God knows how many animals in your life and you had your cross hairs on his bare and it was a done deal. And he said, I'm not feeling it. I don't want to shoot this animal. And just weird

Speaker 7:          02:23:55       for me. No, I say that. But then I went shot one shot burned out long after that. But, but no at that. Yeah, that happens to me.

Speaker 5:          02:24:02       But you apologized after you shot that bear, which I thought was weird too because you wounded it and then you had a shoot it a second time and you said you were sorry for hurting it.

Speaker 7:          02:24:10       Yeah. But like, yeah, I feel, I don't know man bears. I love to hunt bears and I like to look at barriers and sometimes I confuse which of those I like. It's confusing to me, which I like more, you know, why is that? I feel, um, kind of an f I feel like an affinity to bears in a way. I just kind of is that someone, somebody, their favorite foods are so favorites of mine too. Like I'll watch bears go eat blueberries. It's like I love eating blueberries at that place. I got in Alaska, the bears all blue mussels and boom, muscles are like one of my favorite things in the world. And so I was like, you look at it bear, it's like, man, we're kind of, I always feel like we like the exact same foods, you know? And another thing about bears, um, is I feel that bears kind of wake up a little different every day.

Speaker 7:          02:25:03       You know, they, they're, they're, they, they, they experiment, you know, they're processing things and experimenting with things. And, um, and so it's a, it's a potent animal for me. And I think that if you look at just the history of hunting in the history of hunters as represented through art, did they leave behind an oral tradition they leave behind is not a new concept that a homeowner would develop an affinity to certain animals. You know, oftentimes people respected the animals that they hunted the most. You look at the, the, the, the race relationship plains tribes to Buffalo, Bison, it was like an object of worship, very sacred object. You have a very conflicted, complicated relationship with the animal and Johan it and kill it. So I'm not, I don't even need to feel funny about the way I feel towards some of the animals I hunt because it's like, it's just something that has obviously happened to hunters for long, long time.

Speaker 7:          02:25:58       Um, and, and as a hunter you kind of develop your own system. Like we never use the word taboo when we're talking about ourselves. We always use tab. We, when we're looking at other cultures and be like, oh, those crazy people, they won't eat that because they have a taboo. Meanwhile, like we don't eat dogs, you know, we have a taboo system, we have a taboo system that governs the things we do. And I, through hunting and through observations of animals and there's, I've developed a set of things that I will and will not do and there's animals that to me are really special, you know, not that I dislike other ones, but just the bare to me is special. I'll go bear hunting this June and I'm, I'm thinking about it. It's just something that, you know, I look at a bear and I respect it as a renewable resource.

Speaker 7:          02:26:44       Something that if managed properly I can kill the bear, have it's hide, render its fat down and make my own lard with it. Eat all the meat. I like that. But I also something about him, he really likes the individual bear too. And just to observe them and, and now and then just to let one walk. Yeah. You said something really interesting to me just now about the fact that they wake up differently every day and that that's something getting, cause what you're saying is that they kind of learn as they get older. I feel that's the case. That process. Whereas a deer, you don't feel that way. I don't a failure, well it's two or it's one or it's five. I mean they learn but it's not the same thing. I have a hard time thinking of whites. I have a hard time thinking of whitetail deer.

Speaker 7:          02:27:23       Most things I have a hard time thinking of as as um, as individuals [inaudible] bear like really? Especially after I killed that bear I was talking about was 17 and I got that back and they, the tooth, I think it's called a dentist that they do. Yeah, they cut a cross section on that tooth. They got back and thought 17 man. Cause at the time I was mad. I was in my early twenties man. Awesome. My early toys. I'm like that's some bitch. Then the rock for 17 that's what Tesla with that 17 year old bear tastes like. I kept some rolls off the back legs and I kept the loins and things fine man. But like I said, I ground a lot of it, but I did keep some rolls off it. We ate it, we sloppy Joe, we did everything. And then the loins, we just grill. And how was it? The grilled lines, they'll still a good barrier. You have to make it medium right with a bear because plus with that bear I knew, I knew he was head trichinosis so it was good. You know, I can't even like, it was so long ago now I, I mean I remember it being good. Everybody being really surprised by I was good. But I'll handle bear

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       meat in different ways. You know, I don't just like cut a chunk of bear meat and throw it on the grill. Like I do a lot of, you know, you might want to tenderize it or I'll do marinades on and I'll smoke it. Like I bring more effort to bear meat than I would to like that, that fine tastes and driftless area Wisconsin Whitetail, we were eating, which is basically warmed up. You know, I mean you're just like putting a little bit, yeah,

Speaker 13:         02:28:43       well for the teeny bit of heat. Do you do that with, with, with, with, with everything, we've got a lot of emails and comments from people about the duck and there was how good was the duck really? And I'm just like, oh, it was incredible. What do you mean? Yeah, people are just like, well, you know, ducks. I was like, are you talking about mallards and Windex? I mean, cause you know, you're talking about diving ducks. That's a whole nother thing. But you know, mailers or heard that screw a mailer it up. I think

Speaker 2:          02:29:06       Joe showing some footage of rendering. Yeah. That's rendering bear fat down in oil. And that's a bear that had been eaten. Blueberries. Right. Those and those are, uh, fall bears the fall. They, they're fattening up. There's nothing bad. I mean, there really is nothing better than that. Then those bears that you would get him in late September, October, and you're up there eating blueberries. They'd been eating blueberries for months. Oh my God, they're good. I mean, they're just good. We've got to make that happen. Listen, Brian Cowen, we've got to go on more hunting trips. I know I'm not shooting a bear, but I'll go on home. I want you to bear now. I want you to bear, but I'll definitely shoot a deer or an elk or anything. I'm going to you, you'll see them in this fall for sure. When we go moose hunting. Yeah. I want to come. Can you come? There's enough room. No, figure it out. We'll figure it out. Oh, that sounds like there's [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:29:56       No, it's a boat. Dot. Say it. If you, if you, if you are honestly like, dude, I want to go so bad. Well, let's see. I really think that the public needs to know how fucking good your show is and I think that, I think we're, we're doing our best to expose it on this show and to expose it online and let people know. And I, and I know that your ratings are growing, but I can't help feel like you're under utilized on, I love the sportsman channel. I watch it, don't get me wrong, but they just large. But channel gives us, gives us the ability to make the show. Absolutely. There's a lot. You can't just go and do the stuff we do and show the stuff we show on a regular network. You can't, they wouldn't let you know because they have, they have it in their head.

Speaker 2:          02:30:37       He can't gut animals and all they have in their head. There's a set of things that the American public will tolerate and won't tolerate. And we had the ability to do. We have absolute creative freedom to show the things that I'm interested in talking about. But do you feel that that's changing? Like when you watch these shows, like these Alaska, the last frontier, yeah. It shows, they're showing a lot of hunting and a lot of stuff. Gutting animals, a lot of skinning animals. They show an animals hanging up in Barnes and shed. Then they're showing the raw real deal and they're doing onto the, there's something that they feel like is more romanticized about subsistence living. Well. Yeah, but that's, but they, there's a fabricated thing there where they're always trying to like make up this idea that this person's gonna die if he doesn't do this,

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       which is just horse shit. Well the most fabricated thing was when they were fucking fly fishing and this, they're like, oh shit, a bear's coming and then you see the bear eating a fish and the fish is fucking filleted. Like they baited that. Yeah. You get a lot of trouble for that man. That that fish was totally filleted clean. Filets missing from the sides. Like absolutely cut the bears eating. And I'm like, you didn't fucking do that. The bear did not do that. That was a knife. Goddamn fillet knife. A straight clean line from the gills back. So yeah, we don't need, we don't need it then. We don't need to. It can be the drama that you're living a lifestyle out of choice and not just some guy act like we've got a whole damn film crew out here. We're flying back and forth with batteries and broken cameras and lenses every damn day and we're going to pretend like this guy out here is going to perish you.

Speaker 5:          02:32:07       What do you need to come up with like cockamamie justification's I live a lifestyle that I want to live and I have very concrete resolute reasons why I live that way. Well, what they're missing is the entertainment value because a lot of those people are fucking boring. That's where Collin and I come in. So comedians and hunting, that's it. You've got your content, your fucking shell man. I'm telling you there, it should be an hour long cause there was so much great shit extended footage that you guys have released. Just this shit of a Brian singing while we're pigeon hunting and trying to get the Tony two minutes, man, 22 minutes. Shit on the stick thing. I was laughing, I was crying, I was so, I don't remember even saying that stuff. But then when you were you, when you laugh at me, that's what I start laughing.

Speaker 5:          02:32:47       I'm like your laughter. So ridiculous. We're sitting there and literally having a conversation and then I edit it with, I have a lot of shit stolen. Well that's the video that they shit on the stick to the hundred mile. The the hundred mile an hour shit. Yeah. That's, by the way, that shit on the stick video got over a hundred thousand views already. 150 [inaudible]. That's our best. It's this meat eaters. It's mediators. Best Vision. I'm assuming I was doing it. That's what happened. I was doing standup in New York and somebody goes, tell the shit story, tell us a shit story. And I, I didn't know what he was talking about though. Talking about the one where I was hiking. Remember that story I told about hiking? I had to shit with that girl and, and and, and I thought that's the thing. I go, I don't have time. I'm doing my hack. But he was talking about fucking bat.

Speaker 5:          02:33:30       That's crazy. What did you say to have a look at like about what the Shit was? Well of course. You know what? I'm trying to interject some education to the, like we had talked to her. Yeah, no kidding. So it was black, not an OT, which is a, but I call my shit at black knots call I call anyway guys. Like yeah, that's what I'm saying. Call my asshole. That balloon now slicks Black Cherry, which is what that plan was in. There it goes again. Black Cherry. I like to see chair. So it's, yeah, it's three days old is 340,000 hits so far. I can play this one. Yeah. That was so fun too. And that was the day when we didn't see a single deer. We went up in the afternoon.

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       Yeah.

Speaker 14:         02:34:19       Is that not that wind up on that stack probably got like me decide I'm going to actually see each other stick before. It's a common expression, but up until now I thought it was a myth. It also might be something called black done. If we could get Brian to break the branch off it, crush it up and put it in his mouth. He just needs to smell it for attention.

Speaker 6:          02:34:44       Well, you can see there. Let's let people see the rest of the video online. But we were fucking howling laughing. There was many of those instances, the talk and the monkey thing. Although, how about the where we're all sitting around and uh, was he your brother's son? That was their 17 year old kid. And we start telling him fuck stories. Oh my God, this kid's eyes light up like plates. Joe was just saying, Joe, John Joseph to the dad's guide, the Kids Dad, the kid's dad kind of looked a little bit like, oh, it was my brother David and Joe's like, he's got the Internet, man. There's no way we're going to tell him. Oh no punches. Even I was, I was like, oh Jesus, you want to know a little bit? You didn't pull any punches either, pal. You went with me on it. I guess you're right. The kid was great pressure though. And he ended up right here that killed a rally. Nice buck from the stem that you guys were sitting in right by that white oak tree that I said. One that's going to walk by. I believe it. He's, yeah, he's a good kid. Too. Fun. Hilarious. Yeah. Good, good checks. That whole area's sauce. You're so lucky man. It's such a beautiful area to go hunting in the fact that you're there, you know, for how long has hunting season from archery to, to write archery started

Speaker 13:         02:35:54       September 15th. And then, um, in our area there's some, there's a little bit of time in December where you can't hunt, but um, it's pretty much until the weekend after New Year's Day. That's crazy. Then two years ago when we did the first episode, um, they've, I think they've stopped this now, but you get land owner tags cause again, we're trying to reduce the herd. And so when Steve called me about that, he said, what do you think we do? That rabbit hunting thing and maybe we can do a little trapping or something. And I was like, well I can go one better. We can still deer hunt at the end of February. So actually you've been to my place toy or talk to my family's farm twice in the last four or five years at this time of the year when we went hunting, you can go hunting at the end of February with a land owner tag. Yeah. How does that work? Well,

Speaker 6:          02:36:42       it's private land hunt, so you're not dipping into, you know, they're not trying to diminish the managers, the harvest that might happen on public lamb.

Speaker 13:         02:36:49       Right. And in, especially in our ear where they're trying to reduce the deer herd, um, because of the CWD thing, largely because it spreads faster than more deer there are. Right. So, you know, that's part of it. And I'm, I believe that we have, you know, that we have too many deer in our area, um, you know, in terms of a balanced ecosystem. So, um, yeah. So I think that I had to buy the land owner tag, which was like $2. And I remember Dodi like, oh, he's going to step up. And there were other guys from board attacks and um, and pat was there and I mean, and Carl and we had seven or eight or nine guys and Jody's steps up, he's going to buy them

Speaker 8:          02:37:24       licenses. It's like $18. He's like, that to me, I've got the car door puts a 20 [inaudible] hunted on that trip for two bucks. Yep, that's right. That's exactly what it was. Yeah. That's incredible, man. Yeah. You didn't need to have it.

Speaker 13:         02:37:40       A regular hunting license. Then it was the land owner permit and then these guys can have tags that the deal.

Speaker 1:          02:37:47       Since you've been hunting since you were a kid and both of you guys had been, what, what's your approach to dealing with people like the people that are going crazy on my Instagram? People that don't think that there's, that it's a, a good thing to do to go hunting. They think there's something evil about it. They think there's something wrong with it. This, how do you deal with that disconnect?

Speaker 13:         02:38:06       I, I don't run into it very much. I mean I do a little bit in Madison, but I, as I said, I people, most of the people that I know that don't hunt don't have a problem with me doing it because of where you live. It's a culture. But it's also, I mean Madison, Wisconsin is a pretty, you know, liberal town and folks from all over the world there. And there's a certain fascination with that. Actually the, I've gotten a little more hot water. D I'm talking about feral cats.

Speaker 8:          02:38:37       Rarely. That's something I've, I'm even careful about bringing up that subject. People yet real hunky about feral cats. And I mean on the farm there were always extra cats around. And when you got to a point on the farm where I used to do some contracts where [inaudible] field and that field of business we talked about that first podcast ever came on. And so that's way more sensitive subject then, you know, hunting wild lands well. Right. And people have a different connection to it. And so friends of ferals is as big group in Wisconsin and I know some friends of ferals friends of ferals. Yeah, they're spaying and neutering them and putting them back out, back out and putting them back. Going somewhere. Songbirds. Well, yeah, I mean it's sort of sort of that they also kill rodents. This one friend of mine, guys that run farms, I mean you gotta have cat, you got lunch of cats like Kiefer's get man, he's got, every once in awhile he'll say, hey, by the way, when we're up walking, there's a cat up there. We need to, I need a few less. But I mean for just for road and contamination and a friend of mine who's, um, yeah,

Speaker 13:         02:39:44       uh, I dunno, she belongs to friends, friends of ferals. But um, was one of the people who started chastise me about talking about a gunny sack and Iraq, which is how you get rid of cats. Uh, extra cats, gunny sack in a rock. You need throw him in the water and just ground. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:40:00       Mild, mild man's grandpa honestly made him dispatch disposables of a litter of puppies that way. One time. Whoa. Anyway, I made a comment about it somewhere cause I actually, I said about, I

Speaker 13:         02:40:14       didn't even go into that. I just went into songbirds and all that sort of stuff. And she said, look, you know, on my, and she's got the horses and stuff and she said, I might place all I have is feral cats and they've all been spayed or neutered and then I put them out there and yeah, I get the whole thing about songbirds, but in my area here in my place, I'm taking care of it. You know, they're not bothering songbirds are not doing this. Then I'm like, yeah, but that's not what's happening everywhere else. Yeah. So you know, the discussion ends up being, to my mind at least the same kind of thing. Well, how many, how many cats is enough? How many deer or enough? Um, you know, what's the balance that we're trying to achieve here? What's the cause, you know, we're the ones who made the problem. Steve Sochi.

Speaker 5:          02:40:53       I mean they, they killed, they got the brushing government came in and killed a bunch of stray dogs because they had a real straight dog rob. Yeah. And that made news

Speaker 13:         02:41:02       and healthy looking straight up.

Speaker 7:          02:41:05       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:41:05       But they shot a bunch of dogs. See you've, uh, you've had this conversation many times, I'm sure. And I, one of them I watched, uh, in a a book signing that you had. I thought it was, it was it books.

Speaker 7:          02:41:15       Yeah. Pt Guy came fascinating, you know, and he was cool because he came to a, a book event I did and sat there through the whole thing, can wait until the question period raised his hand and then took me to task on, on the idea of hunting and the, that everything I was saying was just like a justification for Wanda farm animals, animal harm, animals to kill animals. And I pointed out to him, and it's something that I've said many times and I'll say many times more. So I think that people who, who come at it with a perspective of having an anti hunting perspective are defending a set of ideas that th th th th their concern for animals, they're concerned for wildlife. They're concerned for the wellbeing of the natural world. They're defending us. That animal, a set of ideals that I know that I understand better than they do. I care more about it than they do. I know much, much more about it than they do. I'm more vested in safe guarding the things that they think their safeguarding than they are. I mean, I just am, you know, um, I might not in my mind, there a vast difference between an individual wild animal and the idea or the essence of that species.

Speaker 15:         02:42:37       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:42:38       It's difficult for people to understand an idea that, that they're saying like, if you love this animal so much, how could you kill it?

Speaker 7:          02:42:46       And it might be if you came down from Mars, you cannot from outer space. It might seem like this really counterintuitive notion, but because of the way we manage wildlife purely in this country, we have where we manage wildlife as a public trust thing as a renewable resource. The funding for wildlife research, the funding for enforcement, the funding for habitat improvement in this country is coming out of hunting. License sales is coming out of excise taxes that are on firearms and sporting goods. Guys that hunt our financing to a large measure, American wildlife particular, that's particularly the case and even more, I mean you could say that, oh sure. At just inadvertent, they don't mean to do that. That need to be have a gun and they want to have a hunting license, but then you look at the work of organizations like National Wild Turkey Federation, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, ducks on limited Theodore Roosevelt conservation partnership back country hunters and anglers.

Speaker 7:          02:43:41       You're these groups that are hunter based, habitat improvement, hunter based wildlife organizations. Those are the people paying for the things in, in financing the research that gives the anti hunters even an idea of what they're trying to defend it. Like in this country, it would not exist if we didn't have some idea of publicly owned, commodified wildlife where we recognize that wildlife is has value and should be maintained for the future. You could have a bunch of Rosie opinions about all that. We would just take care of these things because we should, and I agree. It'd be great if we did, but one of the best things that can happen to a species now in contemporary America, one of the best things that can happen to it is that it's at, it has a perceived value to hunters because we want to make sure that our resources are safeguarded and are going to be around for a long time to come and they're going to be round for our kids and not talk about that. It's altruistic or anything else is based on pragmatism, but we're taking care of our own and we're handling our own issues.

Speaker 1:          02:44:47       Have you ever had a real legitimate debate with someone who's an animal rights activists where they sat down for a long period of time, like on a podcast and had a long form conversation because never because no one shallow, it's a shallow conversation on their part. It's a shell

Speaker 7:          02:45:04       station on my part because like if I sat down with someone, um, I'd go into it just as, as holy as they would just be like, I'm never going to change my mind.

Speaker 1:          02:45:15       I don't think you would because that conversation that you had with that guy at that book signing shows that you've got a pretty nuanced point of view when it comes to this. It's something you've considered. I've tried to defend it from that point of view in order to understand it better. And the problem is there's nothing there it goes, it gets shallow. When you go into this idea of overpopulation, you go on the idea of what, what, what are you gonna do? You're gonna bring in predators. Like how are you going to control this population? Because if you don't, you don't really love these animals because the bottom line about game animals when it comes to like things like deer and elk and they must be hunted either by wolves or by mountain lions or by people because of they're not, they're just going to fuck and they're just going to overpopulate and they're going to,

Speaker 7:          02:45:57       you get like something like the hand, are you gay? Are you wind up where you're at with the Hamptons or where you're at with New Zealand where then you have government financed control efforts where you have people willing to pay to do something or you finance the, you know, the sort of managed,

Speaker 5:          02:46:15       well I wanted, I would love to hear that conversation. Like what is the, what's, what's the contrary point of view? It's, I did Bill Maher. No, he's a fucking silly bitch. Yeah, that guy is so silly. He's friends with Anne culter and he's, he's such a weird dude when it comes to Sony things. But the Pieta thing is a knee jerk reactionary thing that you can do if you're getting all your food from a fucking supermarket and you're so not in touch with the natural world, you're banging playboy playmates at the mansion. That's a fucking wildlife preserve right there. That's a fence. Didn't preserve well another area, I'm sorry, go ahead. But it's just, I want to know what the point of view is. What is the debate against, because I've never seen it done. I've never seen it success

Speaker 7:          02:46:55       talking about two different things, but you're not really, but I think that people would come and they'd be talking about just suffering. Okay. Animal suffering. I could never look someone in the eye and say, I could never look someone in the eye and say that an animal is, uh, willfully lending themselves to slaughter. I could ever look someone in the eye and say that, oh yeah, hunting animals is painless procedure. And so they have a thing where they value if their primary thing is stopping any level of suffering happening to any individual sentient being. And that's their goal. My goal is just so different. My goal is to have a managed, when I say manage, I'm just saying sustainable. I'm not saying anything to have a sustainable suite of North American wildlife that we can manage into the future for, for myself and future generations to enjoy. And that we can leave the country and leave the world in a, in a better place.

Speaker 5:          02:47:57       The logic and than we found it. I think that's a scientific perspective, Steve. And when you're talking to Peter People, the reason that chart, it's a religious, you're talking about religious fanatics in a way. Well, it's a shallow thought thinking process because they've only looked at it on the surface and they've looked at it in a way where they've conveniently ignored the fact that these are animals that have a finite lifespan and that the animals that are traditionally hunted by predators, human, you're partnering with people who are religious, but are they, are they or are they just trying to, are they just nice people that haven't looked into it? Some people, I think some of the Peta people and some of the movement came when we realized that a big Pharma and, and uh, cause cosmetics industry, and we're using animals for experiments like chimpanzees and bunny rabbits with lipstick.

Speaker 5:          02:48:44       And a lot of people said, you know, why are, why are you making animals suffer on these farms where you're using them for their fur and using testing makeup on them and they're going blind or you're, you're seeing how a monkey reacts when you take its baby or way you in the end, the animal sobs or even, and I don't know the extent of how much HIV drugs have benefited from, from experimentation on chimpanzees, but I've read very heartbreaking accounts of chimpanzees that are given HIV. And they just saw because they feel sick and they feel terrible and they literally just put their head in their hands and sob in a alone in some cases. So you can understand all of us, I think all of us go, wait a minute, I can understand going, that's not right. I don't want, I don't want to buy products that are tests on animals.

Speaker 5:          02:49:30       And we all do that. So I think some of the Peta movement was fueled by that particular thing and Doug Raises Doug raises beef cattle and he just said that there's some cattle practices that he's uncomfortable with. Yeah. And suddenly we were all drawing lines and you're right, you know, a lot of us could look like if you can put some kind of shampoo and a rabbit's eye and determined that that's not a good recipe for shampoo and you could have read the same conclusion in some way that didn't involve animals suffering. It's a, it's a potent argument. Yeah. But a lot of trucks that save lives, they do. You do. You start in a petri dish, then you do test them on animals. In the last group is a, is a, is a controlled group of humans. She read a book about this, that that's what you do. And the reason you test on animals is because you have to see initially how it's going to react in an organism is complex as a, as a, as an animal organism to see if it has adverse side effects before you go on to test it on to a human. So it's a, but I can, I can appreciate, like I said, when somebody says, if you're testing animals to see if you, if somebody can look prettier, I can see that being somebody can have an objection.

Speaker 13:         02:50:37       So then it becomes a question of what, what's, what's worth what's worth testing on animals. Yeah. And I, yeah, I couldn't agree with more. And Steve's right. I've in my people will call you if you're mistreating your animals in our area, other people who have animals and people who hunt. And it's hard if you're mistreating your animals, you get called out on it. I'm in our area. People will say, you know, wait a minute, just like if you're doing poor, uh, uh, management practices and your fields and what not, people will, will call you out on it. Why aren't you doing contour stripping? Or why aren't you taking care of, you know, why don't you take care of things. So, you know, it's sort of an extension of that. So it, you know, in my view it ends up being, there's a balance in all of this. And Yeah, case by case, I, I'd go with you. There's things, I mean, I don't, I'm not worried about personally not worried about I make up or that kind of stuff. So I don't think it makes

Speaker 5:          02:51:23       you shouldn't be, you'd look beautiful. There was a question about whether I was going to something that literally, I know, but the marketplace, by the way, because of that, that education that a lot of the marketplace has said, you know, you see a lot of, how many products do you see that not tested on animals? So not a ways. The marketplace kind of went, you know what? A lot of people, all of us went, I don't want an animal. I don't want that. Well, there's big difference between testing cosmetics, which is so frivolous, or testing medicine, which you can save your children. There's a huge difference. In my eyes, I don't have a problem with them. Testing medicine that can save babies are really, I'm sorry. I don't, I like people more than I like animals. I have to the whole vaccine. I mean all of our major vaccines, man, we wouldn't have, yeah, I have two dogs. I have two cats. I love animals. I fucking do animals. I love to

Speaker 6:          02:52:05       eat. I'm too though. I'll tell you a surprising thing I saw one time did we? Did we got to, do we have more? Do we have a couple minutes? We're, we're running out of steam here. I'll do, I'll, well, I'll say it for next time. We turn into a Pumpkin at three hours in. We talked about a lot of this on the, on the show eater. He gets on. Yeah. Tomorrow night. The show needs to be an hour. Don't you think you show needs to be an hour? I'd love to see the show because sports channel, the candidate, Sarah Pailin, broad

Speaker 5:          02:52:30       fucking [inaudible] some questions about that one too. But

Speaker 6:          02:52:35       sure. It's going to bring attention to the network, which is a great thing because it's a great network and they, they support that show, which is the best show on television all the time about going into hour. And we talked about the upsides and downsides. Don't know, there's no downside, there's no downside. There's something really just, but I, I've fallen in love a little bit hesitant. Love with just how clean and crisp 2020 well done. How, how clean and crisp like a well done. It's too good a show. Um, you're right. That's flattery. Flattery, 44 minutes please. It means in ease an hour and needs no commercials.

Speaker 9:          02:53:10       That's great. I couldn't agree with you more, but I really got to get this in or Helen's going to give me heck after awhile. Helen's you can give me hell and that is the show on. But then also the show tomorrow night is the second part of our episode. And I honestly, I'm excited to see it because I have no idea what happens in this second part, other than I know what happened while we were there. But what became a part of [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          02:53:32       what out of that 80 hours made it really interesting that Steve, you know what the first show we did, Steve

Speaker 9:          02:53:38       warned me and said, well, you know, nobody likes the way they come across. And I, yeah, and I, and I was, it felt exactly the opposite. And then the other thing is that you can download episodes on,

You can stream and download. There it is right there. Oh yeah, yeah. Awesome. Fucking show. Live Bra. It really is the best show on television. And you know, I get a lot of compliments about the show. People that love it, that I turned on to it and did not even hunters. They have no desire to hunt. They never want to hunt. They just love it. It's a great show. It's great narration. It's just, it's a really special thing, man. Joe Rogan is the best thing that ever happened with the show.
