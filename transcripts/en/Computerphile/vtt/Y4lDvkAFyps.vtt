00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
It's all about being in the "In Crowd" and
I've been reflecting about this, you know,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.030
and sociologists would have a field day
about it.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.969
Yeah, at Bell Labs they, of course, were the
Computing Science research section. They

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.539
could afford their own computers but I
think, even there, they liked the idea that

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.240
it was THEIR computer and it wasn't the
Computing Center's computer, although

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.790
there was one. Let me go way back to the
sixties and seventies when multi-user

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.530
computing came on the scene, even here
at Nottingham. It was batch, it was cards and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.719
paper tape in those days.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.250
But, of course, the university had to make
quite sure that your username

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.469
reflected a fair bit about you, so they
could categorize you. I remember, I think

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:02.430
I was PMZDFB. P [for] Pure Science
faculty; M [for] Mathematics department; Z

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.270
(don't me why!) [for] member of academic
staff. DFB - 6 characters. We were all

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.159
like that. But when we could afford
our first UNIX computer we thought: "We can

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.860
be like Bell Labs. ! " I could be just "dfb".
We're in with the in-crowd!  We've got our

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.350
own computer and it's all ours!

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.780
I'm sure that was an awful lot of what
was being reflected in that. If you say

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
BWK, way over 90% of the computer science 
audience will tell you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.329
who that person is.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.320
But I've checked back with Brian about
this and I said: "Well, was it always

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.479
initials?". Because I know in North America,
y'know, "First name, middle initial, surname" is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.180
very common. He said: "Well, almost always"

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.799
And I said: "Well, what about Ken Thompson then
 - he's 'ken' isn't he?!". And it was more or

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.549
less: "Dave are you going to tell
Ken can't he can't be 'ken' ?!" No, apparently

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.740
Ken, because he was so early on was on
MULTICS, not just on UNIX -  an absolutely

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.860
ground-zero multi-user system and which
he was helping to design. He was 'ken' and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.480
that was allowed you see.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.070
So, I think the rule came about that if
you'd got a short first name then fine,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.600
that might be used as well. So that was
part of the whole thinking behind all

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.360
this. And I guess the next question I
asked Brian - because I know how it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.060
evolved here -  was were you allowed to have 
more than three letters? And he said: "Oh yeah!
yeah! There was a guy,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.500
I think his surname was 'Chesney'. He was always
'ches'. No problem, y' know. And so oh! 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.040
and Rob Pike, I think, was allowed to be 'rob' y'see.
And I said: "Well, did

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.690
anybody try to pull rank and say 'I'm senior, I 
want that [acronym]' ?"  Again, according

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.540
to Brian : "No, no it was first come first served;

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.440
if you got the acronym then that was yours".
So it started me off

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.170
on thinking, well, if I'd only been
fortunate enough to stay longer at Bell

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.030
Labs. - in my brief visit in 1986 - I
didn't stay long enough. But if i could

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.780
only have had a username could I have been 'dfb'  
at Bell Labs. ? The answer is "yes", but

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.270
here's the sad story:  Dr. Heartbleed -
he's 'srb' - so I said to Brian: "How about

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.780
'srb' at Bell Labs.? He said: "Sorry Stevie -it's 
gone already,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.350
[to] Steve Bourne, inventor of the Bourne Shell.
We would have had to find something else".

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.070
When you think about it you can see some
of the perils and pitfalls and this

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.800
what about if two people have very
nearly the same three-letter codes but

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.940
not quite and you accidentally send the
wrong email to the wrong person. That has

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.250
happened to me with Steve [Bagley] a few times. 
In fact with two Steves, that are a bit

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.310
ambiguous, in fact both are  on Computerphile.
Steve Bagley is 'srb'; Steve Benford, of

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.209
blogging guitar fame, is 'sdb'. And I have
from time to time, had a baffled visit

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.970
from 'sdb' saying:  "What on earth do I know
about document engineering", or something

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.870
like this.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.020
The virtue was, of these very simple
three-letter names 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.390
was - you've got to remember is that you're back 
in the days of dumb terminals here. Pretty

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:24.560
well keyboard, character-driven terminals
What you type is what you get. It could

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.180
have auto-completed but that would have
been in its infancy. The idea of auto

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.330
completion and, yes, then you can click on it

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.940
No. That had to come in the future - that
came in with graphics terminals, later

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.500
UNIX, Windows, Macs, all that. So there you
are out in a .... visiting Bell Labs. You've got

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.490
a dumb terminal. You want to send
somebody an email. Being able to type,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.360
whatever you would be, 'sar', at something.
Easy to type - that mattered a lot. I

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.970
still routinely type three-letter
acronyms to get through to people on

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.130
email. Unless I'm replying to something,
of course, then that's all automated.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.580
It's not just computer scientists - 
although we're probably the worst about it.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.970
But, as you know, in high-school teaching,
in in any organization where somebody's

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.450
trying to say: "Who's in charge of this
item on the agenda? Who's the person

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.110
responsible?".,  rather than writing a full
name you'll often just put three

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.250
initials at the bottom. Again, it's in the
"in crowd". We board members know who each

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.250
other are and 'abc'is in charge of this
particular matter. When we come to doing

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.290
our grading sheets - our mark sheets - here.
every year, and we look at each student's

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.470
individual performance there's always a
little bit added on in the corner - the

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.510
three-letter login name of the academic
member of staff responsible for that student

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.870
- and that helps enormously.
&gt;&gt; Sean:  What happens if you've got initials 
that don't really ...

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.590
let's say they're not they're not
something you want to be known as ?!

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.860
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yes ....
&gt;&gt; Sean: There are some rude examples of this
but let's try one that isn't maybe so ...

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.890
Well, I know that many of the viewers
here are very familiar with things like

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.410
github. Now I know what git means but I've
wondered: "Well is there some other kind

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.340
of more universal meaning, of git

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.270
than that?" And i looked it up and
it says, on Wikipedia no less, that 'git' is

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.940
a UK-inspired prefix for a person
who's just very very annoying, which is

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.360
true. I don't think there's any other
meaning behind the 'git' in 'github'

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.580
other than that. So, y' know, somebody
called  George Ian Taylor might not

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.560
like having the three letter acronym 'git'.
The only other thing I

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.310
think we haven't covered is: "What happens
with people that have only got two

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.010
initials, yeah?"  Now apparently at Bell Labs
Brian tells me that Tom Duff who is

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:03.570
really famous - fabulous computer graphics guy
and, everybody, the inventor of Duff's Device,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.400
Look it up! I might even do a separate
video on that at some stage. Yeah! Tom Duff. so

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.870
famous he was just allowed to be 'td'. Now has
amazed me because my Dad - and we can

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.310
refer back to YouTube videos again - when
he was with his Type X machine, out in

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.810
the field, he had to have US Air Force
accreditation because he was reporting

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.280
as a cipher clerk, to the US Air Force. He got
his documentation. You know what it said

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:34.889
at the top?  "Frank NMI Brailsford". So
what does NMI stand for?
&gt;&gt; Sean/DFB (in unison): "No Middle Initial!" (laughter) 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:42.870
So, y' know, I'm surprised to find
that Tom Duff has no middle initial.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.410
I'm not saying it's quite unique in
North America but there we go.
&gt;&gt; Sean: I would

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.960
have thought, perhaps, lots of systems
required that this had to be of the same format?

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.720
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yes again you know in asking Brian about
the background to all of this he

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.380
points out that there was a sort of
feeling that maybe not going beyond four

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.660
would be a good thing because - again it's
something we hope to get on to in

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.880
other videos - there was some weird word
lengths in early computers and for

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.190
example i remember that on the ICL
series computers there were 6-bit

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:26.010
characters - not 8-bit characters - and
24-bit integer words. So four 

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.430
characters - four sixes are 24 - would fit into

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:38.889
one word on a computer like that. I think
he said, similarly, one of the machines he

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:43.959
was on, it was fine to have up to six
characters - it was all efficient because

00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:49.990
six sixes are 36 - it was a 36 bit machine. So 
those kinds of considerations because we're

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:55.389
computer scientists, were background
factors as well. Should we set a quiz?

00:08:55.389 --> 00:09:02.560
Right. Just a little quiz. Who can be the
first commenter not to say "first", but to

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:11.199
tell you, Sean, the answer to the following
question: "Who is 'dek'" 
&gt;&gt; Sean: Any clues?  Is it a bit ...

00:09:11.199 --> 00:09:15.670
&gt;&gt; DFB: I don't want to give too many clothes
except to say he's a computer scientist,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.850
yes, and a second and rather harder one.
Another very famous computer scientist

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:28.660
who was at Bell Labs. but is no longer there.
But he's very famous and it's a he.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:35.019
His acronym at Bell Labs was 'ava' and
it's not female,

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:38.740
it's male, it's not a surname. He was 'ava'

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:43.839
Who was that?
&gt;&gt; Sean:  Good! I hope these aren't just
available on Google and people just go ...

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:46.839
&gt;&gt; DFB: Oh they might do. They might be . I don't know.
