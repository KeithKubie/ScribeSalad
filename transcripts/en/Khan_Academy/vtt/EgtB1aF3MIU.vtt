00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:01.949
- [Voiceover] On the number line above,

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.852
the tick marks are equally spaced

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:06.148
and their coordinates are shown.

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:08.949
Of these coordinates,
which has the smallest

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.130
positive value?

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:11.898
So this is interesting.

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:13.050
These are equally spaced.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.172
We start at negative eight and we have

00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:18.845
one, two, three, four,

00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:21.626
five, six equal spaces

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:23.610
to get all the way to 10.

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.849
So what must be the space
between these tick marks here?

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:29.277
Well, to go from negative eight to 10,

00:00:29.277 --> 00:00:31.880
to go all the way from
negative eight to 10,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.152
you have increased by 18

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:37.345
or the difference between
negative eight and 10 is 18.

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:38.936
You have to go eight to get to zero

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.873
and then 10 more to get to 10.

00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:43.125
So this distance is 18.

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:45.390
We've split it into six sections,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.155
six equal sections.

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.105
So 18 divided by six,

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:52.493
each of these sections must
have a length of three.

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.873
So they each have a length of three.

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:57.173
So now we can figure out the values

00:00:57.173 --> 00:01:00.167
of A, B, C, D and E.

00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:02.652
A gets us to negative five.

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.383
I'm just adding three each time.

00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:08.004
B is at negative two
and then you add three,

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.187
you get to C, which is at one

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:11.592
and we've already answered our question.

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:13.333
This is the smallest positive value.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.783
We went from the most
negative, we keep increasing

00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:17.826
and this is the first of the choices.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:20.145
This is the first positive value we hit.

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:24.925
So C has the smallest
positive, positive value.

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:26.788
Then we could keep
going if you're curious.

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:28.564
D, you're going to add another three.

00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:29.731
D is four.

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.632
E is seven and then you add three more

00:01:31.632 --> 00:01:33.485
and we get to 10.

00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:36.677
We wanted the smallest positive value

00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:37.991
out of the choices,

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:40.066
and that's going to be C.
