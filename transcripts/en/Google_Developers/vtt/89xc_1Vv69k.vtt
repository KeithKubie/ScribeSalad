00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.370
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome vice
president of engineering for Google, Vic Gundotra.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:16.250
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Well, good morning, everybody.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.700
You made it, even at this early hour.
I hope you enjoyed that party last night.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.700
How --
[ Applause ]

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.220
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.460
How about that spider?
Was that cool or what?

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.809
After a few drinks, I thought that thing was
going to chase me.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.210
A lot of fun.
Let me also welcome the many thousands who

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.820
are watching our live stream on YouTube.
Yesterday, just for your information, we had

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.649
over 24,000 people watching it concurrently
live.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.030
So in addition to the 5,000-plus folks we
had here, we had almost 30,000 watch us yesterday.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.999
So welcome to everyone watching on YouTube.
[ Applause ]

00:00:52.999 --> 00:01:01.269
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: To begin today's keynote,
I'd like to start with a story.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.390
It's a story of my very first day on the job
at Google.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.200
Now, I'm sure you've all been at a new job.
You understand the apprehensiveness you might

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.481
feel with a new office, new people.
It was on that very first day that I met a

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:22.659
man named Mr. Andy Rubin.
Now, I suspect most of you know who Andy Rubin

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.610
is.
At the time, he was responsible for what was

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.520
then a secret project code-named "Android."
And on that first day, Andy enthusiastically

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.049
described to me the team's mission and purpose.
And as he spoke, I'll level with you, I was

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.689
skeptical.
In fact, I interrupted Andy.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.920
And I said, "Andy, I don't get it.
Does the world really need another mobile

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.289
operating system?
Google's about advertising.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.229
Shouldn't we be on every phone?"
To this day, I remember Andy's response.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.939
And he made two points.
The first point Andy made was that it was

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.340
critically important to provide a free mobile
operating system, an open source operating

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.520
system, that would enable innovation at every
level of the stack.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.660
In other words, OEMs should be free to build
all kinds of devices, devices with keyboards,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.640
without keyboards, with front-facing cameras,
two inches, three inches, four inches, that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.110
operators should be able to compete on the
strength and coverage of their network, 2G,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.860
3G, 4G, LTP, CDMA.
And that in the end, with innovation coming

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.660
at every layer, it would be the consumer who
would be able to benefit by getting the best

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.520
device and best network for them.
I remember Andy's second point.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:54.360
He argued that if Google did not act, we faced
a Draconian future, a future where one man,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.140
one company, one device, one carrier would
be our only choice.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.760
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That's a future we don't want.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.520
So if you believe in openness, if you believe
in choice, if you believe in innovation from

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.010
everyone, then welcome to Android.
Now, let's get started.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.510
Let's talk a little bit about the momentum
that we've achieved in 18 months.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.890
It's been a year and a half since we've started
with Android.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.290
How are we doing?
Let's do a little bit of a report card.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.880
First of all, let's demonstrate some momentum.
It's hard to believe that in only 18 months,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.620
we've achieved over 60 compatible devices,
where your software, where your applications

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.831
can run.
And these devices are not just from, you know,

00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:53.030
people you haven't heard of.
These are from the leading consumer electronic

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.600
companies in the world, Sony Ericsson, HTC,
Motorola, and many others, who are producing

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.000
devices that meet the needs of consumers.
We think this is pretty fantastic progress

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.830
in just 18 months.
Of course, it's not just the creation of the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.170
devices.
It's the 21 OEMs in 48 countries and over

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.919
59 carriers who have joined the Android revolution.
Of course, producing devices, making them

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.100
available across a multitude of countries
and carriers doesn't necessarily mean that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.480
we're going to see adoption.
Have users found Android to be something that

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.419
they desire?
Well, last year, we reported, late last year,

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:46.090
that we had reached a sales run rate, a daily
activation rate, of over 30,000 units a day.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.889
In February, just a few months later, we announced
that our daily run rate had achieved 60,000

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.210
units a day.
I'm very proud to announce today that our

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.660
run rate daily activations has now passed
100,000 a day.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.979
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Go, Android!

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.249
Of course, that momentum has led to some pretty
significant milestones.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.499
One of the ones we are most proud of is that
this quarter, we are now second in the United

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:23.409
States in smartphone sales, second only to
RIM.

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.900
And that's pretty amazing progress in 18 months.
We're second in smartphone sales, but according

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.360
to AdMob data, we are now first this quarter
in total Web and app usage.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.930
That's fantastic.
[ Applause ]

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:46.439
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know, we set a crazy internal
milestone for ourselves.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.270
The phones are being used by consumers, but
what are they being used for?

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.990
And we set a crazy internal goal when we shipped
turn-by-turn navigation for Android.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.060
We thought it might be possible to have a
half a billion miles navigated in the first

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.560
year.
In hardly six months, we've now crossed a

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.180
billion miles navigated with turn-by-turn
navigation on Android.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.819
So users just love that feature.
Thank you.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:20.039
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: There are some who say that

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.400
users don't use Google Search on smartphones.
Well, we're a company driven by data, not

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.990
by opinions.
And you know what the data shows?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.349
The data shows that we've seen a 5X growth
in the past two years.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.850
That's not just on Android, but that's across
all smartphone categories.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.039
People love Google search.
You give them a great browser, and they do

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.189
Google search, tremendous, awesome usage of
the Web on these devices.

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:49.669
Of course, what they love is applications.
And today I'm happy to announce that we've

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.449
crossed 50,000 applications in the Android
Marketplace.

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:58.841
And, really, the credit there goes to you.
Thank you, for the 180,000 developers.

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:06.280
Thank you.
The 180,000 developers who have joined the

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.370
Android revolution.
Really, it's your hard work that's paired

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.900
with the innovation that's coming from OEMs
and carriers that makes the mobile ecosystem

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.090
work.
We certainly couldn't have done this without

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.620
you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for supporting

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.139
Android.
[ Applause ]

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.970
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, let's talk about the
platform.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.680
We've finished the section on momentum.
Let's talk about what we're doing to make

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.090
the Android platform continue to evolve and
get better.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.580
In this section, I have over 20 demos, 22
demos, I believe.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.550
In order to help me with that, I'd like to
invite up on stage Matt Waddell, my partner

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.180
in crime here.
Many of you may remember Matt from last year.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.050
And we're going to go through a number of
demos that are going to really showcase what

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.909
we're doing with Android.
There are five major areas of investments

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:57.741
that we're making in the platform.
Now, we've been quick to iterate with Android.

00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:00.979
In fact, there's been seven releases in those
18 months.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:07.729
And today we're announcing the next release,
Android 2.2 code-named Froyo.

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:14.599
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: What's in Froyo?

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:20.150
Let's talk about five pillars.
Number one, let's begin with speed.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:27.639
Now, as you developers know, the Android architecture
is one that's built upon a virtual machine,

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:30.189
the Dalvik virtual machine.
We think it's important.

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:36.310
It's a critical design decision that we made
that future-proofs your application.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:41.450
We have big dreams for Android.
And part of those dreams mean that Android

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.810
will go to new places with new chip architectures.
But by having your applications write to the

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:52.790
virtual machine, we believe we can carry the
entire ecosystem to exciting new areas.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.910
Of course, that only works if the virtual
machine is fast and the Dalvik VM has done

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.660
its job being fast, efficient, and automatic
and easy for developers.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.880
But we can do even better.
We're very proud to announce that in Froyo,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.950
we've added a JIT, a just-in-time compiler,
this gives up to two to five X speedup of

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.760
your apps on the exact same hardware.
Now, this is best demonstrated.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.930
And let's do that.
Let's go to our first demo.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.830
We're going to show you a game.
The game has been modified for purposes of

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.790
this demo.
You guys may know Replica Island.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:32.250
Here's what we've done to modify the game.
The game now will show the frame rate that

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.130
it's rendering in the bottom right-hand corner.
If the frame rate drops beneath 30 frames

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:42.540
a second, the screen will Flash red.
Exact same hardware, exact same game, top

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.070
is running Froyo with JIT compilation, the
bottom is running Eclair.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.570
We're going to introduce a crazy number of
monsters into this game.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:54.250
You see the monsters keep getting added, increasing
the complexity.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.880
You see the frame rate at the top.
As we add complexity, it starts to slow down.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.280
You'll note there at the bottom, there are
times when we're dropping beneath 30 frame

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.620
a second and it's flashing red.
You'll note at the top, with Froyo, exactly

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:12.300
the same game runs much better, never dropping
beneath 30 frames a second, all because of

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.420
the JIT compiler.
All right.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.160
Let's go back to slides.
