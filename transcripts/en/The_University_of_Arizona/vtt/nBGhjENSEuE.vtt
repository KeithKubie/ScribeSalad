00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.650
What is it that you can tell me about
that goes on behind the scenes,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:15.820
underground, above-ground, all around that
keeps the university running in terms of

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.660
facilities, in terms of heating, cooling,
all those kind of issues that nobody

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.140
knows about? Sure. Our facilities
department — we got over 600 employees.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.390
They just do an outstanding job. And part
of what we do not only are custodial and

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.260
our grounds, it's our utility management
system of the entire campus. And so we

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.310
have three plants on campus. We're
producing over 36,000 tons of chilled

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.910
water that we're producing and sending
out to the buildings in the middle of

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.380
the summer when it's 115 degrees. We're
also trying to drive down costs. We have

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.860
thermal ice that we produce that helps
us go ahead and lower our overall

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.700
electrical costs. Our utility bill on
average is about $38 million

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.750
dollars. We've been able to lower that
millions and millions over the years due to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.570
the hard work of our facilities
management utilities staff. Tell me a

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.070
little bit about how you interact with
students because you're having to keep

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.210
us all supported, but at the same time,
there are learning and teaching

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.659
opportunities. Definitely. You know, we
have several themes within our

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.899
facilities department. One of them is we
run it like a business, extremely

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.579
effective and efficient. But also, we
graduate students. 40 to 50 classes will

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.640
come through these power plants —
mechanical engineers, electrical

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.090
engineers. It's just a great
collaborative effort. Yeah, I think it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.170
fits right in with our land-grant
mission. I mean these are all the kind of

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.960
things that we're trying to help our
students get skills and knowledge to go

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.450
out there and be competitive in this
very rapidly changing world, and data is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.189
a big one. It takes a great team,
harnessing the big data, so we can make

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.049
real-time decisions that have positive
benefits in our operations and then as

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.709
the strategic plan continues moving
forward, it's going to give additional

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.579
opportunities to do other initiatives if
we're being extremely efficient on our

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.619
operations side of the house. What are
some of the technological or

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.680
evolutionary changes you see coming down
we need

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.000
be aware of? We have a 10-year plan
right now to take all our buildings on

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.960
campus and have the building automation
systems all computerized. And so we're

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.610
dealing with somewhat older systems. If
we can compress that to five years we're

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.910
going to see even more positive benefits
in terms of financial benefits and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.740
operational benefits, which also then
have major benefits for the culture

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.459
inside the buildings, for the academics,
for the students, for the research. We

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.270
have 800 meters that we've installed
underground and we can go ahead and read

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.260
every one of those each morning and see
a variance analysis. You can go ahead and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.880
look at the monitors, you can measure
what's above the variance line, and then

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.660
make the proper decisions — what needs to
be repaired in a timely fashion. This is

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.709
like running a small city. We are a small
city, and the ability to look at policies

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.410
but also the hands-on, experiential
problem-solving, these are all the things

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.030
that we hope that our students are going
to acquire as skills and knowledge for

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.780
critical thinking, collaborative teamwork,
because you've got incredible

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.160
collaborative teamwork. And I just
appreciate the the reality check of

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.940
seeing it in practice right here today.
We're not talking about something

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.830
futuristic, you're doing it every day.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.709
