ERIC BIDELMAN:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.370
I'm Eric Bidelman.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.240
I'm a developer
advocate here at Google,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.440
working in the Polymer
team and Web Components.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.160
Web Components are a fundamental
shift in web development.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.260
They're going to
change everything.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.720
They're the future
of web development,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.136
and we're thrilled
that all of you

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.360
are here today helping out
and learning about them.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.136
Welcome to Polytechnic.

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:18.510
Throughout the
month of November,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540
we've partnered with
hundreds of developer groups

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.640
around the world that host
similar events like this one.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.970
We're excited to see what
all you guys are going

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.636
to build today on top
of Web Components.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:27.440
So for all of you that
are new to Polymer,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.650
we actually started the
project over two years ago

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.462
as an OpenSource project,
and we started it

00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:33.170
for a couple of really
important reasons.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.100
First, it was to gain
valuable experience

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.050
and provide feedback to
the standards bodies.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.050
This has been really
important to kind of evolve

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.200
the specs over time.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.360
The four main specs-- HTML
imports, custom elements,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.529
Shadow DOM, and
templates-- these

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:47.320
have all improved over
the last four years,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.700
largely thanks to
the Polymer teams'

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.980
involvement of these projects.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.980
The second thing
we wanted to do,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.150
we wanted to create a
well-lit path for developers.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.970
This includes building a set of
polyfills so you the developer

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.060
can use Web Components
today in browsers

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.736
that don't support
the Native APIs.

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:01.610
We wanted to make
developers more productive.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.069
I like writing less code,
and I'm sure you do too.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.430
Web Components do a whole lot
for web developer ergonomics.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.300
They allow you to build
reusable, declarative,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.825
interoperable, custom elements.

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:13.950
And of course, we're starting
a new ecosystem here,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.230
an entirely new ecosystem
of Web Components.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.410
So we wanted at the
Polymer team to seed

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.740
the community with a
valuable set of rich,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.470
visual, and non-visual
custom elements,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.610
show the power of
these technologies.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.720
Most recently too, we
talked about material design

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.345
at Google I/O. Polymer has
a set of paper elements

00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:31.950
that you can use to achieve
material design in your apps.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.754
So with Android
and Web, now we can

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:36.170
create the same app that looks
and feels exactly the same.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.480
So if you're new to
Polymer, welcome.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.930
You're going to
learn a lot today.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.250
If you've already tried
it, help someone else out.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.450
Upload your stuff to GitHub.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.160
Create something
reusable, something new.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.070
We'd love your feedback,
so please, please

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100
file bugs if you find
anything that's amiss.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.070
So thanks a lot.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.000
Have a lot of fun,
enjoy the schwag,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.650
and go componentize the web.
