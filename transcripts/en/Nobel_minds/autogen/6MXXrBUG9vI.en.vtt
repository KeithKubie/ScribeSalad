Nobel Prize well thank you of course I'm
humbled and thrilled how did the news

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
humbled and thrilled how did the news
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.220
humbled and thrilled how did the news
come to you I got a telephone call about

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
come to you I got a telephone call about
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.480
come to you I got a telephone call about
ten minutes ago

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
ten minutes ago
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.470
ten minutes ago
just before they started the session I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
just before they started the session I
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.130
just before they started the session I
guess so it really couldn't have arrived

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
guess so it really couldn't have arrived
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229
guess so it really couldn't have arrived
any faster the news because the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
any faster the news because the
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.910
any faster the news because the
announcement of gravitational waves was

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
announcement of gravitational waves was
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.540
announcement of gravitational waves was
only made last year putting LIGO

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
only made last year putting LIGO
 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.479
only made last year putting LIGO
together and getting this result it took

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
together and getting this result it took
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.490
together and getting this result it took
many decades and an awful lot of work

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
many decades and an awful lot of work
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.750
many decades and an awful lot of work
where did that dedication come from I

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760
where did that dedication come from I
 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.970
where did that dedication come from I
think a hard question to answer I think

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
think a hard question to answer I think
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.040
think a hard question to answer I think
is a personal part you have to be

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
is a personal part you have to be
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110
is a personal part you have to be
someone who doesn't need instant

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
someone who doesn't need instant
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.900
someone who doesn't need instant
gratification but I think the scientific

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
gratification but I think the scientific
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.679
gratification but I think the scientific
goals and the technical challenges were

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
goals and the technical challenges were
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.300
goals and the technical challenges were
the two things that equally motivated me

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
the two things that equally motivated me
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.450
the two things that equally motivated me
this technical challenges were technical

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
this technical challenges were technical
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.190
this technical challenges were technical
challenges that were not unbeatable

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200
challenges that were not unbeatable
 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.600
challenges that were not unbeatable
learn how to do things and had to build

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
learn how to do things and had to build
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.530
learn how to do things and had to build
a sensitive enough device it took us 20

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
a sensitive enough device it took us 20
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120
a sensitive enough device it took us 20
years after we built the first version

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
years after we built the first version
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.840
years after we built the first version
of my go detector and of course the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
of my go detector and of course the
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.910
of my go detector and of course the
science is unbelievable so we're I think

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920
science is unbelievable so we're I think
 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.679
science is unbelievable so we're I think
it's not hard to be motivated for 20

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
it's not hard to be motivated for 20
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569
it's not hard to be motivated for 20
years to do the kind of science were

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
years to do the kind of science were
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.780
years to do the kind of science were
starting to be able to do the precision

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
starting to be able to do the precision
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.889
starting to be able to do the precision
of this instrument this point

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
of this instrument this point
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.700
of this instrument this point
unbelievable isn't it yes it is the size

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
unbelievable isn't it yes it is the size
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710
unbelievable isn't it yes it is the size
of the effect that we measured from the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
of the effect that we measured from the
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.499
of the effect that we measured from the
first event emerging to black hole the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
first event emerging to black hole the
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.050
first event emerging to black hole the
actual size of the signal was about

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
actual size of the signal was about
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.649
actual size of the signal was about
1,000 the size of a proton what it did

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
1,000 the size of a proton what it did
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.260
1,000 the size of a proton what it did
to our apparatus so we were able to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
to our apparatus so we were able to
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.230
to our apparatus so we were able to
measure a movement or a change of length

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
measure a movement or a change of length
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.719
measure a movement or a change of length
of the apparatus by the passage of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
of the apparatus by the passage of
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.990
of the apparatus by the passage of
gravitational waves to that accuracy and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
gravitational waves to that accuracy and
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.420
gravitational waves to that accuracy and
then measure its form well enough to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
then measure its form well enough to
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.990
then measure its form well enough to
decide what a while

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
decide what a while
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.020
decide what a while
that's pretty unbelievable it's a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030
that's pretty unbelievable it's a
 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.790
that's pretty unbelievable it's a
testament to human ingenuity isn't it to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800
testament to human ingenuity isn't it to
 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.260
testament to human ingenuity isn't it to
modern technology science I think this

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270
modern technology science I think this
 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.000
modern technology science I think this
couldn't have been done fifty years ago

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010
couldn't have been done fifty years ago
 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.190
couldn't have been done fifty years ago
or 20 years ago or 30 years ago it's

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
or 20 years ago or 30 years ago it's
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.420
or 20 years ago or 30 years ago it's
taken best modern literature's and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
taken best modern literature's and
 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.840
taken best modern literature's and
control and engineering will we'll be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
control and engineering will we'll be
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.180
control and engineering will we'll be
welcoming you to Stockholm in December

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
welcoming you to Stockholm in December
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.300
welcoming you to Stockholm in December
yeah is great to talk to you in

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310
yeah is great to talk to you in
 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.160
yeah is great to talk to you in
congratulations okay thank you bye bye

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
congratulations okay thank you bye bye
