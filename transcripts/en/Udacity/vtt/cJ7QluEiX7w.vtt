00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's have some fun.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This gentleman you probably don't know. His name is Monty Hall.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Starting in 1963, for many years Monty Hall ran a game show called Let's Make a Deal.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In the center of the game show was a puzzle

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that puzzles statisticians to the present day.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In this unit, which is optional in the statistics class,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'll let you solve the Monty Hall problem, and you'll get a chance to program it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to verify that the assertion, which is not obvious, is actually correct.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Here we go.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The essence of the game are three doors.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Behind one of those is a beautiful car, but Monty won't tell you where the car is.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Instead, all the doors are covered by curtains.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The subject of the game is as follows.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You get to place a bet. Say you pick door 2.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If behind the bet you place you'll win the car. Otherwise, you'll win nothing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So far, so good.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here's the caveat.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Obviously, between the two remaining doors there'd be one that doesn't contain the car.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Monty is going to be mean. He's going to show you.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
He's going to lift the curtain from one of the other doors, and there is clearly no car.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
After now closing the curtain again, he'll ask you do you want to switch.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That is, do you want to change your vote to the remaining curtain

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in the hopes of having an increased chance of winning the car.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The reason why this problem is interesting is because when Monty Hall lifted the curtain

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
he really didn't tell you anything.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You knew in advance that one of the two curtains wouldn't contain the car.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The mere fact that he lifted the curtain should give you zero information

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
relative to where between the remaining doors the car is.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
All you know now is that door 3 doesn't contain the car,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but why should door 1 now be more likely than door 2.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Here's the question.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What are the probabilities of the car being behind door 1, door 2, and door 3,

00:01:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
provided that your initial pick was door 2 and Monty then lifted door 3 to show you there's no car?
