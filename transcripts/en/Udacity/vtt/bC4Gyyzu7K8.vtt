00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.320
It's very important to align all
the different stakeholders towards

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.740
that same goals.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.770
First, everyone needs to have a shared
view on what the current situation is.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.850
What are the goals?

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.180
What are the current practices and
flows?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.000
All of the stakeholders
should participate and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.780
work together to
formulate the end goals.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.700
Shared input generally creates
shared responsibility and ownership.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.820
People are willing to work
together if their thoughts and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.410
opinions are being heard.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.410
It's important to have a shared
view on problems and identify and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.890
eliminate bottlenecks.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.009
The bottlenecks can be inside
departments or between them.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.870
It's not really important as
long as they're being addressed.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.440
And it's also important to have
shared benefits amongst the team.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.090
You want to make sure that you have
all the involved stakeholders get

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.470
the benefit of a new product release.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.970
To achieve that you need to define and
measure key performance indicators for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.990
the whole cross functional team.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.720
You cannot improve what
you cannot measure.
