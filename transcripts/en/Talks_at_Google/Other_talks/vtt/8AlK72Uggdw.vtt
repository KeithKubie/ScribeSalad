00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.953
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
all for coming, especially

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:05.703
for making the trek
all the way down here.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.770
Dr. Phelps won the
Nobel Prize for what

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.396
he calls the unified
field theory of economics.

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:17.770
Actually, he didn't
call it that.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.801
No, you did.

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:25.490
But today, he's going to talk
about capitalism and what

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.900
makes a capitalist economy
different from either

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.045
a socialist or a
corporatist economy.

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:32.780
I had a speaker a
couple years ago,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.490
Luigi Zingales from
Chicago, who is

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.370
kind of a soul
brother of Dr. Phelps.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.320
If any of you came
to that, you'll

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.220
recognize the themes here that
neither the right nor the left

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.800
would be totally happy
with what Dr. Phelps has

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000
to say-- the left for
reasons he'll tell you about,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.650
and the right because they tend
to favor big business rather

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.920
than-- or rather, I would say
that being pro-business is not

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.120
the same as being pro-market.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.040
So without further ado, please
welcome Dr. Edmund Phelps.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.460
EDMUND PHELPS: Thank
you, Bob, very much.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.920
It's a real pleasure
to be here at Google.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.370
This is my first time here.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.640
And I'm very pleased
to talk about

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.460
my book, "Mass Flourishing."

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.740
The book is about
the modern economies

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.960
that arose in a few nations
in the 19th century-- Britain

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.750
and America, around 1820,
later Germany and France,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.940
economies that remained
well functioning

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.170
until the middle of
the 20th century.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.760
They were the
marvel of the world.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.540
The wonder was not so much
the high wages and wealth.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.080
There was rampant prosperity,
material and non-material.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.750
Mark Twain spoke of, quote,
"the drive and push and rush

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.980
and struggle of the raging,
tearing, booming 19th century."

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.970
One kind of prosperity
was classical.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.580
Modern economies
were achieving growth

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.280
of economic knowledge, thus
growth of productivity.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.770
Hence wage rates and
working conditions

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.330
were improving
throughout the economy.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.210
A worker could just
ride the rising tide.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.130
And modern economies and
non-modern economies,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.490
through trade and
technological transfers,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.760
could tap into that
kind of prosperity

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.260
in order to catch up.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.640
Another kind of prosperity was
modern and of key importance.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.330
There were gains
in one's earning

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.370
power from one's new insights
and skills, and gains in one's

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.550
satisfaction from new
experiences in one's work.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.320
These gains, material
and non-material,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.830
are rewards of
initiating and creating.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.420
They represent succeeding, or
to use the term I will use,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420
prospering.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.230
Non-modern nations could not tap
into that kind of prospering.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.270
Never before had prospering
been within reach

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.980
of large and increasing numbers.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.440
Before the first
modern economies,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.850
around 1820, economic
knowledge, thus productivity,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.820
was virtually stagnant,
even in economies

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.830
that were the jewels of
mercantile capitalism,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.460
such as Spain and Holland.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.270
The concept of job
satisfaction was unknown.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.930
For me, the lone shepherd, bored
by the routine and isolated

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.070
from his fellows,
symbolizes that system.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.520
The new mass prospering was
brought by mass innovating,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.350
though the historians spoke
only of resources, efficiencies,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.930
and increasing returns to scale.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.780
In the stream of new
products and methods,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.040
some found adoption by
consumers or producers,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.670
changing the complexion
of the economy.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.910
In Britain and America,
especially, there

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.770
was a welter of innovations,
large and small, not

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.290
just headline innovations.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.500
In an 1858 lecture,
Abraham Lincoln

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.660
said of America that
there was a perfect rage

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.550
for the new, a rage that was
rife among makers of products

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.820
as well as users of products.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.050
Where did ideas for
innovation come from?

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.270
The German historical school
and the young Austrian Joseph

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.440
Schumpeter believed that
innovations originated

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.970
from a succession of discoveries
by scientists and navigators,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.490
who were generally
exogenous to the economy,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.050
and the commercial applications
of these discoveries

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.810
by entrepreneurs.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.240
But the modern economies possess
their own economic dynamism--

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.160
the desire, the capacity,
and the scope to innovate.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.780
This led to an outpouring of
imagining, tinkering, testing,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.560
and trying out.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.000
These economies were capable of
indigenous innovation, not just

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.280
the exogenous innovation of
the mercantile capitalism.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.840
The system of dynamism was
more effective the more open

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.200
it was to contributors
down to the grassroots.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.270
And the modern economies were
rather open to the grassroots.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.280
Human resources of
initiative and imagination

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.220
were devoted to innovating,
not just producing and trading.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.770
Dynamism ran high to the
middle of the 20th century.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.420
No wonder there was
mass prosperity.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.090
No economy before had
drawn on the imagination

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.010
of such a wide range
of the nation's minds.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.800
This dynamism required
entrepreneurs and financiers,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.970
of course, just as the
sporadic innovations

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.620
of the mercantile period did.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.775
Their judgment and
expertise was needed.

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:39.220
Yet dynamism further required
innovators, innovators

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.880
with the insight,
imaginativeness,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.890
and vision to dream
up new products that

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.730
might pan out and win adoption.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.240
Yet the idea that business
activity in a free market

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.060
can always be depended
upon to possess

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.290
the dynamism for indigenous
innovation is a mistake.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.840
The right stuff is required.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.490
Innovators often have to
buck conventional thinking

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.150
and to break away from the
traditional ties to families

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.720
and friends.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.040
Also, innovating requires a
social and political climate

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.220
that is receptive
to innovations,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.870
despite the disruptions
that they're apt to cause.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.130
Was the modern
economy desirable?

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.130
Modern economies
yielded a sustained rise

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.680
of material benefits, including
rising productivity and wages,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.840
decreasing disease,
poverty, and pauperism,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.230
and increasing inclusion.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.450
In the worst factories, workers
at least had escaped the farm.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.690
The more radical impact of the
new economies was non-material.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.820
They changed the very
nature of life and work

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.950
where they took root.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.580
There were experiential rewards
from working on new problems,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.180
gathering insights, imagining
and creating novel things,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.100
testing them in the
workplace, and trying them out

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.730
in the marketplace.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.120
And there were
existential rewards

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.280
of self-discovery
and personal growth

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.030
from journeying
into the unknown.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.020
The adventurous and
exploratory spirit

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.090
of the modern
economic life emerging

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.200
in the 19th-century
cities was reflected also

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.490
in the arts of the period.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.510
Of course, this
transformation depended

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.429
on the development
of institutions

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:43.330
that enabled dynamism, including
various legal rights, laws

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.320
governing corporations,
and financial institutions.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.860
The real crux, though, and
one not given enough weight

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.560
until now, is the rise of
modern values, the spread

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.350
of modern attitudes,
precepts, and beliefs.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.810
These modern values
could be grouped roughly

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.600
under the headings
of individualism--

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.480
thinking for oneself,
working for oneself,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.330
willingness to break
away from one's group,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.640
break away from convention.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.380
Vitalism-- relishing challenges,
overcoming obstacles,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.830
satisfying curiosity, competing,
taking initiative, acting

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.190
on the world.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.340
And self-expression-- imagining
and creating, demonstrating

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.940
an insight by testing it,
voyaging into the unknown in

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.410
hopes of making a mark.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.270
A basic thesis of the book
is that the slow accretion

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.210
of these modern values finally
achieved the critical mass

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.960
necessary to whet the desire
in individuals to innovate,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.160
to spur capabilities required
to innovate and boost

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.740
the willingness in society to
give wide scope for innovation.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.360
The book documents
the modern values,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.870
from the onset of
the modern era,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.770
in Jacques Barzun's terminology,
to its winding down,

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.350
roughly from 1490 to 1940.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.380
Individualism began
with the humanism

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.670
of the late
Renaissance, vitalism

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.870
with the quests
of the Baroque era

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.140
and the curiosity of
the Enlightenment,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.640
and self-expression with
the Romantic period.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.350
This cultural heritage
belonged to the world,

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.950
certainly to all of
the Western nations.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.970
But it is implicit in the book
that some of these nations

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.870
did not fully assimilate
it into their life,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.930
into the values
that they act on.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.310
Ultimately, some
severe reactions

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.340
to the modern economies set in.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.870
The fluctuations and
disparities in outcomes,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:03.110
and even in prospects,
typical of modern economies

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:08.360
and the endemic unemployment
led to socialist opposition.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.270
Some nations moved part of the
way to a socialist economy,

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.230
seeing more planning
and more state ownership

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.180
as a step towards
stability, equality,

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.150
and greater employment.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.040
Generally speaking,
the socialists

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.260
spoke of greater development of
people's capacities to produce,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.990
but showed no
consideration or awareness

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.140
of the deeper goals
of individuals,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.970
the non-material
rewards deriving

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.870
from a life of self-expression,
such as exploration

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.600
and creativity.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.290
The socialists neglected, then,
to provide for innovation.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.510
The rudderlessness and
the social upheaval

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.650
wrought by the
modern economies led,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.180
in the interwar years,
the 1920s and 1930s,

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.300
to a corporatist reaction,
a reaction invoking

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.170
some traditional values
found in the Middle Ages

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:13.460
and even in as long as
mercantile capitalism.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:19.360
The corporatist critique in
Italy, Germany, and France

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.120
drew upon a set of
traditional values,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.600
seen there in the
left hand column.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.250
The corporatists
hated new enterprises

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.220
invading towns and
hated new money

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.360
upsetting traditional
ways, wealth, and status.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.140
So they hated the lack
of society's control

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.250
over the economy.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.310
The essence of their
thought was a revolt

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.010
against individualism
and self-expression.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.960
For them, what mattered
was the good of the nation,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.630
not the individual.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.960
And the government got to decide
what is good for the nation.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.100
The classic corporatist
economies of that time,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.340
of interwar years,
retained private ownership

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.040
but left little
control to the owners.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.280
They replaced competition
and the market

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.720
with a tripartite system of
business confederations, labor

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.670
unions-- both with little
power-- and the state.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.590
Corporatist institutions
and policies

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.480
aimed at social
protection and solidarity.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.240
These economies were
conspicuous for their patronage

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.670
and lobbying, not to mention
cronyism and nepotism.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.560
Mussolini, a
leading corporatist,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.480
promised higher productivity
through innovation,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.990
but without arranging
much for innovation.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.570
Corporatists and
socialists have continued

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.270
to claim, right up
to the present day,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.370
that their systems boost
economic performance

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.540
on their measures.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.580
But data from the
1980s and 1990s

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.060
do not support those claims.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.170
In brief, the more
socialist economies

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.940
did not excel at employment, and
the more corporatist economies

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.060
did not excel at growth.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.830
Those economies have
proved so woefully lacking

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.780
in innovation, indigenous
or even exogenous,

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.800
that they have been unable
to realize their own goals.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.010
The book tests its thesis
that highly prospering nations

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.050
require high dynamism,
and for that, they

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.270
have to be high
in modern values.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.270
To simplify the
investigation, the book

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:55.730
tests whether to be
highly prospering,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:00.810
nations have to be
high in modern values.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:06.410
That is done by using the
prevalence of several attitudes

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:11.270
reported in household surveys--
a preference for jobs that

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.210
are interesting, that involve
initiative, that offer

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:20.140
change, that present challenges,
such as competition--

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.970
to represent the prevalence
of modern values,

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.530
and using the prevalence
of job satisfaction

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:33.640
in a nation as a measure of
the prevalence of prospering

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.980
in that nation.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.190
Among 18 countries
in the OECD, the six

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.870
where job satisfaction
was widespread

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:49.140
were all above average
in modern values.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.840
The more prevalent
modern values are,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.930
the more prevalent
job satisfaction is.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.840
And by the way, if that
feels like it's not

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.390
quite the question that
should have been answered,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.280
the same is true for
life satisfaction.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.630
Also, the countries
where traditional values

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:14.970
are more prevalent tend
to report very low job

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.710
satisfaction.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.990
Now let's return to
the book's narrative.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.680
In the post-war years,
Germany and France

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.730
resumed rapid growth, and
Italy found new growth,

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.550
but it was mostly through
technological transfers.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.270
There was mounting evidence
of lessened dynamism

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.600
in those countries.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.810
In Britain and
Germany, later France,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.680
the loss of
indigenous innovation

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.970
appears to have
been considerable,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.670
though concealed by
continuing technology

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.800
transfers from America, as
long as the supply lasted--

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.350
and it seems to have lasted
until the late 1990s.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.109
In America, the growth
rate of productivity,

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:09.460
after subtracting the part
attributable to growth

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:15.750
of capital per worker,
fell in the early 1970s

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:22.329
to about one half of what it had
been consistently in the period

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:31.760
1922 to 1972, and it remained
there ever since at about half

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.110
of its former self,
with the exception

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.720
of the years of the internet
build-out, 1996 to 2004, when

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.610
there was a brief respite.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.100
What has happened
is that innovation

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.670
has narrowed, I
believe, diminishing

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.790
in most established
industries in particular,

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.190
and of course rising in some
other industries, generally

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.490
new industries.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.590
Predictably, the declines
of innovation in these four

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:07.290
countries were followed
by a major ballooning

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:12.200
of unemployment in
each one of them,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.910
which is further evidence
that something went wrong.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.960
What are the root causes?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.600
The book lays much of
these declines of dynamism

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.620
to a rise of traditional
and anti-modern

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:38.420
or anti-business values
in post-war times

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.100
compared to prewar times, when
dynamism was still strong.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.830
I will focus on cultural
shifts in America,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.900
leaving Europe to one side.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:01.370
There has been a spread of the
much-discussed money culture

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.665
in America.

00:19:02.665 --> 00:19:06.550
Hence fewer people
prefer years of austerity

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:12.280
trying to innovate with a
doubtful pecuniary payoff, only

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.900
the non-material
reward, to working

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.370
in jobs that pay really well.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.890
In many people, the
desire to make money

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.600
has grown into greed.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.410
A survey of financial people
found that about half of them

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.840
would engage in inside
trading if there

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.560
was no risk of being caught.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.640
This widespread
desperation for money

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.900
must lead to a lot
of self-dealing

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:46.590
by managers and others in large
firms, mutual funds, and banks,

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.680
pathologies that
must divert managers

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.375
from innovation
to short-termism.

00:19:55.375 --> 00:19:59.630
In America, at least, there
is a much-commented rise

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.330
of an adolescent culture
that's low on concentration

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.920
and self-discipline.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.530
Relatedly, there has been
a striking devaluation

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.960
of achievement.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.270
Witness the denigration
of creative figures.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.840
There was just
another one last week.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.650
Tighter traditional values
tie many a young person

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.490
to their families, circle
of friends, or community.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.050
Few people are telling
the youth these days,

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.490
"Go West, young man, go West."

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:37.180
A new culture of entitlement
brings pressure on companies

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.640
to allow employees to meet
family needs by working

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.060
at home, which is
bad for innovation.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.560
A key precept of
the new corporatism,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.850
the right to social
protection from the market,

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:57.760
has led to pervasive patronage
from politicians and campaign

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.620
contributions from
corporations and labor unions.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.110
When established
corporations are protected

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.810
through special
interest legislation,

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:16.230
such as evergreening
of old patents,

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.170
these corporations become
less interested in innovation

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.870
then in rent-seeking.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.280
And after they've
got their carve-outs

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.640
and their special
interest tax deductions,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.410
outsiders with potentially
innovative ideas

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.080
are less able to enter.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:41.570
So they cannot innovate, while
the insiders, now protected,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.730
can drop whatever defensive
innovation they were going

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.570
to do.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.430
They don't need to innovate.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.780
So it's a double whammy.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.310
The nexus between
private and public

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:56.820
in education, medical
care, and pharmaceuticals

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:04.300
is especially harmful-- is
especially impeding innovation

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.370
there.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.330
Another precept of
the new corporatism,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.160
that the state is needed
to set important directions

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.030
for the economy, leads to elites
in government playing a larger

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:19.120
role in the nation's
attempts at innovating,

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.630
and ordinary people doing
grassroots innovation

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.960
to a smaller role.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.200
And it is the ordinary people
doing grassroots innovation

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.320
who, being up close to the
problems and the opportunities,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.970
have an advantage at innovating.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.615
Yet another-- that's it.

00:22:43.615 --> 00:22:45.880
I'll make a cut here.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.190
Thus, America has
strayed pretty far

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.510
from the pioneer spirit captured
by Willa Cather and the movie

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.040
"Shane," and the new
values have choked off

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.170
much of the modern
economies' dynamism,

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.300
not just caused a loss
of efficiency, which

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.940
was the focus of
books by Mancur Olson

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.180
and, before him,
Jean-Baptiste Say.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.110
Modern values, if
they are predominant,

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.330
spark the engine of
human imagination

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.520
that drives the
innovation that is

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.190
central to the modern economy.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:28.750
In contrast, some traditional
or anti-modern values directly

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.470
inhibit people from making
attempts to innovate.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.130
And these values,
if they prevail

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:41.790
over modern values, foster
corporatist policies that

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:51.010
impede or even block innovation,
if there are any attempts.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:56.370
What sort of an economy
ought we to aim for now?

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.190
What is the good and the just?

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.430
Some serious people
have suggested

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.550
we say goodbye to growth.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.910
Now my book agrees
that it is especially

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:13.800
the non-material rewards that
were the great gift to nations

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.210
with modern economies.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.690
But now, prominent
economists and commentators

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:27.600
are proposing to say goodbye
to dynamism and prospering.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.850
They are advocating a focus
on the quality of life,

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.490
amenities like sports stadiums,
comforts like clean streets,

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.620
and security.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.850
A well known report
from the OECD

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:47.460
views wealth and leisure
as the highest goods.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.940
My book argues that an
economy, to be a good economy,

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.310
must be structured
to offer participants

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.840
prospects of the good life.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.230
It would be an injustice to
deprive people of prospects

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.150
of the good life, prospects
for the good life.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.810
Further, the book
sees the good life

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.400
as the conception
developed across centuries

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.990
in the modern era by a
succession of philosophers

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.500
and humanists, a
life of exploration,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.430
creativity, and discovery.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.130
This modern conception
of the good life

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.640
derives from Pico
della Mirandola,

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.690
at the end of the 1400s, Martin
Luther, Montaigne, Cervantes,

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:41.400
Shakespeare, Hume, Hegel,
Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, William

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.090
James, and Henri Bergson.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.510
Philosophers use the
word "flourishing"

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.370
to characterize
this sort of life.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.220
It's apparent, I think,
that the prospering

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.510
I was describing before, that
came to the modern economies,

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:02.680
is a splendid example of the
philosophers' flourishing.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.430
Moreover, ordinary people
have no other source

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.970
of flourishing but
the business economy.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:16.250
Where else are they going
to find the opportunities?

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:22.200
So the modern economies
were unique and necessary

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.570
for the provision
of the good life

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.430
to large numbers
of participants,

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:33.120
all the way to the grassroots.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.400
Now I've just talked about the
good life and the good economy.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.110
An economy both
good and just must

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.310
be geared to offer
those with the poorest

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:46.530
prospects of the good life
the best prospects possible.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.040
Further, if some
people are not oriented

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.820
toward the conception
of the good life,

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.540
this modern conception,
a just society

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:03.820
will allow them to operate
their own parallel economies.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.160
All this breaks with
accepted thought.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.900
Both the left and the
right and the corporatists

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.150
overlook the world of
creation, with its imagining

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:19.940
and venturing and the resulting
personal growth, in favor

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:26.040
of materialist criteria,
such as leisure and wealth.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.490
But the sort of quality life
that they appear to envision

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.190
is no substitute
for the good life.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.830
The good life is a wild
ride through an economy

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.310
with an open future,
an economy offering

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:47.610
unimagined rewards, a life
of Kierkegaardian mystery,

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.160
Nietzschean challenge,
and Bergsonian becoming.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.930
This is what we
must hope to regain.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:02.460
To conclude, I would just make
one comment about strategy.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:08.460
I would say that it will
be necessary to broaden

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.450
to the whole economy the
grassroots innovation that

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:18.320
found its footing, especially
in California, in garages,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.780
in the music business,
and in the film

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.030
industry and a few
sparkling companies.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:30.520
The nation must aim for
this more participatory kind

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.910
of economy, for a
grassroots revolution.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.694
Thank you.

00:28:35.694 --> 00:28:41.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.718
AUDIENCE: So Silicon
Valley is often

00:28:43.718 --> 00:28:46.675
felt as a pocket of
innovation, which it is.

00:28:46.675 --> 00:28:50.048
But in, let's say, 1999,
there was a huge number

00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:53.853
of copycat companies
trying to just sort of get

00:28:53.853 --> 00:28:54.799
big, fat [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:58.645
How do you distinguish
between and encourage

00:28:58.645 --> 00:29:02.725
the real innovation versus
just sort of pure exploitation?

00:29:02.725 --> 00:29:09.680
EDMUND PHELPS: Well, that's why
we have wizened old financiers

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.880
with green eyeshades
and tons of experience,

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:18.050
who use their intuition
about what might fly and what

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.670
probably won't.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:29.360
And we like to leave them in
charge of the nation's purse.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:36.310
They will finance what seems
good to them and say no to what

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.220
doesn't.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.080
Of course, there's
often or sometimes

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.290
a diversity of opinion.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.720
By the way, Schumpeter
thought that the financiers

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.760
were omniscient.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.940
They had some sort of
mystical knowledge of-- I

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.940
don't think that.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:30:03.000
But this is simply-- the fact
that nobody has foreknowledge

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.830
of what's going
to work and what's

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:10.460
not going to work
is part of the game.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.910
You might say the
downside of the game,

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:20.090
that there are an awful lot
of people who try and fail.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:27.048
But I don't see any
alternative to that.

00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:31.385
AUDIENCE: I was always amazed
at people like Henry Ford.

00:30:31.385 --> 00:30:34.701
How was he able to expand
so quickly, so fast

00:30:34.701 --> 00:30:37.470
in the US and worldwide?

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.912
There was no internet,
no fax machines.

00:30:40.912 --> 00:30:42.572
He was putting up
factories, which

00:30:42.572 --> 00:30:47.884
were a lot of capital investment
and a lot of know-how,

00:30:47.884 --> 00:30:50.872
how to build a large factory,
something they'd never done,

00:30:50.872 --> 00:30:53.860
so a lot of unknown that we deal
with today, a lot of unknown.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.378
And what can we learn-- how
was he able to move so fast?

00:30:58.378 --> 00:30:58.878
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:07.250
EDMUND PHELPS: I do discuss
Henry Ford for a paragraph

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:14.680
or so, which doesn't make
me a profound Ford scholar.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:23.980
But I think what
distinguished Ford

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:29.410
was, as some have said
before, principally

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.100
a remarkable vision.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.760
And he used to insist that he
didn't know a damn thing more

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.220
about building a car
than anybody else,

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:43.840
and he just, in every case,
used state of the art methods

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.290
to assemble his car.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.800
So it wasn't in the car.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.310
It was in his vision of
what the demand for the car

00:31:53.310 --> 00:32:03.870
would be if the
price were right.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.210
And the price could be right
if the demand was big enough.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:12.390
And so it's something like that.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.420
I don't know about where
he got his capital.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.090
Probably he started with
a relatively small amount

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.070
of capital but quickly
expanded once he

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.641
got the confidence
of financial people.

00:32:25.641 --> 00:32:26.623
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:32:26.623 --> 00:32:29.569
Of all the companies
in the world right now,

00:32:29.569 --> 00:32:33.006
which one do you think
is the most modern

00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:35.177
and has the most dynamism?

00:32:35.177 --> 00:32:37.010
EDMUND PHELPS: Thanks
for the question, Bob.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.718
It gives me a chance
to talk about China.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.960
It's a very curious
thing, but I got

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.040
invited to be dean of the
New Huadu Business School

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.260
in the early months of 2010.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.340
I had hardly set foot
in the business school,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.140
let alone been a dean.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.440
But by this time, I was
interested in innovation,

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.700
so I saw it as an opportunity.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.220
So I started to go to China
regularly for about two weeks

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.370
at a time, about
four times a year.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.080
And at first, I
thought, ah, China.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.820
It's all about
technological transfers,

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.880
principally from
the United States.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.210
There surely is no
indigenous innovation here.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:34.820
And then some of my colleagues
among the professors

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.680
reinforced this
prejudice by saying,

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.770
yes, here in China, people
are afraid to stand out

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.050
from the group.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.850
They're conformists, they're
timid, et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.110
So I thought, well, that's that.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.590
But then my handlers
started to push me out

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:58.480
into visits to
factories after a while,

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.860
and I began to see with
my own eyes that, my gosh,

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.390
these people, maybe
they're not innovating

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.800
the socks off of the
world, but they certainly

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.920
are thinking about
innovation, and they

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.230
are very sophisticated.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.500
And it must be only
a matter of time

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:26.780
before some of the ideas they
have work and then make people

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.400
sit up and take notice.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.880
There was a zipper
factory that, to this day,

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:39.079
impressed me enormously with
its creativity and its spirit.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:45.000
They knew everybody
in the zipper business

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.270
around the world.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.489
And they weren't just
state of the art.

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:50.729
They were creative.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:56.070
And now, I prodded some
of my young colleagues

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.670
to do some statistical
work with me.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.460
And this work is still ongoing.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.000
It's bedeviled by complications.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.650
But my tentative guess,
from this research so far,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.290
is that the rate of growth
of what economists call

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:20.530
total factor productivity, that
part of the growth of output

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.820
per man-hour not explained
by the growth of capital

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:29.830
per man-hour, that total factor
productivity growth in China

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.660
is about 2%.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:41.230
The thing is, it's being-- we
are being distracted from that

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.260
by the continuing
growth that comes

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.150
from other sources in China
that accounts for something

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:55.960
like a 7% growth rate,
or maybe a 6% or 5%

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.190
growth rate of
productivity per hour,

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:05.450
and even more a few years ago.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.650
And what's this other
growth coming from?

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:15.560
Well, after
technological transfers

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:21.770
have led to the introduction
of up to date technologies

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:35.780
in the sophisticated companies
along the coast of China,

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:41.040
there's still the process of
what Dick Nelson and I call

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:49.140
diffusion of technologies
across the rest of the economy.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:55.940
And what's going on in
China now is two things.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.350
First of all, they're
continuing as best they can

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.670
with new technological
transfers,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.890
although America's making that
harder and harder for them.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.070
But at the same time,
you're getting also, so

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.460
to speak, technological
transfers from the west coast

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.280
of China to the
interior of China,

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.490
so that you're getting
strong productivity

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:24.160
growth through that
diffusion of the cutting edge

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:32.210
technologies that had
made their way to the more

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.130
pioneering companies.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.780
What's the number for
the United States?

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.050
I said that total
factor productivity

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.590
growth had fallen in a half.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:52.870
Almost like from day to
night around 1972, 1973.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.940
What are the numbers?

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:01.880
Remarkably, the rate of growth
of total factor productivity

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.900
in the United States
from 1922 to 1972

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.440
was very stable--
with fluctuations,

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.380
but I mean it was not
trending anywhere,

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.920
stable around 2% per annum.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:22.400
But then since 1972, it's been
stable at around 1% per annum.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.320
So actually, China
looks like its rate

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.420
of indigenous
innovation actually

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.240
exceeds that of
the United States.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.540
It's just being overshadowed in
China by all the productivity

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:45.280
gains coming from diffusion
plus any remaining

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.010
technological transfers.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:48.836
Yes.

00:38:48.836 --> 00:38:50.234
AUDIENCE: People
who are thinking

00:38:50.234 --> 00:38:53.030
innovatively about,
what is a city?

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.440
What is-- [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.260
EDMUND PHELPS: I won't
attempt to take that very far.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:04.230
But I do dwell for a
page or so on cities

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:12.480
in the chapter of my book on the
rise of economies of dynamism.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.390
What was going on there?

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.660
And I make the point that one
of the things going on there

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.570
was that cities were growing up.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.920
A surprisingly large number
of cities were growing up.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.300
In England, for
example, London was,

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.490
on some measures,
the only city around.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:40.670
And then after things got
going in 1815 in Britain,

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.860
pretty soon, there
were five cities

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.400
on the same measure,
five cities in Britain.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.450
So you had all this
interactivity going on,

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.920
with people talking to
one another, companies

00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:01.020
exchanging views,
ideas, information.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:08.110
I think that was very
integral to the explosion,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.030
from an historical
perspective, integral

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:15.472
to the explosion of
productivity in Britain

00:40:15.472 --> 00:40:19.750
that began around 1815,
almost like a shot.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:29.120
And now whether you can
kind of artificially

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:35.620
create that by saying, hey,
let's build a city here,

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.930
and they will come, I'm
not sure they will come.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:47.300
I think that would
be the big question.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.620
Will they come?

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.385
What exactly is necessary
for them to come?

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.720
I would hate to see the federal
government launch a program

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.470
to create cities in
the United States

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:06.680
according to some academic
formula, most likely

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.460
by people who know not
very much about it.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.840
On the other hand, if some
region of the country thinks

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:22.770
it can survive by creating a new
city, well, more power to it.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.522
Maybe it'll work.

00:41:24.522 --> 00:41:27.994
AUDIENCE: Do you see the
diffusion or the technology

00:41:27.994 --> 00:41:30.970
[INAUDIBLE] transfer to
Vietnam also happening

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:35.270
at a similar rate to
China, or is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.770
EDMUND PHELPS: I don't know the
productivity growth numbers,

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.130
but I don't have to know the
numbers to make the educated

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:49.630
guess that productivity growth
has taken off in Vietnam.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:53.630
And they have opportunities
for technological transfer,

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.590
not only from the
United States, but also

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:59.280
from other Asian countries,
such as South Korea and

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.260
such as China.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:06.090
So even without having
looked at the numbers,

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:10.360
there's no doubt in
my mind that they've

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.540
enjoyed a very rapid
growth of productivity

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:18.840
in the past 10 or 15 years.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.810
I was conscious when I was
there quite a few years ago

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:28.246
that there is quite a heritage
of top-down government,

00:42:28.246 --> 00:42:31.920
a lot of government
control, and probably

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.260
a lot of social protection--
a lot of corporatism.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:41.400
And so I don't
know to what extent

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.970
they've graduated out of that.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.190
EDMUND PHELPS:
Thank you very much.
