00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.290 align:start position:0%
the animation style let's talk about
that<00:06:16.319><c> really</c><00:06:16.440><c> quick</c><00:06:16.529><c> so</c><00:06:16.919><c> I</c><00:06:17.159><c> think</c><00:06:17.669><c> it</c><00:06:18.210><c> was</c>

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
that really quick so I think it was
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.029 align:start position:0%
that really quick so I think it was
pretty<00:06:18.479><c> solid</c><00:06:18.990><c> but</c><00:06:19.080><c> there</c><00:06:19.259><c> was</c><00:06:19.349><c> a</c><00:06:19.380><c> few</c><00:06:19.770><c> times</c>

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
pretty solid but there was a few times
 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.830 align:start position:0%
pretty solid but there was a few times

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 align:start position:0%
off the model like the heads got really
 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.519 align:start position:0%

only problem I could have with how short
 

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.190 align:start position:0%
only problem I could have with how short
it<00:08:52.520><c> is</c><00:08:52.580><c> is</c><00:08:52.850><c> that</c><00:08:53.030><c> he</c><00:08:53.090><c> sort</c><00:08:53.330><c> of</c><00:08:53.390><c> just</c><00:08:53.570><c> accepts</c>

and I'm just like how did you figure out
 

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm just like how did you figure out
just<00:09:16.989><c> any</c><00:09:17.989><c> sort</c><00:09:18.410><c> of</c><00:09:18.559><c> like</c><00:09:18.769><c> lead</c><00:09:19.100><c> up</c><00:09:19.309><c> to</c><00:09:19.339><c> that</c><00:09:19.519><c> so</c>

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:21.919 align:start position:0%
I think that would be my one problem but
 

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:24.099 align:start position:0%
I think that would be my one problem but

00:09:25.719 --> 00:09:25.729 align:start position:0%
short and sweet because we can move on
 

00:09:25.729 --> 00:09:27.460 align:start position:0%

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:18.529 align:start position:0%
any of that right here so I think that
 

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
any of that right here so I think that
maybe<00:10:18.799><c> that's</c><00:10:18.980><c> why</c><00:10:19.220><c> he</c><00:10:19.549><c> connected</c><00:10:19.970><c> more</c><00:10:20.089><c> to</c>

00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:20.209 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why he connected more to
 

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:22.689 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why he connected more to
