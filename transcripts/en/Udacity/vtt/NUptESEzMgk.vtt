00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.100
So to give you, again,
still a little bit of intuition, but

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.050
getting a little more formal, so here we
have the same person walking at Time t,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.719
and then there's a question of
what do we do at Time t plus 1.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.720
The idea is that from Time t,
we have some prediction or

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.035
some belief that's indicated here in
red of where we think the person is.

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:22.630
Okay, and that's our prior.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.140
So, before we take any measurements
at Time t plus 1, this is our belief.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.620
By the way, I will go back and forth,
the slides sometimes go back and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.760
forth, between whether we're talking
about moving between t minus 1 and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.350
t, or t and t plus 1.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.670
It doesn't matter.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.040
It's just going from one step to the
next and sometimes I screw up one way,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.240
sometimes I screw up another way.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.940
This is like the story of my life.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.150
All right, so at red, we have the idea
is we have some prediction to Time t and

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.090
we want to know what's
happening at t plus 1.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.180
At Time t plus 1, we take a measurement.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.240
That's what's shown here in green.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.720
Okay, so we had some distribution that
was our belief about what's there and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.180
now we have some measurement.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.758
Now notice, that this measurement
is also a distribution.

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:11.390
We're going to talk in a little
bit about what that means

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.700
it means two different things.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.330
One, you can think of is that,
given that the person is someplace,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.070
how likely would be the current
measurement that I got?

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.060
So you see here, let's assume
the measurement was there, okay?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.050
This distribution says, not how likely
is the person at a particular place,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.180
that's what I'm trying to estimate.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.670
What this distribution says is,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.110
how likely would this measurement be,
how likely would I be to get

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.420
this measurement if the person
was at these different locations?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.510
That's a little confusing.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.270
When we do the math of likelihood,
that'll become clearer.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.210
For now, you can think of a measurement
that's just a little bit noisy,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.230
I don't know, you know, it gives me some
bounds on where the person probably is.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.420
And then finally taking that prior be,
belief or

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.060
prediction and the measurement,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.040
I come with what's referred to as either
a corrected prediction final estimate.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.310
Or the technical term is the posterior
distribution is to where I think it is,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.410
and that's what's shown in blue.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.880
So I go from a prior, or an old belief,
to a measurement, to a new belief
