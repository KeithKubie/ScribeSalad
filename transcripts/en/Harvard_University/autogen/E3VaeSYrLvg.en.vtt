00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.679
kind of conversation that was taking
place at the table but it wasn't about

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689
place at the table but it wasn't about
 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.479

this other dimension of the conflict was

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
this other dimension of the conflict was
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.099
this other dimension of the conflict was
popping up and just because I have so

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109
popping up and just because I have so
 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.899

little time I'm not going to go into

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909
little time I'm not going to go into
 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.789
little time I'm not going to go into
much detail about it but let me just say

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799
much detail about it but let me just say
 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.699
much detail about it but let me just say
that it was a profoundly emotional

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709
that it was a profoundly emotional
 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.550
that it was a profoundly emotional
dimension that was never ever being

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560
dimension that was never ever being
 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.140
dimension that was never ever being
discussed at the table but in my view it

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150
discussed at the table but in my view it
 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.080
discussed at the table but in my view it
was running the running the conversation

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090
was running the running the conversation
 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.520
was running the running the conversation
and so just the short story is this this

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
and so just the short story is this this
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.069
and so just the short story is this this
emotional conversation if i were to put

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079
emotional conversation if i were to put
 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.660
emotional conversation if i were to put
words to it and it would say something

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670
words to it and it would say something
 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.729
words to it and it would say something
they would be saying something like how

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739
they would be saying something like how
 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.789
they would be saying something like how
dare you treat us this way right don't

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799
dare you treat us this way right don't
 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.619
dare you treat us this way right don't
you see where human beings can't you see

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629
you see where human beings can't you see
 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.509
you see where human beings can't you see
that when you treat us as if we were

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519
that when you treat us as if we were
 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.250
that when you treat us as if we were
second-class citizens earth if we're

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260
second-class citizens earth if we're
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.559
second-class citizens earth if we're
less than that it affects us can't you

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569
less than that it affects us can't you
 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.740
less than that it affects us can't you
see we're suffering and so very long

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
see we're suffering and so very long
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.509
see we're suffering and so very long
story short it took me a while but I

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519
story short it took me a while but I
 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.610
story short it took me a while but I
figured out that this was all about

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
figured out that this was all about
 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.970
figured out that this was all about
their dignity and how they were being

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980
their dignity and how they were being
 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.610
their dignity and how they were being
treated by the other side and I think

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620
treated by the other side and I think
 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.729
treated by the other side and I think
this is the the really important aspect

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739
this is the the really important aspect
 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.259
this is the the really important aspect
of dignity that I'm going to focus on

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269
of dignity that I'm going to focus on
 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.869
of dignity that I'm going to focus on
here is that it's about the relationship

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879
here is that it's about the relationship
 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.240
here is that it's about the relationship
about how it's not so much about how

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250
about how it's not so much about how
 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.610
about how it's not so much about how

what is the nature of the relationship

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750
what is the nature of the relationship
 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.129
what is the nature of the relationship
between people that either makes us feel

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139
