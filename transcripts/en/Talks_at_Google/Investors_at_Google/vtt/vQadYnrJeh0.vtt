00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.510
MALE SPEAKER: So
today we're here

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.720
to talk about a special book.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.860
This is a book that has lots
of pictures, lots of profiles,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.670
lots of wisdom in it.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.426
And you just wish
that when you're

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:18.800
reading this book
that you didn't

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.810
have to pay as much
as the sticker tag,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.950
because it's
prohibitively expensive.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.420
But part of the reason is
it's also a fantastic book.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.750
It's a great book.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.200
And we have the author of
that book here with us today.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.620
William Green has been
writing about investing

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.500
and other topics for
over two decades now.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
And as you read the
words in the book.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.110
"The Great Minds
of Investing," you

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.610
realize that he
has tried to talk

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.600
about the wisdom
of great investors,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.300
but not restricted it
to investing alone.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.820
He's taken it beyond that.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.160
And he's put it together in
a very, very authentic voice.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.730
I'm very honored and
very happy that he

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.420
has decided to
come here in person

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.630
and talk to us
about his thoughts.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.960
So without any further
ado, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.820
please join me in
welcoming William Green.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.386
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:22.760
WILLIAM GREEN:
Thank you so much.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.330
I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.700
And I'm so grateful to you
all for taking time off

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310
during your lunch
break to come here.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.320
And I'm actually
particularly happy to be here

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.860
because I'm actually a
shareholder in Google, or now

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.910
Alphabet.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.005
And it's pretty much
the only investment

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.630
that I've had over the last year
or so that's done really well.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.770
So keep it up.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.595
My retirement is in your hands.

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:45.720
But I feel happy because
I've rarely been in a room

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.250
where there are
so many IQ points.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.000
So thank you for all of your
ingenuity and hard work.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.270
When I was 15
years old, I became

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.740
obsessed with gambling,
and specifically

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.480
actually with horse racing.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.430
And at the time I was at this
very posh English school,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.930
a school called Eton College
that had been founded, I think,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.854
in 1440 by Henry the VI I think.

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:09.229
And this is a
school where people

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.051
like Prince William
and Prince Harry went

00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:15.300
and the current British prime
minister, David Cameron.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.830
And so I was supposed
to be becoming

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740
this posh English
gentleman, and instead I

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.011
would go off to gamble
in this turf account

00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:24.010
in this betting shop in
Windsor, the neighboring

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.490
town next to Eton College.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.130
And I actually had this illicit
account because I was only,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.807
I guess, 15.

00:02:29.807 --> 00:02:31.390
So I had an account
under a fake name,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.320
which was Mike Smith--
not a very creative name.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.804
And at first I did pretty well.

00:02:37.804 --> 00:02:39.470
And I made some money,
totally randomly.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.219
It wasn't because I
knew what I was doing,

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.440
although I think at the
time I thought I did.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.540
And then after a while, I
sort of started to lose.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.815
And I realized--
basically the reason

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:50.190
I had started in
the first place,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.390
it wasn't because
I loved horses.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.431
It wasn't because I thought
this is an incredibly

00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:54.950
beautiful sport or anything.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.870
I just liked the
idea that here was

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.220
something where you could make
money just by using your mind.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.000
And I was kind of lazy.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.710
And I thought well, I don't
want to mow lawns or anything.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.550
And here if I can just sort of
invest a little bit of money

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.380
on a horse race and make
some money, that's fantastic.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.300
And when I started to
lose, I just thought,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.630
I'm going to stop cold turkey.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.910
And literally I stopped
at the age of 16.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.760
And I haven't had a
bet on a horse race,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.840
I haven't been to a casino and
gambled in more than 30 years,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.380
because basically
it's a mugs game.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.190
You're just losing.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.650
You're just doomed to lose.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.200
The odds, unless you're
particularly brilliant at sort

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.990
of figuring out odds, you're
just kind of doomed to lose.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.890
And so I stopped completely.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.450
And then when I got to my 20s,
I discovered the stock market.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.500
And then I thought wow, now
this is what I was really after.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.970
This is the real game.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.580
Because again, this is somewhere
where, if you're smart,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.520
you can use your brain
just to make money

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.730
without really getting your
hands dirty in any way.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.890
And I just thought
this was magnificent.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.752
Now I was very fortunate,
you know, that-- thanks.

00:03:57.752 --> 00:03:58.835
That was a very good move.

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:00.010
That was impressive.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.870
I want to see that again
if you could do it.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.012
And then I was very
fortunate in that I

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:08.720
was writing for these
magazines back then

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.750
like "Forbes" and "Money" and
later for "Fortune" and "Time."

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.360
And so I got to interview all
sorts of famous investors.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.709
So I would, for
example, I would get

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.769
to interview Peter
Lynch or Jeff Vinik who

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.930
was managing the biggest
mutual fund in the world

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.540
when he was in his early 30s, or
Seth Klarman or Marty Whitman,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.260
Bill Ruane who ran the
Sequoia Fund for many years,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.390
some of these
extraordinary investors.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.060
And I would go off to
Houston, for example,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.760
and I'd meet Fayez
Serofim, who is

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.410
this Egyptian multibilllionaire
known as the Sphinx.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.890
And he has an El Greco painting,
a 430 year old El Greco

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.700
painting on one wall, a de
Kooning on another wall,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.430
and he's got this 5th century
mosaic floor from Syria

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.610
that he's imported
from a Syrian church.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.620
And I became really
fascinated by the fact

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.990
that there was this
tiny minority of people

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.740
that managed to defy gravity by
performing extraordinarily well

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.400
for many years as investors.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.680
And I sort of figured,
what if you could reverse

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.770
engineer these people
and figure out why

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.020
it is that they win this game?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.490
How do they stack the odds so
that they win as investors?

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.140
What characteristics
do they have

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.140
in terms of temperament,
in terms of principles,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.430
in terms of insights?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.224
And is there any way that
I could learn to do this?

00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:24.640
Then over the last
couple of years

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.098
I was working on this book,
"The Great Minds of Investing,"

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.980
where I had this opportunity--
in the end I interviewed

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.740
I think 22 of these
guys and I wrote

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.960
profiles of 22 famous investors
and edited profiles of several

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.120
more.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.710
And by this time,
part of what happens

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.080
I think when you hit
your 40s is that you

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.372
start to suffer from all
sorts of existential angst.

00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:45.830
So instead of just
thinking, how do

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.235
I get rich by reverse
engineering these people,

00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:49.860
you start to think,
well how do I live?

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.430
How do I make better decisions?

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.547
How do I eradicate what
Charlie Munger would

00:05:54.547 --> 00:05:55.630
call standard stupidities?

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.470
How do we make good
decisions in the face

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.440
of a very uncertain future?

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.310
How do I handle adversity?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.350
How do I handle pain?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.400
How do I handle stress?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.240
How do I balance my family,
who are here-- so obviously not

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.070
very well-- my family, my
work, all of these things?

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.970
And so the question
really became how to live.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.550
And so what I'd like to do today
is to share four lessons that I

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.575
think are really-- they're very
useful in terms of investing,

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:29.470
or at least three of them are.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.070
And I think they
will help to make

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.360
you richer over the long term.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.500
But I actually think
they're also very

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.920
important in terms of life.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.580
And really it seems
to me that the goal

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.580
is to reverse engineer
these people to figure out,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.870
how do I become richer?

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.830
How do I become
smarter and wiser?

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.570
And how do I become happier?

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.590
And so I think these
are lessons that

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.000
help you in each of these areas

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.800
And we're going to talk-- I've
got these four things up here.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.570
Hopefully you can see if
the technology is working.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.170
The first idea we're
going to discuss

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.990
is the willingness to be lonely.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.290
And what we're really
talking about here

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.050
is this idea that
you have to take

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.790
what Peter Bernstein,
the market historian

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.230
once described as uncomfortably
idiosyncratic positions.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.420
That if you want
to outperform, you

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.920
have to diverge from the crowd.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.890
You have to be
willing to be lonely.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.130
And this has
powerful implications

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.117
both in terms of investing
and other areas of life.

00:07:26.117 --> 00:07:27.700
The second idea we're
going to discuss

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.770
is the power of humility,
which as we'll see

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.310
is a somewhat
contradictory idea.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.810
You have to have
the self-confidence

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.960
to go your own way, but you also
have the humility to say yeah,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.300
but what if I'm wrong.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.440
And then you have to build
in safeguards in case

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.390
you're wrong.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.380
The third idea-- sorry
for these gloomy titles.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.870
My son Henry said to me,
man, that's a real downer.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.880
The third title is the
ability to take pain.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.550
But what we're really
talking about here

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.840
is emotional resilience, which
I have come to believe over

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.340
many years of covering
investing is really

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.560
one of the absolute keys to long
term success as an investor.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.810
And what we're talking about
with all of these people,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.470
we're not talking
about being great

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.020
as an investor over one cycle.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.230
We're trying to achieve
success over many decades.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.530
And so you need this
ability to take pain,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.070
because there are going to
be times when you're hit.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:24.560
And this obviously also relates
to other aspects of life.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.760
The fourth topic, which
is slightly more elevated

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.880
in areas, is the key to
happiness, which it strikes me

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.549
that one of the
things you really

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:38.210
want to learn from these
great investors is how do I

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.090
not just become rich, but how do
I make the money work for me so

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.240
that it's not just sort of
a short circuit in my life,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.150
but is actually something
that enriches my life?

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.440
So the fourth section
is really about what

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.490
you could call true prosperity.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.630
And what we're really talking
about with all of these things

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.270
is the ability to stack
the odds in your favor

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.240
so that you're kind of
tilting the playing field so

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.510
that the odds of having
a successful life in all

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.390
of these different
areas is increased.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.290
So the willingness to be
lonely-- back in, I'd say,

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.780
the winter of 1998, I got
this fantastic assignment

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.974
to go interview
Sir John Templeton.

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:18.390
And as many of you
know, Templeton

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.840
was one of the greatest
investors of the last century.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.380
At the time he was 85 years old.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.210
If you had invested in
the Templeton growth fund,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.805
over 38 years he compounded
a rate of about 15% a year.

00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:34.940
And as a result, your $10,000
would turn into $2 million.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.030
And in fact his returns--
that doesn't really

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.880
reflect his returns because he
was an extraordinary investor

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.830
really for about 60 or so years.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.540
So he defines this ability
to have great success

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.700
over a long period.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.990
Now Templeton lived in
this gated community

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.840
called Lyford Cay in
the Bahamas, which

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.790
was a fascinating place.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.580
He had decided
early in his life he

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.110
was going to save-- he
saved half of the money

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.969
that he made early
in his career,

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.510
and then decided
with his wife, we're

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.801
going to be able to live
anywhere we want in the world.

00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.170
And so they took a
bunch of pieces of paper

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.650
and figured out
that Lyford Cay was

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.430
the place-- Lyford Cay was a
place where people like Prince

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.270
Rainier of Monaco lived.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.050
The Aga Khan had a house there.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.555
Sean Connery had a house there.

00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:22.820
I think part of
"Thunderbolt", the Bond movie

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.720
was filmed there.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.890
So this was a pretty sweet gig
to go in the middle of winter,

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.580
to go interview Templeton,
this great guru at Lyford Cay.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.690
And I remember as I came up to
his house, there's actually,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.290
as you walked along
the porch of his house,

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.360
an electronic dog
starts barking.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.950
And I had this
quandary whether I

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.700
should out him in
this article as having

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.940
this fake security, which
of course I did mention

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.590
in the article.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.740
And so Templeton is
kind of this giant

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.500
of this period,
this 85-year-old who

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.070
is really the pioneer of
international investing.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.050
He was the first great
fund manager in America

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.570
to venture abroad and
say, why should I just be

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.960
looking for bargains in the US?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.060
So the most
memorable experience,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.529
strangely with Templeton,
was not in fact anything

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:11.070
that he said.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.260
It was watching him one
morning when he was exercising.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.380
And he didn't actually
know that I was there.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.140
So I'm on the beach
in Lyford Cay.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.740
It's a very tough assignment.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.740
And I hide behind a
palm tree because I'm

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.840
worried that he's going
to see that I'm there.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.050
And he's in the water.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.860
He would do this for 45 minutes
every day for many years.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.350
He's in the water
up to here, and he's

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.910
pumping his arms and
his legs like this.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.080
And he just looks ridiculous.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.650
He's wearing this hat
with this crazy visor

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.730
sticking up there and
these ear flaps down here.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.000
And his face is slathered
with sun cream, which

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.760
he hasn't bothered to rub in.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.152
And as I'm watching
this, I'm just thinking,

00:11:49.152 --> 00:11:50.860
this is kind of this
extraordinary sight.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.970
I thought I was going
to see this kind

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:59.700
of heroic sort of wise sage.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.340
And in fact he just kind
of looks like an idiot.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.180
And when I got home to New
York, I'm thinking about this.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.920
And I'm thinking actually,
this is the key to Templeton.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.360
What I realized Templeton really
embodies is this willingness

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.550
to be lonely, this
willingness to say,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.800
this is how I do things.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.650
This is a way to act that
actually makes sense to me,

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.900
is a really efficient exercise.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.470
I don't care what
anybody thinks of me.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.070
And it's an extraordinarily
powerful way to think.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.525
And this became
kind of a metaphor

00:12:28.525 --> 00:12:30.900
for me when I started thinking
about the great investors,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.340
that what all of these
guys have in common is

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.350
they're kind of mavericks
and free thinkers.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.940
They don't go with the crowd.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.490
If you want to outperform,
you have to be different.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.080
And this is something that
all of these guys have.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.700
And you see this
very vividly with

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.430
this extraordinary investment
that Templeton made in 1939.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:53.310
So the world is kind of
coming to an end, right?

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.860
It's really this calamitous
event where Germany

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.130
is about to overrun Paris.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.430
The market is still--
many companies

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.700
have been just smashed
by the Great Depression.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.240
And Templeton looks at
the Wall Street Journal,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.180
and he tells me he
figures out that there

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.570
are 104 stocks trading
on the New York Stock

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.810
Exchange that are all trading
at less than $1 apiece.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.950
And he figures that actually
the world is not coming apart.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.660
It's not going to
end in the way-- this

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.493
is one of the great
lines from Howard Marks.

00:13:27.493 --> 00:13:29.750
Howard Marks said to
me, most of the time,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.130
the world doesn't end.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.110
And this is something that
Templeton figured out.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.000
So he figures
actually the war is

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.840
going to jump start all of these
tiny companies that are still

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.020
recovering from the
Great Depression.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.700
And so he put in this order
for 104 of these stocks.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.400
And the broker that he calls,
calls him back and says,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.920
yeah, it's an eccentric
order, but fine.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.650
We'll do it.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.630
But there are 37 of these
companies that are bankrupt.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.250
And Templeton says
yeah, I want those too.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.250
And so he buys these 104 stocks.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.620
And he said to me that
five years later when

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.860
he liquidated his
position, 100 out of 104

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.600
had been profitable bets,
and he quintupled his money.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.100
So think about this
in context, right?

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.260
This guy was about 27 years old
at the time that he did this.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.530
He'd started on Wall Street
maybe two years before.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.770
He had no money.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.960
He came from nothing.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.940
I mean, his father told him, I
think his second year at Yale,

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.280
I cannot pay a dollar towards
your education anymore.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.940
And here he actually
borrowed $10,000.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.790
It was the only time he ever
borrowed money to invest,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.000
he told me at least.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.400
And so he borrows what in
today's money is about $170,000

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.270
I think.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.380
This is incredible
guts to do this.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.310
So this is the first
idea is that you

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.750
need to be willing to
diverge from the crowd

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.090
if you're going to
succeed at this.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.320
And you have this extraordinary
default option, right?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.999
If you don't want to
diverge from the crowd,

00:14:56.999 --> 00:14:58.290
you can just buy an index fund.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.360
And we know you'll do just
great over many years.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.149
And it may be that you do
even better doing that.

00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:05.940
But if you want to
outperform, you actually

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.360
have to be willing to
go against the crowd.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.550
So I think this is
one of the areas where

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.080
you can apply this great line
from Charlie Munger where

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.630
Munger as we know says, he
takes a line from algebra where

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.870
he says, invert.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.370
Always invert.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.895
So think about
what the crowd does

00:15:21.895 --> 00:15:25.150
and all of the stupidity
of the crowd, all

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.380
of the folly of the way
that most people invest,

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.570
and then invert it.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.710
So we know that when
it comes to investing,

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.380
the crowd is emotionally
very reactive.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.500
They make these very
short term decisions.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.020
They trade too much.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.060
They get carried away
by fads, by whatever

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.320
seems to be hot at that moment.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.390
They're listening to
market predictions,

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.500
for example, a great deal.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.180
And there was a wonderful
line from Marty Whitman, who

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.710
said that market prediction
is the last refuge

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:53.930
of the incompetent.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.500
We know that market prediction
really doesn't work.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.030
We know that you're not going
to be able to figure out

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.940
when the market's going up, when
interest rates are going up.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.730
And yet so many people
spend their time

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.010
being yanked around
emotionally and intellectually

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.687
by watching the latest
news on CNBC and the like.

00:16:10.687 --> 00:16:13.020
So one of the things that my
friend Mohnish Pabrai who's

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.575
one of the most brilliant
minds in this book, "The Great

00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:18.950
Minds of Investing"
said to me is

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.590
that when he started
to invest in 1994,

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.260
and he started basically to
reverse engineer Buffett,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
he said you could see
that Buffett basically

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.890
lays out the laws of investing.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.466
You can see what you need to do.

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:31.840
And he said he
would look around,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.720
and no mutual fund managers
and no hedge fund managers

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.750
were doing this.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.230
And he was like, what a country.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.470
He said it's like it's like an
entire generation of physicists

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.710
saying that gravity
doesn't exist.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.560
So this became his
great opportunity.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.150
It was to say, all right, if
no one else can to do it--

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.691
he's like, if no
one else will do it,

00:16:49.691 --> 00:16:51.350
the Indian guy will do it.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.300
So he figured out
that he was just

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.720
going to use Buffett's
laws of investing.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.650
So things like buying
stocks at a great discount

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.960
to their intrinsic value.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.270
As he put it at one point
to me, he said, rule number

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.380
one, extreme patience.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.630
So if everyone else is
being very short term,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.750
exercise extreme patience.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:17.460
Regard the market as
your servant or something

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.339
that you can use rather
than as your master.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.839
So Francis Chou, another of the
great investors in this book

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.151
said to me, most of
the time you just

00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:27.359
shouldn't be buying anything.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.280
He said I could
wait 10 years now

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.350
without buying a single stock.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.140
He's like, I don't
need to do anything.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.680
I can just sit around
and read until there's

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.059
a great opportunity.

00:17:37.059 --> 00:17:38.600
So I think one of
the things that you

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.690
see with these great
investors is this ability

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.320
to detach themselves from
the stupidity of the crowd

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.660
and to think for themselves.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.080
And I think the first
point to remember really

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.690
is to ask yourself,
do I actually have

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.760
what it takes temperamental
and intellectually

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.350
to go my own direction, to
defy conventional wisdom?

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.560
And if I don't, it's a
perfectly smart thing

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.660
to buy an index fund.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.720
But if I do, then
these are the kind

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.470
of rules that are going
to really help me.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.930
I want to diverge
from the crowd.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.830
And I think there's
no shame in saying,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.070
this is a game I shouldn't play.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.800
It may be that the
single smartest

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.800
thing I did in my
youth was to decide

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.220
I'm going to lose if I bet
on horses and if I gamble.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.400
And I'm just not going to
play that game anymore.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.280
So I think self-awareness
is probably

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.290
an important starting point.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.980
The second idea is
the power of humility.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.622
Now this photograph, which
was taken by my friend Michael

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.580
O'Brien, who took the
extraordinary photographs

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.496
for this book, "The Great
Minds of Investing,"

00:18:47.496 --> 00:18:49.086
is of Howard Marks.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:52.670
And as I mentioned in
my profile of Howard,

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.251
when you're in the
presence of Howard,

00:18:55.251 --> 00:18:56.750
you feel like you're
in the presence

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.505
of a very superior machine.

00:18:58.505 --> 00:18:59.880
He's one of those
people you just

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.440
fell, man, this guy's so
much smarter than I am.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.040
And he really is,
at some level, one

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.630
of the greatest of the
great minds of investing.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.100
This is a guy he's overseeing,
I think, $97 billion

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.510
in assets at this point.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.250
He has this
extraordinary reputation

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.570
where Buffett would say,
when something arrives

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.334
in the mail written
by Howard Marks,

00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:22.500
it's the first thing I read.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.810
I drop everything
and I read that.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.093
He's worth a couple of
billion dollars already.

00:19:28.093 --> 00:19:30.750
He bought an apartment in
Manhattan for, I think,

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.880
$52.5 million dollars.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.780
So he's a very
remarkable success story

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.790
and sort of a triumph of the
intellect and rationality.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.592
One of the things Howard
said to me when I met him

00:19:43.592 --> 00:19:46.050
in his office-- he has this
beautiful corner office on sort

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.920
of the 43rd floor of a
Manhattan skyscraper--

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.570
he said the screwiest
thing you can do

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.600
is to think that you're
a master of the universe.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.950
And this is a very
important idea.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.309
He explained to me that A, the
future is extremely uncertain.

00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:02.850
So you don't want
to get carried away

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.960
by this hubris of thinking that
you know what the future holds.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.810
So he said the only
constant is impermanence.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.850
We just don't know
what's going to happen.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.030
And so you have to
be constantly looking

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.090
at where we are in the
cycle and thinking,

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.500
am I getting carried away?

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.150
Am I taking too much risk given
where we are in the cycle?

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.680
Rather than just
thinking, I know

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.860
what the future is going
to bring, just keep

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.750
a careful gauge on
the weather and think,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.490
am I getting carried away.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.260
And people do.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.670
The other thing that I
would say about Howard Marks

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.500
is he has this belief that
comes from Japanese philosophy,

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.450
from it's this idea of
the turning of the wheel

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.630
of the law, which is the
Japanese word, [JAPANESE],

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.544
where he basically says,
we're all just little cogs.

00:20:48.544 --> 00:20:49.960
And the world is
going to keep on.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.410
The universe is going to
keep on going without us.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.910
And so you can't
get carried away

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.710
by the sense of
your own brilliance.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.240
And he is fascinated by this
idea of randomness and luck

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.200
in his own life.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.020
So he said to me
actually, even something

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.520
as simple as the
fact that he became

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.850
a very successful investor
was a series of total flukes.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.480
He told me this
wonderful story where

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.090
he said that he got
this job out of--

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.430
or he applied for this job out
of college at Lehman Brothers.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.460
And the partner
at Lehman Brothers

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.740
who's supposed to call
him and say Howard,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.590
we're super excited to hire you,
got drunk and had a hangover,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.840
and totally failed to call him.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.810
So one of the reasons why he
took this path where he ends up

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.032
as an expert on junk
bonds and the like

00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:36.990
is just because he didn't
go to Lehman Brothers

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.340
because a guy got drunk.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.270
And so he said, before
you start thinking

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.853
you're a master of
the universe, think

00:21:41.853 --> 00:21:45.221
about how many lucky breaks
came that you thought

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.220
made you incredibly
successful but actually were

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.910
just this beautiful randomness
or these deep patents,

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.660
however you want to see it,
that put you where you are.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.440
The other person
I would talk about

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.510
in discussing this idea
of the power of humility

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.954
is Bill Miller, who is
a very remarkable mind

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:04.620
in the same sort of
way as Howard Marks.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.350
He has this wonderful
kind of Renaissance mind.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.840
I had this wonderful assignment
back in, I guess, 2001

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.750
to write a profile of Miller.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:16.640
And so I spent something like
45 hours interviewing Miller.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.943
And since then I've spent a
lot more time interviewing him.

00:22:19.943 --> 00:22:22.430
It was this experience
because I flew with him

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.160
on his private
plane from Baltimore

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.126
to his alma mater where
he was giving a speech.

00:22:27.126 --> 00:22:28.830
And Miller said to
me the only reason

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.110
he had this plane really was
because he had a 90 pound dog,

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.020
and he really, really wanted to
be able to travel with his dog

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.880
wherever he went.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.920
Well it didn't come on
this particular trip.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.050
And also he quoted Buffett,
saying that at a certain point,

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.420
the scarce resource
is time, not money.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.990
So we go on his private plane
to-- I think it was William

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.580
and Mary was his college.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.860
And at the time the
market was just imploding.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.750
I mean, this is
right after 9/11.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.720
And I think the market had its
single worst week since 1929.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.420
And stocks were just crashing.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.200
And Miller is just
buying like crazy.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.920
He's just totally
happy, totally calm,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.880
totally at peace as this
brilliant contrarian investor,

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.050
very unemotional.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.560
And at the time he has
like a 15% stake in Amazon,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.740
which has just crashed from
$90 a share to $5.50 a share.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.967
And I went to some
conference where

00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:30.300
Bruce Greenwald, who's a
brilliant, brilliant mind who's

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.420
one of the great gurus
on value investing,

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.820
basically pillories
Bill Miller for thinking

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.640
that Amazon's going to survive.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.520
And Bill stands up
and he gives this sort

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.140
of impassioned speech,
speaking at triple speed

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.410
because he's nervous
and says if I'm wrong,

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:48.920
I'm going to lose
100% of my money.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.252
But if I'm right, I'm going
to make 50 times my money.

00:23:51.252 --> 00:23:53.210
And when I looked last
week, actually the stock

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.140
is up 100-fold from then.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.510
And so he was this consummate
contrarian value investor,

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.914
very, very brilliant, able
to see what other people kind

00:24:00.914 --> 00:24:03.330
of couldn't see and able to
apply this temperament, really

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.780
this willingness to be lonely
that we were talking about.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.690
And I'm standing next
to him one morning when

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.770
he calls his office in
Baltimore and he says yeah,

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:12.530
is there any news?

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.030
And one of his
colleagues says yeah,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.170
this stock that we
bought the other day,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:20.220
AES, they've missed
their earnings massively,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.860
and the stock is halved.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.910
And so it's not even
lunchtime and Miller's just

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.580
lost $50 million
on this one stock.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.120
And he was totally calm.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.910
He's like, let me see
where my cash position is.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.760
Let's double our bet on this.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.260
And he's just assuming that
basically most people overreact

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.910
to bad news.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.743
The crowd is going to
overreact to bad news.

00:24:39.743 --> 00:24:42.060
It's going to be discounted
more than it should be.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.960
And his default position
is that he should

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.980
he should be adding to his bet.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:51.470
And so I'm watching this guy and
I kind of start to hero worship

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.040
this guy because he
just embodies everything

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.355
that I admire in an investor.

00:24:57.355 --> 00:25:00.500
So then you wind forward a few
years to the financial crisis,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.160
to 2008, 2009, and
all of these stocks

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.580
are imploding once again.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.370
Financial stocks
are getting killed.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.680
Housing stocks are
getting killed.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.850
Miller, as always, is
tremendously contrarian

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.190
and he's buying things
like Countrywide Financial,

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.770
Merrill Lynch, AIG.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.190
And everything he
touches turns to dust.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:28.510
It's unbelievable to see someone
this smart look so foolish.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.520
And he's just
absolutely crushed.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.090
And one of his funds,
his flagship fund

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.410
goes down 55% in 2008.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.820
The other fund goes down
65%, his smaller fund.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.350
And this to me was an
extraordinarily powerful

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:46.850
reminder of why you need to be
humble, that you need always

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.294
to remember, what if I'm wrong?

00:25:49.294 --> 00:25:51.210
What if this hedge fund
manager that I admire,

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.750
that I have my
life savings with,

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.880
turns out to be a
charlatan or a fraudster?

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.890
What if this brokerage account
that I have turns out actually

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:02.590
to be a house of cards
and the bank goes under?

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.480
What if this private company
that I've invested in

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.990
turns out to be terrible?

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.280
And in fact this is a
particularly resonant issue

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.250
for me because the single
stupidest investment I ever

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.840
made was in a private
company that I made about 12,

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.330
13 years ago, where everything
looked fantastic here.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.749
The technology was fantastic.

00:26:20.749 --> 00:26:22.790
It was run by a friend of
mine who I love dearly,

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.360
is a very talented person.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.050
And then it just goes to hell.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.595
And Goldman Sachs
came in and invested

00:26:30.595 --> 00:26:33.480
at 40 times the valuation
that I invested in.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.790
And so I'm thinking
wow, I'm so smart.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.140
And in fact you discovered
no, you're not smart at all.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.520
You're an absolute idiot.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.680
And so I think this is
a very useful reminder.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.140
And for me part of the
reminder is that you also

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.170
need to be humble about
your own flaws and foibles

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:49.860
as an investor.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.180
And so for me I think part of
the attraction of investing

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.550
in a company like that
was feeling like wow,

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.570
I'm part of the smart
intellectual set who

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.660
gets these inside
opportunities that

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.320
aren't available
to the mere mugs

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.680
out there who are just getting
fleeced by Wall Street.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.480
And any time you
let your ego get

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.300
involved in investing I think
it's kind of a disaster.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.140
So I think the power of
humility is a very important

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.710
characteristic.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.490
And I'll finish this topic just
by mentioning this wonderful

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.500
from Damon Runyon, a superb
writer who would often

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.730
write about gambling.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.130
And he wrote this great
story "Guys and Dolls"

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.280
that became the musical
"Guys and Dolls."

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.450
And there's this character
in it, Sky Masterson,

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.710
who's a gambler.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:37.780
And Sky Masterson's dad
bankrolls him to be a gambler

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.740
and gives him this advice
very early in his career.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:46.550
And he says son, he said in
the course of your travels,

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.840
someone will come to you
and they'll offer you a bet.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:54.450
And they will say-- they'll
hold up a sealed pack of cards,

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.410
a sealed deck of cards.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.030
And they'll say,
the jack of spades

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.210
is going to jump out
of this deck of cards

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.830
and is going to squirt
cider in your ear.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.085
And he says son, do
not take that bet.

00:28:04.085 --> 00:28:06.580
Because sure as you're standing
there, the jack of spades

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.720
is going to jump out of
that sealed deck of cards,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.810
and you're going to wind up
with an ear full of cider.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.760
And I think this
is, in some ways,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.770
humility is a part of avoiding
that you earful of cider,

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.500
these situations that you think
it's impossible that they'll

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.540
happen, and they do.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.040
The ability to take pain--
so as I was saying before,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.170
this is about
emotional resilience.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.077
So let's go back to Bill Miller.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.910
So think about what
Bill Miller went through

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.720
during the financial crisis.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.560
He had recently gone
through a divorce, which

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.080
he said to me it was
an amicable divorce,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.860
but it halved his assets.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.310
He then invests half
of the assets on margin

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.180
because he is always kind
of a bit of a risk taker.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.770
He loses 80% on paper of his
assets in the financial crisis.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.230
Whereas he said to me, he said
his wife put all her money

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.280
in bonds and did fantastically
and outperformed him massively

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.390
and now has the biggest house
in Greenwich, Connecticut.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.120
And so he's done well since
then, so he's recovered.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.630
But his two funds
get really hammered.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.580
And assets just fly
out of the window.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.940
I mean, at his
peak at Legg Mason,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.490
he was overseeing
$77 billion dollars.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.400
Assets go down to $800 million.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.790
And when this happens, he has
to lay off tons of people.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.570
And so he ends up laying
off over a hundred people.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.200
And he said to me, this
was the worst thing.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.610
He said, people
lost their money.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.170
Investors lost their money.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.060
And people lost their jobs
because of me, because

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.420
of Mistakes that I made.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.260
And I said to him, did
you blame yourself?

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.020
And he said sure as
hell I blamed myself.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.280
He said I looked around, I
wanted to blame someone else.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.100
There was no one else to blame.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.446
They were my mistakes.

00:29:49.446 --> 00:29:55.940
And during this period he told
me that he put on 40 pounds.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.080
And I said to him, how
come you put on 40 pounds?

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.677
Dietary issues are
important to me

00:30:01.677 --> 00:30:04.010
because I'm always wondering
how I can ever lose weight.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.230
And so I was interested
in his answer.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.432
And he said, well, I ate
a lot of comfort food.

00:30:08.432 --> 00:30:09.640
I ate a lot of cheeseburgers.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.806
I ate a lot of Chinese food.

00:30:10.806 --> 00:30:13.355
I would drink red wine at night.

00:30:13.355 --> 00:30:15.230
And he said, you know,
I could have come home

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.940
and just had grilled salmon
and broccoli and Perrier.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.200
But he said a man can
only take so much pain.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.074
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.670
So Miller said to
me at one point

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.350
that if you did a brain scan of
the greatest value investors,

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.420
he said he's pretty
convinced that you would find

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.336
that the greatest value
investors are actually

00:30:35.336 --> 00:30:38.095
wired differently
than the rest of us,

00:30:38.095 --> 00:30:41.280
that the part of the
brain that processes, say,

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.100
the fear of loss
or the pain of loss

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.770
is actually kind
of stunted in them.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.170
And I think you can
see this in people

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.420
like Buffett, that they're
just extremely unemotional.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.090
You see it in Marks as well.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.000
And yet, Miller
during this period

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.150
of very tremendous
intensity, gets

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.380
hit badly enough that
he puts on 40 pounds

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.100
and it becomes this
incredibly intense experience.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:09.200
And I think this is a powerful
reminder that you really

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.310
need to pay attention.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.800
If you want to be long time
successful as an investor,

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.610
you need to pay
attention to the need

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.180
to build emotional resilience.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.170
And this is a really
important point

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.300
that I think particularly
people forget when we're

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.570
going through a good period.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.350
You tend to assume things
will always be good.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.100
And you tend to overreach
during these good periods.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.950
We get full of
overconfidence and hubris.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:37.240
And I think it's really key
to remember one of the things

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.810
that Howard Marks says, which
is that life is basically

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.495
a pendulum, that our own
lives are a pendulum.

00:31:42.495 --> 00:31:45.550
They swing one way from
one extreme to the other.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.140
The market is a pendulum.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.150
The market euphoria
is a pendulum.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.229
And so just not to get carried
away during these periods where

00:31:54.229 --> 00:31:55.020
everything is good.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.200
You don't want to overreach.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.040
You want to work on
the basis that there

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.370
is going to be a time
where I'm going to get hit.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.314
And this isn't to
be gloomy about it.

00:32:05.314 --> 00:32:07.950
You want to take
various safeguards,

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.134
various precautions.

00:32:09.134 --> 00:32:10.300
You don't want to overreach.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.550
Bill Ruane once
said to me, you just

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:14.870
never want to invest in margin.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.010
Because when the
market gets hit,

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.900
it's just impossible
to be rational

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.590
because it's such an
emotionally grueling thing.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:29.760
So I think this sense
of taking great caution

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.670
during the periods
where things are good

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.660
is a key to setting
yourself up to be

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.117
able to dealing with pain.

00:32:36.117 --> 00:32:37.700
But I think also
it's really important

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.850
to look at where
different investors get

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.070
their emotional strength
and to ask yourself,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.590
so where will I get my
strength when things go wrong?

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.100
And so it was very
striking to me,

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.910
for example, that
Miller, when I asked him

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.910
what he was reading during
the financial crisis,

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.380
he said basically I was
reading the stoic philosophers.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.524
So he was reading
Epictetus and Seneca.

00:32:56.524 --> 00:32:57.940
Because what they're
talking about

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.640
is, as he described
it to me, he said

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.320
it's their general
attitude to misfortune.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.290
It's that they're saying,
you can't necessarily

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.600
control what happens to you, but
you can control your attitude

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.600
towards it.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.820
This is a very,
very important idea.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.230
And when I look at all
of these great investors,

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.740
it's very tempting
to assume that there

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.250
was this straight
upward trajectory

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.370
and their lives were always
going to be a success,

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.990
and it's really not true at all.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.067
These guys, all of them
went through the wringer.

00:33:28.067 --> 00:33:30.150
And you look at people
like Eveillard-- Jean-Marie

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.960
Eveillard or Don
Yacktman, they went

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.130
through periods in
the late '90s where

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.050
they looked like idiots
because they refused

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.610
to buy expensive stocks.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.320
They underperformed for years.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.020
You know, Eveillard said to me,
when you underperform massively

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.020
for three years, he
said the first year,

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.250
your shareholders are upset.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.790
The second year they're furious.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.750
And the third year they're gone.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.770
And he said at a certain
point, you start to say,

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.070
am I an idiot?

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.100
How come I don't get it?

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.160
How come everyone else gets it?

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.920
So while we're talking about
the willingness to be lonely,

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.670
the willingness to go
your own direction,

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.253
it's important to
understand that this

00:34:08.253 --> 00:34:09.670
requires a degree of strength.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.980
It requires emotional fortitude.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.980
But I would say for
all of you, you're

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.144
going to find that in
the course of a lifetime,

00:34:17.144 --> 00:34:18.810
there are periods
that are very intense.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.929
And you need to
figure out, where

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.770
am I going to get my
emotional strength?

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.159
And it doesn't
necessarily matter

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.047
whether it's from
stoic philosophy,

00:34:27.047 --> 00:34:28.630
whether it's from
spirituality-- which

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.296
it was for someone
like Don Yacktman who

00:34:30.296 --> 00:34:34.019
was a-- actually he was an
archbishop in the Mormon church

00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:34.560
at one point.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.199
And he said to me that a
period like the late '90s,

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:42.690
he said if it hadn't been for
his faith, his family-- he's

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.179
been married for
I think 50 years

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:48.389
and has seven kids
and 25 grandkids--

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.170
if it hadn't been for his
faith, his family, and the fact

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.770
that he volunteered in
things like the Scouts,

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.157
he said a period like that
could have destroyed me.

00:34:57.157 --> 00:34:58.240
And this was his language.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.050
He was like, it could
have destroyed me.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.410
And so I think here's
a very important idea.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.670
Where am I going to get
my emotional strength,

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.540
and not to underestimate
the importance of that.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:14.600
And also just not to idealize
these great, successful people

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.890
and assume that everything
was just fine always.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.010
It's like no, you're going
to go through periods

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.200
that are very difficult.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.620
The fourth and final idea
before we get to questions

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.150
is, I think, probably
the most important,

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.292
which is the key to happiness.

00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:32.650
And I've spent a lot of
time over the years studying

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:33.580
these great investors.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.640
And some of them are
multibillionaires.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.200
And you're trying to
figure out, are they happy?

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.630
What does the money buy them?

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.790
What makes their
lives worthwhile?

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.452
And I was in a very
privileged position

00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:45.910
because I got to
see this up close.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.666
And so I got to see
when actually they

00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:48.790
were really pretty unhappy.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.270
And you could look in the
eyes of certain investors,

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.905
whether it's a Tom Gayner or
a John Spears or a Mohnish

00:35:54.905 --> 00:35:58.360
Pabrai, and you'd be like, this
guy has a kind of glow to him.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:58.860
And why?

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.070
Where does that come from?

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.550
Why is this person
more fulfilled

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.690
than some of the
other investors?

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:12.330
And so the reason we have
this photograph of Irving Kahn

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.040
is that in some ways he kind
of embodies this deeper wisdom

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.030
about what life is about.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.660
This photo of Kahn was taken
when he was 108 years old.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.620
He was one of four siblings, all
of whom live to over a hundred.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.330
It's an astonishing thing.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.900
And what's even
more astonishing is

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.720
he smoked until
he was about 50--

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.020
I'm not necessarily advocating
this-- and ate red meat always.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.990
And so his son Tom, who worked
with him for many years,

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.460
was in his 70s, said
to me, really he

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.470
stayed young because
he just always studied.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.710
He just was learning constantly.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:52.090
So he had a youthful
mind until the very end.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.940
So a few months--
actually maybe six,

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.460
eight weeks before
Irving Kahn died,

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.220
I had this very strange
interview with him

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.330
where I was hoping to
meet with him in person,

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.760
and he was too sick to meet me.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.800
And I was initially
very disappointed.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.000
And then his grandson Andrew,
who's a analyst in his third--

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.070
he's at Kahn Brothers,
his investment firm--

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.380
is a really lovely
bloke, takes my questions

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.730
that I've written out,
and asks these questions

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.540
to his grandfather, whom he
adored, over several days,

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.945
and writes our answers.

00:37:22.945 --> 00:37:24.739
And when I get
these answers back,

00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:26.530
there's something deeply
moving about them.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:31.480
This is sort of the lifelong
wisdom of a 108 year old man.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.957
And so one of the
key questions I

00:37:32.957 --> 00:37:34.790
said to him, when you
look back on your life

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:39.430
and you think about not
just the key to a long life,

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:41.280
an extraordinarily
long life, but actually

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.630
a happy life and a meaningful
life, a fulfilling life,

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.400
what is it?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.130
What can we learn from you?

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.187
And he said, this is a very
hard question to answer,

00:37:50.187 --> 00:37:51.520
and it's different for everyone.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.510
But he said for me,
family is very important.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.310
And when I asked him
what made him happy,

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:01.440
what made him look back on
his 108 years with happiness

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.380
and a sense of pride
and fulfillment,

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.990
he said the things
that were important

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:11.120
were happy, healthy family
members, the fact that he

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.430
built a company that
he was proud of,

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.740
that he'd created something.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.670
And the third thing
he said was that he'd

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.994
met people who were smarter
than him who could give him

00:38:21.994 --> 00:38:23.410
the answers, because
he said there

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.230
are certain mysteries
in life that you just

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.200
can't solve on your own.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.783
And sometimes you
have to stop and you

00:38:27.783 --> 00:38:28.940
have to ask for directions.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.440
And so when you
look at the things--

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.606
and I'm pretty sure that
the person he was referring

00:38:32.606 --> 00:38:35.970
to above all was Ben Graham, who
was a lifelong friend of his.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:40.140
And he was actually his
teaching partner in the 1920s.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.632
So here you're looking at
a guy who lives to 109.

00:38:42.632 --> 00:38:44.590
And the things that he's
emphasizing, it's not,

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.570
I had a Maserati.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.110
It's learning.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.240
It's family.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.020
It's health.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.180
It's wisdom.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.410
And his son and grandson
said the only thing

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:59.070
he ever truly craved, really,
in terms of physical objects

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.920
was books.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.630
They were taken to
a French restaurant,

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.421
fancy French restaurant,
and he would order

00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:06.150
chop steak or a hamburger.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.380
He just was totally not
interested in anything flashy.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.450
So I thought that
was very revealing.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.089
I had a very interesting
interview with John Spears

00:39:15.089 --> 00:39:15.880
from Tweedy Browne.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.990
He's an extraordinary
guy, again,

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.880
with a real glow
in his eye, someone

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.760
you feel has figured stuff out.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.700
And he was telling me about
this apartment that he

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.380
had bought in Florida, which
cost him, I think, $5 million.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.131
And he doesn't like
to have a lot of risk.

00:39:29.131 --> 00:39:31.296
He doesn't like to have a
lot of stress in his life.

00:39:31.296 --> 00:39:32.750
So he paid for it in cash.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.250
And he said to me, yeah, I
felt like kind of a big shot.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.310
It was the biggest
apartment in the building.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.250
And I was the only one
who had two apartments

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:40.630
that I put together.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:44.000
And he said-- he was
very funny about it.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
He said yeah, so I had this sort
of sense of my own importance.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.100
And then he said when he
thought about it more,

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.326
what he realized was
actually the importance was

00:39:51.326 --> 00:39:53.950
that his kids and his grandkids
could come stay there with him,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.170
that it was big enough.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.290
And he said to me,
investors are always

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.190
talking about return on
investment, return on assets,

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.520
return on invested capital.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.920
And he said, this
is a return on life.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.310
And I thought it was
a very beautiful, kind

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.360
of poetic phrase.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.380
And it's an important way, I
think, to look at your money.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.490
There's got to be
a return on life.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.280
I'm not trying to be
self-righteous about this.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.520
This isn't a moral thing.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.240
It's like, it's what works.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.990
Munger always says, he looks
at other people and figures

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.820
out what works and
what doesn't work.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.840
And so you're look at these
people like Kahn and Spears

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.480
and Gayner who are very
charitable, very philanthropic,

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.440
who are very family oriented,
and they're actually happier.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.060
And I think that's a
very revealing thing.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.830
So finally I would
mention Mohnish Pabrai,

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.560
who has spoken here before.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.751
And Mohnish kind of
embodies this attitude.

00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:48.500
He's thought very
deeply about this stuff.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.090
And Mohnish is a
very brilliant guy

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.990
and a very brilliant investor.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:56.479
And I went with him
to India recently,

00:40:56.479 --> 00:40:59.020
and he was talking about how he
was a lousy student as a kid.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.700
And then they did
bunch of testing on him

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.116
and they said oh
yeah, by the way,

00:41:02.116 --> 00:41:04.000
you have an IQ in the 180s.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.800
So this is an
incredibly smart guy.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.420
He has a really good engine.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.820
And he's figured out how to
stack the odds in his favor

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.764
so he wins this particular
game of investing.

00:41:13.764 --> 00:41:16.180
But the thing that Mohnish is
going to be remembered for--

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.760
and he's very
conscious of this--

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.330
is not his hedge fund,
however good the returns are.

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.540
It's actually this
charitable foundation

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.456
that he's set up, which
is very extraordinary,

00:41:25.456 --> 00:41:27.290
which is called The
Dakshana Foundation.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:30.650
And Dakshana a
Sanskrit word for gift.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.170
And I had the opportunity
to go recently

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.391
with Mohnish over Christmas
to spend several days in India

00:41:36.391 --> 00:41:36.890
with him.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.110
And so I went around to
look at the charity up close

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.216
and to see what it did.

00:41:42.216 --> 00:41:44.950
And what Dakshana does
that's very extraordinary

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:49.270
is it takes some of the
cleverest teenagers in India,

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:51.760
but these are people from
very, very poor backgrounds.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.150
Some of them are from families
that are untouchables,

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.950
from very poor rural areas.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.530
And he gives them two
years of free coaching

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.360
to take the exam to the Indian
Institutes of Technology,

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.320
which as many of
you will know, is

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.400
the Indian equivalent of MIT.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.050
And this totally and utterly
transforms their lives.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.680
If you get into IIT,
your prospects in life

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.530
and the prospects of your whole
family are just transformed.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.430
And IIT has an acceptance
rate of less than 2%.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:25.890
Dakshana graduates, 54% of
them have gotten so far.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:27.580
It's an astonishing thing.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:32.790
And again, it's Mohnish figuring
out, how do I win this game.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.840
What are the things that we can
do that can make our students

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.770
do really well in this exam.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.887
And so the latest count, I think
888 of these graduates got in.

00:42:43.887 --> 00:42:45.720
And I had this wonderful
experience in India

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.180
where I was in Pune where I
met a lot of the graduates.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.370
One of them
particularly stuck out.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.450
He was kind of the star of the
Dakshana Foundation graduates.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:00.600
He had come top of all of
them in the national exams.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.440
He's come 63rd out of more
than half a million people

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.960
in this exam and had
gone to IIT Bombay, which

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.790
is the hardest to get into.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:14.270
And then he gets this job
at a great tech company,

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.890
goes to work in London.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.950
And recently came, a
month or so, recently

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:20.900
came to work in California.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:26.955
And I said to this guy,
were your parents smart?

00:43:26.955 --> 00:43:29.330
Because I knew that he lived
in a very, very modest home,

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:30.620
a very modest area.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.640
And he said yeah, my
father is incredibly smart.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.320
He said he was a
superb mathematician.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.470
But he never had an
opportunity to use it.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.290
And he spent his life-- he
makes a very modest salary

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.370
as a tailor.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.430
And one of the first
things that this guy had

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.990
done with his money after
he gets this tech job is he

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.420
buys a house for his parents.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.870
And so he moves them out of
the very, very modest house

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:52.910
into a new house.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.350
And as I'm thinking
about this story,

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:58.030
I'm thinking what an
amazing thing, that Mohnish

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.630
has taken his skill
at playing a game,

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:04.730
and he's totally transformed
hundreds of lives in this way.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.200
And that this young
guy has figured out

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.980
actually the first
thing I want to do

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.100
is to transform my parent's
life, not my life when

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.270
I get the money.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.250
And the thing that's
more amazing about this

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.960
is that that guy is
in this room now,

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.770
and it's Ashok, who's here.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.410
And so the company that
Ashok went to work for

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.440
is actually Google.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.400
And so Ashok went to work,
after graduating from Dakshana,

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.020
went to work for
Google in London,

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.390
recently came here as
a software engineer

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:36.720
in the search area for
Google here in Mountain View.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.230
So you're seeing here
the fact that Mohnish

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.470
has been able to take
this extraordinary skill,

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.570
this extraordinary
brain, this ability

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.520
to stack the odds in
his favor in life,

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.920
and actually use it to
have this tremendous impact

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.210
on other people.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.410
And I don't think this
is because Mohnish is

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.780
some sort of righteous figure.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.372
I think he's a lovely guy.

00:44:56.372 --> 00:44:57.080
He's a great guy.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.350
I love spending time with him.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.820
But I think what he's figured
out is, this is what works.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.890
He's like, if I'm to have a
really happy and fulfilled

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.480
life, it's not going to
come because I have a yacht.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.249
It's actually going to
come because I figured out

00:45:11.249 --> 00:45:13.540
how to help other people and
how to make other people's

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.924
lives more complete.

00:45:14.924 --> 00:45:16.840
And so the thought that
I would leave you with

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.680
is just that you should
think about your Dakshana.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.800
What's your gift?

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.520
And how do you take
your particular gift

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.190
that you have-- you're all
incredibly smart people-- how

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.119
do you take your
abilities and figure out

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:33.660
what do I do with this to make
a difference in other people's

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.320
lives?

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.690
And I think you do this not
because you're necessarily

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:40.330
Mother Teresa or Gandhi,
it's because you're

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.327
tilting the playing
field in your direction.

00:45:42.327 --> 00:45:43.910
You're stacking the
odds in your favor

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.840
so that you can have a happy and
successful and meaningful life.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.558
Thank you.

00:45:48.558 --> 00:45:51.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:55.037 --> 00:45:56.370
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you William.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.170
We'll open for
taking for questions.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.100
AUDIENCE: So you're talking
about-- you suggested

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.950
to diverge from the crowds.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:06.220
I think the people follow
the crowds for reasons

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.700
because it's safer.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.440
It's less risky.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.900
So what's your
take on this point?

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.100
If you want to be
[INAUDIBLE], takes more steps

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.409
to be diverse, but
probably be more risky.

00:46:16.409 --> 00:46:18.700
WILLIAM GREEN: So how to
think through this idea of how

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.340
diversified you should
be to control risk.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
versus taking risk.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:24.570
This is a trade-off there.

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.460
WILLIAM GREEN:
Yeah, I think you've

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.990
focused on really one of the
most important questions.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.600
And one of the things
that was fascinating to me

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.274
in terms of
interviewing an array

00:46:33.274 --> 00:46:34.690
of these different
great investors

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:37.890
was actually to see the
difference in the way

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.560
that they had solved
this question.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.720
So Mohnish for example
had most of his money

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.020
in about five stocks and
had tremendous confidence,

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.147
tremendous knowledge
of these stocks.

00:46:49.147 --> 00:46:50.355
But then one of them blew up.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.011
So it's risky.

00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:58.390
I think it's one reason
why Mohnish will outperform

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.670
massively over the years, but
I think it can be like that.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.210
And so you for
Mohnish, because he

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:08.210
has this extraordinary
temperament, it's feasible.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.660
So I said to Mohnish about
the financial crisis, I said,

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.556
how did you deal with the
stress of the financial crisis?

00:47:14.556 --> 00:47:16.430
Because at one point
his fund, his hedge fund

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.940
was massively down.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.190
And he said oh, I
don't feel stress.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.270
And I actually don't
think that's true.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:24.730
I think it may have
been true then,

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:25.960
but I think there
are circumstances

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.660
where even for Mohnish or even
for Bill Miller, these guys who

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.120
are very unemotional, you
can get to a situation

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.095
where a sufficient
number of things

00:47:33.095 --> 00:47:35.220
can go wrong that actually
it becomes very painful.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.890
And so I think even for
people like Mohnish who

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.430
have an extraordinary
temperament,

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:45.000
you have to be aware of the
dangers of overconfidence.

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.970
And I talked to people like
Joel Greenblatt about this.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:56.515
And Joel had 80%-- Joel is
one of the greatest hedge fund

00:47:56.515 --> 00:47:57.460
managers of all time.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.040
And Joel had 80%
of his money in six

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.310
to eight stocks for
much of his career.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:06.750
And he said, every few weeks
the portfolio might go down

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.500
30% in a couple of weeks.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.414
And he said it was fine for him.

00:48:10.414 --> 00:48:11.330
He could cope with it.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:13.831
But he said he actually returned
a lot of the shareholders'

00:48:13.831 --> 00:48:14.330
money.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.900
After five years he
returned half the money.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.920
And after 10 years he
returned all of the money.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.320
So the only shareholders
were him and his family

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.810
and his partners.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.700
And he said if the family lost
money or friends lost money,

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.560
he would just help them out.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.940
And so it was OK.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:33.080
So I think the point
is, you kind of have

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.614
to look at your own temperament
and say how unemotional am I.

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:40.030
And one of the things my friend
Guy Spier was saying to me

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:42.440
recently is you can
actually get to a point

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.010
where you are emotionally
flooded, where you can actually

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:48.334
reach a point where, if a
sufficient number of things

00:48:48.334 --> 00:48:50.000
can go wrong at the
same time, that it's

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.510
very hard to be rational,
to make rational decisions.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:57.090
And his view is that
you want to try always

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.620
to be the last man standing.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.280
And he said you
look at Buffett, who

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.340
has 10 times more capital
in his insurance business

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.130
than anyone else.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.450
He's basically set it
up so he's antifragile.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:12.014
So he'll survive
whatever goes wrong.

00:49:12.014 --> 00:49:13.930
And so Guy's view is,
you want to kind of look

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:20.440
at what everyone else is doing,
what the people you really

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.390
admire, where they
are on the risk curve.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.590
And then he said, just
do less than them.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:29.254
And I think it's a really
interesting idea that

00:49:29.254 --> 00:49:31.090
yeah, if you're
super constrained,

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.970
if you're incredibly smart, you
can get unbelievable returns.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.040
But I think for
most of us if you

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.210
want to survive over not
one cycle but 20, 30, 40,

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:46.170
50 years as an investor, I
think diversification and just

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:47.564
saying, what do I know.

00:49:47.564 --> 00:49:48.480
What if it goes wrong?

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.510
What if I'm wrong?

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.870
There's a French
investor I interviewed,

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:56.740
a guy called Francois
[INAUDIBLE], who said to me,

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:00.650
I have three principles--
doubt, doubt, and doubt.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.420
And I think it's kind of
helpful to doubt yourself.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.610
And I think
diversification-- it's just

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:10.740
kind of rational to say
yeah, but if this company

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:15.230
I own, if I'm wrong, what
are the consequences?

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.940
And one of the things Irving
Kahn said to me that I thought

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:21.790
was really interesting, he said,
the single most important piece

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:26.050
of financial advice I can share
is to focus on the downside.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:31.010
And he said, you know,
the trouble these days

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.594
is that people can
gallop really fast.

00:50:32.594 --> 00:50:34.968
But he said they don't really
know what direction they're

00:50:34.968 --> 00:50:35.810
galloping in.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:40.680
And he said if you really
focus on the downside,

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.600
and he said you have
reasonable returns

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.420
and you avoid
terrible losses, he

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.840
said you'll outperform all
of your gambler friends.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.150
And he said it's also a
good cure for your sleeping

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.935
problems.

00:50:49.935 --> 00:50:51.310
AUDIENCE: I think
you interviewed

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:53.570
Bill Ackman for your book.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.895
Would you please tell
us something about him,

00:50:55.895 --> 00:50:57.864
and do you think
he will survive?

00:50:57.864 --> 00:50:59.780
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah, I
do think he'll survive.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.600
I think Ackman is
remarkably smart.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.430
I think he's a very
brilliant analyst.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.480
He's got a very brilliant mind.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.680
I think as with all of
these great investors,

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.170
they're flawed.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.560
They're not perfect.

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.635
They make mistakes.

00:51:17.635 --> 00:51:21.210
And his mistake with
Valeant-- so far

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:24.380
it's turned out to be
a really dire mistake.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.550
You could say that's
a kind of bull market

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.520
phenomenon of over confidence.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.600
But he's always been taking
these very contrary positions

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.660
that are very aggressive.

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.880
And it's part of his character.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:41.500
And I think Bill has a very
interesting personality.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.780
He's very combative
in certain ways.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:49.680
And he's prepared to go into
these very difficult situations

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:54.920
where, with something like
Herbalife where he thinks

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.650
this company's a fraud
and a Ponzi scheme

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.630
and I'm going to take it down.

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:01.330
And he has spent
over $50 million

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.870
on this campaign to
bring down Herbalife.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:07.280
And so I think he has a
very distinctive approach.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.280
And one of the things he
said to me about money,

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.417
he said the reason I wanted
to get rich from very early on

00:52:12.417 --> 00:52:14.000
was so that I would
have independence.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.290
He said it was so that I
could say what I believe,

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:19.830
so that I could act in a
way that I believe is right.

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:23.790
And so he really embodies
this idea of the willingness

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.374
to be lonely, the willingness
to take idiosyncratic positions.

00:52:26.374 --> 00:52:28.498
And that's going to mean
there are times where he's

00:52:28.498 --> 00:52:29.880
going to look really stupid.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.990
But there were
times where Buffett

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:34.814
looked stupid in
the late '90s where

00:52:34.814 --> 00:52:36.230
he refused to buy
any tech stocks,

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:38.563
where Eveillard looked stupid,
where Don Yacktman looked

00:52:38.563 --> 00:52:39.630
stupid.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.840
Eveillard's assets went down
from I think $6 billion to $2

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.580
billion during the tech
bubble in the late '90s.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:49.780
Everyone abandoned him.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.250
He said to me that one
of the senior executives

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:54.840
at his company said,
well, Jean-Marie,

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.730
he's half senile anyway.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.750
And Jean-Marie said
to me, I was 59.

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:03.040
And so I think one of the things
that's really striking to me

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.850
is that there are always periods
where these great investors

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.110
look like idiots.

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:13.000
And my money is on
Ackman, just in terms

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.150
of his intellect, his
analytical brilliance,

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:20.160
and he's got a kind of in
inner toughness to him.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.614
And I think the real
lesson for-- you know,

00:53:24.614 --> 00:53:26.780
there are multiple lessons
of the Valeant situation.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.480
But I think the hubris
and the overconfidence one

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.140
is important, the
unknowability of the future.

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.060
Peter Lynch was looking
through some old notes

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.675
from an interview I had
Peter Lynch the other day.

00:53:36.675 --> 00:53:39.415
And well, the interview
was about 18 years ago,

00:53:39.415 --> 00:53:41.290
but I was looking at
the notes the other day.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:44.940
And Lynch said to me, he
bet on some company in 1969

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.800
where he said, Ned Johnson
was not yet running Fidelity

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.946
but was then running
a fund there.

00:53:52.946 --> 00:53:55.180
And Lynch pitched
this stock to him

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.940
that was an apparel
company that was great.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.350
He said it had the cover
of Vogue three times.

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:04.020
And their earnings, it
was like a record year.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.200
And he said then the
movie, what was it,

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.810
"Bonnie and Clyde" comes out.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.520
And he says Faye
Dunaway is wearing

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.550
these incredible long
pleated 1930s skirts.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.440
And it totally and
utterly changes fashion.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.680
And he said in the
same year this company

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.090
had record earnings, the
company went bankrupt.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:25.299
And he said he talked
to Ned Johnson about it,

00:54:25.299 --> 00:54:26.840
and he said Ned
Johnson just laughed.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.631
And he said yeah,
sometimes this stuff just

00:54:28.631 --> 00:54:29.970
comes out of left field.

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:35.450
And so I think this sort of
healthy awareness of the fact

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:37.400
that the jack of spades
can actually jump out

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.620
of the pack of cards and
squirt cider in your ear,

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:46.650
it's useful to retain that
sense of our own fallibility.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:48.290
AUDIENCE: During
the times when you

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:51.050
said these investors
would look stupid,

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:54.930
there seems to be two
kind of categories.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.090
One is category
where they decided

00:54:57.090 --> 00:55:00.290
they don't want to participate
in irrationality they see,

00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:03.630
like Don Yacktman or Eveillard.

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.690
And then the second
one is where they

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.490
seem to be confident
about something,

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:10.680
but then it eventually
builds up on them.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:16.540
So say Bill Miller, Valeant
example that you gave.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.920
In those cases
where they're taking

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:25.830
a bet where they're kind of
alone, how important is it

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:30.250
where, on one side you want
to be kind of confident,

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:34.290
but the humanity is confidence
doesn't go into arrogance.

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:38.290
And in several of these cases
there was enough evidence

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:39.380
that they could be wrong.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:44.900
For example, there's a famous
Steve Eisman and Bill Miller

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.980
kind of face off type of
thing where Steve Eisman was

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.380
this young hedge fund
analyst, running company

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.722
that had done all this work.

00:55:52.722 --> 00:55:53.930
That this is really a bubble.

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:55.990
In the Valeant case
there was enough evidence

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:58.220
before that all these--

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.780
WILLIAM GREEN: I think it's a
really profound and important

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:06.380
question you raise, this thin
line between the willingness

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.470
to be lonely and the arrogance
where you say everybody else is

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.930
wrong, I am right.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.740
And you end up
blowing yourself up.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.660
And it's a very, very
interesting question.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:21.440
You know, I was always a huge
admirer of Marty Whitman.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.150
And he was an absolutely
brilliant contrarian value

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:26.080
investor.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.296
And Whitman-- once
I said to him,

00:56:30.296 --> 00:56:32.670
if you would to own just one
stock for the next 10 years,

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:33.378
what would it be?

00:56:33.378 --> 00:56:35.050
And he said MBIA.

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:39.660
And this is the company
that Bill Ackman shorted.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:45.336
And Ackman said to me that he
actually-- I think he said,

00:56:45.336 --> 00:56:47.040
I can't remember if
actually met him,

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.786
but I think he told me that
he contacted Marty and said

00:56:50.786 --> 00:56:52.160
to him, I want to
go through this

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.900
and explain to you
why this is crap,

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.280
why it's going to fall apart.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.459
And Marty kind of dismissed
him and kind of bad

00:56:58.459 --> 00:56:59.500
mouthed him in the press.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.860
And Marty's a kind of
combustible guy in the way

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.850
that he's feisty.

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:08.150
And I talked to Marty
about this afterwards.

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:09.990
And I said, why did you mess up?

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:14.430
And he said-- I mean,
he's now in his 90s.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:19.500
And he said at a certain point
as I became richer and older,

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.949
I became lazy.

00:57:20.949 --> 00:57:22.740
And he said there were
certain stocks where

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.220
I should have sold.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:26.740
He said I knew that I should
have sold my housing stock

00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.170
before the financial crisis.

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.860
And I kind of didn't
get around to it.

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:37.181
And Bill Nygren said to me
that this is a full on game.

00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:38.680
He said there are
lots of people who

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.721
have decided I'm going to
go into semiretirement.

00:57:40.721 --> 00:57:41.670
And it's like no.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.780
He's like, either the switch
is fully on or it's fully off.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.290
He said it is so
hard at that level.

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:52.530
And so I think it's interesting
that all of these guys

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:53.040
screw up.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.310
Templeton said to me,
however smart you are,

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:57.270
you're going to screw
up a third of the time.

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.030
And you know, there
was a wonderful moment

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:02.277
with Bill Miller where
years ago in 2001

00:58:02.277 --> 00:58:04.110
after the financial
crisis where he's making

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:05.940
these incredibly gutsy bets.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.580
I said to him man,
you really have

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.452
to have balls to do what you do.

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:11.160
And he said yeah, you
have to have balls.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.050
But you've also got to be right.

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.390
And it stuck with me forever.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:18.720
And he said, let me
show you this chart.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.484
And he shows me this chart
of a fund's performance.

00:58:21.484 --> 00:58:22.400
He says, look at this.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.474
You see the steady monthly
upward trajectory of this fund.

00:58:26.474 --> 00:58:28.890
And then he said, and then it
just collapses and goes down

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.000
90 something percent.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.990
He said that's Long-Term
Capital Management.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:34.080
And he said the thing
that's really hard to tell

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.760
is am I here in my
career or am I here?

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.130
And so I think this idea of
hubris, of just saying yeah,

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.900
I believe this is true,
but what if I'm wrong?

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.900
And this is why the idea
of the margin of safety

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.050
is so powerful.

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:52.360
And so I think when you look
at people like Irving Kahn, who

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.860
did tremendously
well for decades,

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.550
it's partly they survived.

00:58:57.550 --> 00:58:59.220
They didn't blow themselves.

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.740
And so Irving would have a
tremendous amount of cash,

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:02.850
often.

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:05.480
I think at the end he had
about half his money in cash.

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.910
And so yeah, maybe
you underperform.

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:09.490
But you survive.

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:13.990
And so I think that idea
of just being resilient,

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:15.560
of trying to be the
last man standing

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.976
rather than necessarily the
smartest guy in the room, that

00:59:17.976 --> 00:59:18.800
is very powerful.

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.591
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you for the great talk.

00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:22.910
And can we all have a big
round of applause only

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:24.190
for [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:26.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:31.140
WILLIAM GREEN:
Thank you so much.
