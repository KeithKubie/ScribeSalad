MALE SPEAKER: Thanks everybody
for coming to this Google

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.800
Author Series talk.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.640
I want to have the
esteemed privilege

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.444
to introduce Bea Johnson,
author of "Zero Waste Home."

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:16.149
Bea, she's lived a waste-free
lifestyle since 2008,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.030
generating for her whole
family just a quart

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.120
of waste in an entire year.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.980
She's also zero waste
lifestyle expert.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.860
Her goals shatter
the misconceptions

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.880
associated with living in
zero-waste lifestyle proving

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.530
that a waste-free living can
not only be stylish but lead

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.350
to significant health benefits
and time and money savings.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.980
She was a grand prize
winner of the green awards.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.230
She's invited to speak, like
here, at many corporate events,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.730
universities, and other
conferences all over the world.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.660
And she spreads her tips for
living a zero-waste lifestyle

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.120
in that.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.970
She opens her home
to educational tours

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.960
and the media.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.740
I know [? Myomi ?]
has been to her house,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.350
has been shopping with her at
Whole Foods to see how she does

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.190
this.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.550
She's appeared on TV shows and
publications around the world,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.220
including the "Today Show"
and the "BBC Breakfast."

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.470
New York Times has
called her the priestess

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.480
of waste-free living.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.650
I like that one.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.720
As a spokesperson for
a zero-waste lifestyle,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.610
she also provides
consulting services

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.600
for sustainable product
conception, waste reduction,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.660
and minimalism.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.801
Welcome Bea.

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.605
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.320
BEA JOHNSON: Thanks
so much for having me.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.160
It's so funny that I have been
calling myself a Google girl,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.890
and here I am today at Google.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.570
So first, let me
introduce my family.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.150
And so this is my family.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.250
On the right, we have
Max who's now 15,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.660
Leo, on the left, who is
now 14, my husband, Scott,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.420
and our zero-waste dog,
Zizu, is actually the mascot

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.130
of our zero-waste lifestyle.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.570
So yeah, it's the little
baby of the family.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.210
Anyways, our zero-waste
journey started back in 2006.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.700
We were living back then in a
large home, 3,000 square feet

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.410
in the suburbs in the East
Bay actually in Pleasant Hill.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.600
But that house was
located in a cul-de-sac.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.910
And the problem with that
is that we felt that we

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.170
had to drive everywhere.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.120
We had to take the car
to go to the grocery

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.240
store, the schools, church,
and movie theaters, and so on.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.590
So we decided that we wanted
to relocate to a location

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.820
where we could have these
things within walking distance

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.960
or biking distance.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.540
So we chose the
town of Mill Valley.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.860
But before finding
the ideal home,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.630
we rented an
apartment for a year.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.870
And we only moved in
with the necessities.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.370
So instead of moving in with
fork tables and 26 chairs,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.420
we only moved in with one table,
four chairs, one set of dishes,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.360
one set of towels, et cetera.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.130
And what we found
during that year

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.010
is that by living with
less, all of a sudden,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.850
we had more time in our hands
to do the things that we enjoy

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.680
doing, more time to spend with
family and friends, more time

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.170
to explore a new
coast or region.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.780
So when we did find the ideal
home in downtown Mill Valley,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.440
we got everything
out of storage.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.050
And we realized that a
lot of the things that we

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.070
had kept in there for a year
are totally gone and missed.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.910
We realized that there were
a bunch of things in there

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.980
that we hadn't even
needed or even missed.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.600
And so we got everything
out of storage

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.490
and questioned ourselves
about all the stuff

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.410
we had, and we let go of
about 80% of our belongings.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.300
And then thanks to that
voluntary simplicity,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.140
that also opened more
time to educate ourselves

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.700
on environmental issues.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.020
So this was back in 2007.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.010
We read some books.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.510
We watched some documentaries.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.180
And what we discovered
with my husband really

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.670
made us sad thinking
about the future

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.260
that we are going to
leave behind for our kids.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.450
So we decided to do
something about it.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.500
So my husband quit his job
to start a sustainability

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.090
consulting company.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.620
And I tackled the home.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.220
So I got super
motivated at first.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.430
And there is lots of
things that I tried.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.560
I googled a lot of alternatives.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.590
And some of the things
that we discovered we still

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.370
do today such as canning.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.195
This is actually canning season.

00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:30.400
I have how-to's on my blog.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.220
So on Saturday, I'll be
buying a bunch of flats--

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.830
I mean a flat of tomatoes.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.750
And then I'll be
canning it for the year.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.640
It's not like I can all
year long, or all day.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.880
I just can once a year
for the rest of the year.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.650
But anyways, some other
alternatives that we tried

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.300
did not quite work out for us.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.860
So I had heard about
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.780
option of shampooing your hair.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.740
And so I thought, oh
maybe that will be

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.470
a good alternative to shampoo.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.180
And so what that
involves is using

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.280
baking soda in lieu of shampoo.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.010
You're supposed
to wet your hair,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.370
sprinkle baking soda on your
scalp, you massage it in,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.560
and then you rinse with
apple cider vinegar.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.075
Now after six months,
the oils of my hair

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:20.400
had migrated down to here, and
I ended up with frizzy ends.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.710
Not really the look
I was looking for.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.990
And when I went to lay
down next to my husband

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.680
after those six months, he
looked at me and he said,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.530
I am just so tired of you
smelling like vinaigrette, Bea.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.670
It's really not sexy.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.650
So I thought, yeah, maybe
he has a point there.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.850
I need to find
another alternative.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.610
And I did.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.670
It's not shampoo.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.860
I'll mention it later.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.120
But I picked
another alternative.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.430
I also came to look at my
cosmetic pouch at one point.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.375
And I wanted a greener
alternative, or at least

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:59.600
a zero-waste alternative for all
the items that I had in there.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.170
So I took my cosmetic
pouch to a green pharmacy.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.290
And I asked the sales
person to give me

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.290
an alternative or a product for
all the things I had in there.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.570
She said, I have
a mascara for you.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.620
I have different types
of makeup for you.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.220
But I don't have an
alternative for a lip plumper.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.490
So for the guys that are
here that don't know what

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.320
a lip plumper is,
it's a glass that

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.100
has an ingredient in
it that's supposed

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.482
to make your lips bigger.

00:06:30.482 --> 00:06:31.440
Doesn't make it bigger.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.940
I've actually taken a ruler and
measured the before and after.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.070
It doesn't really
make them bigger,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.020
but it makes you feel
like they are bigger.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.900
So since she didn't have an
alternative for me, of course,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.560
I googled it.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.210
Alternative to or green way
to make your lips bigger.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.440
And I found this video
of this beautiful woman

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.090
on YouTube, a woman that had
lips a bit like Angelina Jolie,

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.490
like really nice
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.698
And I thought, well, perfect.

00:07:02.698 --> 00:07:04.150
That's what I need.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.890
And she said, it's very simple.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.050
All you need to do is
gather some stinging nettle,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.850
you remove the leaves, and then
you roll the twig on your lips.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.200
And I thought, uh,
how simple that is.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.810
I have a bunch of stinging
nettle in my backyard.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.600
So I put on some gloves,
and I hiked up my hill

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.770
because we're on a hill.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.810
And I grabbed a bunch of
stinging nettle, brought it

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.890
back down to my kitchen, I
removed the leaves carefully,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.460
and then I rolled
the twig on my lips.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.730
OMG, did it hurt!

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.450
Of course, it did
not at all provide

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.020
the results I was expecting.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.000
And not like the video, I ended
up with blotches, red bumps all

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.880
over the place.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.040
Not very sexy, or not
very much the look

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.634
I was looking for again.

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:52.050
And of course, that's when my
husband came home from work.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.410
And he looked at me,
and said, oh my gosh.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.252
What did you do again, Bea?

00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:58.850
And I said, eh, just
trying out something.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.120
Don't worry about it.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.200
We also came to question
our use for toilet paper.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.450
So at that point I was
taking a foraging class.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.990
And once we were in the forest.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.420
And my teacher said,
well, if you guys are ever

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.470
stuck in the woods with
no toilet paper, that

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.140
moss out there is awesome.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.770
I thought there Is my
alternative to toilet paper.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.010
So I grabbed some and took
it home, but-- but moss, FYI,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.470
it dries over time.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.250
So the first day
it might be soft,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.490
but the next day,
you're basically

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.690
left with a scouring pad.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.799
Not very pleasant.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.780
So we decided to
forego that idea.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.730
And instead, we decided
to stick to toilet paper.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.500
It's 100% recycled.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.670
We buy it from a restaurants
and hotel supply store

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.620
because we can buy
it wrapped in paper.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.320
We don't have to worry
about the plastic packaging.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.990
So after all this trial and
error, we found balance.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.260
And we found that for
zero-waste to be truly

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.530
sustainable in our
home, we simply

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.150
had to follow five
rules in order.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:14.230
It was all of it simply about
refusing, reducing, reusing,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.760
recycling, and
rotting in order so

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.100
that at the end of
the year-- sorry

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.710
I disappeared there-- we're
left with one jar of waste.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.890
So this basically represents
our family's waste for the year.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.070
This one is 2014.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.200
So the first rule then that
we apply is we simply refuse.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.300
We simply say no to the
things that we do not need.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.840
We say no to
single-use plastics--

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.840
plastic bags, water bottles.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.540
But we also say no to freebies.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.980
For today, in this
consumerist society,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.600
we're the target of
many marketing goods.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.380
But every time we
accept them, it's

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.150
a way for us to reinforce
an unsustainable practice.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.009
Every time we take a free
plastic pen from a conference

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:03.550
that we do not need--
because I think

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.950
everyone has enough
pens in their homes

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.590
to last them a
lifetime-- every time

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.630
we accept one of
those pens, then

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.460
more oil will be
drilled from the ground

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.190
to create a replacement.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.970
Same goes with junk
mail, every time

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.490
we take junk mail
straight from the mailbox

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.650
and put it in a recycling
bin, it's a way for us to say,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.730
love junk mail.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.930
Please send me more.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.730
And more will be sent out to us.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.030
So it's important to
say no to these things

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.540
to simply stop the demand.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.410
We also say no to
business cards.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.610
So don't try to give me
your business card later.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:42.480
I'll have my contact info at
the end of the presentation.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.600
Our second rule is to reduce.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.275
So I'm sorry the
slide is so light.

00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:49.160
So we reduce what we do need.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.600
So that means for us living
a minimalist lifestyle.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.100
So in our kitchen, for
example, as you can see

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.122
the counters are pretty bare.

00:10:58.122 --> 00:10:59.080
But I love it that way.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.100
It's actually much easier to
clean-- much faster to clean.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.690
I used to have next to my stove
a jar filled with accessories

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.250
and different types of spoons
until I realized that I only

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.750
have two hands.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.250
I only use one spoon at a time.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.960
I don't need the 10
of the same spoon.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:25.030
So today I've downsized to the
true accessories that I need.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.330
Same goes for
underneath my sink.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.120
Underneath my sink
in the old days

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.310
was filled with products--
toxic products-- products

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.610
that the marketers
told me I needed

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.120
for different applications.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.934
They tell us that to clean
the floor we need a product,

00:11:38.934 --> 00:11:41.600
to clean a window is a different
product, to clean your bathroom

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.840
a different product, the
kitchen a different product.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.170
This is all BS.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.000
I found that we can clean
the whole house simply

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.490
with a spray mixed
with water and vinegar.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.210
And we use castile soap also
that we purchase in bulk.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.350
In a pump at the sink, we
use it to wash our hands,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.440
wash dishes, wash the
dog, wash the floor.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.180
This is our bedroom.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.790
Even if it's a total
whiteout for you,

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.480
we still don't have
much in the bedroom.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.610
And we just have what we need
in order to sleep in the room.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.440
And this is our closet.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.830
So my husband and
I share a closet.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.130
This is not the walk-in
closets that you

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.450
see in movies or
in glossy magazines

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.520
because it's not really
a walk-in closet.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.330
It's more of a scoot-in
closet because it's so tiny.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:35.050
But my husband has the top rail.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.340
And I have the bottom one.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.660
And then he has
one set of shelves.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.220
I have the other.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.780
When we decluttered
our lives, we

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.020
came to choose
[INAUDIBLE] items that

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.780
were the most versatile,
the most multi-functional.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.110
And in my case, I ended
up picking a wardrobe

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.960
that I can dress up or
down for different events

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.130
and throughout the seasons.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.070
Well, likely to
live in California,

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.910
it's much easier
for us to do that.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.280
So in my case, I have one pair
of shorts, two skirts-- that's

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.110
one of them.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.890
By the way, in drought
season, wearing leather

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.550
is awesome because you obviously
don't throw that in a wash.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.210
You just wipe it off.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.350
Saves water.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.310
I have two dresses, seven
shirts, three sweaters,

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.720
five pairs of shoes.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.520
Actually, talking about
the shoes, at one point,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.450
I looked at my
tennis shoe, and I

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.330
realized that they
were gathering

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.800
dust more than anything.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.620
All my activities, my
more sporting activities,

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.070
do not really require
the use of tennis shoes.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.270
So instead, I have
a bootie that I

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.900
can wear when I go hiking,
backpacking, biking.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.100
I don't need a pair
of tennis shoes.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.140
This is a little experiment
that I did for my blog.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.470
I wanted to show that this
one little black dress that I

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.330
purchased for $2 at
a secondhand store--

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.010
because we buy all our wardrobes
from a secondhand store--

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.780
can create lots
of different looks

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.330
based on how I accessorize it,
whether I dress it up or down,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:15.540
and wear it under something
or on top of something.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.250
My kids are also, of
course, minimalists.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.330
This is Leo's bedroom.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.880
And his closet is
as bare as ours.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.170
As you'll notice, he
doesn't have much clothes.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.300
But all our clothes
actually fit in carry-ons.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.680
So what's great about that
is when we want to go away

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.090
for a weekend, or a week, or
a month, all we have to do

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.750
is pull our wardrobes
in our carry-ons.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.570
We zip them.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.620
We're out the door.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.950
Then we have a service that
comes, cleans the house.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.400
And then the renters come
and pay for our vacations.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.280
So this is one of those
ideas that my husband

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.830
had four years ago.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.570
He only has two good ideas
a year, and I have to say,

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:59.910
this one blew my mind.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.930
My kids today don't really have
toys because they're teenagers.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.680
But when they did have
toys, we encouraged them

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.600
to pick their favorite items.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.160
And then once they
became older, they

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.440
were able to sell
them to purchase more

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.340
age-appropriate replacements.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.070
So this is our bathroom.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.380
As you can see it's
also very minimalist.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.300
And what you see on
the right is basically

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.650
the contents of the
medicine cabinet

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.880
that you see on the left.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.670
So there again,
when we decluttered,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.950
we realized what
our essentials were.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.750
So just to give you some
examples on what I've done,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.900
for example, for
cosmetics, on my skin,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.790
the only thing
that I actually buy

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:54.290
manufactured is a tinted
moisturizer with an SPF in it.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:16:00.110
Otherwise, to hydrate my skin,
I buy cooking oil in bulk.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.710
The black that
you see on my eyes

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.170
is, actually, almonds
that I have burnt

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.290
and to which I have added
a little bit of oil.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:11.180
My mascara is made of four
ingredients, same ingredients

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.680
that you can actually
eat, that I've purchased

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.050
in bulk from the bulk isles.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.900
And actually, I should
say, the mascara

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.790
is the recipe I'm actually
the most proud of in my book.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.800
It took a lot of trial
and error to find

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.380
just the right concoction.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.030
I went out to dinner
once with my girlfriends.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.100
I was trying or
testing out a recipe

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.790
only to find out once I got home
that I had black down to here.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.986
You'd think my girlfriends
would tell me, no.

00:16:38.986 --> 00:16:42.390
Yeah, I've wiped them out since
then-- no, I'm just kidding.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.250
On my cheeks, to add
color to my cheeks

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.040
and my eyebrows, and
sometimes [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.710
I use a cocoa powder.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.500
It's an organic cocoa powder.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.610
And just to fill that little
jar, it cost me $0.72.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.650
There is no way I can find an
organic bronzer at the store

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.210
if I were to buy
it manufactured.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:10.020
And then to smooth out my
hair, to add a little shine

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.920
on my lips, or maybe
highlight my cheeks,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.400
or even add shine on my nails,
I make a multi-purpose balm,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.400
which are simply two
ingredients-- beeswax

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.550
and cooking oil.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.364
All the recipes are
in my book, again,

00:17:24.364 --> 00:17:26.530
so if you guys are interested
in these alternatives,

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.723
check it out.

00:17:27.723 --> 00:17:32.230
The deodorant, we use a crystal.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:38.270
As a hair spray, we
reduce lemon peels

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.250
with a little bit of
water, and it's magic.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.770
It works.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.310
It actually makes
your hair stick.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.990
I don't use it.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.850
My husband does to make his
little hair spiky in the front.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.670
To shave, he uses a
double-edged razor.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.560
It's actually a vintage
razor that you can

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.990
purchase, for example, on eBay.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.020
And then to wash
ourselves from head

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.100
to toe-- so to wash our
hair, our face, or body,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.670
and also to shave,
we use a bar of soap

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.460
that we buy unpackaged, loose,
from the health food store.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.280
Then to brush our teeth,
we use baking soda

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.410
that we buy loose
from the bulk bins.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:19.310
And then to brush, we use a
compostable wooden toothbrush

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.410
made out of bamboo.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.740
And this is what
we do for floss.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.440
So what we use is simply a
little piece of organic silk.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.260
Two strands work better.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.140
So we take them, we twist them,
and then we use it for floss.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.120
And then we can compost it.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.530
This is our linen closet.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.880
So you'll tell me, well, great.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.266
But where are the linens?

00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:43.910
Well, linens are, actually,
once we wash them,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.100
we put them back on the bed.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.380
So we only have one set of
linens for each one of us.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.870
In the bathroom, we always
have four towels that are hung.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.000
And then we always have
four extras in case

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.470
we go to the beach, to the
pool, or have friends over.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.550
So before basically launching
the zero-waste movement

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.740
and spending my time preaching
the zero-waste lifestyle,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.070
I was actually an artist.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.880
And my previous
studio was filled

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.100
with art materials--
canvases and frames

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.391
and different types of media.

00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:21.210
And here I realized
that, well, it's

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.150
not the materials
that make the artist.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.560
It's rather with the
creativity that the artist

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.640
has in their head
that makes the artist.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.450
So I let go, and I donated
basically all my supplies.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.970
And I also came to realize
that after all my compost

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:44.510
bin and my recycling bin are
themselves sources of material.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.320
So the only food that
we purchase in packaging

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320
is butter.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.220
So when I came to look
one day at my compost bin,

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.710
I realized that the
butter wrappers, which

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.220
we buy-- the
wrappers that we pick

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.540
are the ones that are
made out of the wax paper

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.680
because it's compostable.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.990
I decided to make a peace
with these wrappers.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.220
So I collected them
for four years.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.590
Then I made a lotus
flowers, origami style.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.160
And then I applied
them to a canvas.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.250
So this basically represents
four years of our family's

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.630
butter consumption.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.780
Now I know the math
people in the room

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.830
are good doing this
times this equals.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.350
Well, if someone had
asked me how much butter

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.220
do you think you
consume in four years,

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.940
I would have guessed
100, maybe 200

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.940
to top-- 575 butter wrappers.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.200
OK, I'm French, and I
use butter for cooking.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.390
But I also use olive oil.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.870
I had no idea how much we
were actually consuming.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.410
The thing is, when
we throw things away,

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.110
or even when we
compost or recycle,

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.280
we're completely disconnected
with how much we're

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.550
truly consuming.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.560
Once you start collecting
it for a while,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.480
then you're much more
aware of your consumption.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.880
So this to me blew my mind.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.250
This is our garage.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.360
Yet you don't see much in it
because there isn't much in it.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.280
I find that in
garages the items--

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.950
a garage tends to collect the
items that are in transit.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.860
The items that we
want to return,

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.490
the items that we keep for
a what-if-- what if we move?

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.700
What if our kids move?

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.210
What if our kids need this?

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.902
What if they want it later?

00:21:25.902 --> 00:21:27.360
I know I love the
looks over there.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.120
You guys are great.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.000
Yeah, I know what she means.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.200
And what we've done
is basically make

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.120
a decision on all of
these items in transit.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.410
And so today, our garage,
it makes it much easier

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.430
for us to grab our bikes and go.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.090
After all, that
was the reason why

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.500
we moved to the
downtown of Mill Valley,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.260
so we could have
access to our bikes,

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.586
so we could bike to
things and walk to things.

00:21:53.586 --> 00:21:55.120
The third rule is to reuse.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.430
So in our home,
reusing means swapping

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.930
anything that's disposable
for a reusable alternative.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.890
So today we no longer
buy boxes of tissues.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.690
We have a glass jar
filled with cloth ones.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.860
I have one right
here-- just remembered.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.980
We've also been able to
eliminate the sponge simply

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:21.830
with a wooden scrubby, a
metal scrubby, and rags.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.540
Once the wooden scrubby
is no longer usable--

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.849
and we usually use them
for about two years.

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:29.890
The metal scrubby, I think
we've had the same one

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.160
for three years now.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.710
And then with rags, you
simply can reuse those things

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.160
over time, and you don't
need to use sponges.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.160
We've also been
able to eliminate

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.050
aluminum foil, plastic wrap,
freezer bags, sandwich baggies,

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.230
et cetera-- all those food
kind of storage items simply

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.140
with glass jars.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.720
And when my kids
go to school, they

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.870
don't need any
fancy lunch gizmo.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.780
What they do is they wrap
their lunch, furoshiki-style.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.380
Furoshiki is the Japanese
art of wrapping in cloth.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.900
And what's great about
doing it this way

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.015
is that then the towel
becomes your place mat.

00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:13.900
It becomes your napkin.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.050
But also you use
it for transport.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.980
And everyone has
a towel at home.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.330
Everyone can wrap their lunch.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:25.200
When we have parties of
50 people at our house--

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.690
or I should say, more
than 10 people because we

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.460
can sit 10 at our table.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:34.370
But if we have more than 10,
then we'll make finger foods.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.150
We don't have a lot
of stuff at our house.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.820
But what we do have
a lot of is glasses

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.400
so that if we do have 50
people coming to our house,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.010
we don't need to
resort to disposables.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:51.820
We use a turkey lacers in lieu
of toothpicks for the buffet

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.070
style food that
I put out, and we

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.920
have a stack of cloth napkins.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.420
So if you are going
to have a party of 50

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.950
people at your
house and you plan

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:06.590
on serving or having paper
napkins, you better at least

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.600
have 200 paper napkins
because people don't really

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.590
respect the paper napkin.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.750
They'll be using at
least two, maybe three.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.820
I have found that people respect
the cloth way more than they

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.160
do the paper napkin.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.040
I only have 32 napkins.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.380
When I have 50
people at my house,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.340
I only need the 32 napkins.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.320
I actually found that only half
the people will use napkins.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.780
So for 50 people, 25
napkins is actually enough.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.860
So replacing anything disposable
for a reusable alternative

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.070
also means shopping
with reusables.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.480
So this is the shopping kit that
I take with me to the grocery

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.660
store.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:53.340
It's comprised of cloth bags
to buy dry goods, mesh bags

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.760
to buy produce, glass
jars to buy anything

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.880
that sweats, such as
meat, fish, deli cheese,

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.345
grated cheese that I
buy at the counter.

00:25:05.345 --> 00:25:09.100
I have a pillow
case to buy bread.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:16.020
And I buy a brand of milk that
sells in a glass container

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.870
that you can return
to the store.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.730
And then we can get
our egg box refilled

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.670
at the farmer's market.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:28.610
So here I am shopping the
bulk foods, the bulk bins.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.240
And then once I am home,
then I transfer the dry goods

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.750
into glass container.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:42.030
So this is what a zero-waste
pantry looks like.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.059
As you can see, there
is no packaging there.

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:45.100
It was great to bag that.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.520
I personally find that
it's so much prettier

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.750
than a pantry filled
with packaging

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.130
because you can
actually see the food.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.670
What my pantry transpires
is not someone's idea

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:01.060
of marketing, of what color
should be in someone's pantry.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.810
It's rather the food
themselves shine through.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.290
We also purchase
liquids in bulk.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.633
I make my own red wine vinegar.

00:26:11.633 --> 00:26:15.550
But the only problem with that
is that you need red wine,

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.570
and at our house,
there isn't much left.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.330
This is our refrigerator.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.870
So we actually have
refrigerator drawers.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:28.450
We don't have a refrigerator
armoire like the usual kind.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.590
And we found it's actually
a great, smart design

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.260
to eliminate food waste.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.820
I can proudly say
there is no food that's

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.270
being wasted at our house.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.340
Because we store all our
food in glass containers,

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.720
we can see through it.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.850
Because we have refrigerator
drawers, we can see on top.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.970
Nothing gets lost in
the back of a shelf.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.520
And we make use of what we have.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.760
So before I go to the grocery
store, I'll make a list.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.380
I'll make sure to only buy
the things that I need.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.950
I'm not buying carrots if
I already have carrots.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.720
I'll make sure that I finish
them before I buy more.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.850
We also buy beer in a growler
from the local Brewery Company.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.770
My local health foods store also
has a orange squeezing machine.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:20.660
So I just bring an old glass
milk bottle to refill it.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.930
And then the bottom picture
over there is my freezer.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:27.880
So once I bring 10 baguettes
home from the grocery store,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.507
then I cut them in half.

00:27:29.507 --> 00:27:31.340
If I don't need half
of them because they're

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.220
so good and warm.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.850
And then I put
them in the freezer

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.780
in another pillow case--
no plastic needed.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.180
And then we freeze some of
our food in glass containers.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.460
You just have to make sure
that it's room temperature

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.930
before you put it in.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.980
But the large glass
jars that you see,

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.700
one actually contains meat
bones, another one fish bones,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.450
which we'll then
use to make stock.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.100
And then once we've made
stock, then we can compost it.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.300
Then we have one
for bread slices

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:06.320
that have become
whitened by the freezing.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.170
It's basically the
freezer burn on bread.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:11.970
Once the jar is
filled with bread,

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.700
then we use it to make croutons,
or we make bread pudding.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.640
We also use it for bread crumbs.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.700
And we also freeze our candles
because candles last longer

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.030
if you freeze them.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.850
We also purchase our wining box.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:33.160
So we have a big stock
of lemonade bottles.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.690
What's great about them is
that then when we get our wine

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:40.400
refilled, we don't need to
have to recourse to corking.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.880
And you can do that in the city
at Tank18, or in Half Moon Bay,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.450
there is also La Nebbia that
will refill your bottles.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.770
They do that through
bottling events.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:55.310
So for us, reusing not only
means swapping anything

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.370
disposable for a
reusable alternative,

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.360
it also means buying
second hand when

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.070
we do need to buy something.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.830
So like I mentioned earlier,
we buy all our clothes

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.200
in second hand from
the thrift store.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.080
But for certain items that
we cannot find in the thrift

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.350
store, then we fall back
either on the free market--

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.260
that's where these
patio chairs came from.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.410
Or we fall back on Craigslist.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.030
That's where the
table came from.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.390
Or eBay.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.940
And speaking of eBay, it's been
great to find the really hard

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.890
to find items.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.710
So at the beginning of the
school year when the math

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.380
teacher requested the
scientific calculator,

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.940
I fell back on eBay.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.430
When I go on eBay, I make
sure to pick the option

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.660
on the left-hand side
that says second hand

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.710
or used or pre-owned sometimes.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:49.072
Somehow, I think the wording
changes, or maybe it's me.

00:29:49.072 --> 00:29:52.500
And then once [INAUDIBLE]
see all the items

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.820
that are second hand.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.500
And then once I've
purchased something,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.670
then I request that
the seller only

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.080
sends it to me in
cardboard or paper

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.105
because plastic wrap
would not fit in my jar.

00:30:06.105 --> 00:30:10.110
So the fourth rule
is to recycle.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.280
So once you've refused, reduced,
and reused as much as you can,

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.470
then you have very
little to recycle.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.550
This is our chihuahua
next to the bin

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.090
that we fill once a week.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.600
So today, thanks to our
zero-waste lifestyle,

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.200
we actually recycle way
less than we did before.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.520
For us the zero-waste lifestyle
is not about recycling more.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.470
It's about recycling less,
thanks to prevention.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.350
So as you saw earlier,
we have a chihuahua

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.090
so our bin is about this big.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.490
We tried to do zero
recycling at one point,

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.600
and we found that it
was way too constraining

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.970
because we had to say no
to the bottles of wine

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.330
that friends were bringing over.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.790
And that's where I thought
I had gone way too far.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.250
And I had to make paper from the
school papers that were coming

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.530
in from the kids' schools.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.190
It works out a little.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.770
In the summer, the paper dries.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.890
But in the winter-- not
only is it time consuming,

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:10.680
but also in the winter,
paper doesn't dry so well.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.882
So we also have assigned bins
for how to recycle items.

00:31:14.882 --> 00:31:16.590
I don't know if you
can see what this is,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.740
but this is a bin in which
we put all tennis shoes

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.590
or sneakers that
have a hole in them.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.470
Especially my kids have two
pairs of shoes-- flip-flops

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:27.640
and a pair of sneakers.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.050
But when they get a
hole in their sneaker,

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.430
we throw it in the bin.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.410
Once the bin is
full, then we take it

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.870
to a shoe store that
participates in the Nike

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.450
reuse a shoe program.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:43.050
And Nike then turns them
into basketball courts.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:47.800
There is also a company called--
I think it's Eco or Ico.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.770
I need to ask them how to
pronounce their company.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.650
But its I colon CO.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:58.680
And they have drop-off locations
that are really easy to find.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.060
They're in lots of
different malls.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.610
What we found with
this lifestyle is

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.610
that we should avoid
plastics at all cost

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:10.030
because not only are they toxic
to our health when we use them,

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.170
they're also toxic in
their manufacturing.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:20.080
So instead of plastic, we prefer
to use-- when we buy an item,

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.320
we pick metal because it's
recyclable over and over again.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.450
And glass, same thing.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.080
Cardboard and paper is
recyclable up to eight times.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.230
And then sometimes,
we fall back on wood,

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.160
such as the wooden toothbrushes
that I showed earlier

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.340
because then we're
able to compost it.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:46.140
So composting for us is the
last straw before the landfill.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.840
So we compost the rest.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.000
So for us composting
has been easy

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.840
simply because-- this
used to be our trash can.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.850
And it's underneath the counter.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.666
It's out of sight but not
out of mind because when

00:33:01.666 --> 00:33:03.290
we have something we
simply [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.360
choices, recycling or compost.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.830
If our friends
have a bubble gum,

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.030
we tell them to just swallow it.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.340
No we don't.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.480
That's why I have
a couple in there.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.670
But we compost not just
fruits and veggies peelings.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:23.390
As a matter of fact, when we
went through a decluttering

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.340
process in the kitchen, I came
to look at my vegetable peeler.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.370
And I realized that
I don't really--

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.500
I do use my vegetable peeler,
but my mom doesn't have one.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.110
My mom doesn't
use one, so then I

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.230
thought I probably
don't need one.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.800
And I have found that by
donating my vegetable peeler,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.970
it's had actually a great impact
on how much compost I produce.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.560
I compost way less
than I did before.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.300
Because when you have
a vegetable peeler,

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:54.270
the vegetable peeler encourages
you to peel more than you need.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.780
When you don't
have a peeler, you

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.220
think twice about
peeling anything

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.880
because it's more manual labor.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.150
And what's great is
that then today we're

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.290
composting way less
than we did before,

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.860
but we're also ingesting
all the vitamins

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.040
that are enclosed in the
fruit and vegetable peels.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.989
We also compost-- well, you can
see a butter wrapper in there.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:18.239
But we also compost the dog
nails, the floor sweepings,

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.469
hair.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.310
I kept my husband's and my kids'
hair so that will go in there.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.570
I don't compost my hair.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.280
I let it grow down to here.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.620
And then once it's long
enough, I get it cut.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.040
So I went, I think
four months ago.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.880
And then I send the hair
to an organization that

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.870
makes wigs for cancer patients.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.440
So I actually recycle my hair.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.900
It's the fourth rule, right?

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.659
Comes before compost.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.520
Not too long ago, had I heard
about a zero-waste family,

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.040
I would have
thought, oh my gosh.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.630
These people must
live in the woods.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.520
I'm sure they are major
granola, crunchy people.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.400
Or she's a stay-at-home
mom that doesn't

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.180
have anything else to do
but worry about her waste.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.870
And I'm sure she spends
her days homemaking.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.660
Well, that's not me.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.240
I actually am a
full-time professional.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.850
And we found that the zero-waste
lifestyle is actually not

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.310
just good for the
environment, but it's also

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.780
been great for our health.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.670
Because thanks to
the alternatives

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.550
that we have adopted, we've
been able to eliminate

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.440
all the toxic products
from our lives.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.900
Like I mentioned earlier, all
the things I use for as far

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.330
as cosmetics are things that
are made from ingredients

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.440
that I can eat.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.610
All of my cleaning
products are--

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.290
I mean it's basically vinegar,
water, maybe a little bit

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.510
of baking soda, castile soap.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.960
I can totally trust
these products.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:49.460
And so thanks to them, I've
eliminated toxics from my life.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.460
We found also that this
lifestyle saves a lot of money.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.000
When I embarked on this
journey, my husband

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.020
was a little worried.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.360
He said, you know, I'm
starting this startup

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.840
in the midst of the recession.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.970
We cannot afford to be going
to the health food store

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:05.760
and the farmer's market.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.660
And so I encouraged them to
compare our bank statements

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.940
between our zero-waste
lifestyle and

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.880
our pre-zero-waste lifestyle.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.780
And he found that we were saving
40% on our overall spending.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.730
This is due to the fact
that, one, we consume way,

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.790
way less than we did before.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.070
Today, we're no longer adding
things to our inventory.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.250
We're only replacing what
needs to be replaced.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:34.680
A sneaker has a hole in it or
a t-shirt that is too small.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.690
And when we buy
the replacement, we

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:40.530
buy it second-hand which
by definition is cheaper.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.880
Then we buy our food in bulk.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.460
One needs to know that when
you buy food in packaging,

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.340
15% of the price covers
the cost of the packaging.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.160
So when you buy in bulk, you
make an automatic 15% saving.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.330
And finally, we've
replaced anything

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.230
that's disposable in our house
for a reusable alternative.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.980
So that means that we're no
longer investing our money

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.470
in things that you throw away.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.130
We're no longer investing
our money in the landfill.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.300
We're no longer basically
throwing our money

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.350
out the window.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.080
We've invested our
money in things

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.300
that we can use over
time, reuse over time.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.830
And this has translated in
huge cumulative savings.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.490
Actually, those
savings have even

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.030
allowed us to install
solar on our home

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.730
which then saves us even more.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:30.430
The zero-waste lifestyle is
a gift that keeps on giving.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.820
But to me, the best
advantage of this lifestyle

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.180
is the fact that it's turned
our life from a life that

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.550
was based on things
to a life that

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.550
is now based on experiences.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.120
Thanks to this
lifestyle, we've been

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.580
able to have time to do
some super cool stuff

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.270
like jackhammering
my patio, going

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.190
[INAUDIBLE] picking for
coastal cleanup which

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.060
is coming up guys.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.530
It's next week-- or actually
at the end of the week.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:56.210
No seriously.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.090
We've been able to
do things as a family

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.480
that we never thought possible.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.970
Just in the last
year alone, we've

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:05.280
been able to go canoeing in
the Everglades, that was right

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.380
before my son found himself
face to face with a Python.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.360
We rode our bikes from
San Francisco to LA.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.040
We've gone ice climbing.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.610
This is one of my
favorite pictures.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.370
But actually my favorite
picture might be this one.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.950
Did you know how hard it is to
get a smile on your teenager's

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.420
face.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.830
To me, this represents
the zero-waste lifestyle.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.030
This is it.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.440
The zero-waste lifestyle
is about living more.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.200
It's about enjoying life.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.550
It's a lifestyle based on
experiences instead of things.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.760
Gives me goosebumps
every time I say that.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.130
Now I'm not here to tell you
guys how to live your life.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:48.470
I'm only here to
share how I live mine.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.880
But if you were interested
in living this lifestyle,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.200
my first tip would be to
follow the five R's in order.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.660
So refuse what you do not
need, reduce what you do need.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.780
Reuse by swapping
anything that's disposable

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.190
for a reusable alternative and
buying second hand when you do

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.340
need to buy something, recycling
only what you cannot refuse,

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.550
reduce, or reuse.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:15.010
And finally, composting
that is rotting the rest.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.470
Of course, my second tip
would be to read my book.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.980
I am really proud of my work.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.840
I share everything I
know about this lifestyle

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.710
in the book about what to do
during the holidays, what kind

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.880
of gifts to give, what
to do when you travel.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.150
But I would also recommend
that you download my app, Bulk.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.630
I've created this
app to help people

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.530
find bulk locations near them.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.460
Whenever I talk about my
lifestyle throughout the world,

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.539
people tell me, oh, I
can't do zero-waste.

00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:42.330
We don't have bulk.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.270
Yes you do.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.450
You just don't know.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.030
You just have to find it.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.640
And that's why I
created the Bulk app.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.890
The app is populated by
the zero-waste community.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.161
So if you guys do know
of bulk locations that

00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:56.535
are not in the app, please
share them with the community.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.360
If you take one thing away
from this talk today--

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.800
so maybe this
should be the top--

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.440
but it's that buying is voting.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.794
If you're not happy with
the product that you buy,

00:40:11.794 --> 00:40:13.460
if you feel that you
don't have a choice

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.340
and you're forced into
buying something, speak up.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.340
Say something.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.450
Send the packaging back
to the manufacturer.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.840
Propose alternatives.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.120
Because if you don't say
anything, nothing will change.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.500
It's super important that
you let your voice be heard.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.740
Back in 2010, I had
right in my jar,

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.790
right in the front,
an insurance card.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.900
Every six months, my
insurance company,

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.260
which is the largest in the US,
would send me a laminated card.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.390
I got tired of it.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:43.440
I said, you know-- I
sent it back to them

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.800
with a little note.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.900
I always send a
little note saying,

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.410
it'd be great if you guys
switched your card from being

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.160
laminated to a cardboard card.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.440
I mean you can have a
thicker cardboard of card,

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.400
and at least the card
would then be recyclable.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.000
And they did.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.110
They changed it.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.160
And they changed it for all
subscribers throughout the US.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.430
I am super happy about that.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.270
I've actually asked people when
I give talks around the US,

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.770
do you guys have that insurance?

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:10.610
They're like, yep.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.818
Do you have a cardboard card?

00:41:11.818 --> 00:41:12.460
Yep.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.253
That's right.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.230
Of course, if you're
interested in this lifestyle,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.320
I urge you to join the
zero-waste community.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.340
I got to say that, the
little au pair that I

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.810
was at the age of 18
that came to the US

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.150
would have never ever
envisioned launching

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:36.770
a movement to the
thousands of people

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.250
involved in this lifestyle.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:43.150
Every week I receive an
email from an entrepreneur

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.140
in like Australia, in
Switzerland, in Belgium,

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.730
in Quebec telling me, thank
you so much for sharing

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.750
your lifestyle.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.650
You've inspired me
to change my ways,

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.150
but you've also inspired me
to open a zero-waste store

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:59.330
or start a new
zero-waste business.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.380
And this is where
you get my info,

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.840
and we don't need to
exchange business cards.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.780
Thank you.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:12.227 --> 00:42:13.560
MALE SPEAKER: We have some time.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.860
Does anyone have any
questions for Bea?

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.860
AUDIENCE: I noticed
that you've managed

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.840
to get rid of your junk mail.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.040
So I've tried to get
rid of my junk mail.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.049
I pick up every single thing.

00:42:25.049 --> 00:42:25.840
I look on the back.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.640
I'm like, where is
the unsubscribe.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.130
If there is no unsubscribe,
I pick a random email address

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.810
from the company
and try to write

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:37.920
them an angry letter saying,
stop sending me the dead trees.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.200
But this only gets me so far.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.170
And I don't understand.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.050
I've joined all of these
do-not-mail-me lists

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.960
and still--

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.300
BEA JOHNSON: You're
talking about paper mail.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:46.820
Right?

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.290
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:47.680
Paper mail.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.490
BEA JOHNSON: So I give
all the steps in the book

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.320
on how to do that.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.460
I can probably say I don't
get junk mail anyway.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.080
I should say, the
last piece I got,

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.360
surprisingly, came
from Zero Waste Marin.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.200
That's ironic.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:01.700
Isn't it?

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.690
It drove me crazy.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.910
Like, you guys obviously
haven't read my book.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:09.020
But there are steps
that you can take.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.970
I got to say from what I've
seen all around the world.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:15.130
The US is probably the
place where it's the hardest

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.830
to remove your name
from the mailing list

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.230
and to eradicate junk
mail because it's so

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.560
ingrained in capitalism period.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.440
So there are things you can do.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.330
You can even pay a
service to do it for you.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:34.020
There is also, I've been
told, about PaperKarma.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.540
It's an app that,
I guess, you just

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.960
take a picture of
the address label,

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.490
and they'll take your name off.

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.940
But I have found that doing
it by myself was fine.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.360
It was not that
difficult. You first

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:54.836
sign-- you go to
preoptoutscreen.com

00:43:54.836 --> 00:43:55.830
or preoptoutscreen.org.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.121
And then there's the other one.

00:43:57.121 --> 00:43:58.765
It's dmachoice.org
or dmachoice.com.

00:43:58.765 --> 00:43:59.810
I can't remember.

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.580
I always get those mixed up.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.280
But that's the two places
you first need to go.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.460
Take your name off of list.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.380
You basically opt out of
those kinds of mailings.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.400
And then I think the
hardest is really

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.780
to-- you can also go
to catalogchoice.org

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.830
to get your name off
of all the catalogs.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.850
But the hardest one is
simply to-- all the letters

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.190
that are sent straight to you.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.910
Let's say you've donated
money to a charity.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.410
And they are using that to
send you letters every month

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:38.220
or whatever, then you have to
contact the company directly.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.110
And if you're not happy,
then even use social media.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.940
I mean social media has
been great about that.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.260
I mean for me it's been
great to get my name off

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.190
of certain lists.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:52.750
Or just to make them aware
that they are bugging us.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:56.300
AUDIENCE: How do
you keep the wine?

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.650
Doesn't that get aerated?

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.070
BEA JOHNSON: But the thing
is, the one that I buy

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.410
is actually getting
bottled for the first time.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.410
It's not like-- you're thinking
about a bottle of wine that

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.490
was bottled and you've
drank a little bit of it,

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.490
and then you're like, oh,
you have all that air.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.350
But when I bring my
bottle, it's actually

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:18.480
getting bottled for the
first time just as a bottle

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.000
that you would buy
from the grocery store.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.340
There is a little bit of-- I
mean the machine is calibrated

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:31.320
for the 750 ml.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.000
So my bottles are exactly that.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.570
So when it goes
through the machine,

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.510
it fills just what it
needs to be filled.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.130
So you can just keep
it as long as you

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.200
would a normal bottle of wine.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.220
AUDIENCE: OK, so that
container is air tight then.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:44.970
BEA JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.620
So the top, it's a
flip-top cap that

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.970
is kind of like the flip-top
caps they use on beer growlers

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.690
so it doesn't let air escape.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.180
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.700
And so I was looking
at your grocery slide.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.880
And you were talking
about getting

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.210
meat and fish in particular
and working with the jars.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:04.610
Do you encounter any resistance
with the packaging on that,

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:06.060
like people at the meat counter?

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.560
BEA JOHNSON: Yeah,
so the first time

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:11.130
I went to my health food store
with my jar, it takes balls.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.470
I got to say, it takes balls
to go for the first time.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.490
And you almost cannot tell--
whatever they're going to say,

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.470
if they say, no,
sorry, can't do it,

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:22.020
don't take no for an answer.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.280
Because, for example,
there was a health food

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.800
store that I had gone to for--
it was not my main health food

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.530
store, but I would go to
them like once a month

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.280
or so because they had a bulk
conditioner that my health food

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.190
store didn't have.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.190
But when I was there, I would
bring my jar of meat or fish

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:41.710
and have it filled.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.740
It was fine for
like three years.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.619
And then one day, I
go to the counter.

00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:47.410
And the lady behind
the counter, I saw her.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:48.243
I'm like, oh, shoot.

00:46:48.243 --> 00:46:49.890
It's a new one.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.141
She said, no, sorry.

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:51.640
Can't do it.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.990
It's against the health
and safety regulations.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.260
I'm like, are you kidding me?

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.060
You guys have been filling
my jar for three years.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:57.750
No, sorry.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.585
Can't do it.

00:46:58.585 --> 00:47:00.460
I'm like, can you please
go ask your manager?

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.370
Said OK.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.470
She goes asks her manager.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.240
She comes back and
says, OK, I can do it.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.450
She fill it.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.225
I come back a month later.

00:47:07.225 --> 00:47:08.940
The same lady--
I'm like, oh, boy.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.870
There she is again.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.830
I give her my jar.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:11.960
She's like, no, sorry.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.040
It's against the health
and safety regulations.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.462
I'm like, are you kidding me?

00:47:15.462 --> 00:47:16.920
You said the same
thing last month.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.760
You checked with your manager
and was like, no, sorry.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.600
I can't do it.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.595
It's against the regulations.

00:47:21.595 --> 00:47:23.345
I'm like, can you
please ask your manager.

00:47:23.345 --> 00:47:24.265
She's like, OK.

00:47:24.265 --> 00:47:25.640
Asked her manager,
came back, OK.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.100
I can do it.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.675
I mean imagine-- it
was my first time.

00:47:30.675 --> 00:47:32.800
I would have said, oh, no
my store doesn't do that.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.110
Forget it.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:33.910
I'm not doing that.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:34.840
They don't do it.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.190
Yes they do.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.890
They just don't know they can.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.770
So you just have to find someone
that one, will do it, and two,

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.080
knows how.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.530
Because there is
also-- sometimes

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.420
I've gone into stores
where they don't really

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.720
know how to tear the jar.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.260
So let's say, they'll put
a little piece of plastic

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.040
on the scale to weigh
the meat, and then

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.614
they put the meat into the jar.

00:47:54.614 --> 00:47:56.530
If it's their first time,
that's fine with me.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.870
I'm not going to bother them.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.810
They've generated
a piece of plastic.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.980
I'm not taking it home.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.200
It's their problem.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.220
If they didn't know
that on their waste,

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.300
they would realize that they
should learn how to do that.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.130
So I don't let that
take me down and make

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:11.550
me feel bad or anything.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.730
But then over
time, once you know

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.780
which ones know how
to work the tear

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.770
on the scale and the
ones that don't, then

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:19.920
you look for the one that does.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.940
And you ask them to
teach the others.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.910
And so at my store now,
it's really no issue.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.330
I can go any time.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:27.600
They know how to do the job.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.425
They know us, and
everyone is happy.

00:48:30.425 --> 00:48:31.300
AUDIENCE: Great talk.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.310
Thank you.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:32.490
BEA JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.290
AUDIENCE: I have a
question on vacation.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.910
I really like the
vacation slide you showed.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:39.400
I just got back from a
lovely holiday with my folks

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.210
to Florida.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.710
And I noticed Florida's a lot
cleaner in terms of litter.

00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:46.580
But also every time
you stay at a hotel,

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.040
they have the same
breakfast meals

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.540
in this country everywhere.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:53.950
And there's just plastic
containers, you know--

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:54.700
BEA JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.850
AUDIENCE: --the plastic forks,
the plastic, everything.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.851
BEA JOHNSON: They have a lot of
Styrofoam in Florida, I found.

00:48:58.851 --> 00:49:01.350
I mean it's kind of a shock
when you've lived in California,

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.810
and it's been banned, and you
just don't see it anymore.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.080
And then you go to another
State, you're like, gosh.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.740
I mean don't they
realize how bad it is,

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.900
and how bad it is for the
environment and our health.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.690
So in that case, to
me dining is voting,

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.406
just like buying is voting.

00:49:19.406 --> 00:49:21.640
If you're using
those containers,

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.809
then you're saying it's OK
for them to put them out.

00:49:25.809 --> 00:49:27.350
For one thing, if
you don't use them,

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:28.240
you're saying that's not OK.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.250
If you contact the
company, it's even better,

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.470
and you can propose
alternatives.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:38.830
So when we go with our family,
we prefer to go to a cafe.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.190
Or there are some chains
where we simply just show up

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.600
with our cloth bag.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.230
The cloth bags that I
show for grocery shopping,

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.750
we always have one with us.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.250
I don't have one with me today
because I knew I was coming.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.900
I had lunch at
Google, and I was set.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.020
She said, don't worry.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.120
It's all reusables.

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.050
And amen to that.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.985
It's awesome.

00:49:58.985 --> 00:50:02.910
But when I travel, I always
have a cloth bag in my bag.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:05.710
I don't take a whole
[INAUDIBLE] dishes and sets.

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.850
I know some zero-wasters
that do that.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.620
They won't go anywhere without
their plate and their utensils.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.280
And I'm like, you know,
there is a God out there

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.610
that always takes care of me.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:18.230
And I don't take things
for just in case.

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:20.800
There is always, always
a solution, really.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.840
If you really truly
believe in this lifestyle,

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.910
the solutions come to you.

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.720
So yeah, I do take my
cloth bag, but I don't

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.090
take all the dishes and stuff.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:35.290
So the cloth bag
is good for buying

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:39.860
a croissant or whatever dry good
that they want to put in there.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.200
If I am at the
airport-- so a little

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.940
anecdote about the airport.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:49.050
When I'm at the airport,
I found that the easiest

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.120
zero-waste snack is a fruit.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.390
And at the airport, they'll
sell you apple or banana.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:55.070
Those are the only two choices.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.370
But then you are stuck with
either the peel or the core.

00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:59.250
Right?

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.110
Some people say, oh,
you can eat the core.

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:04.860
There is-- well, whatever.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.030
I've done that sometimes.

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.980
I'm not doing that every time
especially because the core has

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.660
cyanide in it.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.180
But anyways, when I'm left with
that, then all I have to do

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.760
is find a live
plant to dig it in.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.750
The problem is in an
airport they don't

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:22.200
have that many live plants.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.896
It's actually really
difficult to find a live plant

00:51:25.896 --> 00:51:26.520
in the airport.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.090
But I know where they are.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:30.770
In each of the airports, I
know where my live plants are.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.440
In San Francisco,
I have my favorite.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.020
And I've seen it
grow over the years.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.490
But anyways, you have to
also reach to your creativity

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:40.460
to find alternatives.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.940
And to me it's almost
become like a game.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.380
So I went-- sorry.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.160
When I get started,
I don't stop.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.650
And I have lots of anecdotes.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:50.800
I went to a green event
a couple of years ago.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.970
And back then I remember I
would bring a glass with me

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:57.560
in case they were
serving in disposables.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.510
And that day, my
girlfriend picked me up.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.730
It was really quick.

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:03.220
I didn't even think about
bringing my own glass.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:07.390
But it was a green event, so I
thought, I'll be taken care of.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.160
It's green.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:13.910
I show up, and it was
6:00 PM, wine time.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:16.420
And they were serving
all the cocktails

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:22.090
in those plastic cone
bio-based compostable cups.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:23.660
And I'm like, I'm
not using that.

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.390
But I looked around
in the room, and I

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:32.340
saw that on tables they had
little vases, like mason jars,

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.060
for their flowers.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.260
I'm like there it is.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.620
So I took someone's used cup,
I took a little mason jar.

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.230
And went to the bathroom,
I did my little dishes,

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:46.260
and I put the flowers
into the used cup.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.300
And I washed the
mason jar, and then I

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.730
went to get my wine that way.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:53.480
Now someone asked me, well,
why didn't you just reuse

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.090
or just washed the
person's used cup.

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:59.280
I'm like, because then I would
have looked like I condone

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.930
that practice, that it's OK
to be serving-- especially

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.380
at a green event, it's OK to be
serving bio-based plastic cups.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:06.880
No.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.970
It's not.

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:10.580
So when I went around
with my glass jar,

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.480
then it was for me to say,
what you're doing is not OK.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.830
This is better.

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:17.246
This is the alternative.

00:53:17.246 --> 00:53:20.860
So don't worry about
the water because if you

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.160
have the creative mind, you'll
see solutions everywhere.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.924
AUDIENCE: But it's
a compostable cup.

00:53:25.924 --> 00:53:27.690
Why would that not
be OK-- [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:28.120
BEA JOHNSON: OK.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.490
AUDIENCE: Or do you not
believe that those cups--

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:29.760
BEA JOHNSON: No.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.550
I do not.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:35.390
I've actually taken a tour
of-- we can say, I think,

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:39.320
that one of the best composting
facilities in the country is

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.270
San Francisco's.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:41.080
Right?

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:45.740
Their compostable waste goes
to [? Jefferson Prarie ?]

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.420
which is near [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.340
And I've gone there.

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:50.680
I was there with a TV crew.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.680
I asked them to get
me through there.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.670
We saw the waste get
on the conveyor belt.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.400
They have pickers
removing those items.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.390
So people that use the green
plastic bags for their dog poop

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:05.190
thinking that it's
magically going to disappear

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:07.210
in a landfill, no, it doesn't.

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.860
And it doesn't compost either.

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.930
As a matter of fact,
on that conveyor belt,

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:15.680
there are people whose job it is
to pick those compostable items

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.030
out of the compostable
stream because it simply

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:20.420
does not compost.

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.364
It does not compost.

00:54:21.364 --> 00:54:23.280
I mean the company might
tell you it composts.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.270
Oh, you don't believe me.

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:28.250
The company might
tell you it composts.

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:33.490
It might compost, over
six months, maybe a year.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:36.740
But the composting facility
of San Francisco which

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.240
is top notch and is
super hot-- I gotta say,

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.590
I put my hand in there.

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.980
My hand got like--
you could not keep

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.160
your hand in the compost pile.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.190
They cannot compose
those materials.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:52.340
And I think the problem
also with those materials

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.100
is like it confuses people.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.700
People are like, is
this compostable?

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.450
It's recyclable.

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.950
Well, I don't know.

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:59.491
I mean I don't have compost, so
I'll put it in the recycling.

00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:03.340
But you put it in the recycling,
your tainting the recycling

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.160
chain.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.460
So you're basically
throwing an item that's not

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.690
recyclable in the recycling.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:15.980
And then it's basically
tainting the chain.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.630
So it's important to stay
away from those products.

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:22.110
It's like as if we're
trying to replace

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.020
one problem with another.

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:27.540
Let's just re-embrace
the reusables

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.160
that our grandparents
were using.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.642
It's that simple.

00:55:30.642 --> 00:55:32.350
So we don't need to
invent something new.

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:35.105
We already have all
the solutions with us.

00:55:35.105 --> 00:55:36.980
MALE SPEAKER: And to
your point, yeah, we do.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.060
We have, here at
Google, a lot of

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.440
the compostable plastic cups.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.370
And we've gone to the
facility and they all

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:42.250
say the same thing.

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.310
You'll see them after they go--

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:43.782
BEA JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:55:43.782 --> 00:55:45.110
MALE SPEAKER: --through
the pile, and there's still

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:46.410
a full cup or a full fork.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:48.710
So they don't really like
that material even though--

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:51.210
BEA JOHNSON: Well, also, I think
in a lot of people's minds,

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.120
compostable means
it's going to go away.

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.420
People think compostable
also means just evaporating.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.660
Like if it's litter
and it's on the ground,

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.300
it's just going to
one day disappear.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.110
It's not the case.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:06.750
I mean my street is filled
with the compostable ice cream

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:07.630
spoons.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:08.940
And I've contacted the company.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.050
I'm like, oh, you use them
because they're compostable?

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:12.190
They're not in a compost.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.090
They're on my street.

00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:15.626
And they're not disappearing.

00:56:15.626 --> 00:56:17.417
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
thank you so much, Bea.

00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:18.710
And thank you all for coming.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:19.650
This was really fun.

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:19.970
BEA JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:20.970
Thank you for having me.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.930
MALE SPEAKER: And
just so you all--
