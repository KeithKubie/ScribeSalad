Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y. S? Yup. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab and today we're going to hit the phones. Hello. Hi. Can I speak to mark starting with this guy, Mark Morrison. Hey mark, this is jad calling from radio lab.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Hey Jack. Good to hear Ya.

Speaker 1:          00:26          Got Ahold of him at his home in Olympia, Washington

Speaker 2:          00:28          that hanging out on the front porch cause the kids are running around so you might hear some traffic.

Speaker 1:          00:33          Okay, Gotcha. Um, alright, maybe we should just jump in and you should just tell me this story.

Speaker 2:          00:37          Okay. So, um, I was deejaying a wedding, um, out in Lacey, which is the next town over. It was a hot, like late spring kind of feeling like summer kind of day. And uh, we were in uh, a little, a rented facility that had like windows on all sides and all of a sudden the power starts flickering and it starts raining really hard. Okay. Then trees are falling over, the wind is gusting and it, the sky turned tonight and this is like three 30 in the afternoon.

Speaker 1:          01:16          So mark takes off, goes back home.

Speaker 2:          01:18          My inlaws are visiting in town to hang out with a new baby and um, we open up the curtain, turned off all the lights and we're just kind of marveling at the insane power of this storm that's happening. My wife is sitting on the couch, my two year old is watching Charlie Brown or something on the iPad and then all of a sudden there's just a loud snap, like the sound of a whip cracking or like, like a two by four being snapped in half and about a foot and a half to two feet in front of my face right next to my mother in law and the baby, there's a little

Speaker 3:          02:01          fear of white, white light, just a little or the size of like maybe an orange or a grapefruit kind of blurry edges around it floating in mid air. As bright as like the sun and like the bright, it lit up the entire room.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Wow.

Speaker 3:          02:20          All screened.

Speaker 4:          02:22          Everybody in the room, in the unit then,

Speaker 1:          02:24          and mark says this son Orb just sort of hovered in front of his face,

Speaker 3:          02:29          kind of going, Wong, Wong, Wong, Wong for maybe a second

Speaker 1:          02:34          when all of a sudden poof, it was gone.

Speaker 2:          02:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:39          That's some x files that right there.

Speaker 2:          02:41          Yeah. None of us had any idea what the heck happened.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Well, did you go around the room being like, did you guys see that? Did you see that?

Speaker 2:          02:47          Yeah. Everybody thought everybody side. I'm by mother-in-law thought that I had liked taken some kind of like fireworks and thrown it up in the [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          02:58          Like what? What did you

Speaker 2:          03:00          do? Like I didn't do anything. So what I did was I started trying to Google it and there's, you know, I mean, imagine trying to Google that and you're not gonna find anything.

Speaker 1:          03:11          What w what did you type into? Google?

Speaker 2:          03:13          A sphere of light floating in, indoors. Um, I didn't get very far. Yeah. But, um, I just, I just wanted to get to the bottom of it.

Speaker 1:          03:29          And so what mark did is he sat down on a computer and he typed up this email basically saying like, what the Hell is this thing? And then he sent that email into the void, which would be us, yes to our email inbox and a, you know, it sat around for awhile because we tend to get these kinds of questions a lot. Are there more stars in the universe or grains of sand on earth? A lot. A lot. Is it clean and neat? The sticker off the apple. Why do some birds walk and others hop? How do fish here? Why are horses special? We get things a leg. What's up with traffic jams? Random questions like Gilliam is a finite resource. Why are we wasting it on balloons out of coop questions. Why is different animals poops differently? A lot of poop. What happens when you flush a toilet on the equator and they just sort of pile up? We sort of put them in this bucket and then feel guilty about not answering them. And over the years they keep coming. So the bucket gets fuller and fuller and fuller. So finally today we decided, okay, let's just dump the bucket out

Speaker 1:          04:42          and so we're going to try and answer some of these questions today. Bunch of us. Hello, beginning with the question about the orb. Can I speak to Martin please? You're talking to him. Try and answer Mark's question. I called up a guy named Martin Newman,

Speaker 5:          04:54          professor of electrical and computer engineering at University of Florida.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Thank you. Is this still a good time to chat?

Speaker 5:          05:00          Uh, it was about the only time because I'm going to go to dinner in about 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          05:03          All right, excellent. Uh, so we'll just jump right in.

Speaker 5:          05:05          All right. How long were you going to talk?

Speaker 1:          05:08          Well, W so I, uh, told Martin the story, thunderstorm, boom, glowing or boof, glowing orb gone. Yeah. So maybe I'll just put the most basic question to you. Like what is that?

Speaker 5:          05:17          Well, that observation is not uncommon and it's called generally called ball. Lightning

Speaker 1:          05:22          ball lightning. Yeah, that's what it's called in. According to Martin Ball, lightning is timeless.

Speaker 5:          05:28          Some Greeks described exactly the same thing in the 19th century and 18th century. They used to commonly come down the chimney, come out the fireplace.

Speaker 1:          05:37          Oh Wow. But now it says Martin, we are living in an electronic world. And so these balls of lightning

Speaker 5:          05:43          sometime to come out of a wall socket sometimes out of a telephone. Huh. Or they happen in airplanes. They happen in submarines.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Whoa. That actually, that's been reported.

Speaker 5:          05:53          Yeah. Lightning strikes outside an airplane and a ball comes through the and floats down the whole plane.

Speaker 1:          05:59          What if I'm in that plane? I'm thinking

Speaker 5:          06:01          you're going to hope you have your diaper on, right. Where are your, depends. Anytime you've got electrical stuff going on you can make a ball of fire like that.

Speaker 1:          06:10          So do we know anything about what causes what it is exactly? Is it just another form of lightening that somehow manages to ball itself up and hang around?

Speaker 5:          06:19          Well, probably

Speaker 1:          06:21          Martin is actually one of the few people who has studied ball lightening in the lab. He actually got funded by DARPA to try and figure out how it works. Wasn't quite able to. He says what's likely happening is that when a bolt of lightning strikes, it might hit something.

Speaker 5:          06:35          Soil, water, tree,

Speaker 1:          06:37          whatever it is, some substance.

Speaker 5:          06:39          Yeah. It's lit up and somehow forms itself into a sphere, like a balloon or a bubble or something.

Speaker 1:          06:45          Like if you imagine lightning hits some dust shocks, the dust changes its chemistry so that it forms some kind of spiritual scaffolding and then the lightning sticks to the scaffolding or something. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          06:58          Maybe that's what's happening. But you can't prove it. I mean, there's some theory which indicates that that might happen, but if you go into the laboratory and you try to make it, you can't make it, so can't prove it. And uh, if you got a book on ball lightning or do you get my book and look at the chapter on ball lightning, you'll see probably a list of 50 different theories that people have come up with. Oh. From all the way to black holes and continuity's and time space and things that are just, you know, completely almost out of this world. So they remain in ministry. But, uh, well observed history. Did you know that people don't have any good maps for how light and get started in a cloud?

Speaker 1:          07:47          Really? I didn't know that.

Speaker 5:          07:48          We don't know what, how lightning can can get started. It shouldn't be able to.

Speaker 1:          07:53          It shouldn't really be based on what the math says. There's not enough

Speaker 5:          07:57          the measurements that have been made of a conditions in clouds.

Speaker 1:          08:00          Huh. So you're saying

Speaker 5:          08:02          all those things that aren't understood, almost nothing is understood.

Speaker 6:          08:09          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          08:09          We're floundering around.

Speaker 6:          08:13          Do you, do you find yourself thinking about ball lightening and then suddenly just tiptoeing into an existential crisis? How little we know of the world?

Speaker 5:          08:23          Hello? Sorry. Make my living is trying to uncover a little, little more bits by little more bits, but yeah, there's lots of, is it not about everything?

Speaker 7:          08:52          [inaudible] wow.

Speaker 8:          09:15          Next up producer Tracy hunt goes on a field trip.

Speaker 8:          09:21          Do some very hallowed ground man. I think I finally reached the library, the New York Public Library, the New York public life within it's white marble walls, the store, the son of man, which in its glory days. Okay. Right here in the grand hall is like Beautiful Chandelier's all over the place. These gorgeous Collins was filled with seven floors of style, millions of books in every field of human endeavor, row upon row, upon row of shelves, smiles up shelves, close to 50 centuries of human thinking and experience. And every year millions of visitors like Tracy would walk through these hallowed halls each has a question with questions fueled by curiosity, the desire for truth, for knowledge, for wisdom, people trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

Speaker 7:          10:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          10:13          I came here to ask them a question about catnip cabinet. Yes. Katnik Whoa, wait, why? Why can't I sit back up? So we actually got like 500 questions from our listeners, so I thought it might be good idea to take some of them to the library. Hey Resin. So I met up with this woman. Nice to meet you. I'm Tracy. Nice to meet you, Rosa. And she walked me into this office. There's about like, I don't know, 12 people sitting at their desk. Why don't you just introduce yourselves? Okay, sure. So my name is Rosalie. I manage asking YPL and I've been in this department for about five years. I would ask and why P L it's nine one seven ask and YPL I'm putting the phone number out there and if you call them and you ask them a question, it's their job to answer it.

Speaker 9:          11:00          Yes. So we are like a call center. So our typical day starts with questions. And like in a typical day, how many phone calls do you get? Typical Day? About 150 to 200. And residents telling me that most of the questions they get it a little, whether it be like this weekend I'm very boring. Hey, my library card expired or I want to renew this book. But you know, also they, they get some weird ones. We take them all. Yeah. Um, so I got a list right here and in the past they've gotten things like what kind of apple did he eat? Is it proper to go alone to reno to get a divorce? And the statistics on the lifespan of the abandoned woman. Do candles have to be licensed in India? What is the natural enemy of the duck? Can I get a book telling me how to be a mistress of ceremonies at a musical orgy?

Speaker 9:          11:43          What does it mean when you dream you're being chased by an elephant? And do they answer all those? They'll try to, you know, I was maybe a little dismissive for a few of them. I mean, all the questions of course are very important. We welcome all questions please. This by the way, is Bernard Bernard and Mar Savine. He has been working for asking YPL since about 2001 and so the question though, he did answer my catnip question, which is do large feline species like tigers and lions have the same reaction to catnip as domestic cats? Yes. I'll Catholic catnip, apparently tigers, at least that I'm, you know, I had all these questions so I actually had them pick one that they thought was super interesting. Yeah. Which one did you pick two to answer? Let me get the exact wording out of, so yeah, so here we go.

Speaker 9:          12:29          Could you play a meaningful game of Frisbee on the surface of Mars? Yeah, and I really liked that. That was a good one. And I think the word that makes it like just really shine is meaningful. So the first thing he does, you'll want to get me kind of doing some, some searching, you know, again, back of the envelope kind of stuff here in he, I guess I was a little disappointed that we didn't invest that. Any like books, I'm just looking up a frisbee aerodynamics. You literally just turn it just computer inside of googling. How's a Frisbee behave here on earth? The spin of the Frisbee, of course lift, drag. So he looks all that stuff up. Let's see. Then he looks at like aerodynamics on Mars. On Mars, it's very thin, the air there. So because it airs within on Mars, you wouldn't get that spinning lifting thing that you always get frisbees. It might not have the same sort of hovering effect that a first bee does here on earth. It probably would be more like just throwing a ball. It would just go from 10 feet away, 15 feet away. I don't think that that's, that counts as a meaningful game of Frisbee. You still throw it back and forth. But the meaningful to me, the question is like you're playing Frisbee on Mars. I mean that's just, that's just inherently meaningful, you know, growing up I remember seeing uh,

Speaker 10:         13:54          alright, sorry.

Speaker 9:          13:55          You know where you broadcast of a, you know like the astronauts on the moon.

Speaker 10:         14:00          Oh yes. In why you are looking at, you might recognize what I have in my head is the uh,

Speaker 9:          14:04          playing golf

Speaker 10:         14:05          and no further continued example return. It just still happen to have it next time I brought him over to my birthday and I have a [inaudible] American. I dropped the damn

Speaker 9:          14:17          and I'm sure that they were not playing like, you know, PGA golf

Speaker 10:         14:23          but I've got to try it. Old Sam shot here, all the [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          14:32          they were just, you know, amateur duffers but

Speaker 10:         14:36          no,

Speaker 9:          14:36          they were golfing on the moon.

Speaker 10:         14:39          Nah, one more. Oh and miles and miles.

Speaker 9:          14:45          I mean to me that's pretty great. Pretty, that's pretty impressive. So the, the, the, the

Speaker 11:         14:52          uh, kind of makes the whole endeavor meaningful I think in it. And its way

Speaker 7:          15:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          15:08          thanks to producer producers. I actually did ask them my dragons question. Oh, well then her next up, Tracy Hunt and dragons. Hi, this is Christina. Hi Tracy. Hi. Hey, are you coming back? This question is from Christina. Hard quiz.

Speaker 3:          15:30          I am a native of Nevato

Speaker 9:          15:31          out in northern California.

Speaker 3:          15:33          Um, and I was born and raised here. So yeah, love this place.

Speaker 9:          15:37          And you, and what was your question too? Is if you remember what it was roughly?

Speaker 3:          15:41          Yeah, so I came across this article about these creatures called ohms that I guess we're being, you know, washed out of these caves in eastern Europe.

Speaker 9:          15:53          What did they call,

Speaker 3:          15:54          um, the o l m these sort of like blind cave dwelling amphibians. They're totally white. Their skin is translucent, very like other worldly. And the article touched on the idea that, you know, folklore thought that these little creatures were actually like dragon babies being pushed out of, of these caves where, where these huge dragons live. So I started digging into it a little bit and of course you can only find so much on the Internet, but there was this idea of dragons being a sort of like a universal [inaudible] yeah, a cross, you know, different disparate cultures.

Speaker 9:          16:35          And Christina started to wonder why it seemed that so many cultures all over the world all had myths about dragons.

Speaker 3:          16:43          Is it about like humans that will cause them to believe in these like

Speaker 9:          16:47          huge airy, fire-breathing animals? Is that true that cultures all over the world have dragons? Well, sorry, now you have the northern European dragon that we're all familiar with [inaudible] then there's the Chinese dragon, which is a little different. It doesn't have wings, doesn't breathe fire. Then there's other dragon looking sort of things. The Nana Boli [inaudible] Soto people in Southern Africa. There's the Amaru associated with the Incan Empire. Yeah, I think there's no doubt that we have dye abuelas awesome creatures like dragons, uh, in almost every culture in the world. So this is Adrian Mayer. I'm a research scholar in the classics department at Stanford and I'm most interested in is what sorts of things found in nature might have led pre-scientific people to believe that dragons or monsters or other fantastic creatures really existed. At least in the past or even maybe in the present. Adrian actually wrote a book called the first fossil that lays out this theory that a lot of these stories were actually based on people finding old, you know, fossils and bones, fossil bones or teeth or claws or footprints in bedded in stone.

Speaker 9:          18:02          So they see a set of old bones that they couldn't explain with any modern creatures. So the creature they go to is this dragon shaped thing. Yes, but I do want to point out though that we can never know for certain which comes first, the observations of mysterious traces of of unknown animals or the stories of dragons. We don't know which comes first. She says it could be that the story about the dragon was already there and then when they found some bones, they just sort of applied those bones to the dragon myth. What if, if the dragon came before the bones, where did it come from? Well, there's another theory. Some scholars have said they're like monsters of the [inaudible]. They arise from ancient memories of very real predators that were faced by our ancestors. Basically dragons are composited that these creatures that used to eat us and in Honduras and kill us like crocodiles, Saber Tooth Tigers and lions, cave bears, gigantic serpents, snakes, pythons, condo raptors. So you can take like this scaly skin of the crocodile, the claws of the saber tooth tiger and its saber teeth. The wings of these raptors put them all together. So this is all the old terrorist rolled into one

Speaker 12:         19:19          boom together. Yeah, they tapped into all those fears that are ready are in ready inside of this theory. I'm going to go for that one. Yeah, I like that. That works. Then that feels like an answer. Well, you know, like, like they're very powerful. I mean that can be very scary. They can be very destructive. But what's kind of magical in, in game of Thrones is that the intimate scenes also melt your heart and bring you closer to these creatures that should be, you know, burning your face off.

Speaker 9:          19:45          Okay. So I, I, I should admit that I actually just use this whole dragon thing to talk to this lady at gay from game of Thrones. [inaudible] her name is Paula Fairfield and she makes all the dragon noises for game of Thrones. Oh, she makes the dragons. Right. Well, what did you ask her? I guess what did you want to know? Well, I wanted to know, I wanted to know like how does she make these sounds? And it was really interesting cause you know, we're talking a little bit about, uh, you know how dragons are composite creatures and she basically uses composites to make these noises. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I absolutely take some laces from birds. Ricci shrieky bird sounds, insects, different kinds of reptilian recordings and stuff. And gays are always scary animals. Well, depends on what dragon that she, you know, which of the dragons that she's trying to actually, um, create a performance.

Speaker 12:         20:40          I have sounds, I might choose simply by certain personality traits that I might want to push forward. Um, so in the case of Drogon

Speaker 7:          20:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          20:53          so, um, on the show there's Dinero

Speaker 12:         20:59          [inaudible] Dragon Queen and she has three dragons and one of them is named Drogon. She named that dragon after cal Drogo, her, her hot late husband. Um, so drogue on his like her lover. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          21:22          He kind of has like a very affectionate central relationship.

Speaker 7:          21:26          Okay.

Speaker 12:         21:29          He's whistling at her all the time. He's looking at her butt and going, Ooh Baby,

Speaker 7:          21:37          does it happen?

Speaker 9:          21:41          And so in order to kind of push forward this sort of like drag in sexual attention, I guess she uses the sounds of

Speaker 12:         21:48          too dry and tortoise is, you know, mating. Oh, toured tortoise as well. It sound like, well, um, you know, I'm, I'll just play it.

Speaker 7:          22:02          Hello.

Speaker 12:         22:03          Whoa, whoa. But the grown of the male actually became with some work and, and you know, adjustments and stuff became, I'm the source, the basis for dro guns per with her,

Speaker 7:          22:17          with the narrows. How far did she come to me? We need to [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         22:28          my people need me. And the funny thing about the per what Drogon was watching people watch it and giggling when they heard it, but not really knowing why. And to me it's because it had that essence that that kind of sensual sexual essence, that person. Yeah. No, I use from all all kinds of things. And you know, I also used for dragon fly wings to make that kind of funny, flatter of the thorns that's as moving like especially on the end of his tail this year as he moved through, there was like a Chitter and that was like dragon fly wings.

Speaker 9:          23:01          Dragon fly wings. Yeah. Really. I was wondering if you ever had a question about dragons that you would like to have answered.

Speaker 12:         23:09          Yeah, no, it's, it's curious because I think the thing that differentiates the dragons from creatures and makes them slightly either worldly is the fire thing. Where did the idea for that kind of long, that's a good question. Yeah. Where did that come from?

Speaker 9:          23:24          Well, there are many theories about that. Actually, I take that question back to Adrian Mayer. The one that I like is connected to the devastating weapon called Greek fire, which was this unquenchable fire can't be put out by water. In fact, it burns in water. And so it was a naval weapon. And I believe that scholars have found that some of the nozzles for lasting Greek fire were shaped like dragons so that the boat looked like it had a dragon on board breathing fire out the enemy ship. Oh, that's so cool. The stories of they had dragons that breathe fire, uh, would make it back to uh, to northern Europe. That's the best theory I've heard.

Speaker 7:          24:07          Oh, that's interesting. So it's like if the drag, it is a composite of all the things, creatures that have scared us now we're part of that composite technology now be it is built, becomes part of the creature that frightens us. [inaudible] thanks Tracy. You're welcome. Who is, what is, uh, what is uh, uh, [inaudible] who is,

Speaker 13:         24:54          uh, uh, anything coming to mind? What is a

Speaker 7:          25:00          Oh oh six something. It's a fedora. I should have known that. He shouldn't have known that. All right, we're going to take a break.

Speaker 7:          25:37          jad Robert Radiolab man, we are back with more questions. Next one comes from producer Rachel Cusick.

Speaker 13:         25:46          So this question comes from Liam hamburger from Denver, Colorado.

Speaker 7:          25:49          No [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          25:51          I was browsing meanings on my Instagram feed and there was meme where the picture was of a husband and wife trying to go to sleep. The wife was looking weird. She was like looking irritated and the husband was looking like this kind of confused on the opposite side of bed and a capsule utter. He's probably thinking of other girls and then him, I wonder if I bought milk from the same cow twice.

Speaker 7:          26:11          What'd he say? When do what?

Speaker 13:         26:13          Yeah, so he said, I wonder if I've ever bought milk from the same cow twice. So if I go to the store, I buy a gallon of milk and then I go back. Maybe a week later I get another gallon of milk. What are the odds that the same cow is in both of those gallons of milk? I see.

Speaker 7:          26:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          26:33          I would say the answer is almost certainly. Yes, 100%

Speaker 13:         26:39          that's our Benjamin. He's a math professor. Yep. At Harvey Mudd College

Speaker 3:          26:42          in Claremont. And I'm also a mathemagician.

Speaker 12:         26:45          And how is he so sure that it's 100% well, according to Art Benjamin, it all comes down to a [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          26:51          ability. Statistics and dare I say,

Speaker 14:         26:53          hey, how cute. So take a farm like Dale's here. Oh, here we go. My name is Dale Mattoon, pine hollow dairy. Dale has about a thousand cows and 20 at a time. These cows walk into a milking parlor, they line up, it looks like a [inaudible] all day and all night long. And they get hooked up with these black rubber hoses area here. And every once in a while is the guy putting the machine on a cow and he hits the button, it turns on a vacuum and any pumps the milk out of their utters into this big hose along the bottom of the floor. You through the hose down into this line and it's meeting up with all the milk from all the other cows and then it goes from that room into another room or it gets cool down the milk out. Put your hand on this pipe. Oh my gosh, it's cold.

Speaker 14:         27:37          There's condensation on it. Very cool. Once it's cooled down, it goes into this rocket ship looking thing outside called a milk silo where all the milk from Dale's farm is just hanging out together. Silo gets filled up and up and up and up until it's full. We're sending out over 8,000 gallons of milk today on a trek. The trailer, his truck comes along, picks up that milk and it stops at another farm and another farm and another farm until that truck is full, right full goes to the processing plant and once you're at the processing plant, all that milk is just mixed around even more with milk from all the cows. [inaudible] Maria and

Speaker 3:          28:13          I still have my, my back of the envelope that had the calculation here.

Speaker 12:         28:19          Here's where the math comes in.

Speaker 3:          28:20          There are about 90,000 drops of milk and a gallon and uh, oh, I don't know, 100,000 cows who are contributing to a particular processing plants.

Speaker 12:         28:30          When you were in the odds of a drop of milk from any one cow getting into any particular gallon,

Speaker 3:          28:35          probably the case, every gallon of milk contains most of those cows contributing.

Speaker 12:         28:41          And here's the thing. In one drop of milk, you could probably have a bunch of different milk molecules from a bunch of different cows.

Speaker 3:          28:47          And so one glass of milk might have, yeah, thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of different how molecules in my glasses.

Speaker 12:         28:58          Oh Wow. Crazy. Oh my God. So going back to Liam's original question, uh, arts argument is that when you're drinking a glass of milk, there's like so many different bits of milk from so many different cows,

Speaker 3:          29:11          then it's probably the case that after just two glasses of milk, you're, you're almost certain to have, um, a cow that was represented in both of them.

Speaker 12:         29:19          So you're bound to run into at least a little bit of one of those hundred thousand cows. Again,

Speaker 3:          29:24          the point being that every glass of milk has, you know, has thousands and thousands of different cows contributing

Speaker 12:         29:31          a little bit of 10,000 cows and every glass, every glass. I love that. I don't know that I do. No, it's great. It's like you're enjoying the collective efforts of this entire almost. No,

Speaker 15:         29:42          no. I think it should be the product of one or two cows and you can picture in your head and maybe pat on the nose. Thank you. You could say, yeah, I dunno. I would both of you I feel like weirds me out. But I also think it's kind of cool at the same time. Well, you know, become a thing of it. What happens if you drink a glass of milk in New York, get on a plane, fly to Atlanta, then have another glass of milk. Are you getting the same 10,000 in each class or are they different? 10,000 yeah, so I tried calling around a little bit to answer that question and it seems like no one really wants to pay to ship milk that far. And so basically a different processing plant might mean a whole different group of cows. If you really want to figure out exactly which plant your milk is coming from, you can go to where is my milk from.com. Yeah, and you input the little code on the top of your carton and see how often that number comes up. Again, each processing plant has its own code

Speaker 16:         30:33          and yet there's so many stores.

Speaker 15:         30:36          Thank you, Rachel. Thank you. Um, and just a big thanks to dairy farmer Dale Mattoon over at pine hollow dairy.

Speaker 17:         30:42          Are you a big milk drinker? Oh yeah. How often do you drink milk? Oh, well I have it on my cereal in the Martin. I have a glass or two for lunch and a glass or two for dinner. Probably two glasses each. Each meal. If I don't drink milk, I don't feel good. Like if I go away on vacation. And a lot of times you go to

Speaker 7:          31:21          [inaudible]. No, now [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         31:42          all right. This next one came from a couple, a married couple. Hello, is this Marie? Yup, this is Matt kilty calling from Radiolab. How are you?

Speaker 3:          31:49          I'm good. Thanks. I have you on speaker phone and that goes right here.

Speaker 15:         31:53          Oh, Hey Zach, how's it going? So Zack Murray, it was years ago actually, they send us an email about what I think is like one of the most confounding, perplexing, mysterious devices that you can find inside anybody's home. Okay. So the microwave, I guess, I guess what I'm wondering is how one, why were you microwaving peppers? Uh, and too you, do you remember the moment this happened?

Speaker 3:          32:15          Oh, I know what it is. I know that's what happened. So,

Speaker 15:         32:17          okay, so quick scene set. Uh, Portland, Maine, a kitchen around dinner time,

Speaker 3:          32:22          I think we're like cooking a tomato sauce.

Speaker 15:         32:25          Zack was on bell pepper duty.

Speaker 3:          32:26          Try and take a shortcut, take them in a microwave to make them a little warm or soft or something. And I said, oh that don't put those in the microwave. They'll spark.

Speaker 15:         32:35          And Zach was just like, hmm,

Speaker 3:          32:37          you're crazy. Hogwash. Believe you

Speaker 5:          32:40          at all. And uh, reads like none of them know. I remember seeing it as a kid.

Speaker 13:         32:43          You said there was a couple times her mom put some peppers in a microwave and they sparked

Speaker 5:          32:46          yes. My first thought was that, and I never even was wrong. [inaudible] bet your memory was wrong.

Speaker 13:         32:51          Like there must've been a piece of metal in the microwave and you just don't remember that.

Speaker 5:          32:54          And that's what was sparking up. Cause festivals wouldn't do that.

Speaker 13:         32:57          And this is going back and forth in yes and no and sparks and nothing until

Speaker 5:          33:00          I think it was like have to, we have the ability to find this out and uh, prove this wrong.

Speaker 15:         33:08          So that was like five years ago in the past. So we decided that we would actually do our own experiment in the present to get to the bottom of this. Do Green peppers spark in the microwave Maserati first things first. I actually went and bought a microwave. Has It gone off guy on craigslist? I, yeah, so, uh, 50 bucks, 50 bucks, 50 bucks. Alright. Alright baby. And carried it like uh, hey eight blocks back to work. Also bought a bunch of crosiers because we were going to do more than just a peppers test. And for reasons I'd rather not get into. Uh, decided not to start with the peppers.

Speaker 13:         33:45          Baby carrots. Carrots. Yeah. Produce producer and Macewan. Then we're going to kitchen. Really? Yeah. Couldn't tell carrots. Okay. And as the Great Runco says of infomercial fame, I don't know who the great Ron go is. Great. Round. Go set it. Alright, two minutes. Let's see what happens. [inaudible] and all of a sudden this little yellow spark to shout out from one of our slices of carrots. That was crazy. As a little spark. Oh yeah. There you see another one? Yeah, I just saw a little flash. Wow. Cause little tiny spark carrots. Hmm. Okay. Next Kale [inaudible] this is where it gets a little crazy because the Kale, oh, there. Same thing. Boom, boom, boom. Sparks smoke. It's a smell. [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         34:53          Jesus. Delicious. Also. That is smoke. Um, we're going to try to base Maddie said it. Woo. We started driving out of a crowd in the studio. Why was the electricity coming out of the blueberry next I'm to get this. Repeat those scripts. [inaudible] and he means any time cook. Whoa. All right. What's up next? Okay. Jumbo francs. Can I got Turkey? Frank did set it. Spread it. Oh my God. Okay. Pepper. Yes. Set it. Okay. Both red and green bell peppers. Green is crazy. Hey pepper. Yes, it's green diced tomatoes. Heres decorative gourd down again and also a flaming lips city. There we go. Who needs fireworks when you've got a CD in the business? KZ shots up. I wish that. Yeah, cause I don't want it. Yeah. Is it gonna? It looks like he was on fire. He's this smoking in here. Yeah. Oh, that smells really bad. I had to take a break. Everybody. Oh God. Yeah. We want to keep the door open.

Speaker 18:         36:13          What did you say to Maria after the peppers sparked in the microwave?

Speaker 3:          36:18          I think I was, I don't know. I was probably speechless. I said I was a, yeah, I believe that you're right. And Murray, did you say anything in return? Oh wait, something to the effect of, I told you so.

Speaker 18:         36:31          So pepper, sparky, the microwave. That was settled, but then there was the debate about,

Speaker 3:          36:35          he doesn't believe my understanding of how microwave's work. Why? Maybe it's just that pepper has a lot of moisture in it. Yeah.

Speaker 18:         36:42          Zach, maybe it's, you put the pepper in the microwave. All that water gets really high.

Speaker 3:          36:45          The skin acts as like Tinder and that light's on fire quickly. But Marie, we always have peppers in our house and I think that the green wine taste a little bit. MCKAYLA,

Speaker 18:         36:56          the, it's like maybe these peppers is, have like some little bit of metal in there that's sparking. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          37:01          And your next step to find the appropriate scientist.

Speaker 18:         37:05          Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm definitely gonna try and put this case to bed. Yeah, just give us one moment. So ended up tracking down this woman. It's a Carolina Carolyn, is it Kyle is Caroline. Caroline. Okay. Her name is Caroline Ross. I'm a professor in the Department of material science and engineering in MIT and experienced microwave. I've done it with them with roast potatoes. Oh, you've seen sparks? Yeah, I've seen sparks for most potatoes. Huh. All right. So yeah, maybe we should just slate. So I asked her in the case of the peppers or you know, the red potatoes or the grapes, like all the different food that we tried, like what happens in a microwave? It makes the food just go late, right? So let's say I got some pieces of pepper put 'em in the microwave, I press start like what, what happens next? Okay. So there was a gadget in the microwave oven that produces the microwave's, it's called a magnet farm.

Speaker 18:         37:57          And, um, it's, uh, an interesting thing in itself. Okay. Quick side note. It's basically like this hunk of metal that makes the microwave. But Kaitlin told me this really cool thing, which is they actually used to be used, uh, in World War II for radar. That was in the forties. And then in 1945, there was an engineer at Raytheon who was working on these devices and he found that some candy bar he had in his pocket got hot. I was like, oh, this cooks food. And so eventually a magnetron got thrown inside of a metal box and thus was born the microwave. So it's an interesting thing in itself, but, uh, it produces a beam of microwaves and they bounce around inside the microwave oven. Moving at the speed of light.

Speaker 15:         38:36          What are the, are the pounding into the pepper or maybe not.

Speaker 18:         38:39          I don't really like shooting into the painting absorbed, yeah. Being absorbed. And these microwaves, um, they are the right kind of frequency to cause the molecules in food to oscillate back and forth. Ah, you've put a pepper in there. So the purpose got a lot of water in it. It's got all the things as well. Um, and those molecules start absorbing the microwave's and dancing back and forth and hitting each other and heating up. And then that bit gets even hotter and even hotter and eventually it could burst into flames.

Speaker 15:         39:13          But that is not what we're seeing with our pepper or any of the food in the microwave. It's not, no, because, uh, as Caroline explained to me a flame is very different than a spark.

Speaker 18:         39:23          So one thing to keep in mind is that, um, the pepper is fairly conductive. It's got all this water in it. We know that water can conduct electricity and the water isn't pure. It has a lot of salts dissolved in it, minerals, things like that. Okay. In that sense it's a little bit like a piece of metal metal as we know, absorbs microwave energy rather well as we all know. Yes. So,

Speaker 10:         39:49          um,

Speaker 19:         39:51          okay. So let's say you get these pieces of pepper in the microwave and they're, you know, carefully keeping up. Okay. Now the thing is the microwave, like the wave itself, it has an electric field which oscillates back and forth rather high frequency. So when these make waves shoot into these pieces of pepper, what happens is this electricity starts swishing back and forth through the bits of pepper. So there's a cone flowing and it's more microwaves are absorbed in these bits of pepper. You can get quite big cones current so big that they start to create this electric field around the food and that electric field builds up and up and up and eventually it's big enough to cause the air to glow

Speaker 13:         40:30          around the food because now there's actually electricity coursing through the air like a fluorescent light bulb can. And says at this point you can start to see these glowing balls of gas floating. It's actually the air turning into plasma. Now back in the center of the microwave are are little bits of pepper where there's still this electrical current swishing back and forth through those bits of pepper. And if you have sharp corners like the actual corner of a pepper, even on the skin, like these tiny microscopic little points, you're like trisomy in the pepper, the electricity in the air can get concentrated at those sharp corners like a lightning rod. And at those corners, electricity bill, Bill ill until

Speaker 18:         41:19          [inaudible] you got some mini lightening bolt.

Speaker 15:         41:23          And then Katelyn said everything in the microwave, just sort of [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         41:26          palms down until the electric field builds up again and it does it all over. Letting loose these mini lightning bolts. So it's a very dynamic, you've got things being ionized, you've got things recombining, you've got charged flowing, you've got light being emitted, things get hot, there's a big current flowing all for that tiny fraction of a second lot of quantum physics in there.

Speaker 15:         41:50          And then we hear a little Ding and then we're done and then we're done. But I just had one last job to do. How are you two doing? Okay, good. Okay. All right. So I think called up second. Marie told him everything I learned about their sparking pepper. And then even though both of them didn't have the exact theory, lake sac was right. Water's important. Part of Murray was, you know, kind of onto something with this metal thing. Yeah. It feels like it's almost like a little bit of like a, um, a marriage of sorts, pardon the pun, uh, between both of your ideas that, uh, kind of is what is happening inside this black box.

Speaker 3:          42:23          Alright. So, yeah. Okay. That's the way we were. We have some of the elements there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 15:         42:31          Um, so that's a, that's about it. Okay, excellent. Oh, there was one thing that I actually thought was kinda interesting and all these questions we were getting in there was like this tiny little pattern of, of married couples sending us in, uh, arguments that they can, there is, there was one couple that was like, uh, they were arguing about the nutritional value of microwaving a potato. Um, there was another couple that sent in a very long email about how they'd been debating about how we perceive color. Um,

Speaker 3:          43:04          you've actually had a similar dispute. Yeah. Oh, over color was the couch. Oh yeah. They have some sort of like drab tone that I thought was rain. And you thought it was brown, Gray. I agree that, yeah, I think that, yeah, we had that couch for like between different houses and different combinations for probably like five or six years and maybe seven years, 10 years and a lot of licensed. And I was, yeah, I always thought it was gray and still do. But apparently you and your sister thought it was green. You're like lived together for years and just never realized. You're seeing something completely differently. Like what do you mean? Our green couch. I have no idea. We don't have a green couch

Speaker 15:         43:52          producer, Matt guilty.

Speaker 7:          43:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         44:02          all right, so that's just a few of the questions you asked us, which we tried to answer, but that's just the first part of our effort. We have another whole sequence of questions and answers coming up. So if your question hasn't been answered yet, um, hang tight, never know the next batch. Put in your question and it's coming very, very soon.
