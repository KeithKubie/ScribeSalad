00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:12.776
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:14.475
It's 1849.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:19.025
William H. Bovee leaves his job
at a coffee producer in New York City

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:22.626
to seek his fortune 
in gold-fevered California.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.295
But leaving behind the luxuries
of the city,

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:29.615
Bovee leaves behind a more expedient
cup of joe.

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:33.185
Out west, folks are still buying
their coffee beans green,

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:34.936
roasting the beans at home,

00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:37.705
then grinding them with a hand crank,

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.796
all before actually brewing them.

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:44.177
Bovee builds California's 
first coffee mill,

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.947
packaging and selling pre-roasted beans.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:52.445
And in a moment of vision,
he takes the process one step farther

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:57.427
making his mill the world's first to grind
the already roasted beans

00:00:57.427 --> 00:00:59.226
on a large scale,

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:03.637
then pack them conveniently
into small, consumer-friendly tins.

00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:08.726
Only a few years later, however,
Bovee tires of the coffee business

00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:14.046
and sells his shares of the company
to a young employee: James Folger.

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:18.287
Folger changes the name and grows
the company to a nationwide brand,

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:24.277
jumpstarting a race to find the quickest,
easiest way to that morning caffeine fix.

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:27.589
For the 64% of Americans that drink
coffee daily,

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:30.837
an expedient cup 
is practically essential.
