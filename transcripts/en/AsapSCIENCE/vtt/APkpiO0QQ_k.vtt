00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.930
There are four billion hours of travel delays
in America each year, contributing to pollution,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.379
fossil fuel waste and costing us all money;
an estimated $87.2 billion dollars! Not to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.130
mention traffic is just plain annoying! But
is there a solution to your traffic woes?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.170
Traffic is often due to construction, an accident,
or bottlenecks created by on-ramps and tunnels.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.380
But do you ever feel like congestion seems
to appear for no reason? You aren’t imagining

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.800
it! In a 2008 experiment, drivers were instructed
to drive along a circular road, following

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.670
the car in front of them while trying to maintain
a constant speed. As the participants drove,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.530
they started to have fluctuations in speed.
These fluctuations increased, eventually causing

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.870
cars to stop completely which broke the free
flow and led to traffic jams without any added

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.969
factors. Researchers compare traffic jams
to the particles in a liquid and a solid;

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.040
moving cars are like the free flowing particles
in a liquid, but can undergo a ‘phase transition’

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.880
to that of a compacted solid. Once the particles/cars
reach a critical density, gridlock happens.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.870
One of the key reasons gridlock happens is
our inability to maintain a constant speed.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.130
When a traffic break happens, most accelerate
to catch up to the vehicle ahead, resulting

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.050
in eventual braking, that forces the drivers
behind to slow down, cause the jam to grow.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.780
When you’re in a traffic jam, you’re part
of the problem. Studies show that 80-90% of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.150
drivers think they’re better than the average
driver, which is...impossible. Additionally,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.910
as humans our attention is selective, and
we tend to forget that other drivers are people

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.100
too - kind of like commenting online, we can
dehumanize other drivers in ways we wouldn’t

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.670
face-to-face. This leads to jerks on the road
- following too closely or constantly changing

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.410
lanes - which contributes directly to the
congestion that creates traffic jams.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.270
Thankfully, as a good driver, you can make
a difference! Pay attention to the car ahead

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.400
and behind you to keep a buffer of space around
you. This way, if the driver in front of you

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.060
brakes, you have room to slow down and won’t
pass the braking tension along the chain of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.730
traffic. Drive slower. Set your car to cruise
control or try driving at a consistent speed.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.640
In Belgium and the Netherlands, there’s
a technique implemented at times of high volume

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.319
known as ‘block-driving’ where a chain
of cars drive at a consistent speed to help

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.030
others keep pace. Police have also used this
strategy for 15 years, driving at an appropriate

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.500
pace in groups to keep the flow of traffic
moving.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.269
Of course, the advent of autonomous self-driving
cars will see automobiles that are able to

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.190
connect and communicate with one another,
vehicle-to-vehicle, and is expected to reduce

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.030
traffic jams significantly. Additionally,
researchers are using biologically inspired

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.170
algorithms to reduce travel times. In one
study, researchers applies a model based on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.519
ant travel behaviour as a way to route traffic.
Changes in infrastructure work too; recently

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.739
LA became the first city to synchronize every
street light, causing lights to make automatic

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.599
adjustments based on flow, which has reduced
travel time by 14%.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.060
Traffic aside, another solution is taking
public transit when possible. An MIT study

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.260
of Boston traffic found that if 1% of current
drivers took transit, everyone's commute would

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.629
be reduced by 18%.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.420
Of course, companies like Toyota - who supported
this episode - are finding new ways to address

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.090
mobility challenges, developing future technologies
to interconnect drivers and vehicles with

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.000
road infrastructure. Toyota is launching their
new Corolla iM Hatchback with the Toyota Safety

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.670
Sense technologies like pre-collision systems,
automatic high beams, and lane departure alert

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.959
- all of which will be standard and launching
across Canada this September. They also have

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.370
a goal to produce vehicles with zero emissions
by 2050 which is something we really support!

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.060
So, special thanks to Toyota for supporting
our channel, and being a leader in the science

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.370
and technology space!
