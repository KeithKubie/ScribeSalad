Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.020
And we now have 200 videos.
So, to celebrate, I'm going to recommend some

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.820
videos.
200 of them, inside playlists, especially

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.549
ones that you guys have been submitting to
me.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.660
But to begin, let's go all the way back to
the start.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.780
Or, more correctly, the RestartPage.com.
I found this on Boing Boing.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.660
The page contains dialog boxes from operating
systems through history.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.900
Click one and your entire browser recreates
the actual restart.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.180
But if you want to be more involved, be like
Suckmynose000, who recommended this visualization

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.400
of "Lights," where you can fly around in electrically
synchronised world of lights.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.040
2MoronsAndAnIdiot sent me "Perfect Eyesight."
How accurately can you click in the exact

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.780
right spot?
For instance, the exact mathematical middle

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.690
of this star.
Nice.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.210
Now, I've covered so many playlists before.
For instance this one, containing the very

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.519
first hour of MTV ever.
Well, a couple of days ago, CGPGrey released

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.200
this winning playlist of his 30 favorite videos,
ranging from comedy to art to music to science

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.260
to horror.
It's an amazing collection of cool stuff that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.280
also let's you get closer to Grey.
RealNintendo put together this playlist of

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.730
7 epic game show fails.
He says they get crazier as it goes, so keep

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.970
watching.
Hunter F. Davies made 4 playlists: Funny 911

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.700
Calls, Great Explosions, 7 incredible historical
Apple ads and 3 videos about why the world

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.460
won't end in 2012.
Now, here's a great one.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.400
28 commercials for video game systems in order
from 1973 to 2011.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.630
Maddog53 collected his 15 favorite YouTube
videos of 2011, many of which were new to

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.780
me and are quite beautiful.
MrBeanmachine17 assembled 7 incredible nuclear

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.990
bomb detonation videos in order of increasing
explosive yield.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.500
But if you'd rather relax, check out this
community - driving videos.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.680
Sped up footage of people driving their cars
through freeway systems in lots of different

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.920
states.
It's actually pretty cool to have on full

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.780
screen in the background like moving artwork.
I received this playlist of cool music and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.129
was reminded of Hadouken's "People Are Awesome."
So I made this playlist containing 5 of the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.069
best made People Are Awesome clips ever.
We may not have claws or beaks or tails, but

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.749
at least we can do this.
Want more inspiration?

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:34.999
Grevejp44 sent me this playlist of epic orchestral
arrangements - be sure to play it when preparing

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.219
for battle.
Oh and here's a thing.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.860
You know when you see "As Seen On" on YouTube?
Well, you can click it and arrive on a page

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.730
showing every YouTube video that site has
featured and you can even subscribe to their feed.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.370
So rather than figure out all the channels
worth following yourself, heck, let Reddit

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.770
do the work for you.
Or, Cute Overload.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.810
Or a sub-reddit that will deliver video meant
to non-plus your mind.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.950
The new YouTube channel layout makes people's
feeds fantastic automatic playlists.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.440
See, rather than having to find other videos
related by keywords, I can find things related

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.329
because the same human liked them.
For instance, I love sword dancing, but related

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.280
videos only give me more swords and a girl
in a tanktop.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.579
But by opening the video from 'temperature3's'
feed, I get this module, which introduces me

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.419
to other things that he liked or favorited.
Now, the same goes for my friend Jake's personal

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.820
channel.
His list of favorites and likes is like going

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.749
to cool things wing of the Jake Museum and
Jake is the museum's curator.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.560
If you've made a playlist of types of videos
you think we should all know about, keep them

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.840
coming my way - michael@vsauce.com.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.340
And as always,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.700
thanks for watching.
