00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:03.135
- [Voiceover] Let's
define a random variable x

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:07.070
as being equal to the number of heads,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.870
I'll just write capital H for short,

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.709
the number of heads from flipping coin,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.951
from flipping a fair coin,

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:17.888
we're gonna assume it's a fair coin,

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:22.590
from flipping coin five times. Five times.

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.970
Like all random variables this
is taking particular outcomes

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.036
and converting them into numbers.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:30.033
And this random variable,
it could take on the value

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:35.011
x equals zero, one, two,
three, four or five.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.600
And I what want to do is figure
out what's the probability

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.644
that this random variable
takes on zero, can be one,

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:43.439
can be two, can be three,
can be four, can be five.

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:46.018
To do that, first let's
think about how many possible

00:00:46.018 --> 00:00:49.940
outcomes are there from
flipping a fair coin five times.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.939
Let's think about this.

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:53.876
Let's write possible outcomes.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:58.345
Possible outcomes

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:01.526
from five flips.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.059
From five flips.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.764
These aren't the possible
outcomes for the random variable,

00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:08.877
this is literally the
number of possible outcomes

00:01:08.877 --> 00:01:10.525
from flipping a coin five times.

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:12.255
For example, one possible outcome could be

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:15.921
tails, heads, tails, heads, tails.

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.094
Another possible outcome could be

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.459
heads, heads, heads, tails, tails.

00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:24.282
That is one of the
equally likely outcomes,

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:26.174
that's another one of the
equally likely outcomes.

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:28.030
How many of these are there?

00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:32.627
For each flip you have two possibilities.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.090
Let's write this down.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.469
Let me...

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.470
The first flip, the first flip
there's two possibilities,

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:46.745
times two for the second flip,
times two for the third flip.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.009
Actually maybe we'll not
use the time notation,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.750
you might get confused
with the random variable.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.863
Two possibilities for the first flip,

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:54.651
two possibilities for the second flip,

00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:56.624
two possibilities for the third flip,

00:01:56.624 --> 00:01:58.586
two possibilities for the fourth flip,

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.653
and then two possibilities
for the fifth flip,

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:05.099
or two to the fifth equally
likely possibilities

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.351
from flipping a coin five times,

00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:10.135
which is, of course, equal to 32.

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:11.797
This is going to be helpful because for

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:15.454
each of the values that the
random variable can take on,

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:16.731
we just have to think about how many

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:19.959
of these equally likely
possibilities would result

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.000
in the random variable
taking on that value.

00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:24.010
Let's just delve into it to see

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.599
what we're actually talking about.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.768
I'll do it in this
light, let me do it in...

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:30.012
I'll start in blue.

00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:32.810
Let's think about the probability

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.987
that our random variable
x is equal to one.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:39.971
Well actually, let me start with zero.

00:02:40.657 --> 00:02:44.150
The probability that our random
variable x is equal to zero.

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.934
That would mean that you got
no heads out of the five flips.

00:02:48.273 --> 00:02:49.956
Well there's only one way, one out of

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:53.495
the 32 equally likely possibilities,
that you get no heads.

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:57.639
That's the one where
you just get five tails.

00:02:58.257 --> 00:02:59.963
So this is just going to be,

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:01.577
this is going to be equal to

00:03:01.577 --> 00:03:05.882
one out of the 32 equally
likely possibilities.

00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:10.099
Now, for this case, to think in terms of

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:14.590
binomial coefficients, and
combinatorics, and all of that,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.529
it's much easier to
just reason through it,

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.431
but just so we can think in
terms it'll be more useful

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:24.421
as we go into higher values
for our random variable.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.198
This is all buildup for
the binomial distribution,

00:03:27.198 --> 00:03:29.599
so you get a sense of
where the name comes from.

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:31.422
So let's write it in those terms.

00:03:31.447 --> 00:03:34.057
This one, this one,

00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:36.740
this one right over here,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.318
one way to think about that in
combinatorics is that you had

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:44.318
five flips and you're choosing
zero of them to be heads.

00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:48.825
Five flips and you're choosing
zero of them to be heads.

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:52.684
Let's verify that five
choose zero is indeed one.

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:55.835
So five choose zero. Write it over here.

00:03:55.837 --> 00:04:00.837
Five choose zero is equal
to five factorial over,

00:04:02.303 --> 00:04:07.049
over five minus zero factorial.

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:10.812
Well actually over zero factorial

00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:14.119
times five minus zero factorial.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.229
Well zero factorial is one, by definition,

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.184
so this is going to be five
factorial, over five factorial,

00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:27.028
which is going to be equal to one.

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:28.562
Once again I like reasoning through it

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.547
instead of blindly applying a formula,

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:32.022
but I just wanted to show you that

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.237
these two ideas are consistent.

00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:35.539
Let's keep going.

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.897
I'm going to do x equals one

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:38.523
all the way up to x equals five.

00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:40.798
If you are inspired, and I
encourage you to be inspired,

00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:43.085
try to fill out the whole thing,

00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:44.304
what's the probability that x equals

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:45.904
one, two, three, four or five.

00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:48.936
So let's go to the
probability that x equals two.

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:50.559
Or sorry, that x equals one.

00:04:51.002 --> 00:04:56.002
The probability that x equals
one is going to be equal to...

00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:58.955
Well how do you get one head?

00:04:58.955 --> 00:05:01.079
It could be, the first one could be head

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.716
and then the rest of
them are gonna be tails.

00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:04.538
The second one could be head

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:06.199
and then the rest of
them are gonna be tails.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.859
I could write them all
out but you can see that

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:10.981
there's five different
places to have that one head.

00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:13.884
So five out of the 32
equally likely outcomes

00:05:13.884 --> 00:05:16.053
involve one head.

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:17.599
Let me write that down.

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.132
This is going to be equal to

00:05:21.132 --> 00:05:25.224
five out of 32 equally likely outcomes.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.291
Which of course is the same
thing, this is going to be

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.566
the same thing as saying I got five flips,

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:35.208
and I'm choosing one of them to be heads.

00:05:35.593 --> 00:05:37.692
So that over 32.

00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:41.803
You could verify that five factorial

00:05:41.803 --> 00:05:46.168
over one factorial times five minus--

00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:47.852
Actually let me just do it just so that

00:05:47.852 --> 00:05:49.812
you don't have to take my word for it.

00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:54.965
So five choose one is
equal to five factorial

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:58.971
over one factorial, which is just one,

00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:03.940
times five minus four-- Sorry,
five minus one factorial.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.003
Which is equal to five
factorial over four factorial,

00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:12.345
which is just going to be equal to five.

00:06:12.683 --> 00:06:14.690
All right, we're making good progress.

00:06:15.052 --> 00:06:19.869
Now in purple let's think
about the probability that

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:22.712
our random variable x is equal to two.

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:25.105
Well this is going to be equal to,

00:06:25.105 --> 00:06:27.866
and now I'll actually
resort to the combinatorics.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.840
You have five flips

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.601
and you're choosing two
of them to be heads.

00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:37.457
Over 32 equally likely possibilities.

00:06:37.457 --> 00:06:38.734
This is the number of possibilities

00:06:38.734 --> 00:06:41.137
that result in two heads.

00:06:41.137 --> 00:06:43.912
Two of the five flips
have chosen to be heads,

00:06:43.912 --> 00:06:47.893
I guess you can think of it
that way, by the random gods,

00:06:47.893 --> 00:06:49.716
or whatever you want to say.

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:53.315
This is the fraction of the 32
equally likely possibilities,

00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:55.300
so this is the probability
that x equals two.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.595
What's this going to be?
I'll do it right over here.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.677
And actually no reason for me

00:06:59.677 --> 00:07:01.093
to have to keep switching colors.

00:07:01.093 --> 00:07:06.093
So five choose two is going
to be equal to five factorial

00:07:07.455 --> 00:07:10.518
over two factorial

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.418
times five minus two factorial.

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:16.719
Five minus two factorial.

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:18.553
So this is five factorial

00:07:18.553 --> 00:07:22.568
over two factorial times three factorial.

00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:24.253
And this is going to be equal to

00:07:24.253 --> 00:07:27.991
five times four times three times two,

00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:29.012
I could write times one

00:07:29.012 --> 00:07:31.251
but that doesn't really
do anything for us.

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:33.819
Then two factorial's just going to be two.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.801
Then the three factorial
is three times two.

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:38.996
I could write times one,

00:07:38.996 --> 00:07:40.898
but once again doesn't do anything for us.

00:07:40.923 --> 00:07:42.514
That cancels with that.

00:07:42.514 --> 00:07:44.799
Four divided by two is two.

00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:46.693
Five times two is 10.

00:07:46.693 --> 00:07:48.235
So this is equal to 10.

00:07:48.713 --> 00:07:51.300
This right over here is equal to 10/32.

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:53.113
10/32.

00:07:53.113 --> 00:07:54.680
And obviously we could
simplify this fraction,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.201
but I like to leave it this way

00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:58.534
because we're now thinking
everything is in terms of 32nds.

00:07:58.534 --> 00:08:00.740
There's a 1/32 chance x equals zero,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.097
5/32 chance that x equals one

00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:05.742
and a 10/32 chance that x equals two.

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:07.959
Let's keep on going.

00:08:08.297 --> 00:08:10.153
I'll go in orange.

00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:13.220
What is the probability that

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.016
our random variable x is equal to three?

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.339
Well this is going to be five,

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:21.299
out of the five flips we're
going to need to choose

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:22.994
three of them to be heads to figure out

00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:25.674
which of the possibilities
involve exactly three heads.

00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:28.936
And this is over 32 equally
likely possibilities.

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:31.397
And this is going to be equal to,

00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:36.829
five choose three is
equal to five factorial

00:08:37.192 --> 00:08:42.031
over three factorial times
five minus three factorial.

00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:43.670
Let me just write it down.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.493
Five minus three factorial,

00:08:45.493 --> 00:08:47.222
which is equal to five factorial

00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:51.644
over three factorial times two factorial.

00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:55.209
That's exactly what we had up here

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:56.974
and we just swapped three and the two,

00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:59.618
so this also is going to be equal to 10.

00:08:59.794 --> 00:09:03.577
So this is also going
to be equal to 10/32.

00:09:03.938 --> 00:09:05.761
All right, two more to go.

00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.841
And I think you're going to start seeing

00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.048
a little bit of a symmetry here.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:11.006
One, five, 10, 10, let's keep going.

00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:14.421
Let's keep going, and I
haven't used white yet.

00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:15.501
Maybe I'll use white.

00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:20.501
The probability that our random
variable x is equal to four.

00:09:22.048 --> 00:09:24.463
Well, out of our five
flips we want to select

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:27.394
four of them to be heads,
or out of the five--

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:32.798
We're obviously not actively selecting.

00:09:32.798 --> 00:09:34.621
One way to think of it,
we want to figure out

00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:36.641
the possibilities that
involve out of the five flips,

00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:38.916
four of them are chosen to be heads,

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:40.563
or four of them are heads.

00:09:40.704 --> 00:09:43.581
And this is over 32 equally
likely possibilities.

00:09:43.757 --> 00:09:48.757
So five choose four is
equal to five factorial

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:54.842
over four factorial times
five minus four factorial

00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:56.678
which is equal to,

00:09:56.678 --> 00:09:58.117
well that's just going
to be five factorial,

00:09:58.117 --> 00:10:00.269
this is going to be one
factorial right over here.

00:10:01.407 --> 00:10:03.005
That doesn't change the value,

00:10:03.005 --> 00:10:05.292
you just multiply one
factorial times four factorial,

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:07.765
so it's five factorial
over four factorial,

00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:09.806
which is equal to five.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.405
So once again this is 5/32.

00:10:13.407 --> 00:10:14.707
And you could have reasoned through this

00:10:14.707 --> 00:10:16.471
because if you're saying
you want five heads,

00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.530
that means you have one tail.

00:10:19.147 --> 00:10:22.206
There's five different places
you could put that one tail.

00:10:22.206 --> 00:10:24.479
There are five
possibilities with one tail.

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:26.790
Five of the 32 equally likely.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.417
And then, and you could probably guess

00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:30.286
what we're gonna get for x equals five

00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:31.993
because having five heads means

00:10:31.993 --> 00:10:33.815
you have zero tails,

00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:36.207
and there's only gonna be
one possibility out of the 32

00:10:36.207 --> 00:10:39.409
with zero tails, where you have all heads.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:41.255
Let's write that down.

00:10:41.477 --> 00:10:43.286
The probability,

00:10:43.369 --> 00:10:48.369
the probability that our random
variable x is equal to five.

00:10:48.768 --> 00:10:50.114
So we have all five heads.

00:10:50.114 --> 00:10:51.530
You could say this is five

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.638
and we're choosing five
of them to be heads.

00:10:56.174 --> 00:10:58.471
Out of the 32 equally
likely possibilities.

00:10:58.682 --> 00:11:02.197
Well five choose five,
that's going to be...

00:11:02.675 --> 00:11:04.161
Let me just write it here since

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:05.775
I've done it for all of the other ones.

00:11:05.775 --> 00:11:10.775
Five choose five is five
factorial over five factorial

00:11:10.976 --> 00:11:13.737
times five minus five factorial.

00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:15.898
Well this right over
here is zero factorial,

00:11:15.898 --> 00:11:17.453
which is equal to one,

00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:19.113
so this whole thing simplifies to one.

00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:22.190
This is going to be one out of-- 1/32.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.953
So you see the symmetry. 1/32, 1/32.

00:11:24.953 --> 00:11:28.677
5/32, 5/32; 10/32, 10/32.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.454
And that makes sense because
the probability of getting five

00:11:31.454 --> 00:11:35.041
heads is the same as the
probability of getting zero tails,

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.620
and the probability of getting zero tails

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.971
should be the same as the
probability of getting zero heads.

00:11:41.298 --> 00:11:43.179
I'll leave you there for this video.

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:46.197
In the next video we'll graphically
represent this and we'll

00:11:46.197 --> 00:11:49.875
see the probability distribution
for this random variable.
