THE BAD DEVIL.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:24.657 line:0%
A NICKNAME AS UNCREATIVE
AS IT IS TERRIFYING.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.527
- ARE YOU PLEASED WITH YOURSELF?
- NO MORE THAN USUAL.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.463
- SURE, YOU ONLY LET
ONE MEASLY GUY GET AWAY,

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.266
AND NOW HE'S RUNNING
THE GODDAMN CITY.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.501
- NOT THE WHOLE CITY,
JUST UPPER MIDTOWN

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:36.903
AND LOWER DOWNTOWN

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.071
AND MIDDLE UPTOWN LOWTOWN.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.440
BESIDES,
IT'S MOSTLY POOR PEOPLE.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.642
- WHERE EXACTLY DID YOU
END UP LAST NIGHT?

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.243
- I WAS PURSUING
SOME HOT LEADS.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:49.182
LEGALLY, I CAN MAKE ANY
THREE PEOPLE HERE DO EACH OTHER.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.350
TAKE IT.
SHOW YOUR FRIENDS.

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:54.787
WHO WANTS SOME?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.489
[slurps loudly]

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.257
- HOW LONG IS THIS
GOING TO LAST?

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.860
- AS LONG AS HEARTLESS CROOKS
HAVE SNAKES FOR HEARTS.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:03.096
- NO, THIS.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.564
- I PAID FOR 48 HOURS.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.599
- GET YOUR SKANKS
OUT OF MY OFFICE.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:09.368
- HEY, THEY HAVE NAMES,
PROBABLY.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.670
[whispering]
KEEP DANCING.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.205
I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE MEN'S ROOM IN FIVE.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.107
- DAZZLE, I NEED YOU
TO FOCUS,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.274
AND I'M GONNA HELP YOU

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.376
BY TAKING AWAY
SOME DISTRACTIONS.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.078
FOR STARTERS...

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.746
YOUR GUN.
- WHAT?

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.949
THEN ALL I'LL HAVE
ARE THESE WORTHLESS KNIVES.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.951
- AND I'M DISMANTLING
YOUR NAP NOOK.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:28.488
- SO I'M SUPPOSED TO NAP
ON MY COUCH LIKE A DOG?

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:33.326
- OH, AND I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT TOO ATTACHED TO THIS.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.794
- NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:37.497
HOW ELSE WILL PEOPLE KNOW
THAT I'M THE NUMBER ONE COP?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.133
I CAN'T DRINK OUT OF A TROPHY.
I'LL LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.534
- I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.504
GO OUT
AND CAPTURE THAT PSYCHOPATH.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.539
I'M GIVING YOU
FIVE DAYS, DAZZLE,

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:49.108
OR YOU'LL BE GONE SO FAST,
YOUR HEAD'LL SPIN.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:53.279
- MY HEAD DOESN'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF THE WORD SPIN.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.350
[slurps and exhales sharply]

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.651
THIS IS HUMILIATING.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:00.920
- YOU'RE TELLING ME,
BROTHER.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:03.322
- IT TASTES LIKE DEATH.
- REALLY?

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.459
BECAUSE I DRINK
FROM THE CUP OF LIFE.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:08.194
- RAD CUNNINGHAM,

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.963
KING DICK
OF THE ASS FOREST.

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:13.099
- I SEE YOU'VE MET
MY SPECIAL LADY.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.735
I'VE BEEN USING HER
FOR ALL KINDS OF THINGS:

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:19.038
SPITTING TOBACCO,
GIVING BATHS TO MY MICE,

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.973
STORING MY FARTS.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.443
- YOU MONSTER.
SHE WASN'T MADE FOR MOUSE BATHS.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:27.213
SHE'S AN ANGEL.
- WELL, SHE'S MINE NOW, OKAY?

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:28.948
JUST LIKE YOUR OFFICE
WILL BE

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.384
AND YOUR CRYSTAL HOUSE DOME
ON THE MOONBEAM BAY.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.720
DON'T LIKE IT?
SHOOT ME.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.490
- I WANT TO,
BUT I CAN'T.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.493
- [laughing]

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:43.463
[door knob clicking]

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:46.766
GOT IT.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.501
[laughs]

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:49.734
[door clanks open]
