00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:06.927
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:08.385
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: Thank you,

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.530
guys, so much for coming today.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.550
I'm really excited
to have the privilege

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.810
to interview Minerva
today onstage.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.242
So give it up for
Minerva, you guys.

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.628
We're really
excited to have her.

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:21.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.170
So Minerva, it is September.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.160
Can you believe it's going to
be two years since Mayor de

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.910
Blasio announced your
appointment as New York City's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.580
first ever CTO?

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.670
MINERVA TANTOCO: Yeah.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.420
So that was-- well,
you'll have to excuse me

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.480
because I want to take
a picture of all of you.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.470
This is like the coolest thing.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.650
You should be so--
I'm so inspired to see

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.250
all your faces here.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.900
And it's just so exciting.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.230
So I'm sorry.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.420
I'm going to be a
tourist, and here I

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.881
am at Google with all of
you here, and with you.

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:04.069
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.110
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
You need to do a selfie.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.760
MINERVA TANTOCO: Oh, wait.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.260
Oh, yes.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.960
We'll do that.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.310
OK.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.780
Now we can start.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.020
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
Wow, you are so humble.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.540
MINERVA TANTOCO:
It was really one

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.030
of the most surreal, kind of
crazy experiences in my life.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.440
This was at the 10th anniversary
of New York Tech Meetup

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.680
that my appointment to the first
ever Chief Technology Officer

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.770
was announced.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.690
And for me, leaving the 30
years in the private sector--

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.330
I started my first
software company in 1985.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.140
It was an artificial
intelligence company.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.290
And I was a junior,
actually, still.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.070
I still had another
semester or so to go.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.110
But I went to the West Coast
to start my first company.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.260
And then to fast forward
and see this really tall guy

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.820
talk about someone and realizing
that he was talking about me

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.440
as the first ever CTO
was just incredible.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.330
And I've always
wanted to find a way

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.850
to help have a bigger impact, to
have a platform for the issues

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.960
that I care about-- to improve
the diversity in technology.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.280
When I started in the '80s,
there were only about a third

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.680
of the class were computer
science majors who were women.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.340
But then I looked up 30 years
later, and it was like 10%.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.710
And so that was kind of going
in the wrong direction for me.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.350
And so the opportunity to
have a platform for improving

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.110
the numbers of women
and people of color

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.100
in technology, to be able
to influence and have

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.180
an impact on the greatest
city in the world, New York,

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.120
and really to kind
of be able to say

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.830
that the first chief
technology officer was

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.790
a girl from Queens who
went to all New York City

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.460
public schools, Bronx
High School of Science.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.800
[CHEERING]

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.270
And I'm fond of saying if you
want to know what a CTO looks

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.350
like, they look like me.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.950
And they look like all of you.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.552
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: That's awesome.

00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:33.660
Looking out at the women,
I heard a few cheers

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.340
when she said the
Bronx High schoolers,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.200
and so I'm wondering,
how many of you

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.260
are kind of early
in your careers?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.300
A few years out of college
or kind of just starting out?

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.720
OK, a few of you.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.260
So maybe it would
be great if we could

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.560
gain some of your pearls of
wisdom for these young ladies

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.520
here.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.770
You've held a series
of different roles

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.050
in your career, everything
from product manager

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.520
to strategist to team leader.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.460
And so when you think
about these women,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.580
is there any particular
role that you would

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.400
suggest that they pursue first?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.010
And how do you
think about pursuing

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.970
one role in one
industry and really

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.740
diving deep into that
as opposed to getting

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.760
a more diverse portfolio of
experiences and companies?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.250
MINERVA TANTOCO: Yeah, I think
that's a fantastic question.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.300
I think for me, the
secret is I actually

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.800
didn't follow the path
I thought I would be on.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.090
I sort of let the path find me.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.980
I've invented every
job I've ever had.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.670
The founder of Manageware
didn't exist before.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.970
And it was just because
I went into college,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.920
and I wanted to be a doctor.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.520
That was actually the
plan laid out for me.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.700
But during the course
of studying psychology--

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.830
in particular,
neuropsychology, because I

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.880
was interested in
brain science--

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.817
I started to use computers.

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:58.650
And then I discovered
that you could program

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.400
computers to think, possibly.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.540
And what is thinking?

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.150
And so that's how
I got interested

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.500
in artificial intelligence.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.550
So I just sort of
pursued the things

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.140
that I thought were cool.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.080
And so later on, we
started the AI company.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.100
We sold it five years
later to what was then

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.070
the largest software
company in the world,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.320
a company called
Computer Associates.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.040
And just kept
following the things

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.160
that I was interested in.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.570
But most of the
time, I had an idea

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.190
of what I'd like
to move on to next.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.290
And so when I decided that I
wanted to be a chief technology

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.510
officer, really drill into
more technical topics,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.770
I sort of laid out a plan.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.260
I needed to learn about
all the different domains.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.730
And so I had this
rough idea in my head

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.220
that I'd want to get into--
after being in software

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.110
architecture, that I
wanted to understand

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.690
network infrastructure.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.770
I wanted to also
understand databases.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.090
Then I moved into
mobile technology,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.704
which is kind of a
strange combination of all

00:06:07.704 --> 00:06:08.370
of those things.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.630
And mobile architecture
was just happening.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.140
And then still trying to improve
on my artificial intelligence

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.970
background, which
now is a thing now.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.810
It's come back after 30 years.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.330
And so I did have the
idea that there were areas

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.370
that I was weak in or maybe
didn't know as much about.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.910
I'll tell you one quick story.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.090
While I was at Merrill Lynch--
this was about 10 years ago.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.450
I had just finished the very
first mobile application

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.460
for the investment bank, it
was BlackBerries back then,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.980
2003, many years before
the other mobile phones

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.050
were invented.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.590
And I did such a
great job there,

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.350
they said, yeah, we need you to
redo the whole data warehouse.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.520
And by the way, the last two
guys that tried to do that

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.535
failed and were fired.

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.500
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
That's encouraging.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.900
MINERVA TANTOCO: And it's
also crashing right now.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.900
So why don't you go
ahead and do that?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.890
And every fiber in my
body was like, no way.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.080
I don't know enough
about data structures

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.290
or running a data warehouse
or business intelligence.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.040
My own mentor at the time
said, that's the poison pill.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.980
Don't do that.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.900
And so I really
thought about it.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.030
And I thought, you know, what's
the worst that can happen?

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.980
So here was a chance
to really take

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.170
on something I'd
never done before,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.500
really doing more
operational stuff,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.260
running a data warehouse,
globally running the reporting

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.650
team, as well.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.730
And at the same time of
running the operations,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.940
re-architecting and redesigning
an entire new data warehouse.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:07.940
And because it was
a burning platform,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.560
we were able to do it.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.740
We did it in 18 months,
on time and on budget.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.240
And back then-- I didn't
realize it at the time,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.680
but that gave me a huge
leg up in the coming data

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.520
science and big data that
was to come 10 years later.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.330
And so I have no regrets.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.289
Obviously, I wasn't
fired or anything.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:39.309
And really built, probably--
they still use it today.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.520
I still keep in touch with
those folks from back then.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.480
So I guess in short, I would
say definitely have a plan.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.260
But you don't have
to stick to it.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.780
You know what I mean?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.351
If you find something,
if you find another turn,

00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:56.600
it's a little bit like walking
down a New York street.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.990
Maybe you have a general
direction you want to go in.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.540
But if you stop and
look around, you

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.860
might find some really
cool things that's

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.117
a little off the beaten path.

00:09:04.117 --> 00:09:05.950
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
I'm so glad to hear

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.408
you say that because it gives
me a little bit of confidence

00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:09.920
in the approach that I've taken.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.560
I've shared Minerva's
sort of windy path

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.506
and have also done a
variety of different roles.

00:09:15.506 --> 00:09:17.130
Most of my work has
been within Google,

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.637
but it's about a lot of
different teams and things

00:09:19.637 --> 00:09:20.220
within Google.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.105
So great to hear that.

00:09:22.105 --> 00:09:23.836
MINERVA TANTOCO: Oh,
you're really cool.

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:24.460
You're awesome.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.502
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
I don't know about that.

00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:28.418
MINERVA TANTOCO: I should
be interviewing you.

00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:31.080
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: I
still got a long way to go.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.060
No, it's so exciting
to be in this room

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.660
with so many amazing women
here and being able to hear

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.869
a little bit about your life.

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:40.326
And some of the
things that I think

00:09:40.326 --> 00:09:41.940
are really cool about
what you've done

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.900
is you've often been at the
cutting edge, maybe bleeding

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.820
edge, of some of the
technologies and everything

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.360
else.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.600
And I think I even heard
you say that you had

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.450
created many of your own roles.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.250
So I feel like there's
something about inventions

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.950
in your background
that keeps coming up.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.920
And I would love if you could
share a little bit about how

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.870
inventions have played
a role in your life

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.950
and even, potentially,
how they might

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.754
play a role in the life
of many of the women here.

00:10:07.754 --> 00:10:08.920
MINERVA TANTOCO: Absolutely.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.290
I think women are
problem-solvers, right?

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.010
Am I right?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.200
We're born that way.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:29.350
And so to me, the saying
that necessity is the mother

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.490
of invention is true.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.330
But I also think
that my version of it

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:43.230
is mothers make the best
inventors, actually.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:51.970
And so for me, a
lot of what we were

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.350
doing, especially a few
years back when we were-- we

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.520
ended up with one of my teams.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.160
We were searching and
searching for a solution

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.440
about how to manage
complex workflow processes.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.850
So there's a lot of
things that don't happen

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.370
in a stepwise fashion, and
the answer to one thing

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:20.074
might change the path that the
computer sequence has to go in.

00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:21.990
And we were looking and
looking for this tool.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.470
And it didn't happen.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.460
I drew out how it could work,
if we had such a system.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.850
We were looking for it.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.840
And when we discovered
that, you know what?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.490
We kind of just invented this.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.750
And this is how we ended
up with four US patents

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.340
in intelligent workflow.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.550
Because we knew what the
solution was supposed to be

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.820
or what we needed the tool
to do and designed it.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.310
And then we were like, oh.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.980
We've invented it.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.000
And the word invention comes
from the idea of finding,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.900
discovering something.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.640
It's not actually making.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.020
It's actually you've
discovered something.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.920
And that's what's been so
great about being an inventor

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.677
and just being in an innovation
mode my entire career.

00:12:13.677 --> 00:12:15.510
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
That's interesting.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.320
And some of what I heard you
say there, too, is kind of,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.800
we didn't necessarily
know what we were doing.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.870
We kind of figured it
out as we went along.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.797
And I often hear-- I hearken
back to some of the TED Talks,

00:12:25.797 --> 00:12:27.630
and you hear about fake
it till you make it.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.520
And I think another
kind of take on that

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.840
is that nobody really
knows what they're

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.407
doing when you get down to it.

00:12:35.407 --> 00:12:37.490
There's a lot of things,
especially in technology,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.690
that we're all going on to
try to do for the first time.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.080
And so how can you be expected
to know what you're doing

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.750
if it's never been done before?

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.070
And so I think that's
also a good message for us

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.280
to repeat to ourselves as we
think about being put into kind

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.590
of challenging
situations, and how do you

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.360
navigate through them?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.360
And I know you've had some
challenges along your past,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.960
I'm sure, that maybe you could
enlighten us a little bit, how

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.284
you've overcome some of those.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.200
MINERVA TANTOCO: Sure.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.090
I mean, it's definitely good
to be first, I have to say.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.460
It's harder.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.520
But I think there's this
notion in technology

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.260
about being first
mover, but also

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.609
the idea that just because
it hasn't been done before,

00:13:19.609 --> 00:13:21.900
you're going to have people
around that say, oh, nobody

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.566
did that before.

00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:23.730
That doesn't exist.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.750
All that means is you're
going to be the first

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.890
and that maybe you should be
the first to do something.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:37.830
And so it's been a great journey
for me because of that idea

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:43.160
that if something isn't there,
that you could make it so.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:50.360
And so when I was at Palm
many years ago-- early 2000s,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.990
actually, about
16 years ago-- it

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.910
used to be that
you have to connect

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.530
your personal digital
assistant to your computer.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.700
And then you downloaded
the data through this wire

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.700
to this handheld device.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.866
And then you'd be like, ooh!

00:14:03.866 --> 00:14:04.500
Look at me!

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.400
I'm so cool with my
data on a little device.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.020
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
So mobile, right?

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.311
MINERVA TANTOCO: I'm so mobile.

00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:08.940
Right, exactly.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.231
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
You're connected to this wire.

00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:14.150
MINERVA TANTOCO: And
my team was like, boy.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.090
I wonder if we could do
this without the wire.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.290
You know, like, over
the air, we called it.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.270
OTA, Over The Air.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.330
And people were
like, you're crazy.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.820
You're fired.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.360
But we persisted.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.854
And we figured out, oh, OK.

00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:33.770
Well, there's this new
thing called Bluetooth.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.965
And there's this cool
new thing called 2G.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.530
Well, before that it
was just G, I guess.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.071
I don't know.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.970
And so we did that.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.670
And that was seven years before
the iPhone was even created.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.820
And so yes, in fact, people
thinking you're crazy

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.240
is probably a good sign.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.880
And that's what I
love about technology.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.990
And so I would
pursue it with all

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.180
of the sense of
play and creativity

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.903
that you can bring
to this career.

00:15:10.903 --> 00:15:18.670
And that's just such a privilege
to be part of an industry that

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.680
is in everything now,
including in government, which

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.500
is why I joined the New York
City government after 30 years

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.151
in tech.

00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:27.650
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: Yeah, and I

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.396
have a sense that when
you were coming up

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:31.770
with these different ideas
and trying to kind of put them

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.280
in front of people, it took
a lot of motivating others,

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:35.860
right?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.550
And I assume that there's
probably a high likelihood,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.070
if Palm was anything like Google
is, where you don't necessarily

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.640
have these people reporting
directly into you.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.710
And so you've got to
figure out how am I

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.920
going to get this
idea across the table,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.770
get it accepted, when
all of these people

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.287
don't actually work for me?

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.870
Can you tell us a
little bit about how

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.750
you developed that
ability to sort of manage

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.820
by influence and maybe how
some of us here in the room

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.274
can develop that capability?

00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:03.190
MINERVA TANTOCO: Yeah.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:08.230
Another great piece of advice,
especially for the CTO role,

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.290
because chief
technology officers

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.960
typically might have some
engineers reporting to them.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.850
But they don't have sales or
marketing reporting to them.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.720
They certainly don't
have the budget folks.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.610
And so 90% of your
power is going

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.580
to come from outside
your organization.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.890
And I think that just having
influencing skills generally

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.370
really is helpful to everyone,
no matter what your role.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.380
But it's especially
important when

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.140
you're trying to
get folks to follow

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:45.480
a strategy because a
strategy is just a plan.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.910
And it doesn't mean that
people have to follow it.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.210
You can't move people's
hands and make them type

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.435
what you want.

00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:54.970
Well, that would be nice.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.815
Maybe a robot.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.850
But I think the
way I learned it,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.470
it did start with
my first company

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.569
because I was still
a junior in college.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.260
I was, like, 20, 21.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.930
And almost everyone else in
the company was twice my age.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.950
We hired them, and
they reported to me.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.869
And I think part of
it is being able to be

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:21.010
persuasive by understanding
the motivations

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.680
and incentives of the people
that you're working with.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:30.420
To make it a win, win, win, win,
win is always a good approach.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.290
I think the biggest
lesson I learned

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.630
was that it's really
not about advocating

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.519
your position, as it were.

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:39.560
I think a lot of people
make that mistake-- like,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.300
if I could just shout
as loud as possible,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.410
everyone will agree with me.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.200
Although some people
might think that.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:55.720
It really is about listening
and empathizing with the folks

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.680
and understanding what
their point of view is

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.100
and figuring out a way
forward that everyone

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.497
can move in the same direction.

00:18:04.497 --> 00:18:06.830
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: Yeah,
you bring up a good point

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.966
there about just listening to
other people's perspectives.

00:18:09.966 --> 00:18:11.590
And that kind of
reminds me of the fact

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.600
that there's just a
diversity of perspectives,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.457
oftentimes, that you're
trying to pick up.

00:18:17.457 --> 00:18:19.790
And I wonder if you could
speak a little bit to the fact

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.920
that we often hear that we
should have more women or more

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.740
minorities at the table.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.240
And I'm not just talking
about kind of C-level

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.270
or in the boardroom,
but actually there

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.790
day-to-day, making the decisions
that drive the company forward.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.670
And I'd love to hear
your perspective

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.480
on why you think it's
important for a company

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.840
to be more diverse.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.620
MINERVA TANTOCO: Again,
that's definitely

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.710
one of my deepest passions
and one of the reasons

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.500
I took this role and have
been active in a lot of women

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.340
in tech initiatives
throughout my career

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.130
once I realized that I had
the ladies room all to myself.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:59.042 --> 00:19:03.310
It's nice, but,
you know-- I think

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:08.270
that there's a few factors.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.360
It's not just about fairness.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.360
We recognize that women-lead
companies outperform the S&amp;P

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.920
500 by three times.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.570
So it's a proven fact.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.120
Look it up.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.720
It's all on the web.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:30.370
A diversity on the board, a
diversity of perspectives,

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.030
is just good business,
as it turns out.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:38.390
On top of that, we just in New
York have 300,000 tech jobs.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.830
It generates $30
billion in wages.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.360
The US Department
of Labor published

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.970
that there will be
1.4 million tech

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:52.990
jobs available in the next
four years, by the year 2020.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:57.420
And yet we only have a pipeline
to fill 29% of those jobs.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:04.320
So if we're not tapping half
the talent of the country

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.390
to fill those jobs, then
our very economic survival,

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.010
our competitiveness, is at risk.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.090
So I think what we're
seeing now is, first of all,

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:19.190
tech is in everything, and
tech should be for everyone.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:26.720
And so as not to be totally
gloom and doom, some

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.000
of the initiatives that
we've done in the city

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.570
to promote more diversity in
tech-- it was actually just

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:39.160
in this building a little over a
year ago that someone asked me,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.370
how do we get more
girls to study coding?

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.790
And I said, well, we should
probably have it in all the New

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.600
York City public schools.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.870
And now, last October,
Mayor de Blasio

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.530
announced our Computer
Science for All,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:58.270
which is an $80 million, 10-year
program to offer computer

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:02.030
science education to every one
of those 1.1 million school

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.530
kids.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.276
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:04.651
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: Awesome.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.910
MINERVA TANTOCO: We also have
the Tech Talent Pipeline,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:17.230
which is a unique program
that aligns industry-- meaning

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.460
employers-- with the
skills that they need.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.520
And we find students who can
learn and take up those courses

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.304
and actually end up in jobs
within two years of starting

00:21:28.304 --> 00:21:29.470
in the Tech Talent Pipeline.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.760
I think we're in
our fifth cohort.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.100
It was started as a pilot--
a small, $10 million pilot.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.772
And the United States Tech Hire
program is modeled off of that.

00:21:39.772 --> 00:21:40.813
So that's going national.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.420
And I have the pleasure
of announcing--

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.010
so do we have Black Girls
Code in the room today?

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.230
So one of my favorite
organizations,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:59.250
they target young black women
from the age of seven to 17.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.260
It's San Francisco based.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.080
We can announce
today that Google

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.244
has agreed to give Black Girls
Code a permanent home in New

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:09.660
York, right here
in this building.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.756
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:13.255 --> 00:22:17.460
So I want to thank Black
Girls Code and Google

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.170
for all the work they're
doing to improve the diversity

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.589
of the tech industry.

00:22:23.589 --> 00:22:25.380
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
I appreciate that.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.870
We're super excited.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.810
And do you feel like there's
enough being done already?

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.030
You've just rattled
off quite a series

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.520
of initiatives and things.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.580
But do you feel like
there's enough awareness

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.255
and enough of a spotlight
on this topic generally?

00:22:38.255 --> 00:22:39.630
MINERVA TANTOCO:
I don't think we

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.616
can stop until we think
of coding as a girl thing.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.870
I love to say to companies,
when I talk to companies--

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.030
I recently talked to a
bunch of venture capitalists

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.820
who came in to look
at tech companies.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.310
And I said, the best way
to hire more women is

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.440
to hire more women.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.900
Just do it already.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.050
So I don't think we can stop.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:11.220
I think we've got a lot of
momentum and a ton of support

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.810
from the private sector, from
governments, from federal,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.220
city, and state levels.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.500
But we've got to keep it up.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.690
We want to create a tech
sector here in New York.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.470
We have the number one
spot in CrunchBase,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.360
which is the TechCrunch
database, for the most

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.420
women-founded tech
companies here in New York.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.890
Number one in the country.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.431
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: That's huge.

00:23:36.431 --> 00:23:37.430
[CHEERING]

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.950
MINERVA TANTOCO: So I think we
have an opportunity here in New

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.780
York to create a tech
sector that is for everyone

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.950
and is more diverse and more
welcoming, and therefore

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.970
better than all the
other tech sectors.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.220
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: Yeah.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.470
I love hearing that because
I think there's always

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.521
that rivalry, I
guess, if you will,

00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.520
between the different
tech centers in the world.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.200
And I certainly feel the New
York versus San Francisco one

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.280
quite deeply personally.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.080
I've lived on both coasts
as a result of my work.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.020
And I think there are elements
of each of those tech sectors

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.340
that are really interesting.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.610
But I think what is so
special about New York is just

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.010
that diversity that we have.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.450
It's the fact that when
I walk down the street,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.250
I'm hearing lots of different
languages around me.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.020
I'm encountering a
lot of different types

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.590
of people in my day to day.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.810
And I think that really can
help people spark ideas.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.620
And I think that's
why I'm really

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.190
interested in the startup
space in New York.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.640
And I know, having founded
a startup yourself,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.410
I wonder what you think
about women in startups?

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.950
And how do you see that
going forward in New York?

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.709
You mentioned the largest
number of female founders.

00:24:49.709 --> 00:24:51.500
But what about just
some of the folks here?

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.200
How might they start
to get involved?

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.170
MINERVA TANTOCO: First of all,
women tech founders rule, OK?

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:07.400
It really is that I'm just
living the dream here,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.850
being able to work with
so many great women

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.740
techies and women founders.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.910
But we're also looking
at the whole ecosystem.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.000
We want to create
more angel investment

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.650
in women founders
and more access

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.890
to capital, more
access to technology.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.980
And so for those of you who
have a great idea and you

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.390
want to develop it, there
are a ton of opportunities.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:35.540
You should definitely check out
our website called digital.nyc.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.190
That's sort of the one-stop
shop for all things tech.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.930
They've got all the
hackathons and classes.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.800
If you want to meet
other founders,

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.890
there's all kinds of startup
events over the weekend.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.560
So a typical hackathon
might be people

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.160
pitch their ideas on a Friday.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.960
Then on Saturday, develop the
idea, develop a presentation,

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.140
and maybe do a
little prototyping.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.200
Sunday, you're coming
up, finalizing, maybe,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.130
your business plan,
your monetization plan.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.660
And then there's a
judging, usually.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.660
And then the winner
gets something cool,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.110
plus bragging rights.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.810
And they have those every
weekend in New York,

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.290
a ton of them.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:25.010
So I think the best
way to learn anything

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.820
is to just go ahead and do it.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.480
And it's also a
fun social event.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.910
There are hackathons
just for women, as well,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.640
and girls hackathons and high
school hackathons and NASA data

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.390
hackathons.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.930
And so if you want to
get into data science,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.290
there are some
really great things

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.210
to do there-- the Museum of
Natural History, the NASA data

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.690
one, and then the New York
City BigApps competition,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.840
which is the largest civic
hacking competition around.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.800
So there's so many fun things.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.082
And it's really just like,
get up off your couch,

00:27:03.082 --> 00:27:07.520
go and put a name
tag on, and try it.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.220
And you will be amazed
and inspired by the people

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.070
that you meet.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.820
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: I'm sure.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.190
Judging from the looks
of you guys-- I mean,

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.910
this is quite a
turnout for a Saturday.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.790
So I have a small sense
that you guys might not

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.290
be too afraid of putting in a
few more hours on the weekend.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.840
So that sounds like some
great ideas for these guys.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.090
I think the other
thing that I've

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.380
noticed as I've kind
of looked at startups

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.030
and I've looked at the different
functions within startups

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.780
and then also at
the public sector

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:41.740
is just the trend, the
growing trend, towards CTOs

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.496
in the public sector.

00:27:43.496 --> 00:27:44.870
And I think whether
it's somebody

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.170
like my former boss, Megan
Smith over at the White House,

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:53.250
Sarah Wilkinson, who's
in the UK, or you,

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.520
I wonder how can we
foster more of this

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.611
and exposing more people to
what it's like to be a CTO?

00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:03.110
And how do you start to take
those initial steps to get down

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.400
that path?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.530
Yeah Of course,
I'm biased, but I

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.910
think CTO is a really,
really cool job.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.130
I mean, there are tons of
cool jobs in technology.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.365
But I think what's interesting
about the CTO role is

00:28:17.365 --> 00:28:21.360
it's always the intersection
of the technology

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.600
with the business
that you're in.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:31.390
So my first ever CTO job was
in 1997 at Grey Advertising.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.090
So we have this idea that maybe
the internet thing might have

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.644
some impact on advertising.

00:28:37.644 --> 00:28:40.980
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: Small inkling.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.410
And you have to imagine a
time when-- again, in '97,

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.840
it was just a couple years into
the web, the world wide web.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.900
And people didn't
have fast connections.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.120
And so if you wanted
to download an image,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.430
you could watch it
download a line at a time.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.620
And we had this cool idea that
you could click on an image,

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.203
and it would take
you to another site.

00:29:07.203 --> 00:29:09.670
Wow!

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:15.580
And so that created
this opportunity--

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.820
it was the first
ever CTO at Grey--

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.670
because it was like, wow, this
may be an entire new product

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:21.770
line here.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:27.120
You know, the click on a picture
and go somewhere product line.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:39.040
And so that was sort of my first
kind of exposure to the idea

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.520
that you could take all
that technical knowledge--

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.710
and clearly there was
a lot of technology.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.270
We later developed ways
to track the clicks

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.480
and blah, blah, blah.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.105
I don't need to bore
you with all that.

00:29:50.105 --> 00:29:53.380
You probably know--
but also to do it

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.340
in the service of
creating revenue, creating

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.430
new products with it.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:04.610
And so similar to
12 years earlier

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.840
thinking about the
artificial intelligence,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.810
and then how do you
create a product with that

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.130
and sell it to people
who will pay money for it

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.450
and things like that?

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.520
And so what I love
about the CTO role

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.980
is it is very much
rooted in engineering.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.514
But it's also understanding
what the applications of it are.

00:30:22.514 --> 00:30:24.180
And so when you apply
that to government

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.530
or when you apply
that to society,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.760
that's when you get
into the good stuff.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.070
So last year-- and
we just started

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:40.730
to put them in-- we were turning
all New York City's pay phones

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.050
into free Wi-Fi hotspots.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.830
Anybody use a payphone?

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:49.540
It's good for, like, hiding
from the rain, I guess.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.795
People put their coffee
cups and stuff in there.

00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:54.086
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: They
still have one at my gym.

00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:56.460
I can't figure out
why it's still there.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.930
MINERVA TANTOCO: Well, we can
turn it into a hotspot for you.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.370
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: That'd be great.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.860
MINERVA TANTOCO: So
that's a cool application.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.210
But even more importantly,
just providing more access,

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:12.410
providing more opportunities
for people to use technology.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:16.360
And how can we help
change society,

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.910
really, truly
democratize society

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.150
by providing more
technology for more people?

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.400
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: Yeah.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.700
And one of the things that
I love about technology

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.320
is just the flexibility
that can come with it.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.489
I mean, you know very well from
working in the mobile industry

00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:34.030
and everything just
sort of what that

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.190
has enabled us to do as humans.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.430
And I know I caught a glimpse
of your daughter over there.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.310
And I was just wondering,
how has technology

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.150
helped you do all that
you do, whether it's

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.044
in your role as a mother or
in your role as CTO and all

00:31:50.044 --> 00:31:51.710
the hobbies and things
that I'm sure you

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.774
have outside of all of that?

00:31:53.774 --> 00:31:54.690
MINERVA TANTOCO: Yeah.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.830
I mean, I like to think,
and there's-- I don't want

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.538
to embarrass her.

00:31:57.538 --> 00:32:01.830
But it's funny because they
story that I like to tell

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.390
is that the day I found out I
was going to be offered the CTO

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:10.000
job, I also found out that
I was going to have a child.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.370
And that was 17 and
eight months ago.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:20.360
And I was really struck
by-- I was just stopped.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.800
I was wondering,
should I take this job?

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.820
Should I take the
big tech job and try

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.790
and be a mom at the same time?

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:34.920
And luckily for me, I talked to
a really good friend who said,

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.480
why are you even choosing?

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.614
You're going to
be great at both.

00:32:38.614 --> 00:32:40.280
I don't know if my
daughter would agree,

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:46.960
but-- and so later
on, I realized

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.740
that I wanted to be
home in the evenings.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.710
And at that time, you
had to be in your office

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.150
to get your email.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.050
And so I thought,
I've got to figure out

00:32:56.050 --> 00:33:00.516
a way that I could check my
email securely from home.

00:33:00.516 --> 00:33:01.890
And then later,
that turned into,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.470
how do I get my email on
a phone, also securely,

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:08.260
so that I could go home,
make dinner, and then do

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.320
some work after dinner?

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.670
And so that was
one of the projects

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:16.140
that I did very early on and
how I even got into mobile tech

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.730
originally, was so that I
could have the flexibility

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:25.380
to still be able to do work,
take meetings, and do emails,

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.750
but pushing a stroller in
the park at the same time.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.735
So in many ways, being a mom
made me a better technologist,

00:33:33.735 --> 00:33:35.709
and not the other way around.

00:33:35.709 --> 00:33:38.000
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: I
think that's a great message

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.360
for people because too often,
I think people kind of can get

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.720
hung up on feeling like
they can only do one thing

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.996
and do one thing really well.

00:33:46.996 --> 00:33:48.620
And I think that
you're a prime example

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.850
of being able to do a lot
of things really well.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.654
And so I encourage all
of you to take that step

00:33:53.654 --> 00:33:55.570
and to kind of really
put yourselves out there

00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:00.090
when you're faced with multiple
things to take on at once.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:04.210
So I'd love to ask you a little
bit about the recent tech

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.569
awards that were
hosted in New York.

00:34:06.569 --> 00:34:09.110
So can you tell me about some
of the people that were honored

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:09.777
that night?

00:34:09.777 --> 00:34:10.860
MINERVA TANTOCO: Oh, yeah.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.580
This was an incredible,
inspiring event last week.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.330
It was the first ever
Diversity in Tech awards.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.350
It was sponsored by
Code Interactive, one

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:26.440
of the great nonprofits who
are providing coding courses

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.409
all around New York
City public schools.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.469
And the honorees were amazing.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:38.139
One honoree was CSNYC,
Computer Science New York City,

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:41.120
which was founded by
Fred Wilson, who's

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.969
one of the partners at
Union Square Ventures.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:47.699
They are the city's partners in
the computer science for all.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.600
So it was a combination of this
public-private partnership that

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.300
made it possible between
the Department of Education,

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.969
city hall, and CSNYC.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.150
And they were one of the
recipients of the award.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.190
One of my favorites
is Julia Geist.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:09.570
She was a student at the
Tech Talent Pipeline.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:14.922
And she is now an
engineer at WikiHub.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.880
So she also received
an award because it

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.300
didn't take her long to feel
like she also had to give back,

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.100
just two years in.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.390
So there were some
amazing folks that night.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:34.730
It was sort of the cap-off
to social media week.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:40.940
But it just showed
how much support

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.610
there is to provide more
opportunities to more

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.450
people and all of the
great organizations

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.260
that are in New York that
are out there to help.

00:35:52.812 --> 00:35:55.020
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: So
how are we doing on time?

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.820
I think we may want to start
to wrap up so that we can

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.220
save some time for questions.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.340
So maybe I'll close on
something forward-looking.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.610
I'd love to know what is your
vision for the New York City

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.270
tech community in the
next five to 10 years?

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.970
And then, when you even think
beyond the next five to 10

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.140
years and you're
thinking about, what's

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.270
the person who's sitting in your
job, say 15, 20 years from now,

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.880
what do you hope
are the problems

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.584
or challenges that they'll
be solving at that point?

00:36:23.584 --> 00:36:24.500
MINERVA TANTOCO: Yeah.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.440
I think we're seeing some of
the seeds of this amazing future

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.882
of New York City already.

00:36:30.882 --> 00:36:32.340
One of the biggest
trends, I think,

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.460
is the notion of
social innovation,

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.650
that is, tech for good.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.570
Because being a woman in
tech and being a coder

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.560
is a superpower.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.690
And we need to use our
superpowers for good.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:48.440
How can we use technology to
help the poorest among us,

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.120
the immigrants, the
people that have no voice?

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.770
And one of the
privileges of my role

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.800
is I get to see all the people
that are making that happen.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:07.736
And so, yes, it's OK to use
tech to sell a few more pencils

00:37:07.736 --> 00:37:10.360
or, do you want some socks
to go with those pencils?

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.010
Whatever it is.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:17.200
But to be able to use
those kinds of technologies

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.810
to really deliver government
services where they can

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:24.520
do the most good, to
come up with new wireless

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.740
technologies that
will expand broadband

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:32.070
to the digital deserts,
that is really taking hold.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.010
And I think New
York City really is

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.050
the epicenter of a
lot of that activity

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:41.210
because it's an ecosystem
of social do-gooder techies

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.830
that are all meeting and
percolating together.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.290
When we think about the
city streets and the idea

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:52.150
of a connected city, again,
I see a huge opportunity,

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.600
where right now we have a lot
of the personal technology.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.560
And sometimes, that has the
effect of actually alienating

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.200
us from each other.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.040
We're there, but
we're not there.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.190
You know, that photo
of everyone at dinner,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.890
but they're all
looking at their phone.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.440
Like, are they at
dinner together, really?

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.980
Or are they just sitting within
a few feet of each other,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.040
but doing something
someplace else?

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.820
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: I saw a couple

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.111
on a date the other night
that was very much like that.

00:38:18.111 --> 00:38:20.220
I was like, I'm pretty
sure they're on a date.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.157
Neither of them was
talking to each other,

00:38:22.157 --> 00:38:24.490
and they were both looking
at their phones for, like, 30

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.440
minutes while we were
just kind of passing by.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.751
So I completely understand
that concept of alienation.

00:38:29.751 --> 00:38:31.250
MINERVA TANTOCO:
And I think that we

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.770
can have a notion
of technology that

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.660
actually connects us better.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.780
And there's no better place
than in sort of public spaces.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.300
So yes, we're going to have
the self-driving cars that you

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.050
can call up with your phone.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.400
That's all going to
happen, for sure.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.770
But also, I think we
have an opportunity

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:54.710
to say, how can we connect
the virtual and physical

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.840
communities to
connect to each other?

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.010
And how do we make
our streets safer?

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:05.284
How do we use technology
to band together?

00:39:05.284 --> 00:39:07.980
I've seen a lot of apps
that are like, well,

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.380
who are the homebound
folks in your building?

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.930
And maybe you could bring
them food once in a while.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:20.380
Or in an emergency, how we get
together and help our neighbors

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.570
who might be flooded out.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.530
And so I think we
have a real, not just

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.360
an opportunity but
a responsibility,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.590
as folks who have
this superpower,

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.960
to really figure out the
vision of New York City

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.240
as a smart and equitable
city, a city whose heart

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.292
is as big as our brains.

00:39:40.292 --> 00:39:42.750
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: That's
an amazing picture and kind

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.420
of painting in your head to
go off into the world with.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.480
So I know I for one am
very excited to continue

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.940
to work here and be able to
experience life in New York

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.096
and work in New York.

00:39:53.096 --> 00:39:54.720
And I'm really
appreciative that you've

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.311
given me some time to get to
know you a little bit better.

00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:59.560
And I feel like since I've
had the privilege of asking

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.560
all the questions, maybe
I should turn it over

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.300
to you guys.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.260
And so if you guys
have any questions,

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.030
feel free to go up
to the mics, and I'm

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.022
sure Minerva would
love to answer.

00:40:09.022 --> 00:40:09.980
AUDIENCE: Hi, everyone.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.790
My name is Maureen.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.070
I am a [INAUDIBLE] advisor.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.030
And I've got, actually,
two questions.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.610
I'm going to keep
it really quick.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.007
The first is for the audience.

00:40:18.007 --> 00:40:19.840
Rarely do you ask
questions to the audience,

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.010
but just by a show of
hands, how many people

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.670
here came to obviously
meet new folks

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.670
and hopefully collaborate
on different projects?

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.530
Just by a show of hands.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.070
We know you've got
full-time jobs.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:31.720
OK, cool.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.220
Awesome.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.160
And Minerva, can you talk
about artificial intelligence

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.250
and some of the use cases for
some of the top companies?

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.350
What are they doing with
artificial intelligence,

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.860
now and in the next five years?

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.437
Thanks.

00:40:42.437 --> 00:40:43.520
MINERVA TANTOCO: Oh, cool.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.120
I love the geeky questions.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.935
Thank you for that.

00:40:47.935 --> 00:40:48.435
Oh!

00:40:48.435 --> 00:40:50.850
I love geeking out.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:57.124
So when I started 30 years ago,
the biggest change between then

00:40:57.124 --> 00:40:58.790
and now-- and people
ask, why didn't you

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.755
continue with your AI after
you sold your first company?

00:41:01.755 --> 00:41:05.330
And the truth is that
between 1990 and 2000,

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.170
it's called the AI winter.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.660
Everybody was
really disappointed

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.310
that AI didn't deliver
what it promised.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.560
And all of the
venture capital for AI

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.530
dried up during that decade.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.320
So I found other
stuff to do, clearly.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.870
But now, we have an even
more powerful opportunity

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.830
with artificial
intelligence because we

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.090
have three main factors.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.390
One, we have massive compute
now because of the way

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.060
that we can do.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.000
We were working on--
this well before even

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.540
the 286 was invented.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:40.670
So I won't bore you, but we
had to basically turn a crank

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.340
to make the computer go.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:49.480
And secondly, we have
massive data because before,

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.030
we couldn't compute
all that data.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.120
And now we've got
massive data from which

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.920
to apply the deep learning to.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.770
And the third big
component, of course,

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.200
is the massive connectivity.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.700
So 30 years ago, it
was pre-internet.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.500
And those three things
are the magic sauce

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.830
that's now why AI and just
sort of intelligence systems

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:18.280
generally is finally
coming into its own.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.990
And so what I see
is a future not

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.390
of replacing human
intelligence, which

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:26.230
is what artificial
intelligence means sometimes.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.340
I think of AI now as an
intelligent assistance.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.780
It's going to allow
us to really process

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.720
all the crazy amounts of
data because now, we're

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.870
spewing terabytes of
data every few minutes--

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:43.470
my watch, the phones,
everybody's phone

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:46.310
is spewing out all kinds
of data and information.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.800
So I think we can use
intelligent assistance

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.330
to help us make humans
smarter instead of trying

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.844
to replace what humans do.

00:42:56.844 --> 00:42:57.510
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.110
Thank you.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.450
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: Thank you.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:00.390
My name's Kelby.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:01.806
I'm from Florida
State University.

00:43:01.806 --> 00:43:03.370
I'm a sophomore.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.561
Just a quick question
regarding women in tech--

00:43:05.561 --> 00:43:07.810
so there's something that
you said that kind of really

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:08.650
spoke to me.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:13.030
And recently, I went into an
interview with a tech company,

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:16.040
and the interviewer
was like, well, yeah.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.790
You're a woman.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.540
That's part of the
reason why you're here.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.274
And I was like, hmm.

00:43:20.274 --> 00:43:21.190
He's like, no, no, no.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.060
You're qualified, but-- and
every time somebody says "but,"

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.960
they don't mean what
they said at first.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.980
And it is a common theme here
to get more women in tech.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.000
And you want to see
more women in tech.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.410
However, do you feel that
there will come a day whenever

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.000
there's too many women, and men
suddenly become the minority?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.710
And how do we stop that because
one thing that's very important

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.820
is that women are
underrepresented in the tech

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.320
field.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.220
And everything
that's being created

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.630
is all by a male's mentality.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.050
So by getting women in and
being able to collaborate,

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:55.960
we have both sides.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.010
But do you think there
will ever be a day where

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.080
women become too much?

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.230
And how do we stop
that from happening?

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.785
How do we get to
the perfect 50/50?

00:44:06.887 --> 00:44:08.970
MINERVA TANTOCO: It's such
an interesting question

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:15.580
because I don't know if the idea
is to be this perfect 50-50.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:22.630
What I look at as my parents and
grandparents grew up in a time

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:26.820
where being a woman doctor
or being a woman lawyer

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.320
was a big deal.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:34.400
I look forward to the time
when it's just not a big deal.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:39.930
That it's just like, yeah, woman
doctor and woman technologist.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:45.170
So whether that's a percentage,
it's much more cultural,

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:50.610
this idea that-- I think
we're right to bring attention

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.810
to it now because
it's clearly an issue,

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:59.920
economic and fairness,
for both those reasons.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.420
But also, my dream is
that, yeah, you're a baker.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.320
You're a mom.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.687
You're a crossfitter.

00:45:09.687 --> 00:45:14.120
Oh, and you're an AI scientist.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.600
And so that's my vision
of where things can go.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:26.744
And I hope that events like
this sort of make it OK.

00:45:26.744 --> 00:45:27.910
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.035
MINERVA TANTOCO: Thank you.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.900
Hi.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.191
AUDIENCE: My name is Stephanie.

00:45:33.191 --> 00:45:36.440
I'm a student at the
Flatiron school right now.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.630
My question is we've got the
New York City digital map.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.670
We've got open-source data.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.920
What piece of technology
that will make for a more

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.310
cohesive, accessible
city are you

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:52.938
most excited about right now?

00:45:55.895 --> 00:45:57.270
MINERVA TANTOCO:
You mean besides

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:02.195
the free Wi-Fi hotspots,
which is pretty cool?

00:46:03.465 --> 00:46:05.340
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA:
People have actually

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.840
talked about moving
their offices,

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.742
I think, to the bus stop
because the Wi-Fi's better there

00:46:09.742 --> 00:46:11.450
than it is in their
office or their home.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:12.700
MINERVA TANTOCO: Yes, exactly.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:13.572
Exactly.

00:46:13.572 --> 00:46:15.810
I was talking to
someone who was like,

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:19.060
I'm going to have a business
where I just rent chairs

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.900
for $1 next to those things.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.299
But I think that some of
the cool-- so you're saying,

00:46:27.299 --> 00:46:28.590
what are some of the cool tech?

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:31.920
Well, I'll say something that
my team worked on last fall.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.119
We just launched a beta.

00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:34.660
So what's also
exciting is that we're

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.334
able to innovate in government.

00:46:36.334 --> 00:46:38.000
Those are two words
that a lot of people

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.740
don't usually put together.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.400
Beta test is another one.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.630
So we took some open
data and decided

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:49.120
to expand it to make
it easier for residents

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.010
because we realized
that open data's great.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.000
It's fantastic.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.060
But not everyone's
a data scientist.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.487
I'd love that to be the case.

00:46:56.487 --> 00:46:58.570
So we created this thing
called neighborhoods.nyc.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.510
And what it is is you
go to neighborhoods.nyc.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.900
You pick your neighborhood.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.830
And you get all of the
most popular open data

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.840
feeds by neighborhood.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.650
So you could look
up chelsea.nyc,

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.450
and it has the alternate
side of the street parking.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:20.440
Everybody loves
the health ratings,

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.890
including the restaurant
ratings and rat

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:26.930
sightings and the garbage
pickups and all that.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:29.570
Because we looked at what
was the most popular one?

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.650
But it didn't come
in a localized form.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:37.020
So we partnered with one of the
winners of BigApps, Vizalytics.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.900
And now we're trying it out.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.310
So please do try the
neighborhoods.nyc.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:42.630
Find your neighborhood.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.920
We hope that we can add
more and more content

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.527
with communities
getting involved.

00:47:47.527 --> 00:47:48.610
So that's really exciting.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.500
That link between the physical
and virtual communities

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.896
is sort of the thing
that we're driving for.

00:47:53.896 --> 00:47:54.710
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.550
That's actually on my
very long list of apps

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.580
that I've started brainstorming.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.400
So I'll definitely check it out.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:01.740
MINERVA TANTOCO: All right.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.135
AUDIENCE: And I
won't build my own.

00:48:03.135 --> 00:48:04.040
MINERVA TANTOCO: Cool.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.998
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'll move
on to something else.

00:48:05.998 --> 00:48:06.580
Thank you.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.280
MINERVA TANTOCO: Thank you.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:07.700
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: And I think

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.329
I'm getting the signal back
there that we have time for, I

00:48:10.329 --> 00:48:11.370
think, one more question.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:12.746
So you'll be our last.

00:48:12.746 --> 00:48:14.120
I think the good
news is you guys

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.900
can come and find us afterwards
if you want to ask a few more.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.530
But please, do us service.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.660
AUDIENCE: Sure thing.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.160
I'm Meghan.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.520
I'm a senior developer.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.310
We talked a lot today
about getting more women

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.090
into the pipeline.

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:31.080
But something that I've
found just in my career

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.680
is that keeping women there
is just as much of an issue.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.190
And I was wondering
what your thoughts were

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.930
around that, and whether it
could come from the government

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.650
level, trickle-down,
or if it needs

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:45.062
to be within the
organizations themselves?

00:48:45.062 --> 00:48:46.860
MINERVA TANTOCO:
Yeah, I'm with you.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:53.890
I think that I also focus a lot
on the mid-career female tech,

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:54.450
as well.

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:56.040
Because like, oh,
you're going great,

00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.930
gangbusters for those
first 10 years or so.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:03.990
And then you hit a bump in the
road, like, oh, I'm pregnant,

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.150
or whatever that is.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:11.640
And you might seriously
consider dropping out.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.180
And I think that's when
you need the intervention

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.390
from the company, from the
mentorship, and programs

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:21.470
for women to come back
from maternity leave.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:27.850
The idea that you
could have flextime.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.960
And I love the idea that
paternity leave is actually

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.380
a big feminist issue.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.400
I think that's really
important, too.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.630
And so for me,
what really helped

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:41.370
me was all the great support
and mentors that I had.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.750
It's hard.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.220
Any job is hard.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:50.230
But sort of being that
lone unicorn in the room

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:53.510
is even harder, and you
feel a lot more pressure.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.630
And I guess I'm here
to say, there's so much

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.220
support out there for you.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.610
Don't be afraid to ask.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:02.550
Don't feel like you
have to go it alone.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.400
And you'll be
amazed and inspired

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.450
by how much help you
get because everybody

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.987
wants you to stay and succeed.

00:50:10.987 --> 00:50:11.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.550
HEATHER THOMPSON
RIVERA: Awesome.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:14.710
Well, guys, thank you
all so much for coming.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.900
And Minerva, thank you so much
for spending some time with us.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.590
MINERVA TANTOCO: Oh, thank you.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.270
It's been an honor.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.645
HEATHER THOMPSON RIVERA: Great.

00:50:18.645 --> 00:50:19.145
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:19.145 --> 00:50:20.410
Awesome to meet you.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:21.535
MINERVA TANTOCO: Thank you.

00:50:21.535 --> 00:50:22.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.560
