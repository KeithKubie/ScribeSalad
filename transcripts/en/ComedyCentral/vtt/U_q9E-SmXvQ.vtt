00:00:02.531 --> 00:00:04.531
- So I'm here, and uh...

00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:08.218
- So Jason, Busy tells me that you might

00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:11.301
have some reservations about therapy,

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.086
and I want you to know

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:18.119
that I am going to be impartial, always,

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.286
because my job is to make things
better for the two of you.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.337
Busy tells me that sometimes
you find her to be controlling.

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:29.501
- Uuhhh

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:30.454
- I think that's fair.

00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:31.945
- Yeah. Okay, yeah, sometimes

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:33.573
I do find her a little controlling.

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:34.406
- Yeah.

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:35.629
- Yeah, well that can be a tough thing

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.796
and believe it or not, I'm that
way with my wife sometimes.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:41.639
- Oh! Yeah!

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:45.553
- Shoot! You know what I'm
sorry, I think I left my phone

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:48.602
in the waiting room. I'm just
gonna grab it, two seconds.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.035
- Come right back.

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:51.702
- I will, of course.

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:58.868
- C'mere. C'mere! Listen
dude, I want you to know

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:01.257
that I totally have your back, okay?

00:01:01.257 --> 00:01:05.272
No matter what is said in
here, I'm on your side bro.

00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:07.697
Okay? Do you know what I'm saying?

00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:08.854
- What do you mean?

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:12.298
- What do I mean? She's in her own world!

00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:16.107
Look, we're a coupla guys.
Dudes back each other up.

00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:18.812
Okay? We're dudes. I'm gonna back you up.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.878
- Oh no no, you don't have to do that.

00:01:20.878 --> 00:01:22.115
- No I'm going to do it.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:22.948
- No no no. That's okay.

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.317
- Shut up. Here she comes.

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.261
(Busy clears her throat)

00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.428
- [Busy] Oh gosh. Sorry. Embarrassing.

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:31.772
- Any calls? Everything okay?

00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:33.279
- Oh no, I just didn't want to leave it

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.716
because I have lost like, four phones.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:38.074
- [Dr. Glen] So Jason, go on.

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:42.241
- Um, well, yeah, she's a
little controlling sometimes

00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:46.667
and that, you know, I just, kinda,

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.431
it feels like it encroaches
on my freedom a little bit.

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:54.333
- Mmm hmm. Do you feel that's
an accurate characterization?

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.205
Do you feel that sometimes you
are controlling with Jason?

00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:58.421
- [Busy] Well, yeah, I mean to be fair,

00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:00.008
we have two children,

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:01.612
we have a lot of responsibility.

00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:03.991
I'm the one that, I mean...

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.635
- She makes all the money.

00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:07.887
- Right. I'm over here,
I'm doing this thing,

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:09.553
and I'm over there and
I'm doing that thing

00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:11.718
and I'm parenting the
kids, so when I ask you

00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:14.023
to pick up milk it's not an order,

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:16.612
it's not me being
controlling when I ask you

00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:18.212
to come home at 10:00 p.m.,

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:20.407
as opposed to staying out til three.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:23.926
- Right, right, I'm working
when I'm out that late.

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.351
I mean I'm like doing stand-up, or I'm--

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.975
- I mean like hanging out in
a club is work, I don't know.

00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:27.808
- [Jason] Yeah.

00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:28.641
- [Busy] I don't know.

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:30.007
- A big component of your job,

00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:32.756
as I understand it, is hanging out.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:36.186
There's a social component
to stand-up comedy

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:38.384
that is, uh, it's being in those clubs,

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:40.809
and that's a big part of
how connections are made.

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.535
Getting work and securing future work.

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:43.680
- I just haven't thought of it that way.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.663
- That's right.

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.798
- That it was more making
business connections.

00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:48.462
- You know I'm sure you would be able to

00:02:48.462 --> 00:02:51.163
tell Busy that there's an unpleasantness

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:54.908
to this hanging out, you wish
you could be home sometimes,

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.920
but then it's all part of the business.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.842
- You see why I wanna
come? Isn't he the best?

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:03.509
- He's the best! This
is great! Doctor Glen!
