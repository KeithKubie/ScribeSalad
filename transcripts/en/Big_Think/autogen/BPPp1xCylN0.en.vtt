if we know stem cells exist in the body

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
if we know stem cells exist in the body
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.430
if we know stem cells exist in the body
and other tissues besides the blood what

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
and other tissues besides the blood what
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.440
and other tissues besides the blood what
we know is that those cells have

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450
we know is that those cells have
 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.140
we know is that those cells have
important roles in making the tissue

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
important roles in making the tissue
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.960
important roles in making the tissue
when we're first forming developing also

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
when we're first forming developing also
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.650
when we're first forming developing also
in maintaining tissue but we don't think

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
in maintaining tissue but we don't think
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720
in maintaining tissue but we don't think
of them as doing a tremendous amount in

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
of them as doing a tremendous amount in
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.390
of them as doing a tremendous amount in
the setting of injury so there are stem

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400
the setting of injury so there are stem
 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.450
the setting of injury so there are stem
cells in places like the brain they

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
cells in places like the brain they
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.189
cells in places like the brain they
clearly don't have much ability to

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199
clearly don't have much ability to
 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.479
clearly don't have much ability to
restore function and someone has a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
restore function and someone has a
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.299
restore function and someone has a
stroke and one of the questions is if

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
stroke and one of the questions is if
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790
stroke and one of the questions is if
those cells can be identified can be

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
those cells can be identified can be
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.130
those cells can be identified can be
isolated can be shown to grow and do

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
isolated can be shown to grow and do
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.540
isolated can be shown to grow and do
lots of different things in the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
lots of different things in the
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090
lots of different things in the
laboratory why can't we get them to turn

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
laboratory why can't we get them to turn
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670
laboratory why can't we get them to turn
on and be more effective to regenerate

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
on and be more effective to regenerate
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560
on and be more effective to regenerate
tissue in somebody with an injury like

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
tissue in somebody with an injury like
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540
tissue in somebody with an injury like
stroke or like Parkinson's disease and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
stroke or like Parkinson's disease and
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.389
stroke or like Parkinson's disease and
one of the issues now is to then think

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
one of the issues now is to then think
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.790
one of the issues now is to then think
about not necessarily taking the sells

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
about not necessarily taking the sells
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.770
about not necessarily taking the sells
out because they live in a very deep

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
out because they live in a very deep
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719
out because they live in a very deep
spot in the brain a place what no one

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
spot in the brain a place what no one
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.600
spot in the brain a place what no one
really wants to go in and biopsy that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
really wants to go in and biopsy that
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550
really wants to go in and biopsy that
may be what we can do is understand how

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
may be what we can do is understand how
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520
may be what we can do is understand how
to turn them on so this idea that we

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
to turn them on so this idea that we
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.400
to turn them on so this idea that we
might be able to develop medicines that

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410
might be able to develop medicines that
 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.410
might be able to develop medicines that
now activate stem cells that we know

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
now activate stem cells that we know
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.080
now activate stem cells that we know
exists in many of our tissues is an

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
exists in many of our tissues is an
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.749
exists in many of our tissues is an
ongoing very active aspect of research

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
ongoing very active aspect of research
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.330
ongoing very active aspect of research
so you can imagine that case what we

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
so you can imagine that case what we
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.919
so you can imagine that case what we
might be thinking about is not so much

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929
might be thinking about is not so much
 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.100
might be thinking about is not so much

that we already know a lot about and now
asking those medicines to change the

asking those medicines to change the
context to change the signals the

become more active in regenerating
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.540
become more active in regenerating
rather than just essentially maintaining

there are ways in which this technology
 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.399
there are ways in which this technology
could be viewed as something that would

could be viewed as something that would
be potentially a threat to the

pharmaceutical industry I think most of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930
pharmaceutical industry I think most of
 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.030
pharmaceutical industry I think most of
the pharmaceutical industries are

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
the pharmaceutical industries are
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.720
the pharmaceutical industries are
excited about this area there caution

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
excited about this area there caution
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.080
excited about this area there caution
comes more from the concern as to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
comes more from the concern as to
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.530
comes more from the concern as to
whether this to know exactly how to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540
whether this to know exactly how to
 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.990
whether this to know exactly how to
utilize this new biology in a way that

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000
utilize this new biology in a way that
 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
utilize this new biology in a way that
will result in products that can really

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
will result in products that can really
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.210
will result in products that can really
make a difference for people and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
make a difference for people and
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.039
make a difference for people and
developing products is of course a very

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049
developing products is of course a very
 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.250
developing products is of course a very
long sequence of events when we're

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260
long sequence of events when we're
 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.710
long sequence of events when we're
dealing with entities that are trying to

dealing with entities that are trying to
 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.039
dealing with entities that are trying to
forestall for the deterioration or

the pharmaceutical industry has worked

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
the pharmaceutical industry has worked
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.960
the pharmaceutical industry has worked
out very well over a long period of time

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970
out very well over a long period of time
 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.740
out very well over a long period of time
and are clearly outstanding at doing so

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750
and are clearly outstanding at doing so
 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.780
and are clearly outstanding at doing so
how to use the idea of a regenerative

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790
how to use the idea of a regenerative
 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.030
how to use the idea of a regenerative
process that's something that's very

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040
process that's something that's very
 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.509
process that's something that's very
complicated and it's still very much in

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519
complicated and it's still very much in
 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.690
complicated and it's still very much in
the days of early exploration so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700
the days of early exploration so
 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.180
the days of early exploration so
understandably pharmaceutical companies

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190
understandably pharmaceutical companies
 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.729
understandably pharmaceutical companies
and generally the commercial side of

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739
and generally the commercial side of
 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.699

health care has been in the wings trying

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709
health care has been in the wings trying
 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.860
health care has been in the wings trying
to understand to assess to really think

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
to understand to assess to really think
 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.809
to understand to assess to really think
about how you might be able to actually

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819
about how you might be able to actually
 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.789
about how you might be able to actually
lay out a path to move forward to the

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799
lay out a path to move forward to the
 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.830
lay out a path to move forward to the
clinic I think now there are a couple of

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
clinic I think now there are a couple of
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.860
clinic I think now there are a couple of
developments in the field where the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870
developments in the field where the
 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.569
developments in the field where the
pharmaceutical industry has started to

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579
pharmaceutical industry has started to
 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.400
pharmaceutical industry has started to
get engaged one of them is this idea

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
get engaged one of them is this idea
 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.550
get engaged one of them is this idea
that we can make models of diseases in

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560
that we can make models of diseases in
 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.860
that we can make models of diseases in
the petri dish that of course then

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870
the petri dish that of course then
 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.259
the petri dish that of course then
becomes terrific raw material for drug

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269
becomes terrific raw material for drug
 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.780
becomes terrific raw material for drug
companies to be able to use it and try

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790
companies to be able to use it and try
 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.699
companies to be able to use it and try
to develop new therapies and we've

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709
to develop new therapies and we've
 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.680
to develop new therapies and we've
clearly seen that large pharmaceutical

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690
clearly seen that large pharmaceutical
 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.619
clearly seen that large pharmaceutical
industry players are getting actively

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629
industry players are getting actively
 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.030
industry players are getting actively
involved in that not i think is a real

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
involved in that not i think is a real
 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.449
involved in that not i think is a real
advantage for them and for the field

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459
advantage for them and for the field
 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.819
advantage for them and for the field
this idea of using drugs to regenerate

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829
this idea of using drugs to regenerate
 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.759
this idea of using drugs to regenerate
tissue activating what are the stem

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769
tissue activating what are the stem
 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.210
tissue activating what are the stem
cells within that's an area that they're

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220
cells within that's an area that they're
 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.089
cells within that's an area that they're
just starting to pick up on and I think

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099
just starting to pick up on and I think
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.150
just starting to pick up on and I think
that still it's still complicated models

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160
that still it's still complicated models
 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.370
that still it's still complicated models
and in general the pharmaceutical

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380
and in general the pharmaceutical
 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.649
and in general the pharmaceutical
industry doesn't have these complicated

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659
industry doesn't have these complicated
 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.440
industry doesn't have these complicated
animal models in hell

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450
animal models in hell
 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.360
animal models in hell
and so they need to partner with

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370
and so they need to partner with
 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.180
and so they need to partner with
academic teams that work on those things

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190
academic teams that work on those things
 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.310
academic teams that work on those things
and that's starting to happen as well so

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320
and that's starting to happen as well so
 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.340
and that's starting to happen as well so
I think we're starting to see that what

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350
I think we're starting to see that what
 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.320
I think we're starting to see that what
used to be a purely academic endeavor

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330
used to be a purely academic endeavor
 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.450
used to be a purely academic endeavor
and frankly one limited to the number of

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460
and frankly one limited to the number of
 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.450
and frankly one limited to the number of
academic centers that could get around

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460
academic centers that could get around
 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.930
academic centers that could get around
some of the limitations that government

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940
some of the limitations that government
 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.050
some of the limitations that government
funding had in the field is starting to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060
funding had in the field is starting to
 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.910
funding had in the field is starting to
break and now we're starting to connect

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920
break and now we're starting to connect
 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.540
break and now we're starting to connect
both with other sources of funding in

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550
both with other sources of funding in
 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.460
both with other sources of funding in
terms of the academic enterprise but

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470
terms of the academic enterprise but
 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.280
terms of the academic enterprise but
also bridging the gap into the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290
also bridging the gap into the
 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.570
also bridging the gap into the
commercial world where we're starting to

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
commercial world where we're starting to
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.560
commercial world where we're starting to
really think about what are the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570
really think about what are the
 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.280
really think about what are the
applications that might turn to dem cell

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290
applications that might turn to dem cell
 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.410
applications that might turn to dem cell
biology into stem cell medicine and

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420
biology into stem cell medicine and
 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.360
biology into stem cell medicine and
that's clearly a critically important

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370
that's clearly a critically important
 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.500
that's clearly a critically important
component of the work of the next five
