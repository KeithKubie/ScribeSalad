00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.769
Pulling on your swim trunks, hopping in the
car and going to the beach is a scene you

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:13.050
probably don't associate with winter, unless,
you like a good 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.990
Polar Bear Swim.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.720
The polar bear plunge seems like a crazy thing
to do.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.721
Firstly, if you're not familiar, a polar bear
swim is a when a person jumps into a body

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:26.119
of water when it's cold outside.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.440
Over 2000 people do it at Coney Island, outside
of New York City, on January 1st, every year.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.410
These cray people are members of the Polar
Bear Club, and they literally do this for

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.850
fun, all the time.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.890
I'm cold inside just THINKING about doing
this, but what it DOES to your body… is

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.970
pretty damn cool; no pun intended.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.170
Physiologically, the human body thinks of
anything below 70 degrees as a "cold" temperature;

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.920
we evolved in Africa, cold isn't really part
of our inherent biological programming.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.200
So, when you jump into 40 degree (4.5 C) water,
your body goes into cold shock response.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.600
The body will constrict blood vessels at the
surface of the skin, increase respiration

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.429
-- usually you'll see people gasping for air
-- and a surge in heart rate.

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.319
There's no real danger, unless the swimmer
has a heart condition.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:17.939
Hypothermia isn't likely either; the core
body temperature can maintain for a long while;

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.700
though arms and legs will become very cold.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.399
You'd have to stay in the water for 30 minutes
before you'd need to worry.

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.919
Winter swimming isn't just a novelty practice
to shock the system.

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:34.060
There are actual scientific benefits.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.279
In Northern Europe, plunging into icy cold
water is considered a stress reliever, usually

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:40.009
after a period in a sauna.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.009
A study in the International Journal of Circumpolar
Health found an improvement of general well-being

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.419
versus a control group.

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:52.869
They followed two groups of people over a
winter season, after four months, the people

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.079
who participated in winter swimming "felt
themselves to be more energetic, active and

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.639
brisk" but also reported a relief of pains
from rheumatism, fibromyalgia, and asthma!

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.960
Reports from people who participate in the
annual Coney Island dip report feeling invigorated

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.030
and relaxed after the experience -- this is
due to the adrenaline and stress hormone release

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.080
in response to the cold shock.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.669
It's essentially triggering your fight-or-flight
response, but not following up with any danger

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.469
-- this results in temporary euphoria!

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.659
Another peer-reviewed study in QJM found people
who participate in regular winter swimming

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.970
experienced oxidative stress, which caused
their bodies to increase their natural antioxidant

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.970
levels!

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.010
Even further studies found winter swimmers
have stronger circulation and a 40 percent

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.799
reduction in infections of the respiratory
system!

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.830
Just by taking a dip in cold water.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.370
When I was a kid, I would sit in the sauna
for 10 minutes and then jump in the cold pool…

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.450
My mother always said it was good for the
skin, but I couldn't find any solid evidence

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.450
of it.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.450
It was a great feeling though!

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.299
Chances are it felt great because of a moderate
cold shock response, thanks, Mom!

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:07.569
Would you do a polar bear swim?
