00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.500
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. 
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.100
And welcome to the Disney Live Action Remake Month.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.440
Disney likes profitable faces, doesn't it?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.040
Don't get me wrong, some of the most timeless characters have made money for years,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.460
but they also like to focus on what's popular for the moment.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.080
Whether it be Disney Channel Original Movies, DVD sequels, or buying what you thought for a second wasn't theirs,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.540
they finally ask the question, "What if they combine their timeless stories still making money with their search for fads still making money?"

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.900
And with less creative effort.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.160
Hey, they had to continue those timeless stories that already made them money.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.980
What if they just told them again?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.560
Now we're cooking!

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.020
The Disney live action remakes, for the
most part, have turned in a huge profit,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.220
so much so that at the time this video's released, at least 12 other Disney stories are 
in the process of being remade.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.280
It's like Groundhog Day, except instead of you becoming a better person, the world is becoming continually worse.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.160
And one of their earliest hits was Maleficent.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.160
Starring Angelina Jolie, this was supposed to do for the villain of Sleeping Beauty what Wicked did for the villain of The Wizard of Oz.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.560
Hey, Disney is ripping itself off enough. Why not steal from other sources?

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.260
The idea of telling a fairytale from a different point of view is nothing different,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.000
but the advertising for this movie made it look like you were going to be rooting for the bad guy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.540
Like "Oh, it feels so good to be so bad! Let's root for that anti-hero!"

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.620
And seeing as how Maleficent is easily one of Disney's best villains, this could kind of be cool.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.780
What we got is...

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.780
"Ow!"

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.720
"Ow!"

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.020
[incoherent yelling]

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.520
Not cool.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.260
Is it possible though that just like the lead, this is all a misunderstanding and I should look closer to find something of worth?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.340
Do all crows secretly have a cool, stylin' emo stud muffin inside of them?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.600
Mr. Freeze: "Stay cool, bird boy!"

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.500
Let's take a look at Maleficent.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.440
Narrator: "Let us tell an old story anew..."

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.860
"and we will see how well you know it."

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.940
Well, if you're telling it anew, we can't know it.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.940
The first line is literally a lie!

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.680
So, there's a kingdom of people and a kingdom of creatures the Na'vi refuse to eat

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.000
as a young Maleficent, shown here as taxidermy owl wings on an American Girl doll,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.560
is one of the kindest and gentlest of all fairies.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.780
I guess they regret calling her Maleficent then.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.680
Knotgrass: "The border guards have discovered--"

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680
Flittle: "Why'd you get to tell her? I want to tell her!"

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.500
"No, you told last time so I should tell this time and Thistlewit next time."

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Knotgrass: "Fine"
Flittle: "Thank you."

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.400
I hope you're laughing your ass off at this because there's 20 minutes of this joy sprinkled all throughout the film.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.140
Flittle: "The Border Guards--"

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.860
Thistlewit: "The Border Guards have found a human thief at the pool of jewels."

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.860
"Sorry."

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.160
For what, delivering a bad punchline or looking like a CG Barbie doll's Barbie dolls?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.880
Christ, are those ugly!

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.080
They find a farm boy named Stephan,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.200
who stole a jewel from them but 
Maleficent forces him to give it back.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.420
She walks him back to his kingdom 
where he reveals his parents are dead.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.700
"My parents are dead."

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.760
"Mine too."

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.080
"My horns ripped up my mother's insides at birth
and then I head-butted my father on the way out.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.180
They agree to form a friendship over the 
years and even end up loving each other.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.440
She grows up into Angelina Jolie, a fitting 
choice as she's a mix of beautiful and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.500
"Kinda funny-looking."

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.920
But as you'll see, the writing does little 
to keep her an interesting character.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.360
For several years pass and Stephan 
was away taking asshole lessons

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.920
so he could help the king destroy the fairies because...

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.320
What was the reason again?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.340
"Crush them!"

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.020
[yelling]

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.320
Makes sense.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.060
Maleficent is the protector of her 
kingdom with her Treebeard army

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.860
and heads up, nothing in the 
film is cooler than this scene.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.000
[dramatic music plays]
[yelling and cries of pain]

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.100
[loud roaring]

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.440
Well, that was great climax in the 
first fifteen minutes of the film,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.500
set the rest of the flick to:

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.240
[click]

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.880
Stephan, the crown's personal Scottish Michael Bay,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.180
hears the king say "Whoever kills Maleficent 
will become the future ruler of the land."

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.220
Hey, how is the old M-gal anyway?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.180
Stephan: "Maleficent..."

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.400
[dramatic music]

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.720
[sighs]

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.600
He finds he can't actually kill her but 
he decides to cut off her wings as proof.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.940
Good thing Maleficent's a heavy sleeper because
she didn't even notice and she wakes up de-feathered.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.940
Maleficent: [screams]

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.240
"I never even got to find out how they tasted!"

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.940
Stephan drops off the wings which...
equals a body, I guess, and is appointed king.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.920
Maleficent says "If one character can spontaneously turn into a dick, so can I" and she turns herself evil.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.020
Her first order of evil business?

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.600
Turn a random crow into a boy!

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.080
YOU MONSTER!

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.080
"I need you to be my wings."

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.460
"What do I call you?"

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.540
"Diaval."

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.240
What do they call you?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.780
"Diaval."

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.020
That's not a name, that's the sound 
a goose makes when it farts.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.780
"Diaval."

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.680
So, Maleficent and "BEYBAH"

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.960
decide to turn their kingdom into a den of evil...

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.720
...or just make things dark, but OOOH it looks so evil!

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.220
And hatch the diabolical plan of...
sitting around and doing nothing for years.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.520
Doth your evil know no...starting point?

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.120
Of course Stephan gets himself a queen 
who gives birth to a daughter named Aurora.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.480
And three of the other kingdom's most 
annoying fairies come to foster peace.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.080
Knotgrass: "I wish for you, the gift of beauty."

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.740
Flittle: "My wish is that you'll never be blue.
Only happy all the days of your life."

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.760
May seeing grief and sorrow in other people
confuse you so you cannot comfort them.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.120
Before the last fairy can give her present though,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.980
and by the way, yes, we never 
figure out what it was going to be,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.720
Maleficent steps in to constantly 
show off that she has two rows of teeth.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.700
Knotgrass: "Stay away from the princess!"

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.360
Thistlewit: "Yes, stay away!"

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.960
[crowd gasps in fright]

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.840
Fairies: [cry out in pain]

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.360
[thud]

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.300
"I'll call you when a 90's rainforest needs patronizing."

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.300
"Before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.040
she will prick her finger on the 
spindle of a spinning wheel,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.980
OH MY--Actually, that's not too bad.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.740
"And fall into a sleep-like death!"

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.740
Oh...that's much worse.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.640
Actually, why don't you just make it death?

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.180
Why a deep sleep that's like death, 
why don't you just make it death?

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.060
Wouldn't that be a lot simpler?

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.560
"Never!"

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.980
Okay, your curse.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.400
And because this movie's tone also 
seems to be on a spinning wheel,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.740
listen to the music they play over this scene.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.160
[dramatic drum beat plays]

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.860
"I like you begging..."

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.420
"Do it again."

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.700
[deep voice] Aw yeah, she's totally cursing 
that baby to feel the rhythm of her swing.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.580
Oh yeah!

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.860
"I beg you."
"Alright."

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.400
Maleficent:"The princess can 
be woken from her death sleep."

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.280
"But only by true love's kiss."

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.360
No!

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.560
What are the chances a beautiful girl who's 
happy 24-7 will find someone to love her?!

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.080
You weirdly-not-practical monster!

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.560
So, yeah as if the fairies weren't pointless enough in this,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.040
they don't even offset Maleficent's magic with 
true love's kiss or sleep instead of death addition.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.160
Yeah, don't you remember?

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.700
That was the last gift that the fairy was 
supposed to give but now there's just no gift at all.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.340
It's just Maleficent's own idiotic curse
 that was a lot simpler in the original.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.760
Maleficent: "On her sixteenth birthday, 
she shall prick her finger...AND DIE!"

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.500
"Oh, wait, wait, wait! There's also like 
five loopholes I myself wanted to put in."

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.080
"I want to be a fair Mistress of Evil."

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:17.380
To make things even dumber, it's the king's idea to give 
his daughter to the fairies to raise her for sixteen years.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.360
Why?

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.500
They in no way show they have an
understanding of Maleficent's magic

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.820
AND they act like bumbling dumbasses!

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.720
Look at their faces, they can barely even carry this kid!

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.160
One song of 'Rock-a-bye Baby' can turn into
ROCK! Uh, bye baby!

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.140
SMART!

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.800
So, Maleficent builds a wall around her kingdom.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.360
Don't worry, the humans will pay for it.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.940
Narrator: "And she reveled in the 
sorrow that her curse had brought."

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.440
"And the millions of ways it can be overturned."

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.620
"Like, I haven't done the math 
but I'm pretty sure it's in the mills."

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.460
The fairies go to a cottage where they 
do eventually make themselves bigger.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.780
Ugh, how fake. Can we go back 
to the realistic looking CGI bodies?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.260
And as expected, they turn 
out to be pretty shitty parents.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.380
Right down to leaving her outside to be spotted

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.480
and Maleficent finding them literally
before they can even move in!

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.060
Oh, there goes all that suspense!

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.980
Oh, wait I take it back, there 
actually is a lot of suspense.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.900
Suspense that these three lobotomized Hocus Pocus stooges will kill the child before Maleficent does!

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.860
In fact, Maleficent SAVES Aurora from 
their benign child-slaughtering ways

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.140
and even ends up raising her more than the fairies do!

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.580
I'm not even joking! 
That's what happens over all these years!

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.000
Look, I'm open to a different interpretation

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.640
but the fairies in the original were clumsy 
but loving and caring and charming.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.700
These three literally let the baby 
almost DIE on several occasions

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.660
and sleep through half of it 
and fight through the other half!

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.760
They're despicably unlikable!

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.520
In fact, they're easier to hate than 
the character you're supposed to hate!

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.140
Actually, yeah, let's talk about her for a bit.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.280
It's clear what Disney is trying to do,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.280
they're trying to go the "Wicked" route of 
taking a famous villain with no sympathy

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.500
and making her a misunderstood hero.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.420
But here's the thing, the original Wicked Witch 
from the Wizard of Oz is a thug!

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.380
She's a simpleton with a low vocabulary who 
uses blunt force to get whatever she wants.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.580
There's supposed to be no charm to her.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.040
So, in 'Wicked', it's compelling 
when you see her as the opposite.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.720
A smart, fragile charismatic yet misunderstood outcast

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.640
who got blamed for everything because she was different and didn't always know how to fight back.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.360
You can easily see how this world would 
make up a story about her being this villain.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.540
With Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent is already a
charming, charismatic and sophisticated villain.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.080
She has her outbursts of course, but there's 
always a charm and grace to whatever she does.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.800
You love how smart, elegant and diabolical she can be.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.840
So, to make this work, you 
would have to do the opposite.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.060
And A, I'm not sure that's what this movie does
and B, if it does, it doesn't do it well.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.540
She's not simple enough to have a charming naivety

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.200
but she's also not intelligent enough 
to be diabolical or menacing.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:06.000
Her actions half the time are pulling pranks on 
the fairies or trying to scare the baby with faces.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.480
And when it doesn't work, she says:

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.360
"I hate you."

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.620
Like a fifth grader!

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.260
So, on no level does this come together.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.540
It can't go all the way with what it originally was 
but it can't go all the way with the opposite either.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.700
She's the badass Mistress of all Ev--!

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.820
[cooing] Oh, she looks so cute when a kid hugs her!

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.260
I'm so behind her being a badass villain--

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.860
[cooing] except when they're trying to
 make her a cute awkward babysitter!

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.180
Oh ho ho ho!

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.960
Mistress of all Evil? How about Mistress of just
stopping Home Alone sequels in her spare time?!

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.100
Though, that would be a welcome gift.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.920
So as the years pass, Aurora, 
now played by Elle Fanning,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.780
grows older and, wouldn't you know it, 
Maleficent and her grow a close friendship.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.120
Again, this film gives us exactly what 
we want from a Maleficent movie.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.600
"I know who you are."

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.660
Maleficent: "Do you?"

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.340
"You're my fairy godmother."

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.340
To be fair, I'd rather have her 
than Helena Bonham Carter.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.800
So, she visits Maleficent every
night and they just...hang out.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.240
Throw mud at each other, have 
girl talk, express their feelings,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.080
again, EXACTLY what you would 
want from a Maleficent movie.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.960
Did I mention in the upcoming Frollo film 
that him and Quasimodo go bowling?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.120
It's very sweet and totally understands the character.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.380
In fact, she gets along so well with Aurora that she
even tries lifting the curse but she finds she can't.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.040
Yeah, apparently even she doesn't 
know what the hell her powers can do.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.440
"There is an evil in this world."

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.220
"I can take care of myself."

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.960
"I frolicked and smiled like nobody's business."

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.580
"I'm very self-reliant!"

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:57.020
Lucky, lucky though, a young prince named Phillip is wondering through the forest and comes across Aurora.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.060
It's love at first--
Phillip: "Goodbye."

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.140
Smalltalk. Hey, it's still more dialogue 
than they had in the original film.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.080
Thus Maleficent and "BEHABAH" 
discuss if the prince can break the spell.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.740
"True love's kiss, remember? It can break the spell."

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.680
"True love's kiss?"

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.400
"I cursed her that way because there is no such thing."

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.700
"It's a very abstract, open to interpretation spell."

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.500
So on the eve of her 16th Birthday, 
Aurora tells the fairies that she's leaving them...

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.360
[splat]

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.200
Way to add to the mood.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.200
And they accidentally blurt out that who she really is.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.200
"We are taking you back to your father witho--!"

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.400
"You told me my parents were dead."

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.780
"It's almost like you're awful, awful, awful, awful, awful,

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.960
AWFUL people!"

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.640
Aurora clarifies this with her real parent, Maleficent,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.020
--Did you hear how stupid that sounded, that's the story!

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.180
As she also discovers that 
Maleficent is the one who cursed her.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.740
[cries] "Don't touch me! 
You're the evil that's in the world!"

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.240
No, actually that's the good version,

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.200
but this one is at least...dumb.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.720
She makes her way to her real father who has
slowly been growing insane over the years,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.960
resulting in his voice sounding 
even sillier than it did before.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.520
Stephan: [shrill Scottish accent] 
"You look just like your mother."

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.660
"I told those three idiots! 
They brought you back a day too soon.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.500
"Lock her up in her room."

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.260
Did they replace him with a shrinking Scrooge McDuck?

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.720
How am I supposed to be intimidated by that voice?!

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.040
Maleficent thinks the prince's kiss might work,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.640
so she knocks him out and tries taking
him to the palace where Aurora is.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.360
She of course pricks her finger and goes into a deep
sleep, throwing her father's voice into a gargling rage.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.580
"Look at her."

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.360
"Look at what you've done."

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.200
"She's only sleeping."

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.600
Oh, my god, have they invented pesticide yet?
Where's you bedside manners?!

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.500
Stephan: "She's only sleeping..."

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.020
"She's only sleeping FOREVER!"

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.360
David Tennant sucking helium balloons 
would sound more intimidating than this guy!

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.980
The prince tries kissing her but it doesn't work,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.540
so Maleficent goes in and...

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.040
Don't get too excited.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.820
It's the Frozen logic, the love for a 
family member over a romantic love

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.340
and since the spell already 
has enough fine print, it counts.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.020
However the crazy old white dude reveals he's 
the villain and not the scary-looking green lady

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.820
cause again,  if we're not gonna tell this
story, we might as well tell this one

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.500
And the guards entrap her.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.380
But she turns "BEHABAH" into a dragon...

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.280
I...feel like there's several instances 
where that could have come in handy.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.780
"I need you to be my wings."

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.500
Turn yourself into something with wings!

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.980
Like in the origina--!!

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.300
And Auroa breaks open Maleficent's 
wings that fly directly to her.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.220
Yaay! It's Sleeping Beauty teamed up with
Maleficent to fight and old crazy guy!

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.740
Sorry, no part of that is cooler than this.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.660
There's not even an acknowledgement to their past
relationship or the years of love that they shared.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.300
She just tosses him over and...it's done.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.980
You kind of even forgot they were in love, 
it's such a meaningless connection they have.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.880
But at least a scene later, it's revealed that 
Aurora is now queen of both kingdoms.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.760
All those years of giggling and twirling in her 
dress will no doubt lead to a strong government.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.460
[cheering]

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.260
Narrator: "So you see, the story 
is not quite as you were told."

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.580
Even though Disney told me 
the first version I ever heard...

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.220
And I liked it a lot better.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.240
Narrator: "And I should know, 
for I was the one they called "Sleeping Beauty."

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.740
"I've been smoking a lot, 
that's why my pitch is a little off."

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:24.500
Narrator: "My kingdom was united not by a hero or 
a villain, but by one who was both hero and villain."

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.820
So that way nobody is happy.
Yaaaaay...

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.500
Ugh! So that is one of greatest Disney villains of all time.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.320
Doesn't it show?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.740
I'll admit it does look very nice even 
though the effects can be very fake,

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.520
it still was shot quite beautifully and 
gives us some nice visual landscapes.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.180
But this movie is an insult to one 
of Disney's greatest characters.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.380
We don't want to see Maleficent as 
a hero, we love her fine as a villain.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:00.500
You want to make her more complex, fine, but 
don't tell us deep down she's a good person!

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.980
That's not what we're looking for!

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.880
Some villains are so good, we enjoy hating them,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.160
like the Joker or Freddy Krueger or 
any number of the Disney baddies!

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.860
Trying to be both bad and good ruins what we appreciated about this kind of character to begin with.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.820
That she did go all the way.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.520
There's definitely great villains that can explore the
good and the bad, but this shouldn't be one of them.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.220
This movie needed to pick a side 
a tone and an idea to stick with.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.960
Instead, it just sucks out the evil fun that made 
our happily ever after all the more happier.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.800
And it's a spell I'm not gonna fall for.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.640
And I'll tell you what, 
I'm avoiding the movies of this writer.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.060
I mean, it's not like this person wrote any other 
live action Disney film--It's the next one, isn't it?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.820
[Nostalgia Critic Theme plays]
DAMMIT!

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.120
"Diaval."

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.800
Hey, Doug Walker here doing the 
Charity Shoutout and this week we're doing "CampFire."

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.820
Helping youth become who they want 
to be takes time and encouragement.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.940
At CampFire, they help youth discover 
the exceptional people that they are.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.080
CampFire provides the opportunity 
to find their spark and lift their voice.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:46.000
With 54 councils nationwide, last year, they 
served more than 175,000 youths and teens,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:52.120
their families and community members
