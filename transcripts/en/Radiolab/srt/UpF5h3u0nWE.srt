1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,720
You are listening to radiolab radiolab

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,170
from [inaudible], w.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,823
N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. E. R.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,700
Okay. I got to see, I'm
suddenly regretting this.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,040
I was looking forward to
this all day, but now it's,

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,910
I didn't expect it to be so
profoundly dark. You're scared.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,470
I was a little tiny bit. Yeah. Ah Dude,

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,420
you don't need to be doing that at like
a moron just turned his lights off.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,810
It's a free here. We do that when
you're driving out in the book.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,910
So that's a producer, Pat Walters and I.

11
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:39,110
This is kind of one is this one right
here. This is the rumor crossroads.

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,050
And I say we are here, so
a pad, and I know it's,

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,140
I know it's you and you're driving
in the dark. Yes. It takes me set up.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,070
So a little while back, pat
and I went down to Clarksdale,

15
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:55,090
Mississippi to this little
tiny town out in the sticks,

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,960
Mississippi Delta drove down
this dirt road and this was dark.

17
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:02,860
I mean curtain of black dark till we
got to this place where our little road

18
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:05,920
crossed, another little road
made kind of an x tape recorder.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,750
Should we get out of the car? Yeah.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,980
And we got out of the
car and we stood there,

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,500
Kayla to be completely silent

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,720
and waiting five minutes to midnight
because we were told if we stood in that

23
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:25,580
very spot til midnight, the devil
would come and uh, talk to us.

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,260
What was that over there? Stop it.

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,540
I'm going to beat you at this. Make Fun.
You do that one more time. Why? Why?

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,380
I should wait and find out,
I guess. No, you should ask.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,260
Would you like to know why we
were waiting for the devil?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,120
Yes. A bunch of tool bags. We are.

29
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,170
Okay. So I've been interested for years
in this story of Robert Johnson and the

30
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:53,060
crossroads. I mean, do you
know him? Robert Johnson,

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,840
one of the Great Blues Musicians of
all times, influenced a ton of people.

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,690
Eric Clapton led Zepplin. He's
also the center of this mill.

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,900
Situate me in time. When did Robert
Johnson live? So here's the story. Yeah,

34
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,010
1920s Robert Johnson is
a kid in Mississippi.

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,760
[inaudible] wants to play the blues
hanging around blues guys, but he sucks.

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,960
Other blues guys would laugh
at him. So he goes away,

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,950
disappears one day shortly after,

38
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,660
comes back and he's not just
good now. He's incredible.

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I mean he's making this music
that's not just technically good,

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,880
but it's just got a feeling
to it that's so different.

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,150
And are the other musicians like
a Umay were like what happened?

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,630
And supposedly what he
says to them is, well,

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,610
one night I walked out into the darkness,

44
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:51,120
found a place where two roads cross
and I waited there till midnight,

45
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,620
waited at a place and
they're going to wait to,

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,470
there's lots of apparently what you
do when you want to meet the devil,

47
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,740
you walk out of town, find the
crossroads at precisely midnight.

48
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:02,440
The devil come up, he'll take your guitar,
he'll tune it, hand it back to you,

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,730
and in that moment you've given the
devil your soul and he has given you the

50
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,110
ability to play anything

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,520
is that story is still told, oh my God,

52
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:14,730
this is like one of the most famous
like eh myths in rock and roll.

53
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:16,290
This is a story that's
repeated constantly.

54
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,550
I mean it's like one of the
most enduring stories in music.

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,340
I was just testing it and for some
reason, for the last 12 years or so,

56
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,340
I keep thinking about it and
I'm always like, one day,

57
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,730
one day Radiolab is going to
go down to the crossroads.

58
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,700
We're going to figure out where
this damn story came from.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,770
And this is an honest question,

60
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:39,720
but is there something about
the myth that is true? Yeah,

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,990
something like that. We've
seen so many stars though. No,

62
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,180
this is amazing. It's beautiful.
All right, so what do you do?

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,500
We didn't see any devil first of all
really, but oh my God, a shooting star.

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,910
We did see a shooting star

65
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,910
and so we ended up there. We ended
up, started doing a lot of reporting,

66
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,940
you know, going around Memphis, visiting
Clarksdale, all these different places.

67
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:05,560
And the funny thing, the
very first thing that we,

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,450
that we sort of learned about
this whole story and uh,

69
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,550
we learned about it from this guy and,
uh, Tom Graves who lives in Memphis,

70
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,540
who studied the history,

71
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,660
very first thing we learned is it
actually the myth in a way began here.

72
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,330
We didn't even have to go to
Memphis. He began right here. Here.

73
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,180
What do you mean? In New York City? Yeah.
What do you mean starts in New York?

74
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:25,361
Well,

75
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:29,530
it starts on a very particular day in
a very particular place and time with a

76
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,700
very particular guy.

77
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,900
I think we can trace pretty much this
whole thing back to John Hammond,

78
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,270
you know, at Columbia records. I mean,

79
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:41,830
he's the one that sort of pushed the
whole thing into two to everybody.

80
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,120
And John Hammond, uh, was an
interesting guy. He was, uh,

81
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,700
one of the heirs to the Vanderbilt
fortune, you know, in New York.

82
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,860
He was a thorough New Yorker and it CBS,

83
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:54,670
he was a sort of a talent
scout and John Hammond had,

84
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,230
this is Elijah Walden historian. He
had the best years in show business.

85
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,940
Pretty much ever. You
discovered so much talent. God,

86
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Billie Holiday Count
Basey Aretha Franklin,

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,650
Bob Dylan, Stevie wave von

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,990
[inaudible]. He discovered
Bruce Springsteen.

89
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,740
I mean the idea that that the same guy
could discover Bruce Springsteen and cow

90
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,330
basey. It's crazy here.

91
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,720
Any of the moment that we're interested
in happened kind of early in John

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,890
Hammond's career. He was very young.

93
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,980
He was in his twenties doing well
cause he'd already brought on,

94
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,000
I think it was Danny Goodman,
who was a huge success.

95
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,140
This would be the late thirties Benny
Goodman has the first major integrated

96
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,180
band and John Hammond.

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,360
He thought that racial
segregation was an abomination.

98
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,250
And right around the time
the Benny Goodman broke,

99
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:57,290
he decided it's time to
make a statement. So yeah,

100
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:02,291
in 1938 John Hammond decided
to put together this one
concert that would be like

101
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,460
the whole history of
black music from the old

102
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,080
hey

103
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,850
slave era spirituals

104
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,080
up to the hottest swing.

105
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,740
And not only was it going to cram the
entire history of black music into one

106
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,290
concert, you wanted to
put it in Carnegie Hall

107
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,170
as an

108
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,310
yeah,

109
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,790
that Carnegie Hall, they're good.
It's a very high tone place.

110
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,870
It's Carnegie Hall. You
know, what was it called?

111
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,820
It was called from spirituals to
swing from spirituals to swing.

112
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,670
But here's the problem and this whole
chronology, he was putting together,

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,260
he needed somebody to
represent backwoods blues.

114
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,850
He didn't have anybody. Uh, so,

115
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,100
so he sends one of his guys
down to Mississippi to a
particularly famous record

116
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:48,371
shop,

117
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:52,930
and the guy comes back with a record
from this young guy named Robert Johnson.

118
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,570
Was he known at that point? No, he
was a nobody. He was a nobody. Well,

119
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,910
when he heard this record, John Hammond

120
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,660
thought, wow, this is the best of the
Backwood blues guys I've ever heard.

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,750
That sort of haunting voice.

122
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,630
He knew right away. This was the guy,

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm gonna pluck him from ops security
and I'm gonna put him in Carnegie Hall.

124
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,580
And so he sent word
down to Mississippi to,

125
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,730
to try to get Robert
Johnson and bring him up.

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,500
Word came back that Robert
Johnson had had died,

127
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,740
just died very, very recently.

128
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,090
Just a few months before he was messing
around with a woman and the woman's

129
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:49,590
husband gave him a bottle of
poisoned whiskey and that was it.

130
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,400
Wow. Well there's a blue thing. His
death. Yeah. So He's out of the program.

131
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,930
One would think concert rules around
December 13th, 1938 here we go.

132
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,500
This was a concert. If you could have
been there, you want it to be there.

133
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,480
And John Hammond is the MC

134
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,610
tonight. We are glad to
have and he, you know,

135
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,250
walks the crowd through the chronology,
starting with this spiritual

136
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,600
on the Boogie Woogie,

137
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,790
Benny Goodman and to count Basey Orchestra
and he gets that many tails. Well,

138
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,700
the big surprise of the,
this is what he said,

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,500
although unfortunately
this part was not recorded,

140
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,100
was to bring you this guy that I
discovered recently, Robert Johnson.

141
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,130
And we just found out that he died,

142
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,820
but I still want you to hearing and
we're going to play a couple of his best

143
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,020
songs. How did he play it?

144
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,730
He played it on a phonograph record
and Mike it through the PA system right

145
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:44,750
there on right there on stage
drops a needle and he played,

146
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,510
one of them was preaching blues,
which happens to be maybe my favorite

147
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,743
[inaudible]

148
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,360
and you can just imagine these
spell ballot people in this audience

149
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:09,660
[inaudible]

150
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,730
hearing a record being
played through the PA

151
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:16,610
[inaudible]

152
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,590
it was very obvious. Something different.

153
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,370
[inaudible]

154
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,200
I mean what a remarkable thing and that
was in a sense Robert Johnson's Angus.

155
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,300
Not in a sense it was his
introduction. It was his debut.

156
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,080
It's so ghostly. Yeah.

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,650
What's most obvious is his absence.

158
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,620
Now at this point there is no myth
about a devil in the crossroads.

159
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:48,100
All you got is music sung by
a guy who's not in the room.

160
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,480
When the record finishes,

161
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:54,481
did they sit quietly or do they jump
up and down and yell or that we have no

162
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,960
idea. I mean, it wasn't recorded,

163
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,930
but temptation would be to
say their minds were blown.

164
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,250
But probably what happened was it, they
just clapped politely in the concert,

165
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:04,010
kept going.

166
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,010
[inaudible] but the seed was planted and
that seed would bloom in the weirdest

167
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:14,110
way 22 years later. So let me
just fast forward a bit. Okay.

168
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,970
See from 1938 to about 1916
threes because before no one,

169
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,400
I really listened to Robert Johnson,

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,970
not too many of his records were
in circulation cause you know,

171
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,600
it was the war years and people were
really into these like twists and pop kind

172
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:30,540
of happy records. But then
as you slide into the 60s,

173
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,020
people get kind of tired of that stuff
and they started getting into folk music.

174
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,410
Awesome man. I bet it baby Mama
Kingston trio and all that.

175
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,850
Kingston trio, Pete Seeger, all of
these guys are both man. So, um,

176
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,310
John Hammond again, John Hammond,

177
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,830
he had his finger on the
pulse of what was going on.

178
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,260
He knew he had just signed Bob Dylan

179
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,823
[inaudible]

180
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,100
my baby's dog. Dylan's first
record as you can hear,

181
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:59,350
was kind of Bluesy in place.
So Hammond thought, hmm,

182
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,940
maybe now is the time to revisit
the whole Robert Johnson thing.

183
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,520
Maybe put out a Robert
Johnson record. So we did.

184
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,930
And then people took those records
overseas and then guys like Eric Clapton

185
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:13,960
heard it flipped out.
Started recording covers

186
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,220
[inaudible]

187
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,130
mean it just sort of like I
went into work drive. Yeah.

188
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,583
Yeah.

189
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,920
This is the really the
song that catapulted Robert
Johnson into the world time.

190
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,790
It's still, despite the name of the
song, there was no sailing of any souls.

191
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,770
Crossroads is a metaphor you use in
countless blues songs come to the

192
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,600
crossroads. Which way are you going to go?

193
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,980
Just refers to a decision point that
shouldn't surprise anybody. So if you,

194
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:52,040
if you bought the vinyl album and
you looked at the album cover,

195
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,980
there's no on the back

196
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,600
cover, no, no devil myth yet.

197
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,860
But now all the conditions are sort of
in place because you've got this whole

198
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,970
folk roots movement when people who want
to know more about the music and you've

199
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:07,810
got a guy in Robert Johnson who's
being covered by huge rock bands,

200
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,120
but who nobody knows
the first thing about.

201
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,900
So you have this void that needed
to be filled and into that space.

202
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,050
Walks a guy named [inaudible].

203
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,310
No, his name's not pat. Pat.
You take this part. All right,

204
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,430
so moment when January we're in Memphis,

205
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:30,150
we went to see this guy who was one of
the first people to find out anything

206
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,070
about Robert Johnson. In a way.

207
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:35,220
He's actually at the root of
the myth about Robert Johnson.

208
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,800
So he assaulted the devil, don't
we? Didn't mean to be right.

209
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,630
His name's Dave David Evans,

210
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,430
professor of music at the University of
Memphis. He works in the music building.

211
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,380
So as you walk in and you're like 60
different instruments playing and you kind

212
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:53,160
of feel like you're losing your mind,
but when you step into his office, okay,

213
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,120
thanks for having us.

214
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,823
It's Kinda quiet.

215
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,360
She felt weirdly appropriate because
we're surrounded by all of these old books

216
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,410
and stacks of reel to reel tapes of the
people that he's interviewed over the

217
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,620
last five decades. And
while we were there,

218
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:12,110
he told us about one of
those taped interviews,

219
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,330
particularly the changed everything.

220
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,510
I was a student at UCLA.

221
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,280
This is 1966 just getting
interested in folk music and blues.

222
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,520
Got a guitar or you know, even
started gigging around a little bit.

223
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,340
I was interested in Tommy Johnson.

224
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,390
Now Tommy Johnson is a
pretty famous blues guy, gay,

225
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,600
but there's no relation between
Tommy Johnson and Robert Johnson.

226
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,560
None whatsoever. And musically
they're way different.

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
Tommy Johnson yodels AIG gave

228
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,150
[inaudible].

229
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,540
Yeah, Robert Johnson doesn't do that. No.

230
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,320
So David Evans was into Tommy Johnson.

231
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,990
I hadn't met, uh,

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I had heard a number of his
recordings and admit Babe Stovall,

233
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,390
the sidecar

234
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,290
blues singer who was
on the circuit at 1964.

235
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,250
And a babe had known Tommy and
he told Dave, well, you know,

236
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,450
if you want to find Tommy Tommy's dead,
but I can point you to his brother.

237
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,010
Ladelle Johnson. Well, he was
living in a little house in Jackson,

238
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:24,870
Mississippi and uh, Dave decides
to go see him. No, Tommy,

239
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,050
I'm recording the interview. See if you
could learn a few things about Tonya.

240
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,000
And 1914 dash 40 came back,

241
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,480
Ladell was a blues man turn
preacher of the visionary.

242
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,110
Spry didn't play the blues anymore,
but he sang for David A. Little bit.

243
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,820
Hey, why don't you, yeah,

244
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:44,380
my longterm cry.

245
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,220
Hey Baby, don't you? Yeah,

246
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:54,430
my lawns and [inaudible]
you treat me Mama.

247
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,710
[inaudible] you do. When did
you first start singing? It's

248
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,740
amazing interview to listen to many case
after he sang a little bit David car

249
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,120
and he played a bit.

250
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,930
Oh [inaudible]

251
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:13,940
[inaudible]

252
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,970
and after that Madell tells Davis story
about his brother Tommy. And again,

253
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:20,370
this is Tommy Johnson, not Robert Johnson,

254
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,110
but Adele tells Davis story that tries
to explain how his brother Tommy got so

255
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:28,470
good. And to our knowledge, this
tape has never been broadcast before.

256
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,800
You could say again, it kind of
tangle up song. You long doing,

257
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,180
I bet you he would play.

258
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Me and him would praise for some white
folks here and he'd just get shut up.

259
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,423
And yesterday,

260
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,200
Dan farmer ready buck
and he could make a song.

261
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:52,040
He could make a song in 10
minutes and I'd ask him,

262
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,890
now you have dome we're live in. You
did not. She and go. Only that man,

263
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,900
my wife day, he said him.
The reason he knows so much.

264
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,910
He show himself to the
devil. I asked him how

265
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,231
he said,

266
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:13,231
if you want to learn how to play anything
you want or you play at Norlane at a

267
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,090
Mitch Song,

268
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:20,090
your Shell that you take your guitar
and you go who are room Croson dad or we

269
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,610
go across roadie and said get
there. Be sure to get there.

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,350
Yes. The Litter for 12 o'clock that
night, Joe, you will know you are beat in

271
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,280
and jail. You have,

272
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:41,780
you get door and be playing a
piece sitting there by yourself.

273
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,470
Say you have to go by yourself and be
sitting there playing a piece and jail,

274
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,570
big black man will walk up there and
take your car and he attuning and then he

275
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,860
play a piece and hand it back.

276
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,340
Dude said that's the way I learned
how to play anything I want.

277
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,280
And he could not. He told that didn't
bring in anything, don't care what is

278
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,843
strong?

279
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,650
No,

280
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,650
I mean I was clocking stuff on
Tommy Johnson and here was uh,

281
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,690
this legend, uh,

282
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,140
Dave says he wasn't quite sure
what to make of this. I mean,

283
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,380
he knew that the idea that the person
could sell their soul to the devil in

284
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:29,030
exchange for limitless talent. That is
a very old myth. But that was about it.

285
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,440
So he goes back to UCLA and one night
he's chatting with some friends, you know,

286
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,810
Grad students have their
bull sessions. You know,

287
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,610
we all talked about these things where,

288
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,790
and he tells his friends about this
thing that Ladelle had said about Tommy.

289
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,420
And in the room that day was a fellow
Grad student named Pete Welding.

290
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,160
Pete was as much of a
blues freak as I was.

291
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,780
And according to David, as
Pete listening to this story,

292
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:55,380
he makes a little mental switcheroo.
He thinks to himself, you know,

293
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,770
this whole soldier soul to the devil thing
would make a hell of a lot more sense

294
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:03,270
if it's about Robert Johnson, not
Tommy Johnson, Robert Johnson.

295
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:03,651
I mean,

296
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:08,510
the fact is Robert Johnson sang a
song about going to a crossroads

297
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,590
[inaudible].

298
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,030
Now he doesn't in the song,

299
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:17,690
he doesn't say that he went
there to meet the devil,

300
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,430
but he also sang another song
on the same album, uh, about me.

301
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:25,820
And the devil walking side by side

302
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,750
bed, bathroom, you
know, which does suggest

303
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,380
at least in the song, he's
in some kind of [inaudible]

304
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,630
partnership with the [inaudible].

305
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,870
So Pete has this thought that this
story sounds a lot more Robert Johnson,

306
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,190
he than Tommy downs need.

307
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,670
And a few months later he travels to
Mississippi and he ends up interviewing

308
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,520
this really famous blues
man named Sun House.

309
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,230
Oh Jim Myron [inaudible] in your fee,

310
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,390
Pete asks son about Robert Johnson.

311
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:58,410
Son Tells Pete the usual story about
how Robert Johnson was just so bad.

312
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,020
Get up on stage. Yes. Just
as in the people you know

313
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,890
[inaudible] I know Josh [inaudible]
boy put them. Give that thing.

314
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,600
Not a running us crazy.

315
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,300
That's a little bit of Stone
House that we found on Youtube.

316
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,360
So son tells Pete that story
and it unusual way says
Robert Johnson disappeared.

317
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,720
He came back, he was better than
all of us. Nobody knew how I did it.

318
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,620
And then probably what happens
is David is in that moment,

319
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,480
I think Pete asked a leading question.

320
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,110
I wasn't there, but Dave suspects,
maybe Pete said something like,

321
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:39,250
is it possible that Robert Johnson got
so good because he's sold his soul to the

322
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:40,500
devil and son?

323
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,170
Son I think gave a kind of hesitant
answer that seemed like it left open that

324
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,320
possibility price said something
like, yeah, sure it's possible.

325
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,950
David says Pete takes that
non answer and runs with it.

326
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,870
Publishes an article where he
says, you wouldn't believe this,

327
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:03,070
but son House told me that Robert
Johnson sold his soul to the devil.

328
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,310
Pete. He was a writer, a stylist,

329
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,030
a bit of a liar quotes.

330
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,930
He himself even admitted that that
article was a bit over the top,

331
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,210
over the top or not. The story exploded,

332
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,240
got printed over and over
and books and magazines,

333
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,860
Compton and others talked about it at
concerts and over time it just became part

334
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:33,694
of the cannon.

335
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,760
The story that we like to tell about a
guy that we really know nothing about.

336
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,690
[inaudible]

337
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,600
been okay. I mean, this was not why
we decided to do this story. I mean,

338
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,980
the whole thought was that

339
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,700
it's gotta be something more going on
here than just a bad game of telephone

340
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,870
because the music does seem to
suggest that there is more going on.

341
00:20:55,871 --> 00:21:00,871
I mean it does feel haunted and midway
through our reporting we did learn one

342
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:05,710
thing that suddenly made the
myth make a kind of sense,

343
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,100
like real sense, not just story sense.
Really. Yeah. Tell me that story.

344
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,040
Well, we heard it from a
guy named Mack McCormick.

345
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,570
I'm actually going to play you a,

346
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,620
him talking about it in a an old
documentary that we found. Okay.

347
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,460
And Mac is probably the expert on Robert
Johnson and in the 80s he tracked down

348
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:28,300
some of Robert Johnson's family that no
one had been able to locate and he came

349
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,000
back with a really different
story about the guy then,

350
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,710
at least I would have ever expected

351
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,430
did.

352
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,430
Robert Johnson was married in
1929 but he was quite young.

353
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,510
He was about 18 says Mac and he met a
girl named Virginia and he fell in love

354
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,750
when he married. He made one of the
important decisions in his life,

355
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,570
which was to live a conventional life.

356
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,850
They were going to live
on a farm, raise a family.

357
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Up until then he'd been a kind of a
casual party musician and his wife,

358
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:57,460
Virginia, became pregnant.

359
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,440
She decided to go back to her family to
have the child he was going to join her.

360
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,350
But right before she was
due, Robert went off playing,

361
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,740
kind of snuck off to play a few
gigs before the baby was born.

362
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,820
And when he went to visit her, he
found that she died in childbirth

363
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:17,700
[inaudible]

364
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,060
and he was destroyed.

365
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,080
And he was faced with
this incredible community,

366
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:28,081
condemnation of what you've done to
Virginia because he was in Virginia's

367
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,430
childhood community at the time.

368
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,850
And they looked upon him as an itinerant
evil musician who was singing the devil

369
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,620
songs and she killed Virginia.

370
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,480
And he gradually became that person
that the community saw in mass.

371
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,170
So if Robert Johnson
was haunted by anything,

372
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,330
maybe it was grief

373
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,673
[inaudible]

374
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,183
oh, Amada.

375
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,563
Hmm.

376
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,520
So, so you, so if you had to
tell it, you'd say, so no,

377
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,720
he didn't go out and meet the devil.

378
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:17,620
He had this tragedy and the
tragedy changed him and it
changed you into a great

379
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,780
musician. That's what I would say.

380
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,720
[inaudible] [inaudible] um,

381
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,220
[inaudible]

382
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,470
and that's where our story might have
ended. Hello? Hello Mac. Yes. Hi,

383
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,290
this is Pat Walker.

384
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,300
But that story about Robert Johnson's
young wife dying in childbirth was so sad

385
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,540
and fascinating that we really wanted
to talk to the guy who found it.

386
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:57,440
My name is Mack McCormick. He's the
guy we just heard in the documentary.

387
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,190
But when we mentioned that story that
he told about Robert Johnson twice dying

388
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:05,690
in childbirth, he, uh, he
kind of cut us off. No,

389
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,620
let's not get into that. Why not? That's,

390
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,820
that's not something I've
converged confirmed satisfactorily.

391
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,320
What does that mean? I have, um,

392
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,900
doubts about the things I
said years ago specifically.

393
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:27,980
Like what? Uh, well, okay,

394
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,640
this is one Mack told us about a weird
encounter he'd had in New Orleans in New

395
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,140
Orleans.

396
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,750
I was told about a man named Robert
Johnson who was a blues musician and this

397
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:39,940
was years after, you know,

398
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,780
the Robert Johnson had died and I went
racing down the street to this address.

399
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,830
What would I got there? This man,
so this, they was Robert Johnson.

400
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,570
He was a blues singer, had been, but he
was not the man who made the records,

401
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,230
but he was somebody who at the time had
gone around imitating the records and

402
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,540
Mechs as it that moment
he started to wonder like,

403
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,860
is it possible that the stories I've
been connecting about Robert Johnson,

404
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,790
one particular Robert
Johnson, the Robert Johnson,

405
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,680
or actually about a collection
of different Robert Johnson's,

406
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,420
this is what you have to
apply our statistics here.

407
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,320
Robert's a pretty common first name and
Johnson's a pretty common last name.

408
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,220
So if you have a state with whatever
population, you've got to say,

409
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,500
there's this many Robert Johnson's, we
don't know how many, but Mac figures,

410
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,430
there's certainly more than
one and as Max doubt mounted,

411
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:38,180
he started to run into other problems.
Have you seen the death certificate?

412
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,700
I've seen reprints of it in books.

413
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,660
Have you seen a reprint of
the backside of it? No. Okay.

414
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:49,661
The backside says that he had come from
Tunica county to play Banjo at a country

415
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:54,050
dance, play Banjo,

416
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,400
but Johnson played the guitar and
to make matters more confusing,

417
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:01,700
the death certificate said that this
Robert Johnson died of syphilis,

418
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,480
not whiskey poisoning. This
has gotta be a different guy.

419
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,550
Mek wasn't entirely convinced until he
met this guy who had played with Robert

420
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,250
Johnson back in the day.

421
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,260
He and Robert Johnson jammed together a
little bit when Mac brought up Johnson

422
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,330
and the fact that he died in 1938 this
guy give him a funny look and said, no,

423
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,050
I,

424
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:26,050
I saw him in a Rodeo in 39 I believe it
was April or so in 39 a few years later,

425
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:29,330
the same thing happened with
another guy Mack was talking to.

426
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,830
He said that he'd seen
Johnson in Memphis April,

427
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,930
1941 and not too long after
that it happened again.

428
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,000
So it's things like that that,

429
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,110
that give you a hint that you might be
wrong and if you're wrong about whether

430
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:44,130
he died or not. How do you know

431
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,070
any of these other things that I believed?

432
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,130
Obviously when Mac told us this,
we were really disappointed.

433
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,180
Kind of kills the story,

434
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,250
although we do still have this song,
which is incredible. The 28 others,

435
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,860
maybe that's enough.

436
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,310
And if you think back to that moment in
Carnegie Hall where music was drifting

437
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,110
out of that audience for the first time,

438
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,340
we talked about that earlier
as an absence, but it's really,

439
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:28,100
it's not if it's all we got actually

440
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,550
it's everything. Okay.

441
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,933
Hmm.

442
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,930
But on the subject of Robert Johnson,
there's the book by writer Tom Graves.

443
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:58,860

449
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:18,300

Johnson in my head and his music in my
head is a guy named dean ulcer. Sorta,
