00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.269
 I'm her team's navy grandson. 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.549
 google launches and in today's episode 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.760
 Let's understand how it works like this. 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.740
 you have and understand them good filters 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.939
 three of the main components of a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.920
 application 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.560
 the activities of the service body care 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.900
 accessible they are activated through 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 messages that we then arrived from 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.120
 do not even try on themselves or 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.850
 an object understands is an attitude given 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.879
 passive and which deals with the description of a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.180
 intention of something to be done by 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.399
 this is understood from the blog of cash 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.219
 and civil matters of something that ended 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.250
 happening is being announced by the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.219
 coc system good and how we go 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 to ensure that these understand the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.199
 correct components there are three 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.070
 different ways to be delivered 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.260
 one understands 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.199
 the first is that you call 1 with 3 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 start activity points are happening in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
 if a new tivit or if it already has 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 started but is coming back for something 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.780
 new or even through the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.670
 points 7 revolt that when 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.220
 You go along, you and I. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.350
 example citing is an understand 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.470
 representing the information that is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.380
 wants to go through that other tite too 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 can be sent by a service through 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.479
 the streets ways to be so service 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.460
 either by start service or by the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.720
 hedges and last but not least 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.939
 important 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.799
 we have good ones that you can afford 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.290
 pass someone try for any even 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.479
 that broadcast them and with that the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.939
 intendants will then be handed over to 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.180
 who is interested in hiring 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.860
 that good broadcast an object of 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.930
 understanding is basically a set of 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.840
 do not talk about it. 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.240
 intention and it contains the information of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.060
 interest of the components that receive 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.250
 this understands and also the android system 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.540
 as a woman then what are these 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.060
 components there 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.789
 the first is the name of the component that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.280
 represents who will treat this understanding 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.860
 it is composed the full name of the class 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.710
 you will receive in the clear case using pac 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.660
 ottey me class name remembering that the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.850
 package name has the same name as the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.660
 package you registered for your 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.750
 application 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.250
 It's okay after that we have action that 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.910
 It is properly said that you want 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.590
 we do, then we have some 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.330
 actions defined in a constant can 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.430
 see the list of documentation to view 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.500
 what conditions are available or what 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.450
 you can take a specific action from your 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.640
 application from your library that you 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.780
 also defined ok 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.660
 the data in this case is a url and also 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.150
 online type of where the information is 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.880
 What do you want, the one that understands the bridge? 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.980
 so for example you want to send a photo 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.350
 for an application to handle this does not 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.110
 will you put the photo file by 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.950
 example mytype referencing an image 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.840
 OK 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.790
 then we have the category of this 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.550
 It's cool that you can take 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.989
 any number of categories step 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.630
 understand why you will give a 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.220
 subdivision of what kind of reaction 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.860
 will perform an action to the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.019
 edition category is new and is 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.590
 save something then you can 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.570
 organize your intentions well touch 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.090
 we also have the extras part that is the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.290
 key parent and value course 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.570
 where you will put information 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.760
 really extras for those who are treating 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.769
 of yours then in the freeport case the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.709
 istream car or any object that 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.870
 Do you want to pass on to the next one? 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.870
 component that will treat your understanding 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.640
 and lastly we have the flex is that 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.799
 will work as if it were instructions 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.400
 for the android system to know how 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.680
 is to launch, for example, tivit or 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400
 musician to deal with after she's gone 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.709
 launched 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.660
 the folds so they are defined in the 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.430
 class intent and worth giving a 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.220
 documentation so that you know which 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.360
 you can use in your app 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.920
 touch and how we are then know 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.299
 that one understands and will be delivered by 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
 correct component 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.250
 good we have is a division of two 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.630
 groups understand that this is to end 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.239
 How are they going to be delivered? 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.519
 the first are the explicit ones they 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.410
 set the component name is 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.410
 directly in what he already said was 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.910
 previously understood in this way it is 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.950
 I already know 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.780
 to whom she goes independently she understands 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.310
 filter something so it goes straight 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.420
 with that component that give you the name 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.700
 ok 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.990
 after that it has the implicit ones ie 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.410
 where I do not have a companion name 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.810
 defined in this case is going to have a 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.790
 change a little bit in the way how the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.010
 to choose who will treat is understood 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.890
 is the content of the object then in the case 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.960
 understands is tested compared to some 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.290
 filters that we call understand 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.540
 filter is good and how does it work? 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.910
 understands them identified filters 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.910
 it is to inform the system which 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.040
 intents a certain component is tivit 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.430
 about what you think you can see 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.410
 and each component may have 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.390
 more than one type of filter has no 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.190
 has limits and will define what type 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.920
 to identify you will treat there 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.580
 good cause of simple to intendant 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.540
 will be delivered to whom problems 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.760
 coincides with one of the criteria of the 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.250
 intendente filter touch and in the case of 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.950
 explicit cells are not even tested 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.900
 is consistent filters because if you already 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.610
 put the component goes straight pro 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.860
 component does not have to be tested 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.110
 with identified having good 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.600
 The tests I am telling you are 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.950
 based on what is good for the nation thing I 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.600
 I have to know who will do that. 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.910
 central has a good filter point 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.650
 action or by a category in which the 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.980
 that I can tie an action and also 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.050
 divided by category and also clear by 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.880
 type of data information that is 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.050
 transferred together with that 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.970
 and the flag and extra information is not 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.220
 are considered at the time of testing the 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.410
 Try to filter a glance 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.250
 Quickly to close some of us. 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.200
 examples 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.540
 first you're seeing there it's how 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.090
 I move from one asset to another and 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.200
 in this case I'm passing a string and 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.080
 an extra object 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.419
 I create understands passing the context that 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.270
 the current class and then any kind of 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.400
 destination adds 30 more method I could 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.340
 stream add an extra with a putt 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.770
 extra and call start it happening 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.020
 understands with an easy parameter in this way 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.450
 You started a new tivit by going 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.800
 this new good object also for example 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.020
 here people where we were creating 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.390
 an application he has information 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.729
 care so in the case and will treat data 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.099
 of the image type 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.800
 he can handle the display do what he 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.349
 it defines better and in this other example 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.180
 here then I now have the schema type 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:53.240
 of the data in this case has a gold scheme 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.219
 http and also the video type then what 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.189
 this is an application that can 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:01.309
 receive a video via the internet and 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:03.349
 this video in your good app then 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:05.779
 with this, that is, they can understand 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.400
 best how the intense ones work to use 

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:09.319
 the intensive use of your applications 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.059
 for you to better handle events that 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.949
 happens in the application on the system 

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:15.349
 android and so the app stay still 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.909
 better in the next episodes 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:18.289
 let's see what we will see how to use 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:21.379
 still in a more professional way 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:23.389
 these intense and open the application a 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:25.659
 Thank you very much and until the 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.659
 next
