00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.560
My entry into astronomy was purely by chance.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.969
I never set out to be an astronomer, or even
a scientist, but when I was in college I had

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.590
an elective course to take, and astronomy
was one of the electives, and it looked like

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.590
fun.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.240
So I said, "Okay, I'll take that course."

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.689
And I remember when I walked into the class,
there were only three other people in the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.689
room.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.180
Two of them were male graduate students, and
one of them was a senior, and me, a sophomore

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.180
girl.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.510
And I remember going in to the professor and
saying, "I don't think that I belong in this

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.510
class."

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.510
He said, "No, no.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.510
This is for you.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.740
I want this class to be for sophomores, you
know.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.260
Stay in the class."

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.370
And a few weeks went by, and I was really
struggling in college, and it was clear to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.140
me I had to drop a course.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.990
And I was either going to drop my astronomy
course or drop my history course.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.720
I went in to the professor and I said, "I
really.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.670
I think I need to drop your class because
I need to drop one class, and I don't have

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.510
any data yet for my project", and blah blah
blah."

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.510
He said, "Look.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.850
Let's go out to our observatory tonight."

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.850
We had a little observatory.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.929
"And see if you can get some data, and if
you do, then you could write your project.

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:17.119
It'll be fine."

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.850
And he said, in retrospect, thank goodness
it was clear that night because I did get

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.829
my data, and I stayed in the astronomy course
and dropped my history course, and, you know,

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.130
there was no going back from there.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.390
I discovered that what I like to do is use
equipment and the bigger the better.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.030
I love to be looking into space and being
the first person to see something.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.030
It's like being an explorer, but not having
to leave the surface of the earth or travel

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.389
across an ocean.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:51.259
And yet you know some of the things that you
see, you're the only person in the world who's

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.549
ever seen that.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.969
It's a really exciting feeling to be an explorer
and to be able to bring that information back

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.340
and share with people.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:11.390
I just love that thrill, that excitement,
to be right on the edge of something.
