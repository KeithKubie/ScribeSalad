disease eradication is a very difficult
challenge it's been tried for a number

challenge it's been tried for a number
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.390
challenge it's been tried for a number
of different diseases but it's only

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
of different diseases but it's only
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.539
of different diseases but it's only
worked so far for small pox which was

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
worked so far for small pox which was
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.400
worked so far for small pox which was
the first human disease eradicated at

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
the first human disease eradicated at
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.160

eradication has been tried before for

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
eradication has been tried before for
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.720
eradication has been tried before for
malaria in the 1950s and 1960s and it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
malaria in the 1950s and 1960s and it
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.640
malaria in the 1950s and 1960s and it
didn't succeed for it for a number of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
didn't succeed for it for a number of
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920
didn't succeed for it for a number of
reasons right now almost half a million

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
reasons right now almost half a million
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.910
reasons right now almost half a million
people die every year of malaria and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920
people die every year of malaria and
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.709
people die every year of malaria and
which is an extraordinarily high number

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
which is an extraordinarily high number
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.619
which is an extraordinarily high number
and a terrible burden although this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
and a terrible burden although this
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.959
and a terrible burden although this
number used to be well over a million so

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
number used to be well over a million so
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549
number used to be well over a million so
there has been progress in terms of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
there has been progress in terms of
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889
there has been progress in terms of
reducing this burden what one needs to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
reducing this burden what one needs to
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.869
reducing this burden what one needs to
do is different if you're starting it at

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
do is different if you're starting it at
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340
do is different if you're starting it at
a very high burden where everyone is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
a very high burden where everyone is
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.369
a very high burden where everyone is
getting infected several times a year

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379
getting infected several times a year
 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.319
getting infected several times a year
and what one has to do when one's down

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
and what one has to do when one's down
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360
and what one has to do when one's down
to the last couple of cases in a given

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
to the last couple of cases in a given
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.790
to the last couple of cases in a given
country the tactics change the strategy

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
country the tactics change the strategy
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.479
country the tactics change the strategy
change is the tools change when starting

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
change is the tools change when starting
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820
change is the tools change when starting
out in terms of reducing the burden the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
out in terms of reducing the burden the
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429
out in terms of reducing the burden the
most important thing is reducing

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
most important thing is reducing
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620
most important thing is reducing
transmission and providing access to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
transmission and providing access to
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.630
transmission and providing access to
treatment so making sure that people

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
treatment so making sure that people
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.749
treatment so making sure that people
have drugs that work is very important

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
have drugs that work is very important
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789
have drugs that work is very important
the second thing will be to give out

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
the second thing will be to give out
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.590
the second thing will be to give out
things like bed nets to reduce the rate

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
things like bed nets to reduce the rate
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.700
things like bed nets to reduce the rate
at which people actually get new

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
at which people actually get new
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.190
at which people actually get new
infections then all of a sudden you can

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
infections then all of a sudden you can
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960
infections then all of a sudden you can
start to look at a country and see that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
start to look at a country and see that
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.819
start to look at a country and see that
there's very little malaria in certain

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
there's very little malaria in certain
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.069
there's very little malaria in certain
parts of it and most of the malaria is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
parts of it and most of the malaria is
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440
parts of it and most of the malaria is
concentrated in a few remaining pockets

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
concentrated in a few remaining pockets
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.890
concentrated in a few remaining pockets
then building the right surveillance and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
then building the right surveillance and
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.679
then building the right surveillance and
information systems and logistics to be

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
information systems and logistics to be
 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.380
information systems and logistics to be
able to target enhanced efforts at those

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
able to target enhanced efforts at those
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.060
able to target enhanced efforts at those
sections of the country becomes the next

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
sections of the country becomes the next
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.679
sections of the country becomes the next
important thing it gets the point where

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
important thing it gets the point where
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569
important thing it gets the point where
not everyone even in the highest

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
not everyone even in the highest
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.520
not everyone even in the highest
remaining transmission areas is infected

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
remaining transmission areas is infected
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.950
remaining transmission areas is infected
but you have to figure out who is still

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
but you have to figure out who is still
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.350
but you have to figure out who is still
driving transmission who is not

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
driving transmission who is not
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.539
driving transmission who is not
receiving access to the right tools and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
receiving access to the right tools and
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730
receiving access to the right tools and
making sure that you extend access to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
making sure that you extend access to
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.219
making sure that you extend access to
everyone who's driving transmission and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
everyone who's driving transmission and
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.289
everyone who's driving transmission and
everyone who is still vulnerable to the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
everyone who is still vulnerable to the
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.480
everyone who is still vulnerable to the
disease and then in the end it becomes

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
disease and then in the end it becomes
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.670
disease and then in the end it becomes
very interesting there will be only a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
very interesting there will be only a
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.490
very interesting there will be only a
small scattering of cases here and there

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
small scattering of cases here and there
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770
small scattering of cases here and there
and finding them and responding to them

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
and finding them and responding to them
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.759
and finding them and responding to them
quickly

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769

with good case management ends up

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599
with good case management ends up
 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.360
with good case management ends up
becoming one of the most important tools

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370
becoming one of the most important tools

becomes really evident in the power of
 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.000
becomes really evident in the power of
collaboration if you're looking at how

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010
collaboration if you're looking at how
 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.500
collaboration if you're looking at how
can we in this this one domain of say

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
can we in this this one domain of say

might be an intractable question but

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919
might be an intractable question but
 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.199
might be an intractable question but
then you bring in the people who are

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209
then you bring in the people who are
 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.879
then you bring in the people who are
good at vector biology the people who

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889
good at vector biology the people who
 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.559
good at vector biology the people who
are good at vaccines the people who are

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569
are good at vaccines the people who are
 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.229
are good at vaccines the people who are
good at data information systems and

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239
good at data information systems and
 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.759
good at data information systems and
computing and the people who are really

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769
computing and the people who are really

good at health systems and logistics and
 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.599
good at health systems and logistics and
all of a sudden you have a bigger

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609
all of a sudden you have a bigger
 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.610
all of a sudden you have a bigger
problem but one where you can actually

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620
problem but one where you can actually
 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.589
problem but one where you can actually
work together and solve this it requires

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599
work together and solve this it requires
 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.420
work together and solve this it requires
a lot of learning in terms of how to

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
a lot of learning in terms of how to
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.060
a lot of learning in terms of how to
speak each other's language and how to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
speak each other's language and how to
 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.060
speak each other's language and how to
listen to each other and how to actually

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
listen to each other and how to actually
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.760
listen to each other and how to actually
take the time to build these bridges to

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
take the time to build these bridges to
 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.990
take the time to build these bridges to
other fields and

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
other fields and
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.690
other fields and
to really see the advantage and the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700
to really see the advantage and the
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.720
to really see the advantage and the
impact of doing this well it's not easy

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730
impact of doing this well it's not easy
 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.050
impact of doing this well it's not easy
it's much easier to just sit in a room

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060
it's much easier to just sit in a room
 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.430
it's much easier to just sit in a room
and talk to other people from your

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440
and talk to other people from your
 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.320
