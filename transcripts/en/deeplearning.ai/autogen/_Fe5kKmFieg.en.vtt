the rule of thumb in machine learning of

the rule of thumb in machine learning of
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.580
the rule of thumb in machine learning of
taking all the data you have and using a

taking all the data you have and using a
 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.390
taking all the data you have and using a
70/30 split into a trainee intensity or

with much larger data set sizes so let's
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.990
with much larger data set sizes so let's
say you have a million training examples

of your 10 set is that after you finish

developing a system the test set helps

that you think you won't over fit the

totally unreasonable to just have a

training and less for death and test

especially when your very large dataset

purpose which is helps you evaluate

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090

final classifiers you just have to set

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160
final classifiers you just have to set
 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.010

your test set bigger now for that

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020
your test set bigger now for that
 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.629
your test set bigger now for that
purpose and that could be much less than

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639
purpose and that could be much less than
 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.570

20% of your data so I hope that gives

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580
20% of your data so I hope that gives
 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.550
20% of your data so I hope that gives
some guidance and some suggestions on

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560
some guidance and some suggestions on
 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.680
some guidance and some suggestions on
how to set up your death and test sets

how to set up your death and test sets
 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.409
how to set up your death and test sets
in the deep learning era next it turns

machine learning problem you might want
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.779

to change your evaluation metric or

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789
to change your evaluation metric or
 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.089
to change your evaluation metric or
change your dev and test sets let's talk

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099
change your dev and test sets let's talk
 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.210

about when you might want to do that
