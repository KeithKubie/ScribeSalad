questions and you do the interview and I

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530
questions and you do the interview and I
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.620
questions and you do the interview and I
say hey how'd it go they say I got my

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630

questions well then you have a real
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.940
questions well then you have a real
objective measure for that so the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
objective measure for that so the
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.590
objective measure for that so the
biggest mistake people make is they

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600
biggest mistake people make is they
 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.030

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010
person can do the same thing and it
 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.470
person can do the same thing and it
plays out totally different just like

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480
plays out totally different just like
 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.240
plays out totally different just like
one person could be given a drug and

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
one person could be given a drug and
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.339
one person could be given a drug and
cure a disease another person could be

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349
cure a disease another person could be

cure a disease another person could be
given the same drug and it could kill

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
given the same drug and it could kill
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.599
given the same drug and it could kill
them and you know there's a lot of gray

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609
them and you know there's a lot of gray
 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.170
