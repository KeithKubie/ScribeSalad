00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:06.870
To a surprising, and almost humiliating extent,
some of the gravest problems we face during

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.661
a day can be traced back to a brutally simple
fact: that we have not had enough sleep the

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:21.890
night before. The idea sounds profoundly offensive.
There are surely greater issues than tiredness.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.869
We are likely to be up against genuine hurdles:
the economic situation, politics, problems

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.841
at work, tensions in our relationship, the
family… These are true difficulties. But

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:38.320
what we often fail to appreciate is the extent
to which our ability to confront them with

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.410
courage and resilience is dependent on a range
of distinctly ‘small’ or ‘low’ factors:

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.280
what our blood sugar level is like, when we
last had a proper hug from someone, how much

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.510
water we’ve drunk – and how many hours
we’ve rested. We tend to resist such analyses

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.320
of our troubles. It can feel like an insult
to our rational, adult dignity to think that

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.170
our sense of gloom might in the end stem,
centrally, from exhaustion. We’d sooner

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.679
identify ourselves as up against an existential
or socio-cultural crisis than see ourselves

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:21.640
as sleep-deprived. Yet we should be careful
of under- but also of over-intellectualising.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.420
To be happy, we require large serious things
(money, freedom, love), but we need a lot

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.220
of semi-insultingly little things too (a good
diet, hugs, rest). Anyone who has ever looked

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.820
after babies knows this well. When life becomes
too much for them, it is almost always because

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.509
they are tired, thirsty or hungry. With this
in mind, it should be no insult to insist

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.280
that we never adopt a truly tragic stance
until we have first investigated whether we

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.369
need to have an orange juice or lie down for
a while. Probably as a hangover from childhood,

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.429
‘staying up late’ feels a little glamorous
and even exciting; late at night is when (in

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.690
theory) the most fascinating things happen.
But in a wiser culture than our own, some

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.550
of the most revered people in the land would
– on a regular basis – be shown taking

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.510
to bed early. There’d be competitions highlighting
sensible bedtimes. We’d be reminded of the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.470
pleasures of being in bed when the last of
the evening light still lingers in the sky.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.680
Our problems would not thereby disappear,
but our strength to confront them would

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.880
at points critically increase.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.280
Did you know that The School Of Life is actually a place?  Ten places in fact.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.840
Campuses all over the world from Melbourne to London, Taipei to Istanbul, with classes and books and lots more.
