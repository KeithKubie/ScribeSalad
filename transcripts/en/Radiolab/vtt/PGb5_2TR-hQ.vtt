00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.310
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.673
S. T. E.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.850
So before we get started, I had a couple of questions for you. Yeah,

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.340
please fire away. So I've talked to a lot of people who leave, uh,

5
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.820
attempted to contact. Um, there's a lot of hesitation.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.210
People just don't have faith in media right now and considering our issues,

7
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.650
um, to be honest, white controlled media.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.630
So I got a couple of questions for you. Quest away. Um, why now?

9
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.940
Why do we want to do this story now? Yeah, it's been a couple of years. Um,

10
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.760
and it's, it's a, it's a, it's Abby. Abby, just found story.

11
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.760
So we, uh, we did, we were,

12
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:51.570
it was unknown to us until right now this feels a little newsy of the moment.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.490
[inaudible] yeah, this is Robert, by the way. So we have Robert, we have,

14
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.290
we have Robert, we have jad. Jad j a d. D.

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.060
Yes. Yes. We should, I guess, do you have that? Did you have other questions?

16
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.060
Oh, sure. We can wait. We can table those. No, no, no, no. Let's hear them. Um,

17
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.190
so what is the end goal? What, what do you want the story to say?

18
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.533
We never know that.

19
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.670
<v 1>Okay. Uh, Hey, I'm jabbing rod by. I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

20
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:25.150
This is radio lab and today today we're going to tell you the story of a guy.

21
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.250
It's just a guy named Ryan wash.

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.100
He's part of a movement of people who've taken this, um,

23
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.270
established corner of the, uh, academic world and they've,

24
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.050
they've reshaped it and reframed it into something

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.030
<v 0>even weirder and more different. Weirder. Hmm. No,</v>

26
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.360
well not weird bad beards. It's just interesting. Yeah. Interesting. Let's,

27
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.000
let's replay it. The worst weird, what's interesting? I don't know.

28
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.850
I'm just saying in debate lingo, that's a link. That's a link.

29
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.230
Um, usually when you run a criticism, the link is the,

30
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.940
the thing that they have done bad. Oh, okay. Okay.

31
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.060
Well the description, the description of performance debate is weird.

32
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.090
Is problematic. Well, can I, can I, can I put a list? Can I,

33
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:12.860
can I push mentally? Okay. So the world that we're talking about,

34
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:13.910
which is the center of this

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.460
<v 1>whole story is obviously debate. Yes. High school debate and cause debate.</v>

36
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.380
Now I have an inverted debates,

37
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.150
but from the outside it always seemed like this hyper competitive like brain

38
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.520
sport.

39
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.720
These guys were these little accordion briefcases where they have all these

40
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:30.560
files in there with all the research. Yeah.

41
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.810
And they go to these tournaments and they argue about some topic back and forth

42
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.240
and back and forth and back and forth. Yeah.

43
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.310
Now the interesting thing about debate, I didn't know this beforehand,

44
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.600
is that the people who do this often go on to become hugely powerful people.

45
00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:47.290
You know, Supreme Court judges, presidents, leading thinkers, scholars,

46
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:50.740
titans of industry. It's the farm team of the big folks for tomorrow.

47
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:54.790
So Lee Iacocca from Chrysler, he was a debater. Margaret Thatcher, Ted Cruz,

48
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:58.690
Karl Rove, Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Richard Nixon, Malcolm x,

49
00:02:58.691 --> 00:02:59.950
they were debaters

50
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.690
<v 2>today. This is Ryan's story. Ryan washes, story of debate.</v>

51
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.500
Actually Ryan's story debating debate. Yes. Uh,

52
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:12.790
and the story comes from reporter Abigail Keel. And before we get going,

53
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.920
just one let you know there is some strong language in the story.

54
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.240
Some profane words, skip it if you need to. Otherwise. Here we go.

55
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.830
Is it cool if we jump in? Right? I would love to know Ryan.

56
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.890
Like what was your life like before you were ever on a debate team?

57
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.920
Well, Kansas City, Missouri, Inner City Public School, you know,

58
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.810
99% black students. I was actually tricked into debating.

59
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.680
I really had, when was it? When was this? We were talking about,

60
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.070
<v 0>oh, well let me see. 2000, I'm sorry, I'm old.</v>

61
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.000
2000 2005.

62
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.900
When were you born if you send your old 1990. Um,

63
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.300
but yeah, I, I ended up getting tricked into debate. Um,

64
00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:01.700
I was definitely a more of an observant person,

65
00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:05.930
which is why I like to play the game of chess because you know how people move

66
00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:09.290
their pieces, the time it takes them to move their pieces all gives away,

67
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.540
you know, something their tails. Um, and so I was tricked into debate, um,

68
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.860
by playing chess.

69
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.660
And I ended up winning the school chess tournament that we had in this little

70
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:23.660
short German redhead lady named Jane Brown.

71
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.440
Hart came to chess practice. I ended up being President Chess Club.

72
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.710
She came to the chess practice one day and pulled me in the hallway and was

73
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:32.140
like, I understand, you know,

74
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.970
you were chance champion and that's a really good thing.

75
00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:38.810
And we had this debate program and I think you'd be really good at it. Like, ah,

76
00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:39.171
you know,

77
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:41.960
anybody who could critically think at chess could critically think and debate,

78
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.360
Yada, Yada, Yada. I didn't even know what debate was.

79
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.860
<v 2>So he told her, no, no, not for me, but I persist.</v>

80
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.780
So over the next year,

81
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.770
<v 0>she kept on telling me, she was like, I thought I told you to join debate.</v>

82
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.720
I thought I told you to join debate. And I was like,

83
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:59.770
I thought I told you to know I can spot a debater at 20 paces.

84
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:01.900
And she was just like, okay, you think I'm playing?

85
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.230
So one Monday I came to school, she handed me a piece of paper.

86
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:06.880
It was a revised schedule.

87
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:10.300
She had my schedule changed to where I had debate first hour

88
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.490
after. And so here I am. Here you are.

89
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.860
That's what happens with a lot of by debaters.

90
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.820
They just come and kind of dazed like, uh, my schedule got changed.

91
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.610
I'm like, yeah, okay, that's fine. Take a seat.

92
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.060
<v 3>Those first few classes, Ryan's learning the basics of debate.</v>

93
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.880
And in this kind of debate that he's doing, it's called policy debate.

94
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.670
There's two teams and two people on each team.

95
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.080
Usually the debate is about some kind of national policy topic.

96
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:44.010
Like the United States government should increase its economic engagement in

97
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:44.640
China.

98
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.140
One team at the beginning of the debate is randomly assigned to be affirmative.

99
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.490
And that means they're supporting that proposition. They're saying, yes,

100
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:58.310
the United States federal government should do that. Here's why. And

101
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.340
<v 4>the other team is the negative team and they're arguing against the affirmative.</v>

102
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.650
Both of those sides make their case. And then at the end

103
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.840
<v 0>the judge decides who made the better arguments. I mean,</v>

104
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.360
I get them up debating almost day one.

105
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.400
We ended up having a mock debates in class like Pepsi versus coke, you know,

106
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.260
family guy versus the Simpsons and stuff like that. So it wasn't very fun.

107
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.000
It made us learn how to do, um, impact analysis, impact analysis.

108
00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:32.560
What is that? So for instance, let's say you're debating apples versus oranges.

109
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.620
If I say the rinds of apples are necessary for the fertilizer to produce

110
00:06:37.721 --> 00:06:39.970
oranges, so you must vote for apples.

111
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.820
That would be the impact of choosing apples over oranges.

112
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.880
You have to be able to compare the two and make argumentation.

113
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.240
So the traditional center segmentation is Ryan started learning all of this

114
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.690
impact analysis Holeman to model argumentation when he started to devos path

115
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.460
logo. Do you really? Well, yeah, yeah, he did join the team,

116
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.840
started going to tournaments. You know,

117
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:03.430
debate is one of those activities that affords you the possibility of traveling

118
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.350
places where I grew up and went to school. I mean,

119
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.280
students didn't leave like a 40 block radius for their entire life. You know,

120
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.440
I mean, you're in control in that debate round

121
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.990
<v 5>and,</v>

122
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.680
and everybody's listening to you and I think it's important to feel that way,

123
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.180
even if it's only in a 60 90 minute debate round.

124
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.900
Ryan needed those wins he needed

125
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.550
<v 0>it's power that allows enjoying the bed and that affirmation.</v>

126
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.540
I was having a great time.

127
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.200
The thing that helped me out was that my first tournament was a debate.

128
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:40.150
Kansas City tournament debate. Kansas City is an urban debate league.

129
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.630
And so we were debating other kids from the same neighborhood,

130
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:45.430
just went to different schools.

131
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.350
And so that environment of debate was to me very different. Like, yeah,

132
00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:55.240
we want it to win. But there was a lot more comradery in the debate I thought.

133
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.330
And so to me, by the time I went to my first national competition,

134
00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:59.740
I was very much committed to debate.

135
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.080
But once I went to that national tournament for the first time, I was like, oh,

136
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.760
okay, I don't know about this. You know,

137
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.350
at national tournaments you're up against what I call name brand schools,

138
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.360
you know, like predominantly private schools.

139
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.570
And so we were real excited about that. Put our little dress clothes on,

140
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:17.200
got cute,

141
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.210
got on the bus nerves started kicking in a little bit just by going into a

142
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:23.470
debate tournament. We got off the bus, went inside and then

143
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.340
we went into the cafeteria

144
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.810
and when we opened the door to walk into the cafeteria and began to walk in

145
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.740
the room went silent.

146
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.410
I mean when I tell you the talking stopped,

147
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:50.411
literally 300 other plus students stopped and stared at us because a bus of

148
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:52.520
black kids had just arrived

149
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.310
and they like watched

150
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.740
<v 7>us the whole time that we were in the cafeteria and they was like,</v>

151
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:01.950
what are they doing here? Huh? Well at least that's how I felt, you know?

152
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.030
But we walked over to our table and our coach was like,

153
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.180
do not worry about them. Pull out your things, get warmed up,

154
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.470
get ready for competition.

155
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:16.010
And so got our stuff pulled out and started to practice and then they started to

156
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:16.944
whisper

157
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.910
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

158
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.670
<v 7>you know, whether they work Westbourne rap debate stuff were about us.</v>

159
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:25.200
I don't know. I wasn't in Marriott,

160
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.060
but I can definitely explain to you what that felt.

161
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.130
It was real awkward and it was real uncomfortable

162
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.210
<v 2>and making things even more awkward and more uncomfortable.</v>

163
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.040
Is that when the debates actually got going,

164
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.320
and this is particularly true at the national level,

165
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.460
this is what debate sounds like because if it also turns back Walter's desertion

166
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.670
voluntary to get your costs and global nuclear war and escalation.

167
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:51.504
If there's a backlash,

168
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.710
the plan to use federal government through an act of Congress will potentially

169
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.920
inform domestic transportation infrastructure by requiring that all federally

170
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:58.780
funded European projects in the u s use 15 to 22% ground my boat and I split the

171
00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:02.880
concrete mixes putting in for [inaudible] homes.

172
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.200
It's just like the intuitive, the sped up or something. No,

173
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.660
this is what debate sounds like today. Like they, they sort of speed read.

174
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.360
Well the goal of speed reading or spreading if you will,

175
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.620
is to get more arguments out.

176
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.850
[inaudible] structure has an urgent requirement for paradox

177
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.240
[inaudible] and this is like a quick digression that this kind of thing actually

178
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:25.260
started in like the 1960s and the students were actually the ones who were

179
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:25.920
driving it.

180
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.100
<v 8>One of the things that makes debate such an interesting intellectual game is</v>

181
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:34.101
that it's much more of a bottom up driven activity than a top down activity.

182
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.320
<v 2>That's Scott Harris, director of debate at the University of Kansas.</v>

183
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.700
In the case of speed reading,

184
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.010
<v 8>we evolved a situation where one team decided, well,</v>

185
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:47.660
I'm going to present eight arguments and the other team talked slower and only

186
00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:49.400
answered six of them. And the judge says, well,

187
00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:53.150
you didn't answer two of these arguments so you lost the debate because you

188
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:55.790
didn't answer those rookie butts. Well,

189
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:57.500
we need to answer all eight of those arguments.

190
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.300
And they started to talk faster and the other team said, well,

191
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:01.430
we'll present 10 arguments and then they answer 12 and then they bid.

192
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.140
And so it escalated to a point. Um,

193
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.220
in some instances has gone way too far. Right.

194
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.340
<v 2>And getting back to Ryan,</v>

195
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:11.220
it's not as if he didn't know how to do that style of debate.

196
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.980
That's the way I debated. I did try to speak fast,

197
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.740
but he says somewhere around the first national tournament,

198
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:20.120
like all that stuff just kind of stopped making sense to him.

199
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.300
Like the fast talking and the fact that he had to debate these super, you know,

200
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:28.150
Highfalutin topics. Um,

201
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.430
I felt as if I could never take any of the stuff that I learned in debate and

202
00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:36.350
take it back to 33 Oh four ASCII, which where I live,

203
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.690
and this isn't just unique to Ryan.

204
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.570
I mean what you see at this stage in debate is that a lot of kids,

205
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:46.010
like especially inner city kids from public schools, black students, you know,

206
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.710
they just start to drop out of debate at a certain point.

207
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.000
But Ryan Ryan didn't do that.

208
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.430
<v 0>Something big is going to happen.</v>

209
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:57.970
I have a feeling like somebody's going to say no, no, no.

210
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.490
What happened was is that a student from university academy, she was a senior,

211
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.140
her name was marsh Shauna and she went to a different school than Ryan. Um,

212
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.600
she came over and asked around heart. She needed a partner.

213
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.190
There was about to be this tournament called the KC KCC TLC tournament.

214
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.730
It was a big high school debate tournament and Marshana she was a senior,

215
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.040
so she was older than Ryan, but she needed a partner.

216
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:25.720
So she came to Jane Rinehart and Jane said, well, uh, here, Ryan,

217
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:28.120
he's your guy. So met with Marsha,

218
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:32.260
it was the Thursday before the tournament happened and I pulled her into this

219
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:35.470
room and I had Oprah, I had three boxes of evidence, you know,

220
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:37.480
and I was ready to go with my traditional stuff.

221
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.900
The topic was whether the US should increase participation in national service

222
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:44.440
programs. So like peace corps, armed services, stuff like that. So now I'm like,

223
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.240
oh, this is the stuff that I've been working on.

224
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.010
I showed her the learning center of America stuff.

225
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:50.920
I had this like Peace Corps affirmative that I hadn't wrote yet.

226
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.580
You should are note cards with statistics on them, quotes from various experts,

227
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.700
you know? And she was like, yeah, that's cute. Yeah.

228
00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:01.540
And so she handed me this expando and it was just like, okay, take this folder,

229
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.250
go home, study it.

230
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.190
So I got home and I opened this expando and it was all of this,

231
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.210
it was full of things. And I stayed up literally all night

232
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.400
studying this file. I mean, it was not a lot of evidence.

233
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:18.010
There was not a lot of pre written out answers to arguments.

234
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:20.540
There wasn't a lot of that. There was some things that were,

235
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.400
there was Ralph Ellison's. I am an invisible man. Uh,

236
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.410
there was a clip from Ralph Ellison's invisible man in there. There was, um,

237
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.000
you may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies, uh,

238
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.320
my Angelou poem in there.

239
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:40.321
You may trod me in the very dirt but still like dust out.

240
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.190
There was some original stuff that she wrote and I'm like, I,

241
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.040
I didn't get it, but she was the seniors. Sorry. Reinhart kind of told me,

242
00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:51.830
you know, let her, you know, drive the ship. You just ride along.

243
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:56.090
And I was like, okay. So next day we get to the first debate.

244
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.850
I still was very unclear when we arrived at the tournament,

245
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.320
just what was going on.

246
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.850
He and Shauna get to the classroom and standing on the other side of the room.

247
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.990
Are there two opponents? Are they white kids? Mostly, yeah,

248
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.060
they were white guys in suits were republican ties on.

249
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.340
If you want to know if you want to visit, just finish the other team,

250
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.140
their affirmative. So they go first and they're like

251
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.263
[inaudible] blah blah, blah.

252
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.160
They lay out this whole argument about how the national service programs are

253
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:29.640
good because they increase your as power abroad and then it was more Shauna's

254
00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:33.240
turn. So she gets up to give this speech and it starts with this like

255
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.760
four minute long piece of spoken words like this performative speech kind of

256
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.220
about her personal experience in debate.

257
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:48.310
And if she had this way of speaking that was very passionately forceful.

258
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:55.020
It made stop. They stopped writing, they stopped talking.

259
00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:56.780
<v 9>Okay.</v>

260
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.080
<v 0>And in the middle of this riff Marshawn, I laid out this argument.</v>

261
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.750
That's the style of debate that they engaged in.

262
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:07.610
That fast paced form of debate was exclusionary because it demotivated minority

263
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.700
students from participating. And not only that,

264
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.900
like it also creates this resource and balance because if you're going to start

265
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.360
debating with a ton of arguments,

266
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.630
then you have to research that many arguments and you need help researching

267
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:21.261
those arguments.

268
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:23.930
So you pay people and you pay coaches to help you make those arguments.

269
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:28.760
And that clearly favors rich and affluent schools. And beyond that,

270
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.290
Marshawn argued like even the language itself sets up a norm of what counts as

271
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:36.530
intelligent, authoritative argumentation, for instance,

272
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:38.570
like men's voice to be held over women,

273
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.010
black people to always seem angry and brewed, um,

274
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.110
when they're just being passionate, as if they don't have feelings. You know,

275
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.690
it was a criticism of the auctioneer style of debate.

276
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:50.330
It was a criticism of the insular lingo of debate.

277
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:54.860
It was a criticism of the way in which debates were decided socially and

278
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:57.050
politically as opposed to argumentatively.

279
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.110
So I was like, I was like, okay,

280
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:07.910
I can tell you shot did this shock. You know, I w I wasn't shocked.

281
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.580
I was like, Eh. I was like, on one hand I was like, Damn,

282
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:14.210
that was a grace that was tight snaps.

283
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:17.330
Like we was at the poetry slam, but I was sitting to myself thinking like, okay,

284
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:20.180
how am I going to extend this? Like when it got to be his turn,

285
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.730
what's left for him to say, I don't know what more,

286
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.680
what other words I could use.

287
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.810
And so it wasn't until the second person from this team got up and he started to

288
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:33.260
speak and he was like, you know, debating about the seat is great.

289
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.920
[inaudible] this is a, this, this is disrespectful to the state of debate.

290
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:38.090
And he turned to her,

291
00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:43.091
it was this moment he turned to her and he said it like from his soul,

292
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.610
you should go down the hall because that's where poetry pros has helped.

293
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.320
This is academic debate. I was like, what?

294
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.960
And he basically, his argument was that what we were doing was not in debate.

295
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.950
We, what we were having with a talent show is how he described it.

296
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.240
And I was just like, I, I get it. I,

297
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.910
and maybe it was the study and I had done all night,

298
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:11.280
but everything kicked in in that moment where the passion came into the room.

299
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.020
<v 10>What was it like?</v>

300
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.350
I get everything that she was trying to say what she was saying about the

301
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:20.750
structure of debate because I had felt those things before.

302
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:25.670
I just didn't know how to articulate them. Was it like I get that I can,

303
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.460
was it like permission? Was she saying like the Betas? Fuck that. I'm sorry.

304
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.200
<v 0>And let's just say we definitely went on to win that debate. You won this match.</v>

305
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.050
Yeah, we won the debate because, okay,

306
00:17:40.051 --> 00:17:42.950
so let me just explain like what happened in this debate. Um,

307
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.830
judges on already in this kind of situation have a choice, right?

308
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.220
Like they can hear the arguments that Ryan Marshawn are making

309
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.050
<v 2>and they can think, uh, okay,</v>

310
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:55.560
this isn't really about the peace corps or about armed services.

311
00:17:55.561 --> 00:18:00.480
So you lose, or they can do what the judge in this debate did.

312
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.230
And they can say, all right, this topic has kind of shifted,

313
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.690
but let's look at what we have in front of us.

314
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:08.370
Let's look at the arguments that were made.

315
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.560
You Have Ryan and Marshawn is saying that the structure of debate is racist.

316
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.450
And then you've got the other team not really responding in any kind of like

317
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.700
counter argumentative way. And Ryan in this debate, what he does is he,

318
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.870
he points at that,

319
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:28.740
he points it when this other team says leave the room and he says, Hey,

320
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:33.741
like what they just did proves our point that we are excluded from debate and

321
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:35.960
the judge agreed.

322
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.550
<v 0>Oh, so you use, you use his sort of, you used his,</v>

323
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.780
you don't belong here as a kind of as a, as an [inaudible].

324
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.190
<v 1>And that's when I was saying it's about our evidence and came for a lot from</v>

325
00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:50.850
what happened in the debate process. Fascinating. [inaudible] wait, is it like,

326
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.300
let me just take that guy side like so that you're changing the whole, the,

327
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.950
you're throwing their huge bombs at them. Racism.

328
00:18:57.951 --> 00:19:01.640
Hegemony like what's he supposed to do? Say I'm a racist, I'm going to be,

329
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:02.750
what is he supposed to do?

330
00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:06.860
Like what do you mean stop or first off do he should stop

331
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.750
second alpha. I mean,

332
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.530
<v 0>you don't have to say you're racist.</v>

333
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.600
Ain't nobody gonna want to admit that they're racist.

334
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.160
But you can definitely admit that you've engaged in racist practice or you can

335
00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:20.590
have a debate about whether or not that was a racist practice.

336
00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.720
There's a healthy debate to be had about that.

337
00:19:22.721 --> 00:19:27.400
But instead what he said was that you all do not belong here. Leave the room.

338
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:28.430
[inaudible]

339
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:33.290
<v 1>like if you walk in and you say what you just said and you say it forcibly and</v>

340
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.200
eloquently and the other says, hey, you're changing the rules here.

341
00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:38.300
You're breaking things down. No, to leave the room.

342
00:19:38.301 --> 00:19:39.830
And then in the leave the room,

343
00:19:39.831 --> 00:19:43.640
they leave themselves open to this counter attack that you give. It's still,

344
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.820
it still surprises me that you win.

345
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.630
<v 0>And so this was the thing, there's very few rules to debate,</v>

346
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.890
but there's tons of norms and depending on, you know,

347
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.680
the community of debate of the space of debate that you're in,

348
00:19:57.681 --> 00:20:01.370
those norms may differ. But I only know of a few rules.

349
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.390
Like there must be a winner and a loser, a time limits.

350
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.290
And I've seen that be debatable at times. Um,

351
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.490
there must be an affirmative and a negative. Other than that.

352
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:17.870
How one approaches debate, you know, how one approaches the topic,

353
00:20:17.871 --> 00:20:20.240
how one approaches themselves in their opposition.

354
00:20:20.241 --> 00:20:24.110
All of that stuff is debatable and arguably should be debatable. What is it?

355
00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:28.670
There's no like Bible of the, of debate. There's no like book.

356
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.960
It's like, okay so they put out things like the NDT rule book,

357
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:36.470
which is like affirmative teams must be topical, but in the world of debate,

358
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:41.270
what does it mean to be topical? You know, what does it mean to be on topic?

359
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.960
Wow. That has to be debatable in order for

360
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.000
[inaudible] this is getting good. Interesting.

361
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.180
I'm just curious if you're really good at this,

362
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:55.600
like can you give me part of me what you would have said if you were the guy

363
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.270
coming after you or before you,

364
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.290
well I'm one of the things that they needed to do in particular was to say that

365
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.710
the bait itself shouldn't be about debate. They were trying to say that,

366
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:09.330
but what they said was y'all should leave a c. That's interesting. Say.

367
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.820
Cause cause that's one of the,

368
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.020
the place where I have sympathy for the other side is, is where they're like,

369
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.880
yeah, I thought we were talking about the Peace Corps.

370
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.840
Like they walked into the wrong room or something. The other,

371
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.510
but that was one of our argument. It was that how do you do debate?

372
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:25.990
How do you participate in an activity for hours and hours and hours and weeks

373
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:30.580
upon weeks upon weeks that arguably years are years and years and not ever think

374
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.130
about why you debate the wave at you do that.

375
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.010
We'll what we were present. So what, what was the other team's reaction?

376
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.530
They were really upset. Um, yeah, they called us an inward and shit. No.

377
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.590
So really? Yes. Like what do you mean? No, that's

378
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.260
<v 6>[inaudible] we'll be right back.</v>

402
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.950
<v 0>Hey, I'm John [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

403
00:23:41.951 --> 00:23:45.890
This is radio lab and it's back to our story again from producer Abigail Keel,

404
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.120
<v 2>which is a story about a guy named Ryan wash and about debate.</v>

405
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.980
How we debate. Yeah. Okay.

406
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.180
So just to kind of like pull back from that moment with Marsh Shauna and the

407
00:23:56.181 --> 00:24:00.140
poetry and all that, this kind of thing wasn't just happening in a vacuum.

408
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.580
Like it actually came from all kinds of different places all at once. And

409
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:10.890
<v 4>one particular interesting person who was influencing it was George Soros with</v>

410
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.030
the billionaire. Yeah.

411
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.800
<v 11>Soros Soros was fascinated by debate. Dr Shannera read wrinkly,</v>

412
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.770
she's a scholar and a big figure in the so called black debate world.

413
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.290
Saros thought that debate was one of those kinds of activities that was

414
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:30.590
incredibly important to the production of democracy.

415
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.700
So he started funding debate programs overseas and say places like Eastern

416
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.490
Europe and here in the u s he poured tons of money, like

417
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.590
millions and millions and millions of dollars to start urban debate programs.

418
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.000
First started with New York City, 1997 right.

419
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:51.410
So they literally, you know, went out to all of these New York high schools,

420
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.600
talked to a bunch of administrators and sorrows,

421
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:58.340
just pumped money into a New York City to start an urban debate league.

422
00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.620
<v 4>And then it went to Baltimore and then to Chicago,</v>

423
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.480
Detroit went to Kansas city out to La Newark

424
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.470
<v 11>and it just kept moving. So we're almost up to maybe 23 or 24 city.</v>

425
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.120
<v 4>So you know, if you take a step back and look at it all like suddenly,</v>

426
00:25:12.121 --> 00:25:17.121
really within just a few years you have all of these new black debaters and many

427
00:25:18.241 --> 00:25:21.720
of those students she says would go through the exact same thing that Ryan went

428
00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:22.150
through

429
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.260
<v 11>at the regional level.</v>

430
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.600
You can imagine you get a bunch of African American students,

431
00:25:25.601 --> 00:25:28.870
a bunch of teachers who are supporting them in a very positive environment.

432
00:25:28.871 --> 00:25:31.090
They build relationships and friendships.

433
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.190
And so debate feels like home in that space.

434
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.290
<v 2>But as soon as they go to that first national tournament culture shock because</v>

435
00:25:37.291 --> 00:25:41.940
there is a sea of white people and according to Dr. Reed Brinkley,

436
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:47.060
this influx of black debaters into a primarily white space started to create

437
00:25:47.971 --> 00:25:52.710
some tension and pressure and that all built up and eventually resulted in

438
00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:56.150
something called Baloo evil project. The Louisville Project, um,

439
00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.630
started its goal was to increase a meaningful participation like Louisville,

440
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.690
Louisville. What happened? And let us go back

441
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:11.040
[inaudible] I know that there's a baseball bat. [inaudible] okay. So,

442
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.360
um, early two thousands, uh, down at the University of Louisville,

443
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.440
there was a debate team, a predominantly African American team. Um,

444
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.720
and so they were having a hard time finding traction. You know,

445
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.610
he says they would go to these national tournaments and you know,

446
00:26:26.611 --> 00:26:27.690
no matter what they did,

447
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.280
if they tried to accommodate them more traditional stout,

448
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.130
there was always something that they did wrong.

449
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:35.880
Apparently those students would try to make arguments about race inside the

450
00:26:35.881 --> 00:26:38.640
topics, but usually it didn't work.

451
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:42.120
And so at a certain point or they decided that they were done with that,

452
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.090
<v 10>they were like, no,</v>

453
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.130
we are unwilling to play your game in the way that you have defined it should be

454
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:51.750
played. And so these debaters,

455
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:54.870
what they would basically do is they would show up and they would force a

456
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:57.630
conversation about race, basically saying like,

457
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.590
we're not going to talk about China or global trade until we deal with this.

458
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.360
This is always bill's famous sprays.

459
00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:08.070
They said we can't change the state but we can change the state of debate.

460
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.690
So they kind of ended up developing this whole new methodology,

461
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:17.100
which is actually a throwback to Aristotle and in his idea, yeah,

462
00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:20.610
you need three things to persuade someone. Ethos,

463
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.560
pathos and logos. Logos is like logic. So, um,

464
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:30.570
you know, getting research and scholars and evidence and things like that path,

465
00:27:30.571 --> 00:27:32.850
those, that's where emotion comes in.

466
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:36.030
So maybe a personal story or sharing something that will connect with the

467
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:40.200
audience and then ethos, which is kind of hard to pin down.

468
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.770
You can think of it like as credibility. Um,

469
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.900
or it's sort of like speaking in tune with like the spirit of your culture.

470
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.230
That's where you get the introduction of the use of hip hop,

471
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.320
the Sweden to CSA, the doctor, the flashing that the police, the spoken words,

472
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.840
they say the N****s always already queered that's exactly the point.

473
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:01.340
It means that,

474
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.110
and it's the case turn to the affirmative because we're seeing the use of what

475
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:05.370
we call street scholars.

476
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.593
[inaudible]

477
00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.700
<v 11>you know, what was the reaction when this first started?</v>

478
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.450
They would say things to Louisville like, you know, this isn't research.

479
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:18.991
This is me.

480
00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:23.991
Search as if black scholars noted black scholars in their field are not real

481
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:28.890
experts, right? They would say things like, hip hop does not belong here. Um,

482
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.100
your argument style doesn't belong here. And they,

483
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:35.340
and then I'm saying these things and really nice ways, you know what I mean?

484
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:39.630
But there could be really angry, screaming matches at tournaments.

485
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.670
<v 1>Would you have a, an objection to a prohibition as a coach? If you said like,</v>

486
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:44.810
look for the next year,

487
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:50.240
let's never talk about you and leave you or a gender, your sex,

488
00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:51.830
your background, your family,

489
00:28:51.831 --> 00:28:56.150
your religion behind and stay entirely in the brain. I quit.

490
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.210
I doubt that you would do that, but I'm wondering why you wouldn't.

491
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.980
<v 11>I would, well, I think that's anti-black. Oh, I think it's anti black too,</v>

492
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.310
<v 1>Sandy. Everything. It'll be Andy Gay, Andy, you and [inaudible].</v>

493
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.600
<v 11>Right, exactly. It would be anti all of those things,</v>

494
00:29:07.601 --> 00:29:10.090
but particularly for our purposes, right. It's, it's, it's,

495
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:14.140
it would be anti-black and the reason why that's important for me is because

496
00:29:14.141 --> 00:29:17.830
these students don't get to leave their blackness at the door when they enter

497
00:29:17.831 --> 00:29:22.060
for competition. Right. They can pretend that they're not black,

498
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.170
but that does not mean that everybody else is going to pretend that they are not

499
00:29:26.171 --> 00:29:28.510
black. How even when they speak,

500
00:29:28.511 --> 00:29:31.810
what arguments they make when they open their mouth to make an argument,

501
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.950
people are paying attention to the fact that it is coming out of a black body.

502
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.590
They don't get to speak without race being a factor.

503
00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:43.770
Nobody gets to speak without being a factor in a nation where race is a factor.

504
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.300
<v 2>Now back to Ryan.</v>

505
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.140
So he's 16 years old and he sees Marshawn and do this spoken word poetry thing,

506
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.860
starts to read more about Louisville and he's just like, I'm in

507
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.810
<v 0>that. I dedicated my debate career to discussing debate, every debate, every,</v>

508
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.740
every single one, every single one. Fast forward

509
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.040
<v 3>he graduated high school, isn't sure he's going to go to college.</v>

510
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.540
I was a first generation college student,

511
00:30:06.541 --> 00:30:11.160
so I really didn't know much about the process. But then early August,

512
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.220
2008 he gets a message from a debate coach at a small school in Kansas called

513
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.780
Emporia state university.

514
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:19.440
And August 14th I was driving up to Imparja for college.

515
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.140
So Ryan gets there, it gets paired up with a sophomore, Lotoja, Williams Green,

516
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.930
who's now the director of debate at cal state Fullerton go best for him.

517
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.420
Two of them start debating together and over the course of a couple of years,

518
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.430
Ryan starts to get recognized.

519
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.790
<v 11>Um, he's winning speaker awards. He's, you know,</v>

520
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.640
making it into the out rounds at tournament.

521
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.180
But it was an uphill battle.

522
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.750
<v 2>She says that Ryan kept bumping into judges who weren't really into the whole</v>

523
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.690
three tier approach to debate. Yes, I lost it.

524
00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:54.320
A lot of debates before I won any of them. And at this point,

525
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.170
toy has graduated and he's debating with the freshman on the team.

526
00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.600
He's halfway into his senior year when,

527
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:00.520
<v 0>um,</v>

528
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.520
I had their freshman's new debate partner flunked out of school at this point.

529
00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:08.710
It was either find somebody to debate with or it might've been career with over

530
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.650
[inaudible].

531
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.900
<v 11>And so what happens, uh,</v>

532
00:31:11.901 --> 00:31:16.670
is Ryan is also close to one of my best friends who's one of my contemporaries.

533
00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.620
Um, Rashad Evans who was then a coach at western Connecticut University.

534
00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.620
And Basically Rashad had this bombshell idea. He,

535
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.300
<v 2>one day they called Ryan up and they were like about asking,</v>

536
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.970
what if you partnered up with this guy from Rutgers, Elijah Smith?

537
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.840
<v 11>And the reason I'm particularly Rashad, I thought this was a good idea. First,</v>

538
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:39.280
Elijah is within a standardly good debate or he just had excellent skills and

539
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:43.600
traditional skills. But the other reason was that, uh,

540
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.360
both Ryan and Alijah were queer black men.

541
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.530
<v 2>The thinking was that you've got two guys kind of standing at the intersection</v>

542
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.560
of to like marginalized groups and if they're going to try to make an argument

543
00:31:55.631 --> 00:31:58.570
about feeling excluded and invisible in the debate world,

544
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.020
well they can own that argument

545
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.180
<v 0>better than almost anyone. So I called him one night,</v>

546
00:32:05.181 --> 00:32:08.840
it was nine 30 and he's like, Hey, do you want to come debate with me?

547
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:13.430
And he was like, dude, this is a lot. I can't really answer this right now.

548
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.720
And I was like, I understand.

549
00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.380
I'm asking you to come move to Kansas for a semester or what have you.

550
00:32:18.381 --> 00:32:21.970
And Liam Newark from Newark, New Jersey. Um,

551
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.850
he called me back the next morning. Uh, it was like 8:00 AM my time.

552
00:32:25.851 --> 00:32:28.430
And he was like, I've already applied and everything.

553
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.490
And so within the next couple of weeks he was down in Emporia,

554
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.950
Elijah and I debated four tournaments together.

555
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.160
<v 2>First tournament they won two matches.</v>

556
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.790
<v 0>Last four. I was very upset. I was, because I was a senior and I was like,</v>

557
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:45.190
I don't really do two, four but it's fine. You know, it's okay.

558
00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.680
<v 2>Dr. Reed Brinkley was actually at that tournament and she said that watching</v>

559
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:52.940
Ryan and Elijah debate was a hot mess because they just didn't have any

560
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:53.560
chemistry.

561
00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.430
<v 11>There was nothing persuasive about, and nothing popped about it, you know,</v>

562
00:32:57.431 --> 00:32:59.200
it didn't really speak to the judges.

563
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.710
<v 2>She remembers a time when Ryan came over to her apartment to talk to her and</v>

564
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:04.250
Rashad

565
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.820
<v 11>and then he was just like, you know, I don't know what we're doing wrong.</v>

566
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.360
You know, he, he, you know, he just didn't know why things weren't clicking.

567
00:33:10.361 --> 00:33:12.750
What's not working. I don't know what's happening.

568
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.310
<v 2>So the three of them were all talking and Rashad like,</v>

569
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.180
Ryan really looks up to Rashad because Rashad is also a queer black guy,

570
00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:22.640
but he's also like a really, really great debater.

571
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.840
<v 11>And, uh, it was, um, Rashad who said,</v>

572
00:33:25.841 --> 00:33:29.290
you're not being a queer black man. Right? You're being a debater.

573
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.590
And so Rashad would say things like, you need to butch it out.

574
00:33:32.591 --> 00:33:36.460
You know what I mean? You need to, you know, you need to fem it up sometimes.

575
00:33:36.461 --> 00:33:38.710
Sometimes you need to duck walk on him. You know what I mean?

576
00:33:38.711 --> 00:33:42.550
Sometimes you're going to have to vogue, you know, so he's saying be black.

577
00:33:42.551 --> 00:33:45.640
You will always be black and queer in these spaces.

578
00:33:45.641 --> 00:33:50.170
So rather than attempting to hide parts of yourself, uh, instead,

579
00:33:50.171 --> 00:33:51.550
you should be fully you.

580
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.210
<v 2>Ryan with this and his head went back to Elijah and within a few weeks</v>

581
00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:02.420
<v 0>things started to click who were just like, here's what our roles are.</v>

582
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.440
This is what you do. This is what I do.

583
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:08.220
<v 12>This debate is about to make the performance and megawatts for clues perpetuated</v>

584
00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:12.310
by the negative to the crop. I would start the debate argument, thank you.

585
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.360
To propagate the strategy that allows for up tonight.

586
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.970
You can meet those N****s that you think is the most, to me,

587
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.850
Ryan would preach black and rain in the choir, if you will.

588
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.620
[inaudible] structural inequalities that allowed the hood to be segregated and

589
00:34:25.621 --> 00:34:29.540
then Elijah your office, like our art,

590
00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.680
he did the middles to beaches. He dealt with logic, counterarguments,

591
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.540
things like that.

592
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.120
It was a question of black goals of persons who pistol biologist.

593
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.310
He was better at the game of debate.

594
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:43.700
Ryan said they went from practicing ethos, pathos, logos to being,

595
00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.890
we embodied that methodology, how their methodology, literally

596
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.310
your problem. Then I will end the debate that the sit,

597
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.560
the armor that talks about real talk you are

598
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:00.510
and their second tournament,

599
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.240
<v 0>they made it to the finals and they lost in a close decision,</v>

600
00:35:03.241 --> 00:35:06.840
but their third tournament was actually a national tournament called Sita

601
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.000
cross-examination debate association.

602
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.050
It's Kinda called that people's Tournament and they won that tournament.

603
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.710
I was able to give a pretty good two ar and we ended up squeaking the debate out

604
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.160
<v 2>and then their fourth tournament, their final tournament together.</v>

605
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.750
That's actually, it's the whole reason we're telling this story. It's the NDT,

606
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.920
the national debate tournament.

607
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.030
<v 12>That was the tournament. Why decision not to go for framework with Freddie?</v>

608
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.750
Kimra MDT is this marathon of a debate tournament. Oh,

609
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:37.980
like you know, March

610
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.260
<v 4>madness or something. It's held every year.</v>

611
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.840
It lasts for four whole days and there's 13 rounds of debates,

612
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.690
78 teams. The MDT is where

613
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.860
<v 3>Harvard is northwest area, you know,</v>

614
00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.173
Georgetown,

615
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.590
<v 4>so tournament that they prepare for. That's the tournament.</v>

616
00:36:02.591 --> 00:36:04.720
Those sorts of teams usually win. So

617
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.620
<v 0>we were definitely the underdogs. Definitely the underdogs.</v>

618
00:36:09.621 --> 00:36:13.010
An all black team had never gotten past quarter finals of this tournament.

619
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.900
<v 4>Things kick off Friday morning at 8:00 AM in Poria versus</v>

620
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.900
<v 3>Idaho State and they beat Idaho State at 11:45 AM they take care of Puget sound,</v>

621
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.950
four 15 they go against Oklahoma. Oklahoma

622
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.650
<v 4>beats them, but it's Prelim, so it's not like they're out or anything.</v>

623
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.470
And then the crazy thing is that after the loss to Oklahoma,

624
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.370
Ryan and Elijah going on

625
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.900
<v 3>role, they take down USC, they rollover Emery, they beat not one,</v>

626
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:43.170
but two different teams from harbor. They beat Michigan State.

627
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.430
And then on the last day they beat another team from the University of Michigan.

628
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.580
Then they go on to be wake forest that puts them in the SMEs,

629
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:52.710
which has never been done before by a black team.

630
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.890
And then they're against Oklahoma who they beat. And that

631
00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:02.590
<v 0>puts them into the finals. It was, I can't,</v>

632
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:06.780
everything's very surreal to me. We're in the finals of the MDT.

633
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.310
A never happened before.

634
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.660
We're also PR potentially about to unite the crowns.

635
00:37:13.661 --> 00:37:15.520
And what that means is when seat in the NDT,

636
00:37:15.521 --> 00:37:19.180
no team in history had ever done that. And, and who were they up against?

637
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.451
<v 4>Well,</v>

638
00:37:19.451 --> 00:37:23.680
they were going against a team that Ryan had already faced like twice that year

639
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.150
and lost every time.

640
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.620
The 14 time national debate champions,

641
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.600
Northwestern university.

642
00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:37.350
<v 11>So when this round gets set up between Northwestern and in Poria,</v>

643
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.370
one of the things that we've described it as is a clash of civilization.

644
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.300
<v 4>She says that about Northwestern because they have one of the biggest debate</v>

645
00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:50.750
programs in the country. They've got an entire hive mind,

646
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.800
<v 11>you know, with a hotel war room for sure.</v>

647
00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.740
<v 4>Them to strategize, strategizing. And then</v>

648
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:03.530
<v 0>it was us, these two queer black guys from Emporia, Kansas</v>

649
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.020
<v 11>from a really small school with not a lot of resources.</v>

650
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.830
So it is like a David and David and Goliath story.

651
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.740
<v 3>Okay. So let me explain the room to you. I,</v>

652
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.700
this is the biggest room that I had ever debated in this hotel room that they

653
00:38:19.701 --> 00:38:22.490
have the debate happening in is a huge ballroom.

654
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:27.530
Welcome to the final round of the 2013 and this ballroom was packed.

655
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.180
<v 6>[inaudible] but</v>

656
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.120
<v 3>the audience itself is segregated on the right side of the room.</v>

657
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.310
Northwestern side. It was packed full of their people. And then on our side,

658
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.940
was it like racially segregated too? It was, it was. It was.

659
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.380
So just to round the

660
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.340
<v 13>judges for this evening's debate</v>

661
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.170
<v 3>up near the front of the room at a table where the judges,</v>

662
00:38:49.171 --> 00:38:51.180
which included our guys, Scott Harris. Yep.

663
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.600
And how many judges were judging this debate? Five. Four men.

664
00:38:54.601 --> 00:38:56.040
One woman for all of them or what?

665
00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.970
<v 13>And he forgives. Even tonight's debate will be that Universal Ryan</v>

666
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.160
<v 3>and Elijah from Aporia,</v>

667
00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:03.990
they were on one side of the stage and on the other side of the stage are the

668
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:07.560
two Northwestern students wearing our Northwestern jerseys. One was this guy,

669
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.220
m Arjun Valley [inaudible]. I debated at Northwestern for four years.

670
00:39:11.221 --> 00:39:14.910
And the other was his partner, a young woman named spangly Peyton Lee.

671
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:20.380
<v 14>I don't know if she knew this, but she was like my college debate nemesis,</v>

672
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:25.220
my partner Peyton, I was a sophomore. Um, whereas my partner and uh,

673
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.520
Ryan were on the other side were seniors.

674
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.320
And that was the thing that was really getting me,

675
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:32.410
it was going to be my last debate. It was Peyton's last debate.

676
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:35.710
It was my last debate. We were seniors. This was it. Oh Wow.

677
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.070
College debate is the pros. It's the NFL. It's it.

678
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.470
<v 3>Since it's their last debate,</v>

679
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:47.660
everybody kind of gets up before their speeches to say like, thanks and bye

680
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:53.150
<v 13>I to [inaudible] for [inaudible] again,</v>

681
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.620
this is Ryan. Yup.

682
00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.650
<v 15>This is going to be my back. So it might take you a little bit. Um,</v>

683
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:04.280
this is Peyton to be his good buddy can lead my Krebs.

684
00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:10.660
It's been my hardest work and my most rewarding play. Um,

685
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.850
and it's taught me more than I could ever treated, um,

686
00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.810
for that aim intended to all of you,

687
00:40:17.811 --> 00:40:21.230
every part of this community in particular,

688
00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:23.570
number special people. If I like it.

689
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.610
<v 3>Wow. It was, it was a lot.</v>

690
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:33.230
<v 14>So the topic for the year was whether or not the United States federal</v>

691
00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:37.760
government should increase incentives for certain forms of alternative energies.

692
00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:40.040
I was nuclear power, solar power,

693
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.690
wind or reduced restrictions on other forms of alternative energies, coal,

694
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.430
natural gas, and oil.

695
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.920
<v 3>Okay, so Ryan and Elijah were affirmative,</v>

696
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.390
so they were supposed to argue like something positive about the how the u s

697
00:40:54.391 --> 00:40:58.470
government should support solar energy production or should restrict coal usage

698
00:40:58.471 --> 00:41:01.950
and energy or whatever. But they're not going to debate that.

699
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.520
But we had figured out that we had wanted to talk about the ideal home.

700
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:06.953
In other words,

701
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.020
energy isn't the most important conversation that we need to have.

702
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.250
The conversation we need to have is whether this community can include people

703
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:18.790
like Ryan, like Elijah, can we find home and debate

704
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.410
<v 11>because that's how the community feels about itself,</v>

705
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.470
that this is a home place for a lot of people, right?

706
00:41:24.471 --> 00:41:26.150
There are people who grew up in debate,

707
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:29.720
people who started debating when they were 12 and 13 when all the way through

708
00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:30.380
college.

709
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.240
So the people that you often develop the tightest with people that you know how

710
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:38.420
some of your coolest memories cause you all spent the summer together going to

711
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:41.480
debate camp. Those people make up your family.

712
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:44.990
There are people who make friends and debate when they're 13 that they keep

713
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:45.890
until they die.

714
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.870
<v 3>So Ryan's up first and to make his argument about home,</v>

715
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.740
<v 13>he bought the records, the great formerly of the canned reports.</v>

716
00:41:52.741 --> 00:41:55.980
He told them no place like home even look at the pot.

717
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.610
<v 3>He starts talking about a movie.</v>

718
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.420
<v 14>Have you all seen the ways I have? I have not. Okay, so</v>

719
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.480
<v 3>all right, real quick synopsis.</v>

720
00:42:06.481 --> 00:42:11.481
It's a 1978 film and what it is is like an all black cast version of the wizard

721
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.930
devise. So like Michael Jackson is playing the scarecrow.

722
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.440
Richard Pryor is the Wiz and Diana Ross is Dorothy.

723
00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:24.360
<v 0>It was that movie was just like to me, you know, it was the fear that Dorothy,</v>

724
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.250
<v 11>yeah,</v>

725
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.140
<v 0>the beginning of arriving to eyes.</v>

726
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.030
<v 11>Then [inaudible] us. I want to go home.</v>

727
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.780
<v 3>I mean the point Ryan's making is that like that's how he felt too when he came</v>

728
00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:42.130
into debate when he was walking into that cafeteria. Yeah. Yeah.

729
00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.090
And there's a line where you say,

730
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.810
<v 14>let me find a,</v>

731
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.460
<v 3>when the Dorothy's of this world think of energy,</v>

732
00:42:48.461 --> 00:42:50.230
they don't think of three m reactors,

733
00:42:50.231 --> 00:42:53.770
but the energy required to get out of bed and navigate the struggle. Yep.

734
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:57.070
So that's like kind of how, is that how you were like tying it?

735
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.930
<v 0>Yeah. Energy for us meant what it meant to get out of bed in the morning.</v>

736
00:43:00.931 --> 00:43:04.710
What it meant to thrive in a world in which you were never meant to survive.

737
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.180
And for Dorothy, she was able to reach a place of eyes. Please.

738
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.950
Is there a way for me to get home where you realize that all you ever needed in

739
00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:18.951
the first place was yourself inside me and that you had the power all along.

740
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.200
And that's part of what our argument was.

741
00:43:22.201 --> 00:43:25.860
And that was part of what I was trying to say was that I had been in debate for

742
00:43:25.861 --> 00:43:30.000
eight years at that point and I was so sick and tired of people telling me that

743
00:43:30.001 --> 00:43:33.690
what I had to say about debate and what I thought about debate wasn't legit when

744
00:43:33.691 --> 00:43:38.160
debate was a student driven activity that I have just as much to say about this

745
00:43:38.161 --> 00:43:41.820
topic as you do and your claims are not any more valid than mine and vice versa.

746
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:46.650
And Ryan ended his like eight and a half minute speech on sort of this like

747
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:50.010
hopeful appeal, you know, to never give up. You know,

748
00:43:50.011 --> 00:43:54.000
we have to ease on down the road together. Dorothy just can't go by herself.

749
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.863
You know,

750
00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.690
<v 13>maybe I had much older, the fat guy in the crop. Oh, she did have one thing,</v>

751
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:05.040
Brian and that no place like, Huh

752
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:13.503
[inaudible].

753
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.830
<v 0>And then after a few minutes origin the sophomore from Northwestern,</v>

754
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.860
I got up and I gave the first negative speech

755
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.860
[inaudible] you started to make these arguments,

756
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.100
the one that they had beat us with every time called, which basically

757
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.370
<v 3>says the topic has posited a question, you know,</v>

758
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.540
you should the US government alter its approach to energy policy and we think

759
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:42.750
that the affirmative should have to answer that or this isn't a real debate.

760
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.640
Well first of all, I don't think the resolution is a question. Second of all,

761
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:51.240
like nowhere in the rules is it say that you have to be topical, but

762
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.130
our position was debates should be theoretically fair.

763
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.750
Both sides should be able to win.

764
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.780
And if you're going to come out here and argue that racism is bad,

765
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:03.600
debates on a home, like we can't argue against that.

766
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:06.390
I'm not going to say debate isn't a home for me. I love it.

767
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.160
It's not fair to have to argue against that.

768
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:12.720
Just who is debate here for now? Whose debate inclusive Fordham.

769
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:16.590
Now is it actually fair if in order to win a debate you need to have like a

770
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:21.240
whole research team and debate camps that cost thousands of dollars to

771
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:22.350
participate in. But

772
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:28.110
there's a topic that's democratically voted upon by all the schools at the

773
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:28.140
beginning of the year.

774
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.530
Something about the topic should be mentioned just to give the negative

775
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.860
<v 0>basically respect</v>

776
00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:37.120
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

777
00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.550
<v 3>respect for the thousands of hours that my partner and I in the Northwestern</v>

778
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:45.180
debate team and other people in debate have spent researching energy and being

779
00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:49.200
prepared to talk about the intricacies of energy policy in the United States.

780
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.460
This went on for over an hour. I mean it was, it was a lot happening

781
00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.610
<v 2>and eventually Arjun and Peyton really start to like focus their argument on</v>

782
00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.450
like their version of debate, the traditional version.

783
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.520
This is how you actually change the world.

784
00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.700
Not by focusing on yourself but doing research.

785
00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:10.210
It's being able to argue the fermentative side of something and the negative

786
00:46:10.211 --> 00:46:13.150
side of it, because people who learn those kinds of skills,

787
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.960
<v 0>they can actually go and do things outside of debate,</v>

788
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.670
<v 2>like deal in convoluted, globalized trade negotiations or solve global warming.</v>

789
00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:24.260
Right. So after two hours of this, it's almost midnight.

790
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.990
Ryan feels like exhausted.

791
00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.830
<v 0>Um, yeah. But I felt it in the room that people were like,</v>

792
00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:34.670
we're not out of the debate. We can still win at this point.

793
00:46:34.671 --> 00:46:37.880
There's only one speech left and it's Ryan's. I was nervous.

794
00:46:37.881 --> 00:46:39.290
I knew it was my last speech.

795
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:41.780
I knew everybody in the audience was waiting on me.

796
00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.960
Like I just felt pressured and I had maybe five sentences written on a piece of,

797
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:49.430
you know, just copy paper.

798
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:53.390
And I looked over at Elijah and kind of was just like, Whoa, this is it.

799
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:54.890
This is it. That's all I got.

800
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.370
<v 2>The audio quality of this speech is kind of terrible, but um,</v>

801
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.020
we're just gonna let it play.

802
00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.190
<v 12>Hold on. The garden in this debate for you to vote of the team</v>

803
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.010
[inaudible] will be bracing back home.

804
00:47:10.011 --> 00:47:11.990
I don't think they have really answered this.

805
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.560
Uniqueness arguments that are not allowing their debates,

806
00:47:15.561 --> 00:47:19.820
all their evidence that suits the role of a good citizen case suits in

807
00:47:19.821 --> 00:47:20.800
democratic societies.

808
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:25.020
All of the things assume that people played people [inaudible] discussion of the

809
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.160
assets are in the right to have a hold of a first place black wall about our up

810
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.170
in bed, wake themselves in a moment of

811
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.770
reflecting that enables them to speak out as a way to engage and change our

812
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:41.350
relationship to the world and I'll go to ourself,

813
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.700
which means that regardless of whether or not we're using the tools of the

814
00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:46.530
[inaudible]

815
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:50.420
<v 3>and Ryan says like early on that piece of paper he was holding, I like through</v>

816
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:55.890
the weekend we start speaking from my soul, what I will call the Shonda,

817
00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:57.323
the Shonda,

818
00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.530
the Shonda is the place that encapsulates your soul laying in your loins.

819
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.793
Well, all right.

820
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:10.300
<v 12>Probably not. They are calling about Robert. The question, rob,</v>

821
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.500
do we get the first bottle ever?

822
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.110
When do we have a discussion around we go into

823
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.350
[inaudible] or close individuals.

824
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.190
We have already had access to a whole organ to go through

825
00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.790
[inaudible] together. Willy, the whole hand

826
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.410
off to Michael Jackson to leave on down the road together,

827
00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:41.260
which is exactly what Arthur did, did a laptop.

828
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.570
[inaudible] integrates to the question of I don't want it.

829
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.360
Instead of being in their notions apparent is one that is always

830
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.980
[inaudible] now. Now it's still,

831
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.080
we don't now why do I have to make a for soil?

832
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.590
Why do I have a a date another team?

833
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:03.010
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

834
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.110
<v 12>Especially when they don't have another place to go.</v>

835
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.100
When did they have been the place where I can share my perspectives in the team

836
00:49:09.101 --> 00:49:09.934
would probably keep it.

837
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.870
I don't know what of what I would do when this debate is over.

838
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.120
I don't know how long

839
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:30.080
[inaudible] energy production do what it needs to get out of bed in the morning.

840
00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.093
Who was

841
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.573
[inaudible]

842
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.190
<v 10>so there was portions of the speech that I don't remember giving,</v>

843
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.290
which is like apparently I, there was a part where I almost took my shirt off,

844
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.850
shirt off and then like I don't remember that.

845
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:04.210
And I had a pause cause what I was trying to just get out of that zone.

846
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:07.550
I'm in comeback, it's a kind of like provide a voice of reason.

847
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:13.040
But as I kind of slowed down to do that, but the crap

848
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.190
<v 6>[inaudible] I have</v>

849
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:21.620
<v 14>50 seconds left. I still have to answer this last thing.</v>

850
00:50:21.621 --> 00:50:23.720
I still have to extend this piece of evidence. Oh Shit.

851
00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:26.930
I didn't say anything about warming. What do I do? What do I do?

852
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.740
Am I doing ever since like, I don't know, this is reason enough to vote.

853
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:32.030
Affirmative. Forget it.

854
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.250
[inaudible] and then

855
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.260
<v 11>I walked over and shook their hands.</v>

856
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:48.120
<v 7>Um, I gave Elijah hug and then I walked out the room and went and smoked a</v>

857
00:50:48.121 --> 00:50:48.954
cigarette.

858
00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:58.930
<v 8>At that point as a judge, I took a deep breath, uh, packed up my notes.</v>

859
00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.970
I put headphones, noise canceling headphones on my head. Um,

860
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:07.150
I found a room where there was no one else around and I could have total quiet

861
00:51:07.151 --> 00:51:09.820
and think about what had been said.

862
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.730
<v 2>Nope. Scott says that he felt like the debate was close, like</v>

863
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.770
<v 8>there's going to be a tight vote. So I sit down and look at my notes.</v>

864
00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:21.400
I relisten to the last couple of speeches that I had recorded several times.

865
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:26.810
<v 2>On one hand Northwestern presented a lot of good research and a lot of it he</v>

866
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:29.150
agreed with. On the other hand,

867
00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.990
like Peyton and Arjun are saying if you have these skills then you're going to

868
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:36.800
be better prepared to go talk in front of like Congress or something.

869
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.390
But Scott says if you just listen to like Ryan and Elijah,

870
00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:43.610
like they sound more persuasive.

871
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:47.150
Like you can't convince me that somebody who sounds like that isn't actually

872
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:50.610
also prepared to do those things. And so like Ryan and Elijah,

873
00:51:50.611 --> 00:51:55.010
his whole presentation is actually proof that Peyton and origins argument is

874
00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:59.000
invalid. At the same time, he thought

875
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:05.780
there have to be things that we all just agree on as our starting point

876
00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.550
<v 7>and if the alternative is a world in which the affirmative can come into a</v>

877
00:52:09.551 --> 00:52:12.150
debate and talk about anything they want to talk about, um,

878
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.090
then the ability to make that a fair competitive environment seems a little

879
00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:16.924
problematic.

880
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:21.070
<v 2>I think Scott was kind of torn.</v>

881
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:24.260
<v 7>It took me about 45 minutes to an hour to decide</v>

882
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.140
who I thought won the debate.

883
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.530
<v 2>Ryan says that when he was sitting there waiting for the decision to be</v>

884
00:52:31.531 --> 00:52:34.830
announced, I was very convinced that we lost and eventually

885
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.200
<v 7>they announced those decision three two decision.</v>

886
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:41.100
Three judges voted from Poria in two for Northwestern [inaudible] for three to

887
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.880
four, the affirmative from Emporia. Yet

888
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.513
<v 14>what</v>

889
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.570
[inaudible] my partner Elijah jumped out. He's like, yeah,

890
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:57.870
the people are crying. I mean, if you could have seen this

891
00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.250
<v 11>room erupts into joy.</v>

892
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.280
I was in tears watching this historic moment happen because I'd been around for

893
00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:11.531
so long and I'd watched so many black debaters fail to make it to that top

894
00:53:11.661 --> 00:53:13.250
point. I stood there and I was like,

895
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.460
<v 7>oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.</v>

896
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:22.090
All I can say, I said it like a million houses. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

897
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:26.130
Oh my God. Yeah. What swayed Scott in the end?

898
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.120
<v 2>Well, he actually published this like 11 page. I say all about, you know,</v>

899
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:34.050
his decision explaining why he voted the way he did. Um, there's a lot in there,

900
00:53:34.051 --> 00:53:37.440
but what I kind of take away from it is that, you know,

901
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:42.390
while while maybe he didn't like that there was a sort of disregard for the

902
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:43.224
topic,

903
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.950
he would have liked it a whole lot less if Ryan and Elijah hadn't been in the

904
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:47.630
room.

905
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:51.800
<v 1>I mean, debate is itself, is incredibly important to me.</v>

906
00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:56.830
A debate has been the greatest influence in shaping who I am as a person.

907
00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:00.260
Um,

908
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:05.260
and so in many ways I view debate as my home and given that it was a debate that

909
00:54:06.891 --> 00:54:10.850
challenged and criticized the activity that I have made a home for the last 40

910
00:54:10.851 --> 00:54:13.340
years that pointed out weaknesses,

911
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:17.300
it caused me to reflect whilst their argument really worked,

912
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.830
I find this kind of hike. It's,

913
00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.100
it's either a segregating or an integrating event.

914
00:54:25.101 --> 00:54:29.520
My Gavitt Mike senses that as kind of integrating like interracially chili

915
00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.510
world. This is a strangely warm spot.

916
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:36.560
Are you saying? No. Well, right.

917
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.390
<v 2>You know, when we asked Ryan about how he felt about winning this tournament,</v>

918
00:54:42.391 --> 00:54:47.391
I expected him to be really like celebratory and you know,

919
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:49.260
tell me that it changed his life.

920
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:53.610
He was the first black student to win this tournament. And you know,

921
00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:58.500
it seemed important to me, but he didn't really go there.

922
00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.680
No, you still don't seem like as proud as I want you to see him. You know,

923
00:55:03.681 --> 00:55:05.010
like why, why no,

924
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.570
<v 1>you know, I, you know,</v>

925
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:13.290
it was a good thing for history. Um,

926
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.160
it was a good thing to motivate people. I just,

927
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:21.600
I just want to stay focused. It was an important, when it was significant,

928
00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:23.250
it was powerful. It was beautiful,

929
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.840
but it was very clear to us very early on that not much had changed by the time

930
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.250
we got into the next year.

931
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:34.340
<v 2>Shannera Reed wrinkly says that since Ryan's, when there's been like a backlash,</v>

932
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:38.030
um, basically, I mean the next year another black team broke through.

933
00:55:38.031 --> 00:55:41.750
It was two black women this time and not caused this big controversy and people

934
00:55:41.751 --> 00:55:46.070
were saying that the state of debate was ruined and in that same year you even

935
00:55:46.071 --> 00:55:49.310
had a group of schools like talking about breaking off to form their own

936
00:55:49.311 --> 00:55:53.000
tournament where performance styles wouldn't really be invited.

937
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:58.430
I think all of this just makes Ryan like not really know how to feel about his

938
00:55:59.550 --> 00:55:59.580
win.

939
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.580
Like maybe sometimes it can just for him feel like an anomaly.

940
00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:12.200
<v 1>Yeah. It sort of seems like there's a series of accidents here.</v>

941
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:16.970
You're in a school where accidentally you have a teacher who pushes you pretty

942
00:56:16.971 --> 00:56:21.971
much forces you into something which suddenly takes you over.

943
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.990
You turn out to be peculiarly good at it almost again by accident.

944
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.800
Then you're thrown into the sequence of events where you get to meet Elijah,

945
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:33.580
and then almost by accident you become a champion and then suddenly it's over.

946
00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:38.790
The whole thing feels strangely lonely to me.

947
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:43.600
Lonely but beautiful. But I wonder how it feels to you. Ironically,

948
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:47.530
the thing that is the first time you have agreed with Robert this entire

949
00:56:47.531 --> 00:56:49.840
interview, oh, stop.

950
00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.920
Just gotta give him a hard time versa.
