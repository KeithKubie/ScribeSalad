00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.000
 We are given a table, 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 which contains the plurality of n, 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.620
 where n equals 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.930
 and the corresponding values ​​of g of n are given. 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.800
 One way to look at it is that this function g 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.290
 defines a row in which n is the number of an array member. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.200
 Or it is the same 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.910
 as a line in which the first article is 168, 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.900
 the second is 84, the third is 42, 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.420
 and the fourth member is 21, 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.820
 as it continues, and more, and more. 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.930
 Now let's think of what kind of line is that. 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.160
 Assuming it starts at 168, 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.890
 how will we go from 168 to 84? 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.480
 One way is to get 84, 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.760
 and another way is to multiply by 1/2. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.630
 We multiply by 1/2. 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.730
 And then, to go from 84 to 42, 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.000
 we multiply again by 1/2. 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.340
 And to go from 42 to 21, we multiply again by half. 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.560
 So here's a geometric progression. 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.160
 We start with a member and each next member 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.350
 is the previous article multiplied by 1/2, 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 or as it is often called - in the general private of progression. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.320
 How can we write g from n, how can we set the progression 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.860
 obviously regarding n? 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.050
 I recommend that you pause the video 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.420
 and think about how to do it. 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.181
 So if I say g of n equals ... 

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.190
 let's try to describe the function, 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 which we just saw here starting at 168, 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.060
 and then multiply by 1/2 each time, 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.920
 when adding a new member. 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.180
 Well, one way is to start with 168 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.330
 and then multiply by 1/2, 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.230
 we will multiply by 1/2 a certain number of times. 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.100
 We can look at the pointer as number of times, 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.160
 number multiplied by 1/2. 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.260
 How many times will we multiply by 1/2? 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.792
 We multiply the first member by 1/2 zero times. 

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.950
 The second one multiplies by one-half once. 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.820
 We multiply the third member twice by 1/2. 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.878
 We multiply the fourth article three times by 1/2. 

00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:04.300
 It seems that regardless of which member we are, 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.630
 we multiply by 1/2 as many times as the member's number minus 1. 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.120
 You can check that it is. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.430
 If n equals 1, you will have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.660
 1 minus 1, which will be 0. 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.300
 1/2 at grade 0 is simply 1. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.260
 So you get 168. 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.320
 If n is 2, 2 minus 1, 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.940
 you will multiply by 1/2 once, 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.690
 here is n is 3, 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.130
 you will multiply twice by 1/2, 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.750
 because 3 minus 1 is 2. 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.230
 You will multiply twice by 1/2, 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.490
 as you see it here. 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.790
 So it looks like a really nice set of definitions 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.050
 for this geometric progression. 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.400
 You can also view it in other ways, 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.740
 you can write it like g of n equals, 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.220
 to see, one of the ways to write it is 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.920
 as 168 and simply algebraic 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.350
 I process it on 2 in degree n minus 1. 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.675
 The other way you can view it, 

00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:01.090
 let us use the properties of degrees a little, 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.030
 we can say that g of n equals to, let's see, 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.290
 1/2 of n minus 1, this is the same 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.494
 like 1/2, let me write it down. 

00:03:09.494 --> 00:03:12.520
 This is equal to 168. 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.221
 Let me write it in another color. 

00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:16.760
 This part here is the same thing 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.280
 such as 1/2 of degree n. 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.660
 So we have 1/2 of degree n by 1/2 of grade minus 1. 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.040
 1/2 degree minus 1, 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.420
 which is equal to 2, so 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.879
 this is 2. 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.790
 So we can write this whole thing like 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.560
 168 by 2 is how much? 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.620
 336? 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.200
 336, did I decide it true? 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.500
 160 by 2 will be 320, plus 16, 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.030
 2 at 8, yes, 336. 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.660
 And then we have 1/2 of grade n. 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.720
 1/2 degree n. 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.970
 So these are equivalent statements. 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.750
 This has a slightly more intuitive meaning, 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.400
 in a sense, it just pops out, you start with 168 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.190
 and multiply by 1/2. 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.581
 By the member you are in, minus 1. 

00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.220
 But this is algebraically equivalent to that, 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.930
 the original one. 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.850
 But can we also define g of n by giving it recurrently? 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.050
 Again, I recommend pausing the video and trying to do it. 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.010
 In many ways, the recurrent definition 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.690
 it's a little easier, so let's do it. 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.890
 g, will write the assigned function in a different color, 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.230
 I will continue with g of n, 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.000
 as this is used in the table here. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.030
 g of n equals to, let's see, 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.879
 when n equals 1, 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.879
 if n equals 1, we begin with 168. 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.340
 If n is greater than 1 and is a natural number, 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.420
 this will be determined for all positive integer numbers, 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.080
 what will we do? 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.430
 We will take 1/2 and multiply it 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.080
 under the previous article. 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 So we will have 1/2 per g of n minus 1. 

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.460
 You can check that it is. 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.690
 If n equals 1, just go right here, 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.300
 we have 168. 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.650
 g of 2 will be 1/2 g of 1, 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.230
 which is of course 168. 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.180
 So we have 168 by 1/2, that's 84. 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.680
 g of 3 will be 1/2 g of 2, 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.930
 or g of 3 is 1/2 g of 2. 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.730
 Thus, we define: 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.290
 this is the explicit definition of this geometric progression, 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.450
 this is the recursive function for setting this geometric progression.
