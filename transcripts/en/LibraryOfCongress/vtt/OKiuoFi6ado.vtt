00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.480
&gt;&gt; Wendy Rieger: I, my father
who lived to be 93 and drove

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.490
until he was 91 used to say to
me, "Growing old is not for wimps"

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.120
and I just turned 60 this
year and I, so thank you.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.220
[ Applause ]

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.250
You get applause for 60 now.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.590
I must be old.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.550 position:56%
Kidding. But it's and being an aging
anchor on television is just loads

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.760 position:56%
of fun, you know, keeping everything
together with spanks and duct tape.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.640
But I'm a baby boomer.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.910
I'm sort of on the end
of the baby boomers

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.110
and I think baby boomers have,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.300
we have been creating the
revolutions you know since 1968,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.500 position:56%
1969 and I think also we in terms
of aging so many of us have watched,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.350
I know I did, watch my
parents grow old and die

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
and thought, oh my
God that was ugly.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.810
I don't want to go, do it that
way and so I think we are ready

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.620
for a revolution and we are ready
to start leaving bread crumbs

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.230
for the generations behind us
those millennials, you know,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.170
those dastardly millennials.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.030
You know and I think well you
know while we're not ready

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.820
to sack the temple of youth, I
think we need to build a temple

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.780
for being older and mature
and having mastery and smarts

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.040
and getting a clue, which
I think is what you get

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.430
when you the loser collagen.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.160
So, with that in mind, is an honor

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.570
to welcome Jo Ann Jenkins who's
the CEO of AARP and author of,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.710
I love the title, the national
bestseller "Disrupt Aging"

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.180
and we are here today
because of her.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.080
Did you know that she started
his national Book Festival?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.510
Yes she did yes.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.970
If 60 gets applause then starting
the Book Festival should definitely

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.300
get applause.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.220
She launched it in 2001 and
as the, she was the Library

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.730
of Congress' then chief
operating officer.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.780
She led and expanded this
festival through 2010.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.760
When they first started it they
had 5000 people, now as you know

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.090
if you've been out there are
150,000 people attending this,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.670
yeah [applause].

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.570
And since joining AARP in 2010
and leading it since 2014,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.630 position:56%
Jo Ann has sponsored groundbreaking
work to transform AARP into a leader

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.420
in social change dedicated
to enhancing quality

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.250
of life for everyone as we age.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.390
Her legacy of the Library

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.390
of Congress not only
includes establishing

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.270
and expanding this festival,
but also creating the Library

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.100
of Congress experience which is an
interactive pathway offering access

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.890
to the library's incomparable
collection.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.310
That's a place where you need to go
spend months and she builts strong

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.010
and mutually supportive
relationships

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.000 position:56%
with private sector sponsors so that
we have all of this great access.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.970
And under her leadership AARP,
the vision there was we imagine

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.340
because you have to have
vision you have to keep sort

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.030
of recreating yourself as we
know as every decade goes by.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.440
And you have to redefine
the challenges,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.780
get rid of the outdated beliefs,
and really ignite some new insights

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.380
that allow people to adapt to
today's realities of aging;

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.960
she also just finished
a partnership with us.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.130
We were so proud to be a part
of it and we were just talking

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.880
about to expand it next
year; the drive to end hunger

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.270
which was a multiyear nationwide
campaign which has donated

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.330
over 36 million meals
and provides support

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.450
to over 100 anti-hunger
organizations across the country.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.750
So it is my privilege to welcome

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.590
to the 2016 National Book Festival
the best-selling author of the book

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.160
"Disrupt Aging; A Bold New
Path To Living You're Best Life

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.510
At Every Age", Dr. Jo Ann Jenkins.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:33.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.400
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: Well
good afternoon everyone.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.890
It has been my honor to serve for
15 years at the Library of Congress

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.290
and now to be the CEO at AARP,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.840
my two favorite organizations
in the world.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.030
I'd like to start and share some
thoughts you and then we'll open it

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.440
up for questions at end, but
let me start with this question;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.250
how old would you be if you
didn't know how old you were?

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.440
Think about it for a moment.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.740
&gt;&gt; Five.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.040
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: Five.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.750
It's an intriguing question.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.130
How does your age affect the
way you behave, what you do

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.870
or what you don't do, and how
often do you get into societies

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.470
or the media's idea of what is old?

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.340
And then think about this, what if
you could lose your preoccupation

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.340
with age and just put
it outside of your mind?

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.380
What if of instead
of being preoccupied

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.260 position:56%
with aging, we focus more on living?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.480
Would you behave any differently?

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.400
Would you treat other
people differently

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.990
or would you be happier
and enjoy life more?

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.890
I love to tell the story about the
Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.820
Satchel Paige joined the Cleveland
Indians in 1948 and help lead

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.900
to the American League
Pennant that year.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.330
That was the first year he had in
the majors, though he had played

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.440
in the Negro leagues
for almost 20 years.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.170
He was somewhere in his mid40s.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.470
I'm being made vague,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.750
because Satchel Paige
never knew how old he was.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.370
Today it's hard to find players
who play over the age of 40

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.150
and playing past 50 was unheard
of, but Satchel Paige did just that

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.930
and reporters would constantly ask
him, "How can you play at your age?

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.910
What keeps you going?"

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.610
How? He would simply say, because
he didn't know how old he was,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.320 position:56%
his age didn't keep him from
performing the way he knew he could.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.450
"Age is a question of mind
over matter", he would say.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.620
"If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter."

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.720
Well, for better or worse,
the overwhelming majority

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.440
of Americans do know how old they
are, and unlike Satchel Paige,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.280 position:56%
they do allow their pre-perceptions
of age to influence how they behave.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.040
And I wrote this wrote
this book, "Disrupt Aging"

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.200
to change the conversation
in this country

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.960
about what it means
get older and it's not

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.670
about aging it's about living.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.600
And it really is, I hope
giving people the opportunity

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.160
to embrace aging as something
to look forward to rather

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.700
than something to fear, to see this
period of your life not as a period

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.720
of declined but a period of growth;

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.320
to recognize the opportunities
not just the challenges

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.460
and perhaps most importantly, to
see themselves as contributors

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.830
to society and not burdens.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.020
Here is the premise in a nutshell.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.870
We need to change the
conversation in this country

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.040
about what it means to grow older.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.800
The way people are aging is
changing, but many attitudes

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.080
and stereotypes about
aging have not.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.650
We need to challenge these
old stereotypes and attitudes

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.840
and spark new solutions so more
people can choose how they want

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.680
to live and how they to age.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.110
Disrupt aging is not only about
changing the conversation,

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:16.400 position:56%
it's also about changing the reality
of aging, our individual behaviors,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.550
our social norms, public policies
and private sector practices

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.260
and it encompasses changing
the culture; how we perceive,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.790
what we believe, and how we behave
as individuals as institutions

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.400
and collectively as a society.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.950
So make no mistake about it,
the way we are aging is changing

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.590
and mostly for the better.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:46.260
Consider this, 10,000
people a day are turning 65

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.560
and that trend is going to continue
for at least the next 14 years.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.400
Over the next two decades,
the number of people age 65

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.370
and older will nearly double to
72 million or 1 in 5 Americans

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:07.130 position:56%
and by 2050, people 60 and older
will outnumber children 15 and under

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.150
for the first time in our history.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.080
The fastest growing age group,
people of the age of 85,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.290
and the second over
the age of a 100.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.090
And if that doesn't make you
stop and think, picture this;

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.100
picture a 10-year-old maybe
it's your son or daughter

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.630
or granddaughter, grandson,
niece or nephew,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:37.100
that 10-year-old a 50%
chance of living to be a 104.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.180
And older he or she gets,
the odds even grow larger.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.150
And some experts have already
predicted that the first person

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.070
who is ever going live to be
150 is already alive today.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:57.650
Now let me pause here for
just a moment to point

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.680
out that this is truly a
remarkable achievement.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.360
We've added more years to
the average life expectancy

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.920
since the 1900s than in all human
history up until this combined.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.650
Today, because of increased
longevity

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.520
and generally better
health, we have opportunities

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.960
for continued productivity
and growth that our parents

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.500
and grandparents and
generations before us never had.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.810
The good news is that the way
people are aging is changing

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.800
and it's mostly for the better.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.340
The bad news is that many of
our beliefs and perceptions

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.000
of aging have not changed
and nor has the solutions

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.120
for supporting people as they age.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.070
Our ability to live
longer, healthier,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.860
more productive lives is one of
mankind's greatest accomplishments,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.860
yet we don't see it that way we
often see it as a problem rather

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.090
than a solution and negative
stereotypes of aging are

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.140
so ingrained in our psyches that
they're difficult to overcome

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.620
and most of us don't even try.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.820
We either just accept this
old stereotype and live

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.360
out this negative image
of aging or we deny,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.160
like Wendy, that we're aging.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.810
And we fight it with
every fiber of our being

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.120
and in some cases every
dollar in our bank account.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.370
If you go to the Google search
engines and type in the bar "I lie

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:29.220
about my" The first word
that pops up is "aging."

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.710
We are a society obsessed with age.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:38.130
Everyone wants to live long,
but nobody wants to get old.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.670
I've always thought that the
comedian Larry Miller described

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.970
it best.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.270
Some of you may have heard this.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.940
He says, "Do you realize that the
only time in our lives when we'd

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.590
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: See what I mean?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.590
You change the perceptions and
you begin to change beliefs.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.390
Think about this way.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.570
Today, it is socially
unacceptable to ignore, ridicule

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.450
or stereotype someone
based on their race,

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.390
or gender, or sexual orientation.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.760
So why is still acceptable for
people to do this based on age?

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.150
Aging in not a problem
anymore than living is.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.970
It's a human experience
and a natural part of life.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:31.550
Muhammad Ali once said that "People
who see life the same way at 50

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.400
that they did at 20 has
wasted 30 years of life."

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.660
In today's world we might
add that people who see life

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:45.030
at 80 the same way they did at
50 have also wasted 30 years.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.010
And so I won't pretend
that we aren't affected

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.500
by our aging process, we are.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.420
But it's time we put aging
in its proper perspective.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.100
We can't allow society whether
the media or advertisers

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.680
or a popular culture to
delude us into thinking we can

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.170
or should stay young forever.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:11.440
That leads to this self-sense
of denial about who we are

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.790
and where we are in life,
and ultimately a feeling

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.290
of hopelessness and despair.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.650
And my years at AARP have
confirmed for me that growing,

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.010
a growing number of people
who are 50 and older are ready

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.480
to change this conversation
about what means to get older.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.000
We like where we are.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.480
We're looking forward to the
years ahead and we're connecting

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.040
with more people in more meaningful
ways through our technologies.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.520
We're committed to both our
family and energized by our work,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.060
and we don't have to
make a choice we can

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.200
and have, but can and have both.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.390
We are caregivers whether as
adult children taking care

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:58.310 position:56%
of older parents, parents caring for
children or grandparents taking care

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.390
of grandkids or some
combination of all of these.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.770
We're volunteers and
philanthropists and we are leaders

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:10.020
in our communities, supportive of
our churches, and helping hands

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.650
to our friends and neighbors.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:17.080
We are a generation of makers
and doers who have a desire

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.650
to continue exploring
our possibilities

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.700
and to celebrate discovery
over decline and we seek

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.210
out these opportunities and grab
hold of them wherever we find them.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.750
That optimism, that desire
to live life on its own terms

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:37.150
to make a difference is very
real and it confirms my belief

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.530
that no one's possibility
should be limited by their age

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.870
and that experience has value.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:48.650
I also know that people face
real challenges every day.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.860
Many struggled to meet their most
basic needs of health, financial,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.030
caring for themselves or their
families and they don't want

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.330
to be limited or defeated
by these challenges.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.490
They want win back their
opportunities and we need

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.930
to disrupt aging to help people
confront their challenges

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.670
and embrace their opportunities
to the fullest extent possible.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:18.280
That requires changing the way we
talk about aging from something

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.480
to fear, to something
to look forward to

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.650
and this change is long overdue.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:29.930
To start, there 3 areas for change
is most needed for individuals

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:35.520
in our society and I refer to
them as health, wealth and self.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.570
I believe we can create a society

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.820
where all people can grow older
knowing that they have access

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.840
to the care information
services they need to live longer

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.760
and healthier and more
independent lives.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.370
Where we have the financial
resources and opportunities

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.300
to match our longer life expectancy

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.060
and where we're seen is an
integral part of a society

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.110
and an aspirational asset.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:07.000
By focusing on health ,wealth and
self, disrupt aging is beginning

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.040
to alter the mindsets around aging.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.900
Fortunately, age disrupters are
everywhere like you in this room

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.830
and we don't have to
look far to find them.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:23.280
As the boomers move into their 50s
and 60s and now beginning this year

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.390
into their 70s, their
disrupting aging everyday just

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.210
as they have done with other
aspects of their lives.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.930
Millennials are also
disrupting aging

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.990
by the way they're demanding a
work-like balance their jobs.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.810
How they're showing us the benefits

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.490
of this economic model
and shared communities.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.480
You know my Angeloo [phonetic]
once said that at 50 each

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.790
of us finally becomes the person
we've always wanted to be.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.540
I think that's true.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:26:00.560 position:56%
I believe that age and experience
can expand the possibilities in life

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.510 position:56%
for every member of society and
when we disrupt aging and embrace it

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.490
as a part of life to
move forward to,

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.900
we can begin to discover the real
possibilities of living a live

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.970
that we've always thought.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.590
In closing, I'd like to
leave you with this thought.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:26.810
On January 6th, 1941, President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt stood

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.770
before a joint session of congress
to deliver his annual State

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:35.570
of the Union address in that
speech Roosevelt argued for an end

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.300
to the isolationist policies
they grew out of World War I

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.900
and offered a new ideology
based on four freedoms;

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.280
the Freedom of Speech,
Freedom of Worship,

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.730
Freedom from Want,
and Freedom from Fear.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.440
Roosevelt's four freedoms
became a rallying cry

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.450
to guard a public support

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.930
for America's involvement
in World War II.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.270
They resonated with the
American people as a statement

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.970
of the country's underlying
values and to this day,

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:12.370
Roosevelt's four freedoms reigns
through as the basic values

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:18.250
that defines American life and
examples of American acceptualism.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:23.230
Indeed this forum, this book
festival here today is a living

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:28.240
testament to the core
democratic values of free speech.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.990
In much the same way as Roosevelt's
four freedoms inspired America

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:37.160
to wake up and realize what was
happening in the world and to act.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.980
I have identified what I call
the four freedoms of aging

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.940
that will define our new vision
from living and aging America

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.320
and to inspire us to continue

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.700
to disrupt aging making
that vision a reality.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.050
The first one, the
freedom to choose how

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.750
and where you want
to live as you age.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.830
When it comes to aging,
there is no one size fits.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.230
If you want to follow
traditional path

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.890
to retirement you should
be able to do that.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.000 position:56%
If want to stay active engaged, you
should have the options is to pursue

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.760
that as well and whether you want
to continue living in your own home

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.720
as you get older or move to
retirement community or live

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.740
in an institutional setting,

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.490
those options should be
yours to choose from.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.500
It's all about having
options that allow you

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.140
to choose how you want
to live and age.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:36.190
The second freedom, the
freedom to earn a key part

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.690
of the retirement model
that most of us grew

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.880
up with was the freedom from work.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.180
Today a key the part

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.410
of that extended middle
age is the freedom to work.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:52.300
Many of us want or need to continue
earning a living and are searching

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:57.190
for ways to make a difference in a
society through the work that we do

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:01.100
and this requires reimagining
work and breaking

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.790
down both social institutional
barriers that stand in the way.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.140
The third freedom,
the freedom to learn.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.190
Our world is changing so
fast, new technologies,

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.590
new ways of communicating
with each other,

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.410
new ways of receiving end
processing information it's hard

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.520
for some of us to keep up.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.820
If we want to stay
engaged, involved,

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.780
and productive during this
extended middle age and beyond,

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.420
we need to keep learning.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.880
If we want to continue working
we need to keep learning in order

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.250
to keep our job skills up-to-date.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:40.380
We need to keep learning in order
to avoid isolation and we need

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.580
to keep learning for our
own personal fulfillment

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.800
and to simply enjoying life.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.450 position:56%
But let's face it, the opportunities
for us to keep learning seem

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:56.150
to diminish as we get older and in
many cases they're just not there.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:01.130
As we continue to disrupt aging we
hope to bring down those barriers

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:05.310
and to create new opportunities
to learn as we get older.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:11.240
And the fourth freedom, the freedom
to pursue happiness by discovering

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.040 position:56%
and fulfilling your purpose in life.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:22.530
We have the power to reimagine
our lives to change course

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:27.410
and discover new ways
of fulfillment.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:31.150
Civil Rights leader, A. Philip
Randolph keenly observed

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.230
that freedom is never given.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.800
It is one.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.870
Winning these four freedoms
begins with each of us.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:47.540
We can't afford to sit on the
sidelines and wait for someone else

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.960
to win these freedoms for us.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.080
We have to do this ourselves.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:05.380
It's time to tell our stories about
what we believe and what we can do.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:17.340
So I ask you in your conversations
with your family and your friends,

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:24.590
what beliefs will you start
to challenge in your own life?

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:31.750
In your life and in your work,
what solutions will you spark?

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.750
In everything you do, think

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:39.610 position:56%
about what new possibilities you can
create for yourself and for others

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:44.490
and what are you going to do
to continue disrupt aging?

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:49.600
Disrupt aging is our rallying cry
to create a new vision for living

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.990
and aging in the 21st century.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.780
Our new vision is about a world

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.580
which aging is not a
decline, it's about growth.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.840
It doesn't present only challenges
it also creates opportunities

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.370
and older people are not burdens
to society, they're contributors.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:11.030
When we disrupt aging and embrace
it as something to look forward

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.270
to instead of something to fear,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.590
we began to discover
the real possibilities

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:21.390 position:56%
for becoming the person we've always
wanted be and to build a society

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.100
where each of us are
valued for who we are

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.900
as a person not how old we are.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.410
I hope you enjoy the "Disrupt
Aging" book and I would love

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.150 position:56%
to the answer any of your questions.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.570
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.470
I'm a journalist.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:29.680
I tell my young journalism
friends that the 60s

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.270
so far has been my best decade as
far as journalism goes and halfway

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.320
through the next decade now it's,
this one's looking good too.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.250
But I'm wondering about
some legal help

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.580 position:56%
for certain areas of discrimination.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.650
For instance, I have applied a
couple years now for some grants

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:53.170 position:56%
that I really think I can
contribute to and the first question

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:57.280
on the grant application is
the date of birth and your age

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:02.990
and I just find that why would
you need to know that for a grant.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.140
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: So the question
was about age discrimination

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.480
and what avenues of
redress to have that?

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.190
I would say to you that, and
it's probably not any shock

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.790
that age discrimination
is alive and well,

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:20.700
we certainly see it particularly
in the workplace and so I know

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:26.650
that I will just speak for AARP in
saying that, we have a whole staff

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.940
of legal team who works on
age discrimination every day.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:37.650 position:56%
And really trying to address and see
the systemic barriers that created

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.750
around age discrimination,
so I would have suggest

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.210
that you either contact
your local AARP office

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.900
and I'm sure they would be
more than are willing to help.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.450
I will also add that
for the first time

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.660
in history we're seeing
5 generations

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.800
in the workplace at one time.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.960
If you're assuming that
interns are coming in at18

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.630
and people are working until
their you know 90s or 100s

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:07.000
and the whole spectrum of
what the workforce will look

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.680
like in the future is dramatically
changing and we also have to adjust

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.420
to that workplace and figure
out how do we bring the value

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.250
of all those generations together
and so it's going to be; you know,

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:25.590
I often talk about for most of
us we went to work at 1 place

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.060
or maybe 2 places and if we were
looking at somebody's resume

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.410
and had jumped around
to 5 or 6 year jobs,

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.280
we probably didn't call them
back in for a second interview.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.580 position:56%
Today, the norm is that if you are
staying somewhere over 3 or 4 years,

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.990
you're probably be
stagnant in the workplace

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:46.110
and that people are having 10
to 15 different places of work.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.930
The workplace of the
future is going to be

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.750
that not only people are working
10 to 15 different places,

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.140
but they're going to have
3 or 4 totally careers

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.370
and so this whole idea of the
freedom to learn is how we need

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:03.000
to start engaging so that
having that college degree

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.430 position:56%
or that master's degree isn't going
to be good enough for you to be able

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:11.500
to compete in the workplace
that is changing dramatically

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.900
with respected technology and some
of the way the world is changing.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.010
So important for us
to continue to learn

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.970
and keep pace with
those technologies.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.270
Other questions?

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.570
I can't really see anything.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.870
Yes. Yes please.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:29.160
&gt;&gt; My name is Naomi
and I am 59-and-a-half

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.400
and I did celebrate that.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.700
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: Great.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.430
&gt;&gt; My question is, thank you.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.150
My question is, okay so you're
saying all these people are aging

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.100
into the 100s and da-da-da-da,
and soon we'll be 150,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.720
so what are going to
do retire at 130?

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.680
I mean that sound like
all the much fun to me.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.470
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: I would say
to you that I've been throwing

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.840
out this idea that somehow we
need to move middle age from 50

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:05.590
to past 65, because we're
going to have an extra 30 years

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.600
to do something very meaningful
in our life or to continue to work

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.160
at a time period of when
social security and Medicare

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.960
and those programs
were put in place.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:20.930 position:56%
People were expecting to retire at
65 and life expectancy was 67 or 68.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.330
And you heard me say earlier

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:26.930
that the fastest growing age
group is people of the age of 85.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.390
But we can't just tack
on to the end of our life

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.300
and decide oh I have 10 extra
years what am I going to do?

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.330
We're going to have to rethink
for those particularly those

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:41.020
on the younger end, rethink how
you're going to plan financially.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.430
We don't want to outlive our income
and we certainly want to be able

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.280
to live comfortably in doing that.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.380
And so how do we start thinking
about our social support system

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.620
in this country, because
we're actually better off

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.060 position:56%
than most countries around the world
in terms of our support systems

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.030
around social security and Medicare
and those kinds of programs.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.310
But each of us are
going to have to think

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.710
through our own personal
health; how we're living,

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.340
whether we're exercising
and eating healthier,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.270
and think about how we need a plan
accordingly so that we don't get

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:20.440
that end of life and be in poor
health for some 10 or 15 years.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.020
That would be the worst
thing that could happen.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.980
We need to make sure there we're
many healthier and taking care

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.510
of ourselves and exercising
and doing all those things,

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:33.230 position:56%
so that that period of declined,
because we all will have that period

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:37.480
of decline, will be condensed
hopefully in that, you know 3 to,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.980
2 to 3 year period rather than
10 to 15 year caregiving phase.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.020
I think we have time
for one more question.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.320
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.620
Florence Navarro.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.920
I'm the executive director

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.790
of a nonprofit called
Empowered Women International.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.790
We train women in this region
to start their own business

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:01.440
and so my question to you is we
actually see quite a few women

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.500
who come to us to prepare for their
retirement and they want to build

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.400
on their passion, on their
skills to start a business

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.120
to complement their retirement.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.620
What do, what is your
view on entrepreneurship

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.350
and [inaudible] starting their
own business and what kind

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:21.220
of help should be provided
or could be provided?

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.520
Thank you.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.350
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: Thank you for
question and 2 important facts;

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:30.990
women are the fastest growing users
of technology and social media,

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.340
as well as, starting
their own businesses.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:39.180
So, this is a particular area for
everyone, but especially for women

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.340
as we think about those skills that
we've developed over the course

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.740
of these years and I know that
it's important and there's a lot

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.370
of online information as well

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.750
as through the small business
administration that talks

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.670
about the preparations, so
not just to have a great idea,

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.630
but also how do you have a
financial and business plan

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.330
around that business idea.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:04.090
Because more and more of us are
going to be independent workers

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:08.270
or self-employed contractors
servicing the private sector

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.690
and so it's important that
we get those skillsets

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.110
and that we're willing to take
that leap of faith to take

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:19.780
that great idea and turn into a
business, so thank you for the work

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.320
that guys are doing and
it's a growing field and all

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.760
of us need to be engaged in that.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.680
They're telling me 1 more question.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.980
Yes.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.680
&gt;&gt; This is a question of all the
time you've spoken I've not heard

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.850
the word senior and hopefully
that senior only refers

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.960
to something associated
with discount.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.170
But my real question you mentioned
about choices of places to be

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:48.220
and maybe you would talk a little
bit about aging and community?

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.080
&gt;&gt; Jo Ann Jenkins: And I would
say I rarely use the word senior

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.620 position:56%
because I think we ought to be
judging people about their abilities

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:02.770 position:56%
and that term senior seems to imply,
in my mind, that this is you're

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.760
in your last phase of
life ready to graduate.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.570
And so I know I personally
don't use that,

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.250
because it to me you can't
judge somebody by an age,

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.750
but about their abilities.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.560
So important that we
think about how we build

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.850
out what we call livable
communities.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.890
How do we get mayors
and county officials

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:27.150
to start building communities
that from day one allow people

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.750
to age in their own community?

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:33.280
Important factual information
that we've been seeing

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.580
over last couple years is that,
there is a closer relationship

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.760
between millennials and boomers

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.560
than any other age
segments in the country.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.930
They like to live in community.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:48.210
They want to work 5 to 10
minutes from their own home.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:52.240
They want the flexibility to
be in work and out of work.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.250
I see a little millennial sitting
here and she's shaking her head

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:59.090
to sort of do that, and
transportation is important.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:03.990
You've seen these whole
charity colony models of people

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:08.970
like companies of like
Lift and Uber.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.860
They, when they setup
these companies it was

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.550
to solve a millennial problem
of how do we around in a place

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.590
that we don't actually want to have
the burden of paying a car note and

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.790
yet we want the flexibility
to do that?

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:27.600
When ARB and B started, they had
no idea; I was talking to a woman

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.970 position:56%
who had started was one of the
cofounders of ARB and B and she said

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:38.270
to us, "We never anticipated that
the users of ARB and B were going

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.830
to be over the age of 50."

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.330
Same thing with Lift and Uber
that they tell us that some

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.330
of their best drivers
are over the age of 50.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.160
They show up for work on time.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.100
They don't get in accidents
contrary to what people say

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.990
about older workers,
and that it's important

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:58.620
that they have the
flexibility to bring that,

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.730
all that additional
income in society.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.040
I hope you; time is up.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.340
I thank you for coming.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.130
We're going to be signing books
in just a few minutes down at the

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.700
"Disrupt Aging" booth,
so thank you very much

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.010
and I appreciate your time today.
