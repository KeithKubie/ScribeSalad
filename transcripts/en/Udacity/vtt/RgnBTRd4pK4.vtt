It's really important to use analytics
with monetization because you really

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.560
want to understand your users.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.750
So as an app developer, knowing
more information about your users

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.100
will allow you to tailor it and
change things and tweak things so

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.460
that you can try to figure out, okay,
why did someone stop at this level?

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.330
Maybe it was too hard for them, or maybe
you have to offer an in app purchase, or

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.350
something like that.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.940
That allows them to really understand
how to get to the next piece of

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.650
monetization.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.320
Right?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.610
So the more data that you have
the more it helps you understand, okay

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.300
what do I have to do to tweak my app to
get to the next phase of your business.
