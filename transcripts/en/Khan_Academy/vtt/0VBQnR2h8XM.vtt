00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:02.033
Voiceover: In the last video we proved

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:04.435
the angle addition formula for sine.

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:05.920
You could imagine in this video

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.774
I would like to prove the angle addition for cosine,

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:10.301
or in particular, that the cosine

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:19.839
of X plus Y, of X plus Y, is equal to the cosine of X.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:25.510
Cosine of X, cosine of Y, cosine of Y minus,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.980
so if we have a plus here we're going to have a minus here,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.567
minus sine of X, sine of X, sine of Y.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.906
I'm going to use a very similar technique

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:37.771
to the way I proved it for sine.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.044
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:41.847
either now or at any time that you get the inspiration

00:00:41.847 --> 00:00:45.205
to see if you can do this proof on your own.

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:47.573
Just like we thought about it for sine,

00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:49.306
what is the cosine of X plus Y

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:51.300
^in this diagram right over here?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.841
^Well, X plus Y is this angle right over here.

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:59.712
^If we look at the right triangle ADF, cosine of X plus Y.

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:04.907
^Well, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse segment AF

00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:08.044
^over the hypotenuse, or since the hypotenuse

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:12.443
^is just one, AF divided by one is just going to be AF.

00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:15.438
^Cosine of X plus Y is just the length of segment.

00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:18.510
^It's just the length of segment AF.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.439
^That right over there is equivalent to this right over here.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.638
Let me actually write that down; copy and paste.

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:32.366
^Length of segment AF is cosine of X plus Y.

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.706
^Let's think about how we can get that.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:36.700
^The way I'm going to think about it is,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.773
^given the other right triangles we have in this diagram,

00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:42.836
^if we could figure out that or AF.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:43.907
Let me write it this way.

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:47.511
This thing, which is the same thing as AF, is equal to.

00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:50.708
Let me write it this way, it's equal to length of segment AB.

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:54.846
It's equal to the length of segment AB,

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:58.510
^which is this entire segment right over here,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.243
^minus the length of segment FB.

00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:05.843
^Minus this segment right over here.

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.778
Minus the length of segment FB.

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:11.911
Just from the way our angle addition formula

00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.567
looks for cosine, you might guess

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.437
what's going to be AB and what's going to be FB.

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:20.977
If we can prove that AB is equal to this.

00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:26.373
If we can prove that FB is equal to this, then we're done.

00:02:26.373 --> 00:02:28.245
Because we know that cosine of X plus Y,

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:33.977
^which is AF, is equal to AB minus FB.

00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:38.641
If we can prove this, that it's equal to that minus that.

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.505
Let's think about what these things actually are.

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:43.441
What is AB?

00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:46.645
^Let's look at right triangle ACB.

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:48.309
We know from the previous video that

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:53.111
since triangle ADC has a hypotenuse of one,

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.175
this length is one, that AC is cosine of X.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:03:00.244
^What is AB, well, think about it.

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:05.040
^AB is adjacent to the angle that has measure Y.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.643
We could say that the cosine, let me do it down here.

00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:12.846
We could say, since I've already looked at all of that.

00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:16.241
^We could say that the cosine of Y,

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.706
^cosine of Y is equal to it's adjacent side.

00:03:18.706 --> 00:03:20.645
^The length of it's adjacent side.

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:25.113
^That is segment AB over the hypotenuse

00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:28.500
^over cosine of X, cosine of X.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.906
^Or multiply both sides by cosine of X.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:36.442
^We get that segment AB is equal to cosine of X,

00:03:36.442 --> 00:03:42.701
^cosine of X times cosine of Y, cosine of Y,

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.305
^which is exactly what we set out to prove.

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:49.034
We've just proven that AB is indeed

00:03:49.034 --> 00:03:51.112
the length of segment AB is indeed

00:03:51.112 --> 00:03:53.512
equal to cosine X, cosine Y.

00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:57.774
^This whole thing is equal to cosine X, cosine Y.

00:03:57.774 --> 00:03:59.580
^Now we just have to prove that segment

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.574
FB is equal to sine X, sine Y.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:06.444
^This looks like a bit of a strange segment right over here.

00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:08.579
It's not part of any at least right triangle

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.374
where we know that I've drawn

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:12.170
where we know one of the angles.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.166
We can see from this diagram ECBF is a rectangle.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:18.036
We use that fact in the proof for

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:19.707
the angle addition formula for sine.

00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:22.644
We'll also use it now because that tells us

00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:29.302
that FB is the same as EC, is EC.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:32.976
What is EC going to be equal to?

00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:36.512
Well, we have this angle Y right over here.

00:04:36.512 --> 00:04:42.303
What is, let's see, this side is opposite the angle Y.

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:44.179
We might want to involve sine.

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:48.695
We know that sine of Y, sine of Y,

00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:50.176
I'm looking right over here, is equal to

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:53.571
the length of the opposite side, which is the length of EC,

00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:57.701
which is the length of EC over the hypotenuse,

00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.143
which is sine of X, sine of X.

00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:02.578
We figured that out from the last video.

00:05:02.578 --> 00:05:06.229
If this is X, opposite over hypotenuse is sine of X.

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.579
Well, the opposite is just one,

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:09.315
so the opposite is equal to sine of X.

00:05:09.407 --> 00:05:13.046
Over here multiply both sides by sine of X,

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:14.577
and we get what we were looking for.

00:05:14.577 --> 00:05:20.512
EC is equal to sine of X, sine of X,

00:05:20.512 --> 00:05:25.513
times sine of Y, times sine of Y.

00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:27.575
Once again EC was the exact same thing.

00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:31.040
Has the same length as segment FB.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.397
We have just shown that segment FB

00:05:33.397 --> 00:05:35.434
is equal to sine of X times sine of Y.

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:38.636
This is equal to that right over there.

00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:41.042
Once again, cosine of X plus Y,

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:42.505
which is equal to segment AF,

00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:47.169
is equal to the length of segment AB

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.577
minus the length of segment FB,

00:05:50.577 --> 00:05:52.507
which is equal to, we've proven the length

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:54.705
of segment AB is cosine X, cosine Y,

00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:56.907
minus the length of segment FB,

00:05:56.907 --> 00:06:00.608
which is sine of X, sine of Y, and we are done.
