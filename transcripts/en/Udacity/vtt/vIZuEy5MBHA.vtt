00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.940
So ribosomes are the molecular machinery that carry

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.650
up the process of translation. Then that means

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.690
they are going to the mRNA sequence, read it codon by codon and spit out an

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.600
amino acid for each codon. Okay, using only

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.920
the one letter abbreviations for the amino acids.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.380
I want you to tell me what would be the sequence for this mRNA. Here it is,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.750
ACAGAUGCC, so forth and so on. And there are

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.130
six possible answers. And what I need you to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.170
do, is try to use the genetic code over

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.300
here to try to figure out. What would the sequence

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.600
of amino acids be, if you were the ribosome

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.860
and you had to translate this sequence. I want

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.190
you to think about this question. It's not an

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.570
easy one. It's not meant to be a trick question,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.160
but you do need to think about it. I want you to try to get

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.520
it right the first go round, but it's okay if you don't. You can look

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.600
at the genetic code again, try to see what you did wrong. If you get

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.440
stuck, go to the forums. See if anyone

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.170
else has some helpful advice. And try again.
