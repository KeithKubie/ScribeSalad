healthcare that that's going I think to
result in and that's a good thing that's

result in and that's a good thing that's
 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.049
result in and that's a good thing that's
going to result in the need for us to be

able to make transparent to them the
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.020
able to make transparent to them the
concrete outcomes of what it is we're

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030
concrete outcomes of what it is we're
 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.910
concrete outcomes of what it is we're
we're we're providing so for example if

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920
we're we're providing so for example if
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.720
we're we're providing so for example if

they're going to be able to go online
and find out well who does the most

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940

and what they should be able to find out
is what's the approximate range of costs

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
is what's the approximate range of costs
