00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.620
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.570
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.160
and the Michelin Guide in Bangkok.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.507
I'm familiar, I mean I love to
eat, I research restaurants.

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:14.110
I keep up with restaurants in Bangkok.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.650
But there's this one
restaurant that received

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.110
a Michelin star that I
had never even heard of.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.130
It's actually not right
in central Bangkok,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.963
it's on the outskirts.

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:25.890
It's actually in the next
province called Samut Sahkon.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.693
They received a Michelin one star.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.870
I'm very curious about the restaurant.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.810
It looks like a very
local seafood restaurant,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.490
it's called Ruean Panya.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.070
Yesterday my wife, Ying, called them up.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.730
We made a reservation, we are on our way.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.560
I'm very excited and I'm
gonna share all the food

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.440
that we eat with you in this video.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.493
Alright, let's go.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.396
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.170
From Central Bangkok it's
a 47 kilometer drive,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.140
exactly one hour, two minutes.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.228
Doesn't look like traffic is
too bad and we are on our way.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.895
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:19.180
We made it, that was
exactly an hour drive.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.130
Great to be here in Samut Sakhon.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.410
You kind of come into the neighborhood.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.280
You kind of think you're gonna
just end up in the middle

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.150
of nowhere, but all of
a sudden a restaurant,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.830
the restaurant which is kind of spread out

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.160
between a number of
different houses I think,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.070
just appears in this
neighborhood community

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.883
sort of at the dead end.

00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:41.550
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.460
I guess this is sort of the reception.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.030
It almost looks like a
hotel, but really classic.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.670
We checked in here, well we inquired here.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.500
But then she's leading us
over into this building,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.530
into this house.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.603
You get this relaxing
sensation when you arrive here.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.560
When I was reading in the
Michelin guide it says

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.133
this is a real hidden gem.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.220
It's beautiful in this
room, it's like a museum.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.830
The wooden furniture, the
paintings and drawings,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.770
the sculptures.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.860
There's antiques all over
and we almost kind of have

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.340
this little private dining room.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.330
We have our one table that's here.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.650
That's where we're gonna sit.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.873
Really quiet, really peaceful back here.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:32.168
(people chatting in foreign language)

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.920
We're gonna order, there's a couple dishes

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.440
that they mentioned in the Michelin Guide

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.680
which I'm definitely gonna order,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.180
especially the (foreign
words) and the fried shrimp

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.470
which look incredible.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.970
Then we're also looking
through the menu trying to get

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.900
some other dishes, some
of their also specialties

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.223
that they have.

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:52.140
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.692
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.540
A few of the dishes have
arrived, not all the dishes yet.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.020
But she just brought the shrimp.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.313
These have to be some of
the most giganormous shrimp

00:03:16.313 --> 00:03:17.680
I have ever seen.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.280
Seawater, saltwater shrimp,
they are unbelievably.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.550
Do you remember the name of this dish?

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.557
It's like (foreign words) salt,
salt fried (foreign words).

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.680
A salt-fried shrimp.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.570
This is really just like
bumped up my mood served

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.300
with starfruit which is also unique.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.920
Kind of like an oily sauce,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.190
but it's so unbelievable fragrant.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.900
Look and they're even
curled up on this plate.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.423
This thing is absolutely massive.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.960
They have it curled on a
plate because they're so big

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.290
they wouldn't even fit on a normal plate.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.290
But if you stretch her out,
it literally is the length,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.580
maybe even longer than my face.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.870
This thing is massive and
this is not a freshwater.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.010
This is an ocean, like a tiger prawn.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.270
You can see they cut out
the vein so that just leaves

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.763
the meat just like it's just sprouting.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.830
Look at that, so they sliced the head.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.184
You can see that head oil
has just kind of sprouted out

00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:21.763
as it was fried.

00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:25.493
Oh look at that, it jut flakes off.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.134
Wow, oh wow, okay we will lick everything.

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:34.453
But look at that juicy head butter oil.

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:38.245
Okay I'm just gonna bite, I think.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:41.912
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.080
oh wow, oh that is unbelievable.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.080
Immediately you taste the
salt rather than fish sauce.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.000
It's sprinkled in salt, I believe.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.180
Sink your teeth into the
flesh and it's so sweet,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.083
it's so firm, it's so fleshy.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.990
Oh that is insane, and
when I took that bite

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.823
look at my plate.

00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:15.100
I just splattered, that's like a painting,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.113
an abstract, beautiful painting.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.507
I've gotta taste that with
some of the starfruit.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.530
Juicy and sweet, just slightly sour.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.613
That's just all good.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.668
A juiciness with the shrimp in your mouth.

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:39.585
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.165
Oh that is amazing,
another dish has arrived.

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:51.082
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:58.498
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.300
You know like normally you're
gonna finish a whole shrimp

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.260
in a couple bites.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.760
This one you can actually
set aside for later.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.910
And since all the rest of the food came,

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.540
gotta try the rest of the food.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.120
It's just, yeah it's beautiful.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.920
It's not like overly decorative,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.880
but just incredible ingredients so far.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.195
Okay I'll try this fish next.

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:22.695
I believe in Thai she
called it a (foreign words).

00:06:24.124 --> 00:06:26.820
So I think it is pomfret,
a type of pomfret

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.470
or a pompano.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.060
But I've never heard of that name.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.230
Normally it's called (foreign
words) which is, I don't know.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.060
Anyway I think it's a type of pomfret.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.980
I'm gonna grab some of
the, oh it's so crispy.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.330
That's so much garlic, too.

00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:44.050
Put this onto the plate.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.150
Oh look at that, the steam.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.700
I'll stick this onto
the splatter painting,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.053
the shrimp splatter painting.

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:53.720
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:06:55.612 --> 00:07:00.060
Oh it's so hot, but the
texture of that fish

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.852
is incredible, really,
really crispy because it's

00:07:03.852 --> 00:07:04.710
deep-fried around the edges.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.480
But then on the inside it's
just like so soft and silky

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.910
and falling apart in your
mouth, but not mushy.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.310
Oh the freshness, that garlic.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.020
I can't remember if this was
the sauce served with it.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.110
But I think it was.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.910
There's some shallots and chilies in here,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.460
and maybe some lime juice.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.723
I'm gonna put this on.

00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:25.514
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.470
There's just like an
elevated (foreign words),

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.400
rich fish sauce, chilies
in it, shallot, and I think

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.190
just a little bit of lime
juice so it has that sourness.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.050
This is one of my favorite types of fish.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.680
It is like the texture
of it, the taste of it,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.970
the meatiness of it and
how they've prepared it.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.183
Nice, awesome.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.543
I can only fit one scoop of
rice on my plate right now

00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:59.913
due to the hugeness of that shrimp.

00:08:00.823 --> 00:08:04.650
The next dish is another
stunner on a beautiful plate

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.483
just piled high.

00:08:05.483 --> 00:08:07.120
It's a fish that I've never called before.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.660
In Thai it's called (foreign words).

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.476
It is she said the dish
preparation is called

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:17.430
(foreign words) which is covered in chili.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.570
But usually it's kind of sweet.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.100
She said this one is a
(foreign words) version.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.330
A traditional version
and you can see the fish

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.230
are kind of small.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.063
There's chilies in there.

00:08:25.063 --> 00:08:28.580
You can see kind of almost
like an oily chili glaze

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.413
just covering it.

00:08:29.413 --> 00:08:30.690
I think it's fried as well.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.070
You can see this is a whole
tail, so it's a small fish.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.560
Ying says that there
might be bones in here,

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.750
oh I just lost the chili again.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.183
We'll have to kind of navigate.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.960
No, you can eat the whole thing,
the whole thing is crispy.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.890
Oh, it's like crunchy and
soft at the same time.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.167
And it's just kind of
saturated in that chili sauce,

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:54.167
which is slightly sweet
and then kind of fried

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.670
like ooziness of chili.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.070
And you taste that like half
the lime leaves are in there

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.990
nicely as well.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.410
I think from the guts of
that fish you get a slight

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.553
bitterness which actually
tastes quite good.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:11.110
Somehow it's like juicy and
puffy, yet fried and crinkly

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.843
all at the same time.

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:14.670
Okay, this one is the (foreign words).

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.040
It's a snail in a type of curry here.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.760
And you can smell,
immediately she sat this out

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.930
I could smell the (foreign
words), which is that climbing

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.180
wattle shoots on top, which
has a distinct aroma to it.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.380
I think that's more coconut cream on top.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.440
Oh yeah, you can see those
little, those are the little

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.740
snails in there.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.843
I'll get a little bit of
everything on this bite.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.010
You can taste the immediate
richness of the coconut milk

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.490
and coconut cream.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.490
Then it's not really spicy,
it's quite a mild curry.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.690
Well, you taste a little bit of chili

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.100
as you keep on chewing.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.720
But you've got the flavor
of the (foreign words)

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.140
with the coconut cream, with
the little (foreign words),

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.183
the little snail shells.

00:10:02.183 --> 00:10:04.973
They're kind of chewy a
little bit like squid.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.210
Next up for the (foreign
words) which is this is

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.950
a chili dip made with shell-less crab,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.820
just the crab nuggets.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.730
This is like solid crab, a
little bowl of solid crab.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.180
You can see the chilies folded in,.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.419
Then I'll grab a cucumber
which is a good neutral

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:24.980
vegetable, a neutral vessel
for it to get the full

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.813
flavor of it.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.873
And generously top it.

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:32.364
Oh look at that.

00:10:32.364 --> 00:10:36.326
Just solid, solid strings of crab.

00:10:36.326 --> 00:10:39.993
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:10:44.002 --> 00:10:45.670
Oh that is stunning.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.670
Mm, it's like it's a very
mellow citrus-y sourness.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.710
You taste the (foreign words)
but also you taste salt

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.040
because it's not such
a pronounced fishiness.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.070
And then just the silky strings of crab

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.210
and chilies in there.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.630
One of the best veggies and
dip you could possibly have.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.793
I believe this is (foreign
words), which is white turmeric.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.033
Yeah, that's (foreign words),
that's white turmeric.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.590
Oh, that's just like pure
and vibrant in all the right

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.423
kinds of ways.

00:11:21.423 --> 00:11:22.880
One more main dish that we've gotta try.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.003
That thing is heavy, you've
gotta use both hands.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.030
This is by far the most
gigantic bowl of (foreign words)

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.863
that I've ever had.

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:38.510
You can eat it with rice, you
can eat it with vegetables.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.980
But it's kind of a dip,
kind of a main dish.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.620
It's made with thick coconut
cream and then in this case

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.460
with crab, an entire
crab chopped up in there.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.640
It is just thick and rich.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.080
You see the vibrancy of
the orange crab in there.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.470
You see the chilies.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.080
That is impressive, I have
never seen, look at the claw.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.300
That's the claw, I didn't
even know. (laughing)

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.960
Okay, I'll grab some cabbage.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.053
Just kind of dip that sauce.

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:11.465
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:14.465
Mm, mm that is so rich and so thick.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.480
It's sweet, partly from the coconut cream

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.840
and then partly from palm sugar.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.160
It's always kind of on the sweeter side.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.560
You can taste the onion,
shallot-y flavor of it.

00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:31.060
Oh that is hot.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.553
If you reach down it's like
because it's such a thick

00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:36.870
gravy-like sauce it just retains the heat.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.100
It's almost rich like melted cheese.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.503
Let me just navigate
this crab a little bit.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.105
You're going to need to
slurp as you eat this

00:12:50.105 --> 00:12:53.970
probably because it's so
juicy and just wrapped up

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.070
with that coconut cream.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.020
Then because it's so hot and
you can also eat it with rice

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.853
which is very common.

00:12:58.853 --> 00:13:00.150
There are some floating
chilies in it as well.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.840
And you also feel the
shallots which are just

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.140
kind of dissolved into
the (foreign words).

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.240
There's so many seafood juices on my plate

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.499
that my plate is getting kind of messy

00:13:07.499 --> 00:13:10.700
from all the seafood
juices, but that's okay.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.763
Okay, eat that with the rice now.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.960
You know, overall (foreign
words) is typically

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.160
a little bit sweet for me.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.730
I like it especially when it's paired

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.720
with the other dishes that are not sweet.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.470
But that coconut, rich coconut
cream is just unbelievable.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.030
I think I sampled all, we've
got another couple dishes.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.612
We've got just a plain soup
and some other chicken,

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:35.790
stir-fry chicken dishes.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.700
But these are the main seafood dishes

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.270
these are the main dishes that I really

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.253
wanted to try.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.440
I have to say that just
from tasting a couple bites

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.060
of every dish I'm very impressed.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.300
The food, the quality of
the food, the giant-ness

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.860
of the seafood, the preparation,
and even the decoration

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.693
and display.

00:13:54.693 --> 00:13:56.855
Just how everything is
on a huge plate but not

00:13:56.855 --> 00:14:00.210
overly fancy, I'm loving it.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.378
That fish is really a
highlight actually for me.

00:14:03.378 --> 00:14:07.045
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:14:15.304 --> 00:14:17.310
That fish is just unbelievably good.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.800
He's just been waiting here
hanging out waiting for me.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.860
I will pull off the head for this bite.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.930
I've taken like four bites
and it's still this size.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.480
It's still the size of my face.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.120
I love how the taste is
simple and only focusing

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.840
on the shrimp itself so you
can really taste the vibrancy

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.300
of the shrimp.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.100
That's like magnified shrimp flavor.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.100
Who would have known the
next big combination,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.733
shrimp and starfruit.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.690
And that's even after licking my fingers.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.610
The orangeness from the shrimp.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.750
This is one of the dishes
that my wife ordered.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.960
I didn't even know she ordered, but it's

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.310
the (foreign words).

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.090
Pork fried with fish sauce
and I love how there's just

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.100
whole floating around
chilies as well as slices

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.933
of raw garlic.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.620
Mm, and shallots, that's
just like super good.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.672
You taste the fish how
salty it is in there.

00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:22.523
The raw garlic is awesome.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.123
Check this out.

00:15:30.123 --> 00:15:32.380
(crunching)

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.980
Somehow they fry it so
perfectly so it's so crispy,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.073
yet not oily.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.030
Another cool thing, because
this restaurant is spread out

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.788
between different houses
there's actually a phone

00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:47.170
in this room.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.283
The waitress said to just
give her a call when we need

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:51.000
some service.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.833
So Ying has called her.

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:54.080
I think Ying is moving onto dessert.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.220
Oh man, I've really got to wipe my mouth.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.890
Sorry about the orange mouth lipstick.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.390
Good thing we have baby wipes.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.583
Is that good?

00:16:03.438 --> 00:16:04.271
Oh no, still got some.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.393
Okay I think we're good.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.240
For dessert they have, this
is a very popular dessert.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.520
But this is actually from,
is it from Samut Sakhon?

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.260
It's (foreign words), which
is famous from Samut Sakhon.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.700
It's a traditional Thai dessert.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.314
They look kind of like
noodles, but the greenness

00:16:24.314 --> 00:16:28.320
is to symbolize that
they're pandan flavored.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.463
There's coconut milk in
here, there's ice in here.

00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:37.018
Mm, mm, boy this is really good.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.794
You crunch on the ice, the
noodles are like jelly.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:46.294
They almost have a vanilla
flavor from the pandan.

00:16:48.205 --> 00:16:50.589
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:50.589 --> 00:16:54.063
2,650, how much was the fish?

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.110
The fish was 3,000 baht.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.950
Look at how long our bill is.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.880
Almost as long as the shrimp,
but yeah not a cheap meal.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.450
But total price came to 9,765 baht.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.670
There were four of us, so
actually five of us eating.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.080
But Micah fell asleep
partway through the meal

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.650
and he didn't eat too much.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.640
But I showed most of the dishes.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.530
We also got a couple of
extra dishes but they weren't

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.293
the expensive ones that
I didn't show on camera.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.990
Yeah, it's not a cheap meal,
but definitely the quality

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.444
and I mean this is a restaurant
you'd want to come to

00:17:28.444 --> 00:17:32.503
for a really special celebratory occasion.

00:17:34.312 --> 00:17:37.979
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.577
Ah, okay so a couple of things.

00:17:47.577 --> 00:17:50.160
Oh number one, we got some takeaway.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.300
We ordered a lot of food and
the food was portion sizes

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.690
are huge.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.260
Not to mention the
ingredients are just massive

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.145
what they use.

00:17:58.145 --> 00:18:01.330
I think the amount of
food we ordered we could

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.720
have at least had two maybe
even three or four people

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.070
could have eaten that entire meal.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.410
Which would have made the
price a lot cheaper per person.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.140
I thought the food was
absolutely world class.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.420
The seafood, that is some of
the greatest, grandest seafood.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.890
The fish which I actually just
looked up is a black pomfret

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.960
which is from deeper water.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.450
It's bigger, that fish was unbelievable.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.610
I would say that you should
really order the seafood.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.240
Seafood is what they specialize in.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.530
The seafood was by far the best thing.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.900
The other dishes, the
chicken and the pork,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.670
they were okay for me but
not something special.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:35.792
It was really about the seafood.

00:18:35.792 --> 00:18:39.111
That was just an incredible
Thai seafood meal experience

00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:42.697
at Ruean Panyah, which is a
one star Michelin restaurant.

00:18:42.697 --> 00:18:46.890
And yeah, I think it
exceeded my expectations.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.440
Did it exceed your expectations, Ying?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.273
- [Ying] Yes.

00:18:49.273 --> 00:18:51.430
- So we both agree that
was a stunning meal.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.760
