with different spin directions they also

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190
with different spin directions they also
 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.460
with different spin directions they also
have a different resistances now that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470
have a different resistances now that
 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.930
have a different resistances now that
might sound very technical to non

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940
might sound very technical to non
 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.210

physicists but in fact people all around

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220
physicists but in fact people all around
 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.680
physicists but in fact people all around
the world be very familiar with how this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690
the world be very familiar with how this
 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.899
the world be very familiar with how this
is being applied could you say how this

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909
is being applied could you say how this
 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.030
is being applied could you say how this
is being used I think the important

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040
is being used I think the important
 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.459
is being used I think the important
thing is that it's an effect which we

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469
thing is that it's an effect which we
 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.980
thing is that it's an effect which we
all know about because this is the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990
all know about because this is the
 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.899
all know about because this is the
effect which is used in the reading

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909
effect which is used in the reading
 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.810
effect which is used in the reading
heads in the whole disk drives and which

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820
heads in the whole disk drives and which
 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.999
heads in the whole disk drives and which
has enabled the possibility to

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009
has enabled the possibility to
 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.060
has enabled the possibility to
miniaturize magnetic data recording

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070
miniaturize magnetic data recording
 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.069
miniaturize magnetic data recording
which we can all see in in the sciences

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079
which we can all see in in the sciences
 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.289
which we can all see in in the sciences
for the laptops we have today compared

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299
for the laptops we have today compared
 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.940
for the laptops we have today compared
to to say the computers in the in the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950
to to say the computers in the in the
 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.340
to to say the computers in the in the
beginning of the 60s also so this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350
beginning of the 60s also so this
 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.690
beginning of the 60s also so this
technology allows us to store

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700
technology allows us to store
 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.039
technology allows us to store
information along on things like

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049
information along on things like
 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.020
information along on things like
computer disks could you sort of give an

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030
computer disks could you sort of give an
 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.209
computer disks could you sort of give an
idea of how this is improve the way we

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219
idea of how this is improve the way we
 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.639
idea of how this is improve the way we
can store information or computers well

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649
can store information or computers well
 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.800
can store information or computers well
I'm sorry already decided if you've been

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810
I'm sorry already decided if you've been
 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.010
I'm sorry already decided if you've been
able to miniaturize the disk but they've

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020
able to miniaturize the disk but they've
 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.709
able to miniaturize the disk but they've
also been able to develop reading heads

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719
also been able to develop reading heads
 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.469
also been able to develop reading heads
which can detect much smaller magnetic

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479
which can detect much smaller magnetic
 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.870
which can detect much smaller magnetic
changes which in itself means that we

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880
changes which in itself means that we
 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.359
changes which in itself means that we
can make things smaller and smaller so

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369
can make things smaller and smaller so
 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.510
can make things smaller and smaller so
there are actually two very important

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520
there are actually two very important
 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.180
there are actually two very important
effects is phenomenal self and the fact

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
effects is phenomenal self and the fact
 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.010
effects is phenomenal self and the fact
that the further development of the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020
that the further development of the
 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.070
that the further development of the
phenomena has made it possible to make

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080
phenomena has made it possible to make
 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.680
phenomena has made it possible to make
the miniaturization go further

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690
the miniaturization go further
 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.600
the miniaturization go further
and in terms of miniaturization exactly

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610
and in terms of miniaturization exactly
 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.790
and in terms of miniaturization exactly
how much information is now allowed to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800
how much information is now allowed to
 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.350
how much information is now allowed to
be it stored on discs as a result of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360
be it stored on discs as a result of
 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.500
be it stored on discs as a result of
this technology well I I should should

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
this technology well I I should should
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.600
this technology well I I should should
remember the DD nice gross we actually

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
remember the DD nice gross we actually
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.020
remember the DD nice gross we actually
saw today but I think think that it's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030
saw today but I think think that it's
 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.120
saw today but I think think that it's
sort of a hundred or thousand falls

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
sort of a hundred or thousand falls
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.450
sort of a hundred or thousand falls
compared to say ten years ago when when

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460
compared to say ten years ago when when
 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.750
compared to say ten years ago when when
this this technology was first utilized

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760
this this technology was first utilized
 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.270
this this technology was first utilized
it was discovered that by the end of the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
it was discovered that by the end of the
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.990
it was discovered that by the end of the
80s but I think the first the first real

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000
80s but I think the first the first real
 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.860
80s but I think the first the first real
applications came 1997 or thereabout and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870
applications came 1997 or thereabout and
 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.810
applications came 1997 or thereabout and
so what were the key discoveries from

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820
so what were the key discoveries from
 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.040
so what were the key discoveries from
the new laureates me what were their

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050
the new laureates me what were their
 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.990
the new laureates me what were their
Eureka moments in terms of creating or

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000
Eureka moments in terms of creating or
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.820
Eureka moments in terms of creating or
discovering this technology well what

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830
discovering this technology well what
 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.250
discovering this technology well what
they realized was that by making this

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260
they realized was that by making this
 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.120
they realized was that by making this
layer three layer device with two

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130
layer three layer device with two
 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.400
layer three layer device with two
magnetic layers separated with a non

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
magnetic layers separated with a non
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.860
magnetic layers separated with a non
magnetic layer they could make use of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870
magnetic layer they could make use of
 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.310
magnetic layer they could make use of
the fact that we conducted the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320
the fact that we conducted the
 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.850
the fact that we conducted the
resistance due to the to spin directions

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860
resistance due to the to spin directions
 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.470
resistance due to the to spin directions
I talked about in the beginning are

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480
I talked about in the beginning are
 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.570
I talked about in the beginning are
quite different and by in this

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580
quite different and by in this
 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.729
quite different and by in this
arrangement and could make make actually

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739
arrangement and could make make actually
 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.420
arrangement and could make make actually
control the ddd total resistance with

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430
control the ddd total resistance with
 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.270
control the ddd total resistance with
three layer structure and so as I said

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280
three layer structure and so as I said
 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.490
three layer structure and so as I said
well I should also say that they were

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500
well I should also say that they were
 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.690
well I should also say that they were
also very clear on the phenomena as such

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700
also very clear on the phenomena as such
 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.880
also very clear on the phenomena as such
they really understood what they had

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890
they really understood what they had
 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.180
they really understood what they had
discovered and because similar effects

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190
discovered and because similar effects
 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.150
discovered and because similar effects
had been seen before by but people

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160
had been seen before by but people
 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.860
had been seen before by but people
didn't realize what they were looking at

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870
didn't realize what they were looking at
 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.540
didn't realize what they were looking at
at that time and worthy with these

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550
at that time and worthy with these
 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.830
at that time and worthy with these
single discoveries or what these are

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840
single discoveries or what these are
 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.320
single discoveries or what these are
serious discoveries every years I think

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330
serious discoveries every years I think
 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.630
serious discoveries every years I think
that you can actually say that these are

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640
that you can actually say that these are
 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.150
that you can actually say that these are
a single discoveries made independently

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160
a single discoveries made independently
 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.750
a single discoveries made independently
of the 22 allora teas and so it was a

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760
of the 22 allora teas and so it was a
 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.820
of the 22 allora teas and so it was a
real discovering and so what would the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830
real discovering and so what would the
 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.110
real discovering and so what would the
individual discoveries that they made

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120
individual discoveries that they made
 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.670
individual discoveries that they made
about that overlapping with

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680
about that overlapping with
 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.320
about that overlapping with
commonalities actually they were

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330
commonalities actually they were
 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.140
commonalities actually they were
probably panko site was the same

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150
probably panko site was the same
 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.970
probably panko site was the same
discovery made at the same time because

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980
discovery made at the same time because
 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.750
discovery made at the same time because
the two publications which very ward is

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760
the two publications which very ward is
 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.530
the two publications which very ward is
Otis I came almost at the same time and

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540
Otis I came almost at the same time and
 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.250
Otis I came almost at the same time and
they were totally independent and what

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260
they were totally independent and what
 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.130
they were totally independent and what
this Lao research do what is what did

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140
this Lao research do what is what did
 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.480
this Lao research do what is what did
their discoveries allow researchers to

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490
their discoveries allow researchers to
 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.250
their discoveries allow researchers to
do Oh Dave okay what they

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260
do Oh Dave okay what they
 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.930
do Oh Dave okay what they
along now actually the development of a

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940
along now actually the development of a
 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.150
along now actually the development of a
completely new field the field which is

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160
completely new field the field which is
 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.020
completely new field the field which is
called spintronics where you combine the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030
called spintronics where you combine the
 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.790
called spintronics where you combine the
said short properties and the magnetic

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800
said short properties and the magnetic
 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.680
said short properties and the magnetic
properties of electrons to make a

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
properties of electrons to make a
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.770
properties of electrons to make a
completely new type of devices which

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780
completely new type of devices which
 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.290
completely new type of devices which
will let Drive Amy notarized ation even

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300
will let Drive Amy notarized ation even
 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.330
will let Drive Amy notarized ation even
further I think so what does the future

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340
further I think so what does the future
 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.850
further I think so what does the future
hold for this field I think it quite a

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860
hold for this field I think it quite a
 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.460
hold for this field I think it quite a
lot it will be as a saint new type of

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470
lot it will be as a saint new type of
 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.770
lot it will be as a saint new type of
over devices based on what we call

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780
over devices based on what we call
 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.650
over devices based on what we call
spintronics it will be new types of a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660
spintronics it will be new types of a
 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.290
spintronics it will be new types of a
magnetic memories based on on this

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300
magnetic memories based on on this
 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.780
magnetic memories based on on this
discovery think you call them for a

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790
discovery think you call them for a
 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.420
discovery think you call them for a
nonvolatile magnetic random access

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
nonvolatile magnetic random access
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.610
nonvolatile magnetic random access
memories which can be made with very

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620
memories which can be made with very
 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.600
memories which can be made with very
very high storage capacity and I also

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610
very high storage capacity and I also
 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.730
very high storage capacity and I also
think that what they've already started

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740
think that what they've already started
 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.610
think that what they've already started
to see your sensors magnetic sensors

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620
to see your sensors magnetic sensors
 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.010
to see your sensors magnetic sensors
which will be utilized in in in course

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020
which will be utilized in in in course
 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.580
which will be utilized in in in course
to measure position angle speed and so

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590
to measure position angle speed and so
 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.740
to measure position angle speed and so
on on different port in the car so the

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750
on on different port in the car so the
 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.390
on on different port in the car so the
feds say this is one of the first major

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400
feds say this is one of the first major
 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.750
feds say this is one of the first major
applications of nanotechnology the the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760
applications of nanotechnology the the
 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.990
applications of nanotechnology the the
major the first major application is of

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000
major the first major application is of
 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.380
major the first major application is of
course the magnetic reading heads which

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390
course the magnetic reading heads which
 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.650
course the magnetic reading heads which
came already 1997 and as I already said

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660
came already 1997 and as I already said
 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.230
came already 1997 and as I already said
that the discover have now created new

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240
that the discover have now created new
 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.330
that the discover have now created new
and you completely new field with with

could have gone to a maximum of three I

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220
could have gone to a maximum of three I
 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.860
could have gone to a maximum of three I
mean what was it the clear-cut decision

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870
mean what was it the clear-cut decision
 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.910
mean what was it the clear-cut decision
to give it to these two particular

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920
to give it to these two particular
 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.420
to give it to these two particular
researchers yes it was because since we

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430
researchers yes it was because since we
 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.350
researchers yes it was because since we
have already phenomena giant

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360
have already phenomena giant
 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.520
have already phenomena giant
magnetoresistance is clear that these

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530
magnetoresistance is clear that these
 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.680
magnetoresistance is clear that these
two persons already two persons behind

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690
two persons already two persons behind
 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.080
two persons already two persons behind
that discovery and what would the

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090
that discovery and what would the
 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.460
that discovery and what would the
reaction of the laureus just to end this

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470
reaction of the laureus just to end this
 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.000
reaction of the laureus just to end this
conversation well I is I understand they

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010
conversation well I is I understand they
 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.950
conversation well I is I understand they
were both very pleased of course and

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960
were both very pleased of course and
 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.530
were both very pleased of course and
really touched about getting the price

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540
really touched about getting the price
 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.020
really touched about getting the price
on the other hand I think you both of

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030
on the other hand I think you both of
 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.490
on the other hand I think you both of
them have got many other international

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500
them have got many other international
 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.730
them have got many other international
prices so I perhaps somewhere in the

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740
prices so I perhaps somewhere in the
 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.530
prices so I perhaps somewhere in the
mind stay they were thinking that

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540
mind stay they were thinking that
 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.840
mind stay they were thinking that
perhaps sometime we will also get into

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850
perhaps sometime we will also get into
 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.989
perhaps sometime we will also get into
Bell price so what's the total surprise

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:39.999
 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.640
it's difficult to say but I think that

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650
it's difficult to say but I think that
 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.129
it's difficult to say but I think that
they were quite touched and as far as

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139
they were quite touched and as far as
 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.869
they were quite touched and as far as
you can tell from listening to what they

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:46.879
you can tell from listening to what they
 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.659
you can tell from listening to what they
they said in the phone now wonderful

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669
they said in the phone now wonderful
 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.279
they said in the phone now wonderful
thank you very much for that veselin
