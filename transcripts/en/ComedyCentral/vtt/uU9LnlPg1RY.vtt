Well I guess they don't have

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.670
the big Hollywood marketing
budgets at Comedy Central

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:07.440
so I got me shilling out here
on the street corner.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.709 line:83%
I don't think you can do it.
I know you know what a bad idea

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.277
is. You're in a lot of movies
that are bad ideas.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.114
But this is a worse idea. This
is like Die Hard 4 Live Free-
whatever.

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:17.183
That was a bad idea.
This is a worse idea.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:18.417
This is a career low.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.687
You're the biggest movie star
in the world they should be-

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.589
Well, you're almost the biggest-

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.992
At one point you were almost the
biggest movie star in the world

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.627
and they should be treating you
better than this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.329
Comedy Central trying
to save a few bucks.
This is bullshit.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.198
Oh you're right.
You're right.

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.033
Does anybody watch
Comedy Central anymore?

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.301
Honestly, you could
really do better.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.435
So, I'll see you there.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.538
Yeah, I'm gonna be there man!
I'm your Roastmaster!

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.407
OK. Gotta go. Bye!

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.277
(car honking)

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.314
Aye! Roastmaster!

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:49.382
Fuck you!
