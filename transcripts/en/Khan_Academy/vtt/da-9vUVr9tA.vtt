00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.860
Female: Into the globe, let's now go
to California where Sal Khan is using

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.447
YouTube in a way that might
just blow up the classroom.

00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:09.946
Sal: We're trying to educate the world.

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:11.879
Female: Tutoring millions online.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.675
Sal: That's what's cool about an equation.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:15.535
You can always check to see
if you got the right answer.

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:18.939
Right now we're getting
2 to 300,000 views a day.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.876
We claim to be the largest
university in the world.

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:26.437
Female: More than 2400
lessons and counting on
everything from basic addition.

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:28.230
Sal: 8 + 1 = 9

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.179
Female: To quadratic formulas.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.604
Sal: Negative 1 times 2 is -2.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:33.101
Female: Photosynthesis.

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:34.803
Sal: It needs carbon dioxide.

00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:36.324
Female: To U.S. history.

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:37.874
Sal: We've had enough
of you, Great Britain.

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:40.929
We are now declaring ourselves
as an independent country.

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:47.617
Female: Any subject just search and click,
all viewed more than 76 million times.

00:00:47.617 --> 00:00:52.675
Sal: They can pause, repeat,
rewind without feeling like
they're wasting my time,

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:56.544
without feeling embarrassed
because maybe they weren't
paying attention the first time

00:00:56.544 --> 00:01:00.764
or maybe they forgot something
from last year or last week and now
it's in a destressed environment.

00:01:00.764 --> 00:01:03.524
Female: It's a long way
from where it all began.

00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:07.076
Sal: My friend said, "Hey why don't you
put some of your lectures on YouTube?"

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:11.665
I said, "No, that's for dogs
on skateboards. That's not
for serious mathematics."

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.835
Female: And yet that was the
light bulb moment for you.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.202
Sal: I gave it a shot.

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:17.142
Female: It's now called Khan Academy.

00:01:17.142 --> 00:01:18.811
Bill Gates: What Sal
Khan has done is amazing.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.761
Female: He's been called Bill Gates'
favorite teacher because Gates' own sons

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.685
were logging on to Khan's lessons.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:28.937
Bill Gates: I see Sal Khan as a
pioneer. It's the start of a revolution.

00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:32.614
Female: The Gates Foundation
gave him 1.5 million dollars.

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:39.277
Google tossed in 2 million. Enough
to hire a small staff and translate
his lessons into ten languages.

00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:43.269
Sal: If it was just a constant,
we would be able to use the
[unintelligible] but we can't do that.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.165
Female: Sal is the only instructor
and he knows what he's talking about.

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:52.136
The MIT and Harvard grad got three
degrees simultaneously in math,

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:55.134
electrical engineering
and computer science.

00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:57.545
But Sal has a dirty little secret.

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:01.605
Sal Khan, one of the best teachers
in the world, hated school?

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:07.334
It didn't register with me. I would
go to class. Half the time I was
bored. Half the time I was lost.

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.748
I had trouble paying
attention for 60 minutes.

00:02:09.748 --> 00:02:13.558
Female: Which may be why Sal
is an education revolutionary.

00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:18.628
Sal: Everything I have listed is true
of both 401Ks and traditional IRAs.

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:22.151
Female: You could make a lot
of money off of your brain, but
you're giving it away for free.

00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:25.680
Sal: Hopefully on my death
bed, and hopefully that's
many decades in the future.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.475
Female: A hundred years from now.

00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:29.353
Sal: A hundred years from
now I'll be able to say,

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:33.072
"There's a billion kids who learned from
those lectures, or five million kids."

00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:34.778
Female: We have a little surprise for you.

00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:38.284
We connected Sal with just
one of his millions of fans.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:41.358
Jasper is a medical
student in the Netherlands.

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:42.623
Male: Oh, yeah.

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:45.532
Female: Who has spent a lot of time
with you. You just don't know it.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:49.457
Male: I watched some
videos and they were great.

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:53.074
They really helped to
understand what I had to do.

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:56.894
Sal: That's awesome, see? I could
sleep and help teach people the
Kreb's cycle. It's exciting.

00:02:56.894 --> 00:03:01.537
One person can produce something on
their own without any extra resources

00:03:01.537 --> 00:03:05.941
almost as a hobby and you
can reach millions of people.

00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:11.820
Female: It's a place of big and
small. Whether you're storm chasing,
[unintelligible] revolution,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.820
or just trying to learn
biology, it's a world connected.
