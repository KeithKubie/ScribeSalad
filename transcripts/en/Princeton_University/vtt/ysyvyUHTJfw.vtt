CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: 
It is indeed a privilege, and also a genuine

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.020
joy, to address you, for all of you graduate
today having accomplished something that is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.400
genuinely important and worth celebrating.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.960
You have completed a demanding course of study.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.010
It will transform your life in many ways.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.310
It will expand the range of vocations you
can pursue, increase your knowledge of the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.200
world, deepen your capacity to appreciate
societies and cultures, and provide a foundation

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.280
for lifelong learning.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.720
As I look out at our extraordinary class of
undergraduate, masters, and doctoral degree

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.040
recipients, I take pride in your excellence
and your diversity, and I am excited about

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.880
the contributions you will make in the years
ahead.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.430
The world needs more college degrees, not
fewer.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.800
We need more celebrations like the one we
hold today, with more proud families and happy

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.390
graduates ready to go out and make a positive
difference in the world.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.580
All of us on this platform are thrilled to
be a part of your celebration.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.530
We applaud your achievements.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.070
We send our best wishes as you begin the adventures
that lie ahead, and we look forward to welcoming

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.120
you back to this campus on future visits.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.410
To all of our graduates, 
congratulations and best wishes!
