CHRIS YERGA: Good
morning, San Francisco.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.560
Hello.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.760
We applauded them out, man.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.150
Thanks so much, ladies
and gentleman here

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.800
in the audience, and
everyone on YouTube globally,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.020
for joining us here today.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.590
I am Chris Yerga.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.070
And it's my pleasure to do
the kick-off here today.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.320
So let's talk about
kick-offs, though, right?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.780
Generally speaking,
kick-offs don't really

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.550
have a whole lot of content.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.220
It's more about
introducing the players

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.470
and flipping coins
and maybe every once

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.430
in awhile, a jet flies over
or something like that.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.900
But there isn't really a whole
lot of football going on.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.840
And today is kind of similar.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.380
So what I want you guys to do is
think about the next 10 minutes

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.660
you're going to have with me as
an amuse-bouche for your mind

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.220
to try to get yourself
ready for the jam

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.030
packed day that we
have coming up for you,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.620
because it is crazy.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.980
We have 14 separate talks
coming up after this one

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.680
covering all aspects
of Android gaming

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.960
with some awesome
speakers across Google.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.700
And I am giving you
my personal guarantee.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.680
There is not a drum
solo in the bunch.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.670
We are playing all
the hits today.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.820
So use those bathroom
breaks carefully.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.700
Now, what I am going
to use my time to do

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.350
is talk to you a little
bit about some context here

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.380
for the history of
multiplayer gaming.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.520
And I think there's
really no better place

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.522
to start than the 12th century.

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:32.730
Now, when we think about
the 12th century, some of us

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.320
think about secret
societies and Freemasons

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.740
and all that kind of stuff.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.240
But then, just as now,
they loved to game.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.184
Certainly, twitch games
were very popular there.

00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:44.350
And they played it hardcore.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.255
No respawns at all.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.046
But what I would really
want to talk to you

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.750
about right now
is a particularly

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.300
famous and important
turn-based multiplayer match

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.810
that happened between
two monarchs at the time.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.200
So we have here on the left
Henry I of Britain versus Louis

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.690
VI-- that's 10 King
Louis before the ones

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.120
that I know anything
about-- of France.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.110
And this isn't a
metaphor or anything.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.370
These guys actually did play
a turn-based multiplayer game

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.070
across a very long distance.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.930
So we want to talk a little bit
about what kind of architecture

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.480
they used.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.350
So clearly, in
order to play a game

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590
over that kind of
distance, you need

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.180
some sort of network transport.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.200
And I know these
guys are loaded.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.870
So they had the best
technology of the day.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.660
It was a little
bit high latency.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.560
And from time to time,
it could be lossy.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.896
But no problem-- they
had a network transport.

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:43.270
And you can deal with those
things at the protocol level,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.450
and so they had a
protocol as well.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.380
Now, we can kind of think of
it as the moral equivalent

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.430
of a wire protocol.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.880
And what it was, was
essentially messages

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.260
that they would deliver
to each other on ships

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.200
with coded instructions on
how to mutate the game states

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.990
and keep a game session going.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.922
Now, of course, this immediately
introduces a third problem

00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:08.630
that they had to solve,
which is somehow,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.890
you need to keep a
view of the game state

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.244
both in England and France
and keep it synchronized.

00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:16.910
And so they had a
solution to that, too,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.720
which was to keep chess
boards at each side.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.710
And then you take
the pieces and then

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.040
send a responding move
when the time came.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.760
So obviously, what
we're talking about here

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.400
is correspondence chess.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.650
And even though it happened
nearly 1,000 years ago,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.110
the way they solved
this problem,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.950
in sort of broad strokes,
looked very much like the way

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.730
that we build systems today
to solve the same problems.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.570
But the thing that I find
far more interesting about it

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.650
is that the game itself and
the players who played it also

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.350
responded to ecosystem
dynamics in a way that's

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.470
very similar to how
people respond today.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.120
So for example, there
was a huge increase

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.352
in correspondence
chess after 1840,

00:04:02.352 --> 00:04:05.000
when flat rate data
plans arrived in Europe.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.380
So you might ask yourself what
does a flat rate data plan

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.320
look like in the 1800s?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.590
And it looks like this thing.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.510
So this is called the
penny black stamp.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.240
It's the first stamp that
allowed flat rate postage

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.010
delivery to a fairly ubiquitous
service area in a way

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.260
that we think of stamps today.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.130
And it fundamentally
revolutionized

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.730
sending messages at a distance.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.580
And so prior to this,
it was complicated.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.340
The receiver would
pay, and it was

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.130
based on how far things
traveled and stuff like that.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.490
So when the market provided a
more economical way to do this,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.580
the gamers rushed in
and filled the vacuum.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.090
Similarly, the
game itself adapted

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.120
to technology
drivers of the time.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.380
So when the telegraph
came around,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.260
games of correspondence
chess immediately

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.530
started using this more low
latency transport mechanism.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.430
And similarly, when
radio came along,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.200
that shared the
latency characteristics

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.610
but also meant that
no wires were needed.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.480
Soon after, games of chess
where one or more of the parties

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.250
were on ships started being
recorded in the literature.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.375
And the final thing,
also, is that people

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:20.500
love to tweak stuff, right?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.291
So there was a lot of
protocol optimization

00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.920
that happened as well,
from the 1600s, where

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.280
you have a whole sentence
to describe a chess move,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.540
down to a few hundred years ago,
it got actually pretty compact,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.660
and there was actually
even variants of this

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.450
for being transmitted
over telegraph or radio

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.230
or other sorts of transport.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.810
So the thing that I want
you to take away from this

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.650
is one really
important fact, which

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.800
is that the desire to
game is ubiquitous.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.120
The only thing that really
changes the size of the market

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.661
is how available
it is to people.

00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:57.160
So 1,000 years ago,
you needed to be

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.370
a monarch with a flotilla of
boats to play a game of chess

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.720
with someone at a distance.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.950
But as the bar to that
reduces and reduces,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.250
the gamers always rush
in, just like water

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.030
finding the lowest
spot in a room.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.260
It's almost like
physics or math.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.210
The desire to game is
completely ubiquitous.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.840
And these same dynamics
have played out

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.950
across our own lifetimes.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.010
Actually-- OK.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.990
Well, this was during
my lifetime, at least.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.200
I'm not sure if everyone here
has the same shared experience.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:36.330
But in the '80s, there was this
great age of arcade cabinets

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.020
and arcades as a location-based
entertainment solution.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.550
So people could have
these awesome immersive,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.890
for the time,
gaming experiences.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.020
The problem was there's only
one cabinet for lots of people,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.010
and you had to drive down there.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.570
But it was a big step up.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.990
And then of course, when
the home console and PC

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.430
era came on, it turned that
whole thing on its head.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.180
So now, you're only
sharing the game

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.190
console between a couple
people in the family.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.640
And it's right
there in your house

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.930
where you could use
it not all the time,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.780
but certainly every day.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.840
And of course, that all
has changed to the point

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.730
now, where in many
regions of the world,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.070
for all practical purposes, it's
one to one devices to gamers.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.340
Everybody has it with
them all the time.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.370
And so it's then expanded
the market exponentially.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.390
And I think we should
really take a moment

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.550
to think about how unique
this point of time is

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.460
and how rich this
opportunity is for us.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.420
And what it's really done is
it's created this world where

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.640
everyone is a gamer, no
matter where you live.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.829
So if you're riding
the subway in Korea,

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:50.120
chances are you're playing
a game on your mobile phone.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.780
But if not, you
might be looking up

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.190
at the ads for mobile
games on the monitors that

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.540
are in the subway.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.880
Or if you're in Seattle, you
might see a giant Angry Bird

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.520
hanging from the Space Needle.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.740
And this is a particularly
salient example for me,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.970
because a few years ago, when
my daughter was maybe five

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.140
and my mom was in her 80s,
they had a conversation

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.490
about Angry Birds.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.230
They were both completely
aware of Angry Birds.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.430
They played the game.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.960
And I think it really speaks
to the ubiquity of gaming

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.600
and how it's really
touching everyone

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.810
but is also showing
up everywhere.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.929
In Japan, we actually
have vending machines

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.490
where you can go get games
for your Android device.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.070
There's a sushi
restaurant I eat at.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.700
And if you look at
the top row there,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.730
you'll see that every
single seat has a monitor.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.240
That's because while you're
sitting there for 30 minutes,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.270
it would be a shame if
you didn't get a chance

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.922
to play a game on the
monitor against the computer.

00:08:50.922 --> 00:08:52.380
So every once in
a while, it beeps,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.630
and you play some
Rochambeau or whatever.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.110
Gaming is everywhere.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.280
It's completely
pervasive in our culture.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.030
And so what that
has created is a ton

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.020
of momentum for
the market, which

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.890
creates a ton of opportunity
for all of us here today.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.640
So think about it.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.750
We have over a billion
activated Android devices,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.050
and three in four Android
users are playing games

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.030
on those devices.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.740
These are huge numbers.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.250
And we also have had huge
momentum for Google Play Games

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.800
Services.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.880
We launched it just
around six months ago,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.480
and we have 75 million users
actively using Play Games

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.000
Services now and incredible
momentum going forward.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.920
So with that backdrop, I
want to take you real quickly

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.800
through some of the stuff you're
going to be hearing today.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.430
This is a pictorial
version of it.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.040
Basically, we think of it
in a couple steps here.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.540
You've got to build
your app, right?

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.420
You're going to
build with Play Games

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.030
Services and Google's cloud.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.910
You then want to connect
up to players and to people

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.680
who want to
experience your game.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.000
So you can connect up with
millions of users in the Play

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.220
store or create
online communities

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.670
on YouTube or with
Google Play Games app.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.020
Also, you want to experiment.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.500
And so we got some great talks
from Google Analytics talking

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.670
about some of the ways that you
can get data and let data drive

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.630
your decisions about
how to make your gaming

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.600
experiences great,
which also helps you

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.310
with monetization, which
is our next topic here.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.920
Clearly, we're all
in it for the art,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.890
but it's kind of
nice if you don't

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.598
have to have a day
job in addition to it.

00:10:30.598 --> 00:10:33.850
So we provide an ever
expanding set of ways

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:39.270
to monetize your apps, obviously
through ad supported models

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.630
via AdMob and in
ever increasing ways

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.780
to allow users to pay in
the Google Play Store.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.960
And of course, we'll
be talking a little bit

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.800
about stuff that
allows you to explore

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.960
some new frontiers
and new platforms,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.360
like the one you see in front of
you, and maybe some fun stuff,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.830
some blobby Jell-O that
sort of bounces around

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.110
and some other new
capabilities that we're

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.680
going to unleash on you guys.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.720
So with that context of
this massive opportunity

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.660
and a lot of really
sharp tools we're

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.840
going to give you to help
capitalize on that opportunity,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.590
I thank you for your time today.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.130
And it's my pleasure
to hand it over

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.950
to-- you're familiar
with this term of,

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.680
oh, that's a tough
act to follow.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.680
These guys are a
tough act to precede.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.490
When we rehearsed
yesterday, I realized

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.470
I had to up my
game a little bit.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.690
So I'm going to hand
over to the dynamic duo.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.690
Thank you so much for
your time this morning,

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.780
and enjoy the day.
