00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.602
Now...

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.504
we are going to take an
uncomfortably close look

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.039
at a befuddling online trend,

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:09.475
in a segment we call
<i> @midnight</i> Deep Dive.

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:11.444
(cheering and applause)

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:16.149
The Internet, it has something
for everyone...

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.817
to masturbate to.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.118
MARTINDALE:
That's true.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.586
Nowhere is this more true
than on Amazon,

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.655
where Amazonian authors
produce digital stories,

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.857
where humans get it on
with dinos, gryphons,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.627
and all manner of beastie,
both historical and mythical.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.828
BELLI:
Aw.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.164
But the master of the genre

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.800
is a mysterious figure
named Chuck Tingle,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.437
who, since 2014, has written
over 80 micro-novels

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.807
with titles like,
Space Raptor Butt Invasion,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.677
or Creamed in the Butt
by My Handsome Living Corn.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.245
(laughter)

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:49.449
-I'm listening.
-Yes, me, too.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:53.419
And my favorite, Happy Birthday,
Frankenstein, Now Pound My Butt.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.388
(laughter and applause)

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:02.462
That's not Frankenstein.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.963
That just looks like '70's Hulk.

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.598
I don't know what that is.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.300
Comedians, what is a line
that you might read

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.368
in this amazing erotic
horror tale?

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.570
Willam.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.205
(bleep) me so hard Gene Wilder
could feel it.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.439
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.274
(laughter)

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.776
Uh, Bridget.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.478
Fire, bad!

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.213
Paying attention to balls, good!

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.182
(laughter)

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.618
HARDWICK (laughing):
Points.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.086
Just... Justin.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.588
It's that show, it's that show.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.156
HARDWICK:
It's that show, that's fine.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.025
Uh, Frankenstein violently
ripped off his own head

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:35.161
so he could easily
suck his own (bleep).

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.996
HARDWICK:
Yes, points.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.665
Well, that's what you do if you
have a removable head.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.667
I mean! I mean!

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.137
And now the reclusive Mr. Tingle
is incredibly prolific,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.938
-churning out super...
-BELLI: Dad!

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.241
-There he is.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.909
There he is.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.677
(whooping, applause)

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.212
But who is Chuck Tingle?

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:56.349
No one knows and it's driving me
(bleep)ing bananas.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.552
I have combed his books
for clues, for research.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.454
-I've had...
-(laughter)

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.923
I've had my entire staff here
scour the internet.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:06.159
I even went to the pet store
and shoved a gecko up my butt,

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.861
hoping he'd appear, but the only
thing that happened...

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:10.296
But the only thing that happened

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.898
was that I could not
stop ejaculating,

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.600
and I saved 15% or more
on my car insurance.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.569
(laughter and applause)

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.372
But...

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.642
Here's what we do know: His name
is most likely a pseudonym.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.511
His author photo
is some kind of stock photo

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.747
-from a stock photo site.
-(comedians exclaiming)

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.183
So comedians, what's a title
for a PowerPoint presentation

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.984
that might use
these stock photos?

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:33.786
-Bridget.
-Oh, that looks like life

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.521
after your wife takes
the kids away.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.423
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:38.624
Uh, Willam.

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:40.560
Tae Kwon No Thank You.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.161
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.429
Justin.

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:45.064
Dying alone and how to do it.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:47.567
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.001
So...

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:50.836
The eagle-eyed Tingle detective

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.206
will find some clues
on his YouTube channel.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.840
So let's take a still
from the trailer for his book,

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:57.510
Buttception, of course,
that book we love, which...

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:58.844
MARTINDALE:
You mean there's more?

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:00.146
There's a lot more, Justin.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.448
There is so much more.

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:05.885
So Buttception features a house
with the address 703.

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.387
I'm sure you guys remember, 703,
so here's where it gets weird.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.755
Listen, listen.
This is serious.

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:11.057
MARTINDALE: Here's where
it gets weird, okay.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.391
-Here's where it gets weird.
-The house, the house.

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:13.960
-HARDWICK: This is the weird
part. -I'm listening.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.828
Chuck has trolled men's rights
activist Vox Day,

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.263
who once appeared
on the podcast,

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.066
The Tom Woods Show,
episode 703, all right?

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.802
In his videos, Tingle also wears
a bag on his head,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:25.404
just like the performance art
piece by Shia LaBeouf,

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:28.941
who is often lusted after on
Twitter by @MaryJane703,

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.376
who lives where?

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.279
In Alexandria, Virginia,
area code 7-0 (bleep)ing 3.

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:34.880
-MARTINDALE: Oh!
-There is more.

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:36.048
I know, I know.

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:37.350
Scoop your brains back
into your heads,

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.852
because you're gonna need them
to process this (bleep).

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:41.254
If that doesn't blow your minds,

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.290
of the 703 people watching this
show, then how about this?

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.727
In the 50th edition of the
<i>Catholic University Law Review,</i>

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.563
we found a case that has to do
with sodomy on page 703.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:51.964
The name of that case?

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:53.666
<i> Bowers versus Hardwick.</i>

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.102
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Wow!

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.938
-I'm in this, too.
-(laughter) -Uh-uh. -Uh-uh.

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.274
First of all, I was innocent.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.276
Second of all,

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.311
the only explanation
that I have, uh,

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:06.846
is to be the subject
of his next book.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.715
So comedians, what should be
the name of<i> my</i> Tingle story?

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:10.983
Willam.

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.852
<i> Jingled Out by Singled Out,
 Part Two.</i>

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.553
HARDWICK:
Yes, points.

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.722
-(cheering, applause)
-Very good. Bridget.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:19.358
Uh,<i> Tingle Me Elmo,
 Chris Hardwick Gets Soft.</i>

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.527
HARDWICK:
Yes, points.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.663
(laughter)

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.399
(applause, cheering)

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:33.039
(as Elmo): Somebody must've
gotten in cold water.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.540
Uh, Justin.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:36.409
<i> Action Figures
 I've Sat On, On Purpose.</i>

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.311
HARDWICK:
All right, points. Points.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.747
Uh, so you can see I'm very
passionate about this, so,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.816
-I would like to talk
to Chuck, himself. -What?

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.351
Chuck...

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:46.819
Chuck, if you're out there,

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:50.089
I admire your prolific nature,
uh, and insane creativity.

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:52.725
And I would like nothing more
than to be the subject

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:55.828
of one of your erotic yarns
that you spin on the Amazon.

00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:58.431
In fact, I'm gonna give you
a (bleep) cover image

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.700
to start the process.
Can we set the mood?

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.735
-Disco ball, all right?
-(whooping)

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:04.570
I need some...
I need some dino-hunks.

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:07.273
Can I get some dino-hunks
in here, please?

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.241
I'd like some dino-hunks.

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.677

and tell him Chris Hardwick--
be very specific--

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:48.280
Chris Hardwick deserves
to have his butt pounded

by some weird creature,
