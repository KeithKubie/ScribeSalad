very very helpful to have that kind of

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
very very helpful to have that kind of
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.090
very very helpful to have that kind of
knowledge and I think in fact essential

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100
knowledge and I think in fact essential

and the notion is when you look at

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800
and the notion is when you look at
 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.560
and the notion is when you look at
cities they are enormously complex

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570
cities they are enormously complex

Ecology's you know can we begin to use

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
Ecology's you know can we begin to use
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.260

just putting a few slides on to to to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450
just putting a few slides on to to to
 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.240
just putting a few slides on to to to
actually to be faster about my

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
actually to be faster about my
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.360
actually to be faster about my
presentation so again these particular

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370
presentation so again these particular
 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.810
presentation so again these particular
features that cities have how can we

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820
features that cities have how can we
 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.020
features that cities have how can we
really maximize their utilities right

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030
really maximize their utilities right
 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.390
really maximize their utilities right
now it seems to me that we are not and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
now it seems to me that we are not and
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.190
now it seems to me that we are not and
it could have to do with a kind of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
it could have to do with a kind of
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.050
it could have to do with a kind of
economic system that we have a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060
economic system that we have a
 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.090
economic system that we have a
market-driven logic a very an

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100
market-driven logic a very an
 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.000
market-driven logic a very an
increasingly narrow market driven logic

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010
increasingly narrow market driven logic
 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.760
increasingly narrow market driven logic
that doesn't help us now if you think

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770
that doesn't help us now if you think
 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.090
that doesn't help us now if you think
about just a few properties if this is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100
about just a few properties if this is
 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.650
about just a few properties if this is
perfect by the way a few properties of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
perfect by the way a few properties of
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.490
perfect by the way a few properties of
cities you know they're there they are a

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500
cities you know they're there they are a
 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.250
cities you know they're there they are a
kind of social ecological system that

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
kind of social ecological system that
 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.470
kind of social ecological system that
has an expanding range of articulations

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480
has an expanding range of articulations
 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.560
has an expanding range of articulations
with nature's Ecology's the problem is

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570
with nature's Ecology's the problem is
 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.230
with nature's Ecology's the problem is
that they're negative question for me

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240
that they're negative question for me
 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.360
that they're negative question for me
and really this is a question other

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
and really this is a question other
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.600
and really this is a question other
systemic properties in this event that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610
systemic properties in this event that
 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.090
systemic properties in this event that
now has negative valence that we could

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100
now has negative valence that we could
 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.550
now has negative valence that we could
give positive valence so I'm not talking

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560
give positive valence so I'm not talking
 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.470
give positive valence so I'm not talking
about destroying everything I'm also

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480
about destroying everything I'm also
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.720
about destroying everything I'm also
talking about how do we work with what

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730
talking about how do we work with what
 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.180
talking about how do we work with what
we have there is a system there there is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
we have there is a system there there is
 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.310
we have there is a system there there is
systematicity if you want how can we

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320
systematicity if you want how can we
 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.680
systematicity if you want how can we
change its valence now the final point

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690
change its valence now the final point
 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.960
change its valence now the final point
here you know how can we begin to use

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970
here you know how can we begin to use
 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.330
here you know how can we begin to use
and begin very modest language very

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340
and begin very modest language very
 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.510
and begin very modest language very
modest hope if you want these

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520
modest hope if you want these
 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.670
modest hope if you want these
articulations to produce positive

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680
articulations to produce positive
 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.160
articulations to produce positive
outcomes now another feature of course

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170
outcomes now another feature of course
 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.680
outcomes now another feature of course
of cities is that they mobilize new

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690
of cities is that they mobilize new
 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.470
of cities is that they mobilize new
kinds of social ecological systems and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480
kinds of social ecological systems and
 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.860
kinds of social ecological systems and
here are a few descriptions for me again

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
here are a few descriptions for me again
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.280
here are a few descriptions for me again
the question here is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290
the question here is
 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.160
the question here is
if they're capable if these complex

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170
if they're capable if these complex
 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.370
if they're capable if these complex

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:06.110
daughter and I are using in our research
 

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.360
daughter and I are using in our research
on this is this notion of this is my

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.370
on this is this notion of this is my
 

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.610
on this is this notion of this is my
language and people sometimes think I

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:12.620
language and people sometimes think I
 

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.350
language and people sometimes think I
say delegating back to nature and they

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360
say delegating back to nature and they
 

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.670
say delegating back to nature and they
think that because I have a foreign

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680
think that because I have a foreign
 

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.710
think that because I have a foreign
accent that I may be misusing English

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720
accent that I may be misusing English
 

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.210
accent that I may be misusing English
but I must say I really mean it that way

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.220
but I must say I really mean it that way
 

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.340
but I must say I really mean it that way
delegating back to nature mind you I use

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:24.350
delegating back to nature mind you I use
 

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.949
delegating back to nature mind you I use
that language also i don't use mimicking

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959
that language also i don't use mimicking
 

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:29.290
that language also i don't use mimicking
the biosphere because i do think that

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:29.300
the biosphere because i do think that
 

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.900
the biosphere because i do think that
cities are not biological systems i

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:31.910
cities are not biological systems i
 

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.360
cities are not biological systems i
think there are a different type system

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:34.370
think there are a different type system
 

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.030
think there are a different type system
but it has multiple interactions with

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040
but it has multiple interactions with
 

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.699
but it has multiple interactions with
the biosphere so one little example that

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:39.709
the biosphere so one little example that
 

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:42.129
the biosphere so one little example that
i love but there are many we have we are

00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:42.139
i love but there are many we have we are
 

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:44.439
i love but there are many we have we are
creating a long list of all of these

00:09:44.439 --> 00:09:44.449
creating a long list of all of these
 

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:47.290
creating a long list of all of these
it's this bacteria and it's both in the

it's this bacteria and it's both in the
 

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.939
it's this bacteria and it's both in the
laboratory but it also already has

calcium that seals the building and has
a double effect it stops emissions

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959
a double effect it stops emissions
 

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:04.300
a double effect it stops emissions

happens with all the bad gases inside
 

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:07.809
happens with all the bad gases inside
these concrete buildings but that's

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:07.819
these concrete buildings but that's
 

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:09.189

another question that's like a little

00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:09.199
another question that's like a little

this is just one example there are many

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:25.250
this is just one example there are many
 

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.480
this is just one example there are many
examples where we could actually use the

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.490
examples where we could actually use the
 

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.670
examples where we could actually use the
capabilities of the biosphere but that

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680
capabilities of the biosphere but that
 

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.559
capabilities of the biosphere but that
would take a lot of knowledge and that

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:32.569
would take a lot of knowledge and that
 

00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:35.710
would take a lot of knowledge and that
is why it is not only urban we can't

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720
is why it is not only urban we can't
 

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.990
is why it is not only urban we can't
leave this stuff only to urbanus and

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000
leave this stuff only to urbanus and
 

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.550
leave this stuff only to urbanus and
architects so to speak you know we

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560
architects so to speak you know we
 

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.309
architects so to speak you know we
really do need to bring other other

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:42.319
really do need to bring other other
 

00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:45.350
really do need to bring other other
forms of knowledge into the picture now

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360
forms of knowledge into the picture now
 

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.650
forms of knowledge into the picture now
wanted to come back to this notion that

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:47.660
wanted to come back to this notion that
 

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.380
wanted to come back to this notion that
that cities are not biological systems I

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:51.390
that cities are not biological systems I
 

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.650
that cities are not biological systems I
have been involved sort of inner inner

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660
have been involved sort of inner inner
 

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.410
have been involved sort of inner inner
in a week way but that involved with the

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420
in a week way but that involved with the
 

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.630
in a week way but that involved with the
Santa Fe Institute you know which is

00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640
Santa Fe Institute you know which is
 

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.340
Santa Fe Institute you know which is
full of physicists and I always say full

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.350
full of physicists and I always say full
 

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.290
full of physicists and I always say full
of physicists who don't do physics they

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300
of physicists who don't do physics they
 

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.389
of physicists who don't do physics they
do everything else but not physics which

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399
do everything else but not physics which
 

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.800
do everything else but not physics which
makes them actually absolutely

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:06.810
makes them actually absolutely
 

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.139
makes them actually absolutely
fascinating now one of the projects of

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:09.149
fascinating now one of the projects of
 

00:11:09.149 --> 00:11:12.500
fascinating now one of the projects of
the director George Jeff West who is a

physicist is is precisely to use I find
 

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.699
physicist is is precisely to use I find
that for physicists biology is often a

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:22.709
that for physicists biology is often a
 

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:25.910
that for physicists biology is often a
bridge into some other object of study

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920
bridge into some other object of study
 

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.180

so I I have had two encounters with him

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.190
so I I have had two encounters with him
 

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.819
so I I have had two encounters with him
one when we spoke both you know to his

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:31.829
one when we spoke both you know to his
 

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:34.930
one when we spoke both you know to his
board of whatever just seasoned and so

he was showing at that point this was

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620
he was showing at that point this was
 

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.160
he was showing at that point this was
maybe two years ago how in biology of

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.170
maybe two years ago how in biology of
 

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.060
maybe two years ago how in biology of
course you have this incredible

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.070
course you have this incredible
 

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.610
course you have this incredible
multiscale of repetition you know the

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620
multiscale of repetition you know the
 

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.699
multiscale of repetition you know the
orders of magnitude are very they repeat

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:46.709
orders of magnitude are very they repeat
 

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:48.949

so from the amoeba up to whatever the

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959
so from the amoeba up to whatever the
 

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:52.460
so from the amoeba up to whatever the
blue whale the biggest organism and then

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:52.470
blue whale the biggest organism and then
 

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.160
blue whale the biggest organism and then
he was showing how his cities it also

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.170
he was showing how his cities it also
 

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.410
he was showing how his cities it also
goes now this was based on an enormous

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.420
goes now this was based on an enormous
 

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.449
goes now this was based on an enormous
amount of data gathering every vast

00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459
amount of data gathering every vast
 

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:01.759
amount of data gathering every vast
amounts of some of the data that we as

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:01.769
amounts of some of the data that we as
 

00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:03.980
amounts of some of the data that we as
urbanist are rather suspicious of but

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:03.990
urbanist are rather suspicious of but
 

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.600
urbanist are rather suspicious of but
you know there's a lot of data on cities

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:05.610
you know there's a lot of data on cities
 

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.790
you know there's a lot of data on cities
frankly so he show so there is the thing

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800
frankly so he show so there is the thing
 

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.079
frankly so he show so there is the thing
and then he's a bit there's something

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:09.089
and then he's a bit there's something
 

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:10.550
and then he's a bit there's something
that happens when the city's become very

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560
that happens when the city's become very
 

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.130
that happens when the city's become very
large but he hadn't gotten there yet and

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140
large but he hadn't gotten there yet and
 

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.110
large but he hadn't gotten there yet and
so I just saw him now at another meeting

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120
so I just saw him now at another meeting
 

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.150
so I just saw him now at another meeting
where we were together and he had gotten

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160
where we were together and he had gotten
 

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.970
where we were together and he had gotten
there and then what he shows with

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980
there and then what he shows with
 

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.610
there and then what he shows with
mathematical formulas etc is that after

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620
mathematical formulas etc is that after
 

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.389
mathematical formulas etc is that after
a certain size the city does not respond

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399
a certain size the city does not respond
 

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.990
a certain size the city does not respond
to the laws of biology hence something

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000
to the laws of biology hence something
 

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.460
to the laws of biology hence something
else happens you know you can call it

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:31.470
else happens you know you can call it
 

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.139
else happens you know you can call it
fuzzy logic systems we can call it

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:33.149
fuzzy logic systems we can call it
 

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:34.910
fuzzy logic systems we can call it
something else now I think that is very

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920
something else now I think that is very
 

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.850
something else now I think that is very
important data that a different sizes of

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860
important data that a different sizes of
 

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.730
important data that a different sizes of
cities some possibilities can happen and

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740
cities some possibilities can happen and
 

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.300
cities some possibilities can happen and
at a large city the notion that we can

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.310
at a large city the notion that we can
 

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.910
at a large city the notion that we can
mimic the biosphere in order to address

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920
mimic the biosphere in order to address
 

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.240
mimic the biosphere in order to address
our problems it's just really not a

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.250
our problems it's just really not a
 

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.900
our problems it's just really not a
ability now another subject of course

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:53.910
ability now another subject of course
 

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.960
ability now another subject of course
that is big on the agenda is ecological

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:55.970
that is big on the agenda is ecological
 

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.460
that is big on the agenda is ecological
economics which compared I would say to

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:58.470
economics which compared I would say to
 

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.680
economics which compared I would say to
mainstream economics I don't mean to

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:00.690
mainstream economics I don't mean to
 

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.810
mainstream economics I don't mean to
offend any economists in the audience

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820
offend any economists in the audience
 

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.870
offend any economists in the audience
here is in advance it basically prices

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880
here is in advance it basically prices
 

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.520
here is in advance it basically prices
equal services I think I have another

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:10.530
equal services I think I have another
 

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.670
equal services I think I have another
one here no this is when it goes sort of

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680
one here no this is when it goes sort of
 

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.190
one here no this is when it goes sort of
when it home to faiz I think that is

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.200
when it home to faiz I think that is
 

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.400
when it home to faiz I think that is
very interesting I think that is a good

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.410
very interesting I think that is a good
 

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.310
very interesting I think that is a good
way of shaking people up we're actually

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320
way of shaking people up we're actually
 

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.670
way of shaking people up we're actually
using nature's services I don't

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680
using nature's services I don't
 

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.710
using nature's services I don't
necessarily see it as a solution but

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720
necessarily see it as a solution but
 

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.990
necessarily see it as a solution but
again this is a debate so it is

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000
again this is a debate so it is
 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.750
again this is a debate so it is
important to recode a lot of what we

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760
important to recode a lot of what we
 

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.220
important to recode a lot of what we
take from nature is beginning to happen

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:34.230
take from nature is beginning to happen
 

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.920
take from nature is beginning to happen
with water you know that we are

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:36.930
with water you know that we are
 

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.200
with water you know that we are
beginning to price it etc but I don't

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.210
beginning to price it etc but I don't
 

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.240
beginning to price it etc but I don't
see it as really as the solution are

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.250
see it as really as the solution are
 

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.310
see it as really as the solution are
certainly not the only solution to the

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320
certainly not the only solution to the
 

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.980
certainly not the only solution to the
sort of the catastrophic challenges that

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:45.990
sort of the catastrophic challenges that
 

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:51.500
sort of the catastrophic challenges that
we face in the biosphere and and here I

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:51.510
we face in the biosphere and and here I
 

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.500
we face in the biosphere and and here I
thought I just want to do to wrap it up

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:54.510
thought I just want to do to wrap it up
 

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.350
thought I just want to do to wrap it up
this is my last slide here what are some

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360
this is my last slide here what are some
 

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.300
this is my last slide here what are some
of the features this repeat some of what

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.310
of the features this repeat some of what
 

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.070
of the features this repeat some of what
I already said what are some of the

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:01.080
I already said what are some of the
 

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.590
I already said what are some of the
features of cities that could help us

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600
features of cities that could help us
 

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600
features of cities that could help us
regarding this environmental issue so

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:05.610
regarding this environmental issue so
 

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.310
regarding this environmental issue so
first one these issues of you know

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320
first one these issues of you know
 

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.060
first one these issues of you know
economies of scale density and the the

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.070
economies of scale density and the the
 

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.070
economies of scale density and the the
efficiencies this is a familiar subject

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.080
efficiencies this is a familiar subject
 

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.200
efficiencies this is a familiar subject
this I would say is the proposition that

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.210
this I would say is the proposition that
 

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.570
this I would say is the proposition that
right now dominate a lot of the

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:17.580
right now dominate a lot of the
 

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.800
right now dominate a lot of the
discussion about how cities can help the

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:21.810
discussion about how cities can help the
 

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.610
discussion about how cities can help the
environmental project and the key

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620
environmental project and the key

of communications the fact that this

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:34.470
of communications the fact that this
 

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.520

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:01.950
now finally this is something that has
 

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.650

gone i would say a bit beneath the radar

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660
gone i would say a bit beneath the radar

in in the question in questions of the
 

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.320
in in the question in questions of the
biosphere and I see it as a challenge to

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.330
biosphere and I see it as a challenge to
 

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.710
biosphere and I see it as a challenge to
recover different temporality in order

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720
recover different temporality in order

of this is and the projects that it

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820
of this is and the projects that it
 

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.460
of this is and the projects that it
contains cities are systems of power

with laws so just I mean this is

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160
with laws so just I mean this is

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160
history just a rational discourse that
 

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.100
history just a rational discourse that
shows us all the advantages how we can

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.110
shows us all the advantages how we can
 

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.010
shows us all the advantages how we can
do it and all of that is not going to be

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:52.020
do it and all of that is not going to be
 

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.790
do it and all of that is not going to be
enough it's going to take other forms of

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800
enough it's going to take other forms of
 

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.120
enough it's going to take other forms of
action as well we have to change laws we

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.130
action as well we have to change laws we
 

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.220
action as well we have to change laws we
have to change systems of authority we

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:01.230
have to change systems of authority we
 

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.620
have to change systems of authority we
have to change prefer by me we I don't

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:03.630
have to change prefer by me we I don't
 

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.960
have to change prefer by me we I don't
mean us okay I'm not this is not a call

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:05.970
mean us okay I'm not this is not a call
 

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.360

to action but when I'm saying and these

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:08.370
to action but when I'm saying and these
 

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.250
to action but when I'm saying and these
are for me it's neither is it just

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260
are for me it's neither is it just
 

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.690

politically these are embedded issues
 

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.070
politically these are embedded issues
that is where the question of

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.080
that is where the question of
 

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.990
that is where the question of
temporalities also comes into the

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000
temporalities also comes into the
 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.730
temporalities also comes into the
picture some of these are going to take

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740
picture some of these are going to take
 

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.740
picture some of these are going to take
a long time others are going through a

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:21.750
a long time others are going through a
 

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.830
a long time others are going through a
tipping point as we speak the spread of

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:24.840
tipping point as we speak the spread of
 

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.960
tipping point as we speak the spread of
urban farming the fact that you now in

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:26.970
urban farming the fact that you now in
 

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.280
urban farming the fact that you now in
New York City you can get a permit to

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.290
New York City you can get a permit to
 

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.470

have your chicken now I don't want to

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480
have your chicken now I don't want to
 

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.070
have your chicken now I don't want to
have a chicken in my apartment but you

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:34.080
have a chicken in my apartment but you
 

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.930
have a chicken in my apartment but you
know maybe if I lived with a gardener of

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940
know maybe if I lived with a gardener of
 

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.580
know maybe if I lived with a gardener of
the chicken either amazing i do they

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:37.590
the chicken either amazing i do they
 

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.350
the chicken either amazing i do they
actually lay an egg every day or

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360
actually lay an egg every day or
 

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.370
actually lay an egg every day or
something like i don't know how they do

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380
something like i don't know how they do
 

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.410
something like i don't know how they do
that but i find that absolutely

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420
that but i find that absolutely
 

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.760
that but i find that absolutely
extraordinary so so you know some of

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.770
extraordinary so so you know some of
 

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.230
extraordinary so so you know some of
these things are just going to evolve

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240
these things are just going to evolve
 

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.530
these things are just going to evolve
and run into tipping points other

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:50.540
and run into tipping points other
 

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.990
and run into tipping points other
aspects are it's going to take real hard

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000
aspects are it's going to take real hard
 

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.579
aspects are it's going to take real hard
work and and this conference really has

00:16:58.579 --> 00:16:58.589
work and and this conference really has
 

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:02.600

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:22.040
took me a long time to figure out how to
get the word city into my talk so I do

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.050
get the word city into my talk so I do
 

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.420
get the word city into my talk so I do
manage however I don't talk about direct

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:26.430
manage however I don't talk about direct
 

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.620
manage however I don't talk about direct
attacks on cities during wartime as

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:30.630
attacks on cities during wartime as
 

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.660
attacks on cities during wartime as
horrendous as those are what i want to

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:35.670
horrendous as those are what i want to
 

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:39.440
horrendous as those are what i want to
do and also i should say i think that to

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:39.450
do and also i should say i think that to
 

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.590
do and also i should say i think that to
some extent this talk will form a bridge

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600
some extent this talk will form a bridge
 

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.260
some extent this talk will form a bridge
between a conference that Professor

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:45.270
between a conference that Professor
 

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.080
between a conference that Professor
assassin had here a year ago which in

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.090
assassin had here a year ago which in
 

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.950
assassin had here a year ago which in
fact dealt with cities and war and so

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960
fact dealt with cities and war and so
 

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.540
fact dealt with cities and war and so
this in a sense i think provides

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:53.550
this in a sense i think provides
 

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.590
this in a sense i think provides
somewhat of a bridge between last year's

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600
somewhat of a bridge between last year's
 

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.430
somewhat of a bridge between last year's
conference and this one so let me begin

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440
conference and this one so let me begin
 

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:09.260
conference and this one so let me begin
by mentioning four major points which I

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:09.270
by mentioning four major points which I
 

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.320
by mentioning four major points which I
think are crucial to understanding what

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:12.330
think are crucial to understanding what
 

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.330
think are crucial to understanding what
I'm talking about these are

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340
I'm talking about these are
 

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.230
I'm talking about these are
uncomfortable they're disquieting the

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240
uncomfortable they're disquieting the
 

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.090
uncomfortable they're disquieting the
first one is that wars are by their

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100
first one is that wars are by their
 

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.309
first one is that wars are by their
actual essence

00:23:25.309 --> 00:23:25.319
actual essence
 

00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:29.069
actual essence
deadly and destructive this is what wars

00:23:29.069 --> 00:23:29.079
deadly and destructive this is what wars
 

00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:31.469
deadly and destructive this is what wars
are all about this is the specific

00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:31.479
are all about this is the specific
 

00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:35.579
are all about this is the specific
intent of a war is to be detrimental to

00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:35.589
intent of a war is to be detrimental to

00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:42.059
the Armed Forces to the people and the
land of one's opponent so point one is

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:42.069
land of one's opponent so point one is
 

00:23:42.069 --> 00:23:46.399
land of one's opponent so point one is
that wars are meant to be destructive to

00:23:46.399 --> 00:23:46.409
that wars are meant to be destructive to
 

00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:51.719
that wars are meant to be destructive to
the second point is that Wars as far as

the second point is that Wars as far as
 

00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:56.539
the second point is that Wars as far as
we can tell have continued unabated

back to World War two and the time

00:24:45.989 --> 00:24:45.999
back to World War two and the time
 

00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:48.929
back to World War two and the time
between World War two and now there's

00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:48.939
between World War two and now there's
 

00:24:48.939 --> 00:24:51.449

never been a year since that period this

more than half a century and there

00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:53.739
more than half a century and there
 

00:24:53.739 --> 00:24:56.759
more than half a century and there
haven't been more or less than about two

dozen wars going on one place or another
 

00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:03.779
dozen wars going on one place or another
around the world so that's point to that

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:03.789
around the world so that's point to that
 

00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:08.489
around the world so that's point to that

enough counter-intuitively warfare has
not gotten more disruptive more

the major nations certainly has improved
and keeps improving

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:37.460
and keeps improving
 

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.230
and keeps improving
however the actual level of damage and

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240
however the actual level of damage and
 

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:47.470
however the actual level of damage and
destruction is relatively constant and

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480
destruction is relatively constant and
 

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.070
destruction is relatively constant and
I'll hope I can demonstrate that in a

I'll hope I can demonstrate that in a

I'll hope I can demonstrate that in a
few moments what does limit the impact

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440
few moments what does limit the impact
 

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.960
few moments what does limit the impact
of warfare on the enemy is basically

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:01.970
of warfare on the enemy is basically
 

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.870
of warfare on the enemy is basically
three things one the objectives of the

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880
three things one the objectives of the
 

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.690
three things one the objectives of the
of the entity that's fighting the war

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:10.700
of the entity that's fighting the war
 

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.970
of the entity that's fighting the war
the will of each of the two parties and

the will of each of the two parties and

other words the reluctance to capitulate

so it's a question not of how serious

00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:29.419
so it's a question not of how serious
 

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:32.980
so it's a question not of how serious
war can get it's a question of how soon

war can get it's a question of how soon

point the fourth major point I'd like to
 

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:49.930
point the fourth major point I'd like to
make is that the impact of war on the

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:49.940
make is that the impact of war on the
 

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.360
make is that the impact of war on the
human population is serious it's nasty

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.370
human population is serious it's nasty

it's horrible but it hasn't changed much

refugees of displaced persons is the
 

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:48.870
refugees of displaced persons is the
fact that there

resource base is shriveling up is
deteriorating and so it's a combination

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:11.500
either in terms of safety or in terms of
 

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.590
either in terms of safety or in terms of
economics and here is my first mention

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600
economics and here is my first mention
 

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.870
economics and here is my first mention
of cities roughly half of all the

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880
of cities roughly half of all the
 

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.900
of cities roughly half of all the
displaced people in the world in recent

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:21.910
displaced people in the world in recent
 

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.600
displaced people in the world in recent
years have ended up in urban areas in

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:24.610
years have ended up in urban areas in
 

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:34.100
years have ended up in urban areas in
cities so let me now discuss briefly

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.110
cities so let me now discuss briefly
 

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.870
cities so let me now discuss briefly
environmental components of warfare

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880
environmental components of warfare
 

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.520
environmental components of warfare
because after all this is what I'm

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:38.530
because after all this is what I'm
 

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.280
because after all this is what I'm
supposed to be talking about the impact

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.290
supposed to be talking about the impact
 

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:48.500
supposed to be talking about the impact
of wars one can think of two levels of

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:48.510
of wars one can think of two levels of
 

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.240
of wars one can think of two levels of
environmental impact and some might say

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:51.250
environmental impact and some might say
 

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.430
environmental impact and some might say
that the second level can be split into

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440
that the second level can be split into
 

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.320
that the second level can be split into
two parts the first level of

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:57.330
two parts the first level of
 

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.540
two parts the first level of
environmental impact of warfare of armed

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:00.550
environmental impact of warfare of armed
 

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:05.460
environmental impact of warfare of armed
conflict is unintentional or at least

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:05.470
conflict is unintentional or at least
 

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.810
conflict is unintentional or at least
incidental so that whenever there is a

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:09.820
incidental so that whenever there is a
 

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:15.060
incidental so that whenever there is a
battlefield of some kind the battlefield

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.070
battlefield of some kind the battlefield
 

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.480
battlefield of some kind the battlefield
itself the theater of operation is

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:17.490
itself the theater of operation is
 

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.180
itself the theater of operation is
disrupted this is not necessarily the

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:21.190
disrupted this is not necessarily the
 

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:27.450
disrupted this is not necessarily the
intent of the of the perpetrators it's

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:27.460
intent of the of the perpetrators it's
 

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.850
intent of the of the perpetrators it's
an incidental effect on the environment

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:29.860
an incidental effect on the environment
 

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.270
an incidental effect on the environment
and it's referred to in military jargon

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:33.280
and it's referred to in military jargon
 

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.170
and it's referred to in military jargon
as collateral effects and so that's

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:37.180
as collateral effects and so that's
 

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.280
as collateral effects and so that's
category one the second category which I

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:41.290
category one the second category which I
 

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.170
category one the second category which I
think I'll split into two parts the

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:43.180
think I'll split into two parts the
 

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.970
think I'll split into two parts the
second category is intentional

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980
second category is intentional
 

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.250
second category is intentional
destruction of the environment for one

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:50.260
destruction of the environment for one
 

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:58.300
destruction of the environment for one
reason or another

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:58.310
 
 

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:02.440
 
this intentional disruption can be an

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:02.450
this intentional disruption can be an
 

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:07.410
this intentional disruption can be an
attack on farms on fields on forests on

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:07.420
attack on farms on fields on forests on
 

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.410
attack on farms on fields on forests on
pasture lands on range lands on water

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:11.420
pasture lands on range lands on water
 

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.060

system height without on the
 

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:18.190
system height without on the
hydrological infrastructure and so this

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200
hydrological infrastructure and so this
 

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.650
hydrological infrastructure and so this
might very well be intentional and I'll

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:20.660
might very well be intentional and I'll
 

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.750
might very well be intentional and I'll
give you quite a few examples of that in

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760
give you quite a few examples of that in
 

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.430
give you quite a few examples of that in
a few moments so we have unintentional

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440
a few moments so we have unintentional
 

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.820
a few moments so we have unintentional
or collateral and the intentional

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:30.830
or collateral and the intentional
 

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.760
or collateral and the intentional
effects and now let me mention sort of a

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:33.770
effects and now let me mention sort of a
 

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:37.060
effects and now let me mention sort of a
subcategory of the intentional effects

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:37.070
subcategory of the intentional effects
 

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:42.120
subcategory of the intentional effects
and those are attacks on the environment

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:42.130
and those are attacks on the environment
 

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:46.450
and those are attacks on the environment
in such a way that a modest amount of

in such a way that a modest amount of
 

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.650
in such a way that a modest amount of
energy supplied ends up in causing a

energy supplied ends up in causing a
 

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:56.290
energy supplied ends up in causing a
massive form of damage this this

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:56.300
massive form of damage this this
 

00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.310
massive form of damage this this
multiple multiplier effect is referred

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320
multiple multiplier effect is referred
 

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:07.540
multiple multiplier effect is referred
to in formal jargon as the release of

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:07.550
to in formal jargon as the release of
 

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.920
to in formal jargon as the release of
dangerous forces for example destroying

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:11.930
dangerous forces for example destroying
 

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.040
dangerous forces for example destroying
a major damn might take one or two bombs

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.050
a major damn might take one or two bombs
 

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:19.450
a major damn might take one or two bombs
and then sweep a huge area into oblivion

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:19.460
and then sweep a huge area into oblivion
 

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.290
and then sweep a huge area into oblivion
or the attack on a chemical factory

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:22.300
or the attack on a chemical factory
 

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:29.680
or the attack on a chemical factory
might be one small attack and in turn

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:29.690
might be one small attack and in turn
 

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.380
might be one small attack and in turn
the noxious fume release might be

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:32.390
the noxious fume release might be
 

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.920
the noxious fume release might be
phenomenal or one could attack a nuclear

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:35.930
phenomenal or one could attack a nuclear
 

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.250

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.510
energy releasing a major output of
destructive energy so those are the the

destructive energy so those are the the
 

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.310
destructive energy so those are the the
categories of

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320
categories of
 

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.320
categories of
of military impact on the environment

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:54.330
of military impact on the environment
 

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.409
of military impact on the environment
let me dwell a little bit now on the

00:31:58.409 --> 00:31:58.419
let me dwell a little bit now on the
 

00:31:58.419 --> 00:32:01.529
let me dwell a little bit now on the
intentional effects to give you a

00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:01.539
intentional effects to give you a
 

00:32:01.539 --> 00:32:03.990
intentional effects to give you a
feeling for what I'm actually talking

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000
feeling for what I'm actually talking
 

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.720
feeling for what I'm actually talking
about and here I'll split them into

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:06.730
about and here I'll split them into
 

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:12.019
about and here I'll split them into
effect on the land and effects on the

00:32:12.019 --> 00:32:12.029
effect on the land and effects on the
 

00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:16.049
effect on the land and effects on the
hydrological infrastructure and here I

00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:16.059
hydrological infrastructure and here I
 

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:19.860
hydrological infrastructure and here I
could go back clear through history I

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:19.870
could go back clear through history I
 

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.529
could go back clear through history I
could talk about the Israelites and the

00:32:22.529 --> 00:32:22.539
could talk about the Israelites and the
 

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:24.810
could talk about the Israelites and the
Persians and the Spartans and the

Persians and the Spartans and the
 

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.409
Persians and the Spartans and the
Mongols and so on and it wouldn't be

00:32:28.409 --> 00:32:28.419
Mongols and so on and it wouldn't be
 

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:31.680
Mongols and so on and it wouldn't be
very different from today but I will

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:31.690
very different from today but I will
 

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:37.080
very different from today but I will
restrict myself pretty much to recent

so this is running away fleeing from war

00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839
so this is running away fleeing from war

before I begin Arthur your point is

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:29.020
before I begin Arthur your point is

before I begin Arthur your point is
already in my pocket with the

00:58:32.059 --> 00:58:32.069
already in my pocket with the
 

00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:34.680
already in my pocket with the
vulnerability of the dike system I'm

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:34.690
vulnerability of the dike system I'm
 

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:37.500
vulnerability of the dike system I'm
aware of it but I wouldn't really be

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:37.510
aware of it but I wouldn't really be
 

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.150
aware of it but I wouldn't really be
able to say what our current attitude

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160
able to say what our current attitude
 

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.069
able to say what our current attitude
towards it is so I'm definitely going to

00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079
towards it is so I'm definitely going to
 

00:58:41.079 --> 00:58:42.150
towards it is so I'm definitely going to
check that out it's a very interesting

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160
check that out it's a very interesting
 

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:47.309
check that out it's a very interesting
point Holland is at the end of the River

00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319
point Holland is at the end of the River
 

00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:51.960
point Holland is at the end of the River
Rhine and it's a delta and in a natural

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:51.970
Rhine and it's a delta and in a natural
 

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:54.990
Rhine and it's a delta and in a natural
Delta you cannot live because the

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000
Delta you cannot live because the
 

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.579
Delta you cannot live because the
borders between land and water are

00:58:56.579 --> 00:58:56.589
borders between land and water are
 

00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:58.589
borders between land and water are
changing all the time and that's very

00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599
changing all the time and that's very
 

00:58:58.599 --> 00:59:01.500
changing all the time and that's very
unpractical so Holland has turned that

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:01.510
unpractical so Holland has turned that
 

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:05.329
unpractical so Holland has turned that
Delta into a big water machine and

00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339
Delta into a big water machine and
 

00:59:05.339 --> 00:59:08.849
Delta into a big water machine and
benefited greatly from that machine as a

00:59:08.849 --> 00:59:08.859
benefited greatly from that machine as a
 

00:59:08.859 --> 00:59:13.980
benefited greatly from that machine as a
trading hub and fertile soil use for

00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:13.990
trading hub and fertile soil use for
 

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:17.400
trading hub and fertile soil use for
agriculture however the machine is

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:17.410
agriculture however the machine is
 

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.650
agriculture however the machine is
sinking down and that also shouldn't be

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:19.660
sinking down and that also shouldn't be
 

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.289
sinking down and that also shouldn't be
too much of a problem but the system the

00:59:22.289 --> 00:59:22.299
too much of a problem but the system the
 

00:59:22.299 --> 00:59:24.329
too much of a problem but the system the
water machine does deserve continuous

00:59:24.329 --> 00:59:24.339
water machine does deserve continuous
 

00:59:24.339 --> 00:59:28.620
water machine does deserve continuous
attention and modifications because of

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:28.630
attention and modifications because of
 

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:30.089
attention and modifications because of
climate change but also because of other

00:59:30.089 --> 00:59:30.099
climate change but also because of other
 

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:31.680
climate change but also because of other
changes in society and that's what I

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:31.690
changes in society and that's what I
 

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:35.039
changes in society and that's what I
will be talking about let's go to the

00:59:35.039 --> 00:59:35.049
will be talking about let's go to the
 

00:59:35.049 --> 00:59:42.660

spendings on water infrastructure flood
 

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:12.240
spendings on water infrastructure flood
defence and that looks like a long time

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:12.250
defence and that looks like a long time
 

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:15.000
defence and that looks like a long time
ahead 10 years but it's in fact sort of

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:15.010
ahead 10 years but it's in fact sort of
 

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:16.710
ahead 10 years but it's in fact sort of
normal in infrastructure planning that

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720
normal in infrastructure planning that
 

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.110
normal in infrastructure planning that
you think in those times

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:20.120
you think in those times
 

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.590
you think in those times
in that report was this drawing and it's

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:24.600
in that report was this drawing and it's
 

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.380
in that report was this drawing and it's
a grown-up that I made for with a plan

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:27.390
a grown-up that I made for with a plan
 

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:30.830
a grown-up that I made for with a plan
to protect the Rhine Delta from flooding

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:30.840
to protect the Rhine Delta from flooding
 

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.230
to protect the Rhine Delta from flooding
and the Rhine Delta is an interesting is

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240
and the Rhine Delta is an interesting is
 

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.030
and the Rhine Delta is an interesting is
for an engineer and interesting region

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040
for an engineer and interesting region
 

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.620
for an engineer and interesting region
because it is the flood protection

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:39.630
because it is the flood protection
 

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.150
because it is the flood protection
system protects about eight million

people about four million in this
particular region but the dike ring

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:46.320
particular region but the dike ring
 

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.380
particular region but the dike ring
spreads out northbound and it has to

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:51.390
spreads out northbound and it has to
 

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.960
spreads out northbound and it has to
deal with storm surges and High River

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:53.970
deal with storm surges and High River
 

01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:56.690
deal with storm surges and High River
discharges and for a particular region

01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700
discharges and for a particular region
 

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.330
discharges and for a particular region
there the coin silence of both those

01:00:59.330 --> 01:00:59.340
there the coin silence of both those
 

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.360
there the coin silence of both those
events and that is what this plan

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:02.370
events and that is what this plan
 

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.610
events and that is what this plan
addresses and the adventure that I'm at

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:04.620
addresses and the adventure that I'm at
 

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.860
addresses and the adventure that I'm at
is that the plan is still standing and

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:06.870
is that the plan is still standing and
 

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:10.040
is that the plan is still standing and
after that reports I was sort of I got

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:10.050
after that reports I was sort of I got
 

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:12.170
after that reports I was sort of I got

little Thai key here is a dike a little
 

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.829
little Thai key here is a dike a little
bit a little bit bigger this is a lake

crisis number one increasing flood risk

01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440
crisis number one increasing flood risk
 

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.109
crisis number one increasing flood risk
one important thing is that we have a

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119
one important thing is that we have a
 

01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:04.460
one important thing is that we have a
law in the Netherlands dictating a

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:04.470
law in the Netherlands dictating a
 

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:07.950
law in the Netherlands dictating a
certain level of protection and the

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960
certain level of protection and the
 

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.599
certain level of protection and the
funny thing about that law is that

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:09.609
funny thing about that law is that
 

01:06:09.609 --> 01:06:12.059
funny thing about that law is that
actually climate change is embedded in

01:06:12.059 --> 01:06:12.069
actually climate change is embedded in
 

01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:14.210
actually climate change is embedded in
that law when climate change occurs and

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220
that law when climate change occurs and
 

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.690
that law when climate change occurs and
every five years that law is being

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:17.700
every five years that law is being
 

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.730
every five years that law is being
updating like there's a sort of a test

01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:20.740
updating like there's a sort of a test
 

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:24.180
updating like there's a sort of a test
going on whether the system is accorded

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.190

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:26.160
going on whether the system is accorded
is updated according to the law or not

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:26.170
is updated according to the law or not
 

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:27.839
is updated according to the law or not
and when climate would change more and

01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:27.849
and when climate would change more and
 

01:06:27.849 --> 01:06:28.880
and when climate would change more and
more parts in system would be

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:28.890
more parts in system would be
 

01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:31.500
more parts in system would be
disqualified and according to the law

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:31.510
disqualified and according to the law
 

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:35.309
disqualified and according to the law
that has to be money allocated to combat

01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319
that has to be money allocated to combat
 

01:06:35.319 --> 01:06:38.339
that has to be money allocated to combat
that it's not as simple as that because

01:06:38.339 --> 01:06:38.349
that it's not as simple as that because
 

01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:40.530
that it's not as simple as that because
even though a law dictates that

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:40.540
even though a law dictates that
 

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.140
even though a law dictates that
resources should go somewhere there are

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:43.150
resources should go somewhere there are
 

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:44.460
resources should go somewhere there are
more laws like that and there's a

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:44.470
more laws like that and there's a
 

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.620
more laws like that and there's a
limited national budget that's one thing

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:46.630
limited national budget that's one thing
 

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:48.630
limited national budget that's one thing
another thing is that some parts of that

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640
another thing is that some parts of that
 

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.770
another thing is that some parts of that
law are actually outdated or and a third

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:52.780
law are actually outdated or and a third
 

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.980
law are actually outdated or and a third
issue is that even when the law says a

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:55.990
issue is that even when the law says a
 

01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:57.970
issue is that even when the law says a
dike is no longer high enough for

01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:57.980
dike is no longer high enough for
 

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.660
dike is no longer high enough for
long enough there are more ways to deal

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:01.670
long enough there are more ways to deal
 

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:03.880
long enough there are more ways to deal
with that so the law looks simple but

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:03.890
with that so the law looks simple but
 

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:05.800
with that so the law looks simple but
it's actually it has some complicated

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:05.810
it's actually it has some complicated
 

01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:09.130
it's actually it has some complicated
issues that's the current situation we

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:09.140
issues that's the current situation we
 

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.020
issues that's the current situation we
have that law then on the long run

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:11.030
have that law then on the long run
 

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.490
have that law then on the long run

there's that Delta committee that I just
referred to that is that has come up

because of climate change what are we

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:48.200
because of climate change what are we
 

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.519
because of climate change what are we
going to do about it first it's more

01:08:51.519 --> 01:08:51.529
going to do about it first it's more
 

01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:52.840
going to do about it first it's more
complicated than that and then there's

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:52.850
complicated than that and then there's
 

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:54.690
complicated than that and then there's
eco ecology and then there are more

01:08:54.690 --> 01:08:54.700

driving forces behind modifications to
the water infrastructure system so you

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920
the water infrastructure system so you
 

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.620
the water infrastructure system so you
know that of course but it's not as

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:02.630
know that of course but it's not as
 

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:04.539
know that of course but it's not as

didn't get it this is a difficult issue

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:16.710
didn't get it this is a difficult issue

what's going on here here we got the

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:18.940
what's going on here here we got the

again the the essence is what I'm

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:23.750
again the the essence is what I'm
 

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:25.870
again the the essence is what I'm
thinking is we have to keep pushing and

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880
thinking is we have to keep pushing and
 

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:29.260
thinking is we have to keep pushing and
keep debating about are we willing to

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:29.270
keep debating about are we willing to
 

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:32.050
keep debating about are we willing to
spend money to improve ecology I guess

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:32.060
spend money to improve ecology I guess
 

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.840

as a designer engineer I want to know

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:34.850
as a designer engineer I want to know
 

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:36.910
as a designer engineer I want to know
like what's my budget to work on that

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920
like what's my budget to work on that
 

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.919
like what's my budget to work on that
and then and that's not clear people are

01:11:38.919 --> 01:11:38.929
and then and that's not clear people are
 

01:11:38.929 --> 01:11:41.770
and then and that's not clear people are
hiding it in other objectives and that's

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:41.780
hiding it in other objectives and that's
 

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.530
hiding it in other objectives and that's
issue number one um issue number two how

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:44.540
issue number one um issue number two how
 

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:50.800
issue number one um issue number two how
safe is safe enough the uncertainty in

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:50.810
safe is safe enough the uncertainty in
 

01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:54.660
safe is safe enough the uncertainty in
climate change makes it very hard to say

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:54.670
climate change makes it very hard to say
 

01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:58.149
climate change makes it very hard to say
this is the level of safety that we want

01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159
this is the level of safety that we want
 

01:11:58.159 --> 01:11:59.740
this is the level of safety that we want
because we don't really know what the

01:11:59.740 --> 01:11:59.750
because we don't really know what the
 

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:03.310
because we don't really know what the
threat is exactly and there are other

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320
threat is exactly and there are other
 

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.950
threat is exactly and there are other
issues also that that make it very

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960
issues also that that make it very
 

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.520
issues also that that make it very
difficult to sit a hard point of this is

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:09.530
difficult to sit a hard point of this is
 

01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:11.919
difficult to sit a hard point of this is
our safety level theoretically the

01:12:11.919 --> 01:12:11.929
our safety level theoretically the
 

01:12:11.929 --> 01:12:15.580
our safety level theoretically the
safety level is an optimum between the

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:15.590
safety level is an optimum between the
 

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.859
safety level is an optimum between the
risk reduction and investment to make to

01:12:17.859 --> 01:12:17.869
risk reduction and investment to make to
 

01:12:17.869 --> 01:12:20.830
risk reduction and investment to make to
reduce the risk the more precious the

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840
reduce the risk the more precious the
 

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.010
reduce the risk the more precious the
treasure the more expensive the case

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:24.020
treasure the more expensive the case
 

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:25.990
treasure the more expensive the case
around the treasure and that should be

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000
around the treasure and that should be
 

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.870
around the treasure and that should be
in balance with each other but there are

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880
in balance with each other but there are
 

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.390
in balance with each other but there are
many reasons why that is actually an

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400
many reasons why that is actually an
 

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.979
many reasons why that is actually an
illusion that you can calculate it very

01:12:32.979 --> 01:12:32.989
illusion that you can calculate it very
 

01:12:32.989 --> 01:12:35.859
illusion that you can calculate it very
strictly so what I sometimes think is

01:12:35.859 --> 01:12:35.869
strictly so what I sometimes think is
 

01:12:35.869 --> 01:12:37.689
strictly so what I sometimes think is
maybe we shouldn't aim for something we

01:12:37.689 --> 01:12:37.699
maybe we shouldn't aim for something we
 

01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:39.459
maybe we shouldn't aim for something we
shouldn't keep calculating so much about

01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:39.469
shouldn't keep calculating so much about
 

01:12:39.469 --> 01:12:42.070
shouldn't keep calculating so much about
trying to get that objective standard

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080
trying to get that objective standard
 

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.540
trying to get that objective standard
but we should just think in relative

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:43.550
but we should just think in relative
 

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:46.450
but we should just think in relative
steps like we don't know exactly how

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:46.460
steps like we don't know exactly how
 

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.160
steps like we don't know exactly how
safe we want to get but at least this

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:48.170
safe we want to get but at least this
 

01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:49.689
safe we want to get but at least this
measure will make us a lot safer

01:12:49.689 --> 01:12:49.699
measure will make us a lot safer
 

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:56.169
measure will make us a lot safer
everybody gets that then there's the

01:12:56.169 --> 01:12:56.179
everybody gets that then there's the
 

01:12:56.179 --> 01:12:58.270
everybody gets that then there's the
issue of to isolate the climate change

01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280
issue of to isolate the climate change
 

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.510
issue of to isolate the climate change
the vector why would you want that well

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.520
the vector why would you want that well
 

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.399
the vector why would you want that well
personally what bothers me sometimes is

01:13:03.399 --> 01:13:03.409
personally what bothers me sometimes is
 

01:13:03.409 --> 01:13:06.149
personally what bothers me sometimes is
that climate change as a driver for

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159
that climate change as a driver for
 

01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:09.280
that climate change as a driver for
investments gets a lot of attention but

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:09.290
investments gets a lot of attention but
 

01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:11.169
investments gets a lot of attention but
maybe there are many other reasons why

01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:11.179
maybe there are many other reasons why
 

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:12.609
maybe there are many other reasons why
would you why you would want to invest

01:13:12.609 --> 01:13:12.619
would you why you would want to invest
 

01:13:12.619 --> 01:13:14.770
would you why you would want to invest
also for example an African country

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:14.780
also for example an African country
 

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.200
also for example an African country
would probe could say we want an

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:17.210
would probe could say we want an
 

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:18.669
would probe could say we want an

change but mostly they want the

01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:20.420
change but mostly they want the
 

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.209
change but mostly they want the
irrigation system because they need that

01:13:22.209 --> 01:13:22.219
irrigation system because they need that

to grow crops so you know to keep

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:25.310

isolate that factor now here is going to

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:31.820
isolate that factor now here is going to

isolate that factor now here is going to
be a little bit of math

01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:32.860
be a little bit of math
 

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:36.320

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:26.110
a cost-benefit analysis between
 

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:27.810
a cost-benefit analysis between
risk-reducing investment and the risk

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:27.820
risk-reducing investment and the risk
 

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.219
risk-reducing investment and the risk
reduction that's what I've just said to

01:18:29.219 --> 01:18:29.229

and fear is not in the question it's
 

01:18:31.599 --> 01:18:34.229
and fear is not in the question it's
just the failure probability that's what

we want to know that that's what we
 

01:18:36.099 --> 01:18:39.629
we want to know that that's what we
count with that's what an engineer would

01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639
count with that's what an engineer would
 

01:18:39.639 --> 01:18:41.299
count with that's what an engineer would
say a probabilistic engineer would say

collaborative understanding we have to

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:28.930
collaborative understanding we have to
 

01:22:28.930 --> 01:22:30.990
collaborative understanding we have to
choose the next step and then you know

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000
choose the next step and then you know
 

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.180
choose the next step and then you know
and then in 20 or 30 years there will be

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:33.190
and then in 20 or 30 years there will be
 

01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:34.740
and then in 20 or 30 years there will be
other people who determine the next step

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:34.750
other people who determine the next step

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.730
participation sessions and what I
discovered is that it's very it's great

01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:44.740
discovered is that it's very it's great
 

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.100
discovered is that it's very it's great
to have the stakeholders to debate but

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:47.110
to have the stakeholders to debate but
 

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.260
to have the stakeholders to debate but
it would be so much better if they would

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:49.270
it would be so much better if they would
 

01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:50.790
it would be so much better if they would
have more knowledge so that's what this

01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800
have more knowledge so that's what this
 

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.670
have more knowledge so that's what this
game would address they get a budget

01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:53.680
game would address they get a budget
 

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.860
game would address they get a budget
every five years or ten years and they

01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:55.870
every five years or ten years and they
 

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.450
every five years or ten years and they
can build with it and they for example

01:22:57.450 --> 01:22:57.460
can build with it and they for example
 

01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.160
can build with it and they for example
recognize that you can't build

01:22:59.160 --> 01:22:59.170
recognize that you can't build
 

01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:00.360
recognize that you can't build
everything you want if you want

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:00.370
everything you want if you want
 

01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:01.740
everything you want if you want
ecological improvement in the

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:01.750
ecological improvement in the
 

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.360
ecological improvement in the
southwestern Delta where do you get the

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:03.370
southwestern Delta where do you get the
 

01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:06.660
southwestern Delta where do you get the
money from so you get and then suppose

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:06.670
money from so you get and then suppose
 

01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:08.970
money from so you get and then suppose
the and I got some money to elaborate

01:23:08.970 --> 01:23:08.980
the and I got some money to elaborate
 

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.710
the and I got some money to elaborate
further on days so it's going to be very

01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:10.720
further on days so it's going to be very
 

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.130
further on days so it's going to be very
exciting because I want interactive

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:14.140
exciting because I want interactive
 

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.040
exciting because I want interactive

elements to that people who use it they
 

01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:18.870
elements to that people who use it they
can send if they disagree with something

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880
can send if they disagree with something
 

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.240
can send if they disagree with something
if they know it better if they have a

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:21.250
if they know it better if they have a
 

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:23.040
if they know it better if they have a
better idea if we lack some kind of

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:23.050
better idea if we lack some kind of
 

01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:25.020
better idea if we lack some kind of
rapport and you can download reports so

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:25.030
rapport and you can download reports so
 

01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:28.380
rapport and you can download reports so
here this is a very important screen to

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:28.390
here this is a very important screen to
 

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:30.420
here this is a very important screen to
really tap into the pool of knowledge

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:30.430
really tap into the pool of knowledge
 

01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:33.900
really tap into the pool of knowledge
and ideas and values of everybody

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:33.910
and ideas and values of everybody
 

01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:39.600
and ideas and values of everybody
involved

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:39.610
 
 

01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:43.649
 
does it do you get the sort of vision

01:23:43.649 --> 01:23:43.659
does it do you get the sort of vision
 

01:23:43.659 --> 01:23:45.810
does it do you get the sort of vision
that I have about combining that

01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:45.820
that I have about combining that
 

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.939
that I have about combining that
modernistic and postmodern mystic

01:23:47.939 --> 01:23:47.949
modernistic and postmodern mystic
 

01:23:47.949 --> 01:23:54.919
modernistic and postmodern mystic
elements yeah we can sort of wrap up

01:23:54.919 --> 01:23:54.929
 
 

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:58.470
 
here you see how storm surges and river

01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480
here you see how storm surges and river
 

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.540
here you see how storm surges and river
discharges correlate with each other and

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:02.550
discharges correlate with each other and
 

01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:06.020
discharges correlate with each other and
that gives you the probability of those

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:06.030
that gives you the probability of those
 

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:08.820
that gives you the probability of those
hydraulic combinations to get people

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:08.830

some understanding of the whole nature

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:11.320
some understanding of the whole nature
 

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.890
some understanding of the whole nature
of probability it's very hard to get

01:24:13.890 --> 01:24:13.900
of probability it's very hard to get
 

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.109
of probability it's very hard to get
your head around what what probabilities

01:24:16.109 --> 01:24:16.119
your head around what what probabilities
 

01:24:16.119 --> 01:24:19.859
your head around what what probabilities
and chances really are now continue game

01:24:19.859 --> 01:24:19.869
and chances really are now continue game
 

01:24:19.869 --> 01:24:21.180

kind of walk you through the challenges

01:26:06.699 --> 01:26:06.709
kind of walk you through the challenges
 

01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:08.619
kind of walk you through the challenges
that are involved in in what we call it

01:26:08.619 --> 01:26:08.629
that are involved in in what we call it
 

01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:10.569
that are involved in in what we call it
kind of adaptation to climate change and

01:26:10.569 --> 01:26:10.579
kind of adaptation to climate change and
 

01:26:10.579 --> 01:26:15.339
kind of adaptation to climate change and
before I do that because many times in

01:26:15.339 --> 01:26:15.349
before I do that because many times in
 

01:26:15.349 --> 01:26:18.969
before I do that because many times in
my ma talks it does come across as

01:26:18.969 --> 01:26:18.979
my ma talks it does come across as
 

01:26:18.979 --> 01:26:21.790
my ma talks it does come across as
possibly that because of the nuances

01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800
possibly that because of the nuances
 

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.219
possibly that because of the nuances
that I demand that it may come across

01:26:24.219 --> 01:26:24.229
that I demand that it may come across
 

01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:26.379
that I demand that it may come across
that I'm more of a skeptic so this the

01:26:26.379 --> 01:26:26.389
that I'm more of a skeptic so this the
 

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:28.989
that I'm more of a skeptic so this the
first three slides is to show no climate

01:26:28.989 --> 01:26:28.999
first three slides is to show no climate
 

01:26:28.999 --> 01:26:31.959
first three slides is to show no climate
change is Israel and we are in it for

01:26:31.959 --> 01:26:31.969
change is Israel and we are in it for
 

01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:33.939
change is Israel and we are in it for
whether we like it or not so that's

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:33.949
whether we like it or not so that's
 

01:26:33.949 --> 01:26:36.819
whether we like it or not so that's
going to put all of you at ease then

01:26:36.819 --> 01:26:36.829
going to put all of you at ease then
 

01:26:36.829 --> 01:26:39.219
going to put all of you at ease then
this then the next set of slides would

01:26:39.219 --> 01:26:39.229
this then the next set of slides would
 

01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:42.129
this then the next set of slides would
be really you're going to since I had a

01:26:42.129 --> 01:26:42.139
be really you're going to since I had a
 

01:26:42.139 --> 01:26:44.939
be really you're going to since I had a
very little idea of the nature of

01:26:44.939 --> 01:26:44.949
very little idea of the nature of
 

01:26:44.949 --> 01:26:47.169
very little idea of the nature of
participants here so I didn't want to

01:26:47.169 --> 01:26:47.179
participants here so I didn't want to
 

01:26:47.179 --> 01:26:48.699
participants here so I didn't want to
take it for granted that you guys are

01:26:48.699 --> 01:26:48.709
take it for granted that you guys are
 

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:51.520
take it for granted that you guys are
already all top notch on all aspects of

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:51.530
already all top notch on all aspects of
 

01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:53.500
already all top notch on all aspects of
weather or climate and so on so this is

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:53.510
weather or climate and so on so this is
 

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:55.589
weather or climate and so on so this is
just a kind of a very simple quick

01:26:55.589 --> 01:26:55.599
just a kind of a very simple quick
 

01:26:55.599 --> 01:26:57.430
just a kind of a very simple quick
run-through

01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440
run-through
 

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.650
run-through
if you guys have already done that you

01:26:59.650 --> 01:26:59.660
if you guys have already done that you
 

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:02.290
if you guys have already done that you
can just say I love participation so you

01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:02.300
can just say I love participation so you
 

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.060
can just say I love participation so you
can just say next next next and we can

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:04.070
can just say next next next and we can
 

01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:06.610

three distinct systems you have the
weather the of climate variability and

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:24.650
weather the of climate variability and
 

01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:27.070
weather the of climate variability and
climate change the weather is in the

climate change the weather is in the
 

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.689
climate change the weather is in the
realm of 1 to 10 days and it's basically

01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:28.699
realm of 1 to 10 days and it's basically
 

01:29:28.699 --> 01:29:30.250
realm of 1 to 10 days and it's basically

parts of the world climate variability
 

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.300
parts of the world climate variability
is all the way from two to three months

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:40.310
is all the way from two to three months

that give persistence and hence gear
skill help give model skill okay so then

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:55.310
skill help give model skill okay so then
 

01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:56.500
skill help give model skill okay so then
you have climate change which is

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:56.510
you have climate change which is
 

01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:58.810
you have climate change which is
generally several decades out into

emission scenarios okay so it's

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:18.290
emission scenarios okay so it's
 

01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:20.050
emission scenarios okay so it's
important to keep in mind that when we

01:30:20.050 --> 01:30:20.060
important to keep in mind that when we
 

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:22.120
important to keep in mind that when we
talk about whether climate variability

variability and climate change are
 

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.770
variability and climate change are
related this may surprise some in the

anthropogenic influence so you shouldn't
 

01:31:40.469 --> 01:31:42.859
anthropogenic influence so you shouldn't
put scientists in that tough spot but

01:31:42.859 --> 01:31:42.869
put scientists in that tough spot but
 

01:31:42.869 --> 01:31:44.060
put scientists in that tough spot but
maybe you should that you're going to

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:44.070
maybe you should that you're going to
 

01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:46.609
maybe you should that you're going to
sharpen their minds so what we have is

01:31:46.609 --> 01:31:46.619
sharpen their minds so what we have is
 

01:31:46.619 --> 01:31:48.200
sharpen their minds so what we have is
an understanding of variability and

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:48.210
an understanding of variability and
 

01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:50.899
an understanding of variability and
change is really important and of course

01:31:50.899 --> 01:31:50.909
change is really important and of course
 

01:31:50.909 --> 01:31:52.910

question is what happens when you have

01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:09.140
question is what happens when you have
 

01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:11.720

which you have worked there with them
 

01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:15.620
which you have worked there with them
and it's interesting that we need to

01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:15.630
and it's interesting that we need to
 

01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:17.810
and it's interesting that we need to
then take into account not just climate

01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820
then take into account not just climate
 

01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.520
then take into account not just climate
that is changing but also the growth

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:19.530
that is changing but also the growth
 

01:56:19.530 --> 01:56:22.160

Manila projecting out you have increased
 

01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:26.810
Manila projecting out you have increased
water demand plus the increased

01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:26.820
water demand plus the increased
 

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.670
water demand plus the increased
frequency of dry spells which is which

01:56:28.670 --> 01:56:28.680
frequency of dry spells which is which
 

01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:30.920
frequency of dry spells which is which
is most likely going to happen will lead

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:30.930
is most likely going to happen will lead
 

01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:32.480
is most likely going to happen will lead
to declines and water availability and

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:32.490
to declines and water availability and
 

01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:35.210

in about normal will result in flooding

01:56:36.710 --> 01:56:36.720
in about normal will result in flooding
 

01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.150
in about normal will result in flooding
so they're going to get both some years

01:56:38.150 --> 01:56:38.160
so they're going to get both some years
 

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:39.710
so they're going to get both some years
are going to get drought somebody's

01:56:39.710 --> 01:56:39.720
are going to get drought somebody's
 

01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.840
are going to get drought somebody's
going to get flooding and again the same

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:41.850
going to get flooding and again the same
 

01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:43.310

groundwater recharge hence can lead to

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:46.950
groundwater recharge hence can lead to
 

01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:49.730
groundwater recharge hence can lead to
flooding but the key is even if you

01:56:49.730 --> 01:56:49.740
flooding but the key is even if you
 

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:52.850
flooding but the key is even if you
model hunger and even to run hunger in

01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860
model hunger and even to run hunger in
 

01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:55.160
model hunger and even to run hunger in
the best possible way that science

01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:55.170
the best possible way that science
 

01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:58.280
the best possible way that science
demands hunger can only supply water

01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:58.290
demands hunger can only supply water
 

01:56:58.290 --> 01:57:00.530
demands hunger can only supply water
there is a supply threshold by around 20

01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540
there is a supply threshold by around 20
 

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:04.940
there is a supply threshold by around 20
20 so then even if you have anger run in

01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:04.950
20 so then even if you have anger run in
 

01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:06.290
20 so then even if you have anger run in
the best way you will not have enough

01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:06.300
the best way you will not have enough
 

01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:08.270
the best way you will not have enough
water for all of the multiple uses so

01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280
water for all of the multiple uses so
 

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:10.040
water for all of the multiple uses so
it's actually right now that you need to

it's actually right now that you need to
 

01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:12.110
it's actually right now that you need to

that's two generations out and the focus
is really on the current generation so

01:58:14.879 --> 01:58:14.889
is really on the current generation so

to explore which we have done in our

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:35.770
to explore which we have done in our

to explore which we have done in our
work and as the previous speaker is

01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320
work and as the previous speaker is
 

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.180
work and as the previous speaker is
saying we need to deal with

01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:39.190
saying we need to deal with
 

01:58:39.190 --> 01:58:40.979

probabilities there is no such thing as

01:58:40.979 --> 01:58:40.989
probabilities there is no such thing as
 

01:58:40.989 --> 01:58:43.320
probabilities there is no such thing as
a certainty that this will happen this

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:43.330
a certainty that this will happen this
 

01:58:43.330 --> 01:58:45.000
a certainty that this will happen this
year this will not happen it's all the

year this will not happen it's all the
 

01:58:45.010 --> 01:58:48.540
year this will not happen it's all the
probabilities and hence really key is to

01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:48.550
probabilities and hence really key is to
 

01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:50.100
probabilities and hence really key is to
focus on the intra and inter

to these things can we imagine as a

02:10:25.890 --> 02:10:25.900
to these things can we imagine as a
 

02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:29.190
to these things can we imagine as a
disaster on the scale of yeah what

02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:29.200

this is a picture I took in the summer
 

02:10:35.380 --> 02:10:38.880
this is a picture I took in the summer
of a of a village in Sierra Leone which

of a of a village in Sierra Leone which
 

02:10:38.890 --> 02:10:41.880
of a of a village in Sierra Leone which
is on a mining concession and and you

02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:41.890
is on a mining concession and and you
 

02:10:41.890 --> 02:10:46.560
is on a mining concession and and you
know as the mining company has expanded

lived there for many generations into an
area which is extremely vulnerable I

02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:53.800
area which is extremely vulnerable I
 

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.260
area which is extremely vulnerable I
mean they're moving them into an area

02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:55.270

the State Department whether we feel
that we can tolerate that that's that's

that we can tolerate that that's that's
 

02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:30.160
that we can tolerate that that's that's
acceptable that's an acceptable level of

robust global economy or whether we're

robust global economy or whether we're
going to do you know try to do things to

02:20:38.170 --> 02:20:38.180
going to do you know try to do things to
 

02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:40.780
going to do you know try to do things to
reduce that and I think that that that's

02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:40.790
reduce that and I think that that that's
 

02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:43.330
reduce that and I think that that that's
we have gridlock in most of the capitals

in these global
 

02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:53.011
in these global
processes I think there's a huge sort of

02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:53.021
processes I think there's a huge sort of
 

02:20:53.021 --> 02:20:54.990

unexplored opportunity for cities to

unexplored opportunity for cities to
 

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.661

02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.840
 
okay and one last question is there

02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:31.850
okay and one last question is there
 

02:23:31.850 --> 02:23:35.590
okay and one last question is there
another another one okay well I'll just

02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600
another another one okay well I'll just
 

02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:37.650
another another one okay well I'll just
dis summarize those so that's either

02:23:37.650 --> 02:23:37.660
dis summarize those so that's either
 

02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:42.780
dis summarize those so that's either

02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:57.650
within cities so if I just ask the panel
 

02:23:57.650 --> 02:24:01.150
within cities so if I just ask the panel
just starting starting with you yeah

02:24:01.150 --> 02:24:01.160
just starting starting with you yeah
 

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:04.810
just starting starting with you yeah
yeah I've been thinking about that it's

02:24:04.810 --> 02:24:04.820
yeah I've been thinking about that it's
 

02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:07.030
yeah I've been thinking about that it's
a going around a lot they call it the

a going around a lot they call it the

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:10.490
spiral of risk I you you protect
 

02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:12.640
spiral of risk I you you protect
yourself better so you invest more

02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:12.650
yourself better so you invest more

potential damage grows and the risk
would increase mathematically that is

02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000

when you when you how do you call that
unwrap the reasoning I I could sort of

02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:37.910
unwrap the reasoning I I could sort of
 

02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:41.620
unwrap the reasoning I I could sort of
say to you like why are you trying to

02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:41.630
say to you like why are you trying to
 

02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:46.000
say to you like why are you trying to
get ah you're probably like a bigger

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:46.010
get ah you're probably like a bigger
 

02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:48.040
get ah you're probably like a bigger
room and then a house and then you buy a

02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:48.050
room and then a house and then you buy a
 

02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:49.900

house and it may be a bigger house and

02:24:49.900 --> 02:24:49.910
house and it may be a bigger house and
 

02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:54.670

then a nicer car and and base and I can

02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680
then a nicer car and and base and I can
 

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:56.080
then a nicer car and and base and I can
say well but then you become more

02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:56.090
say well but then you become more
 

02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:58.150
say well but then you become more
vulnerable because you can lose all that

02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160
vulnerable because you can lose all that
 

02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:00.040

what are you doing why are you doing

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:00.050
what are you doing why are you doing
 

02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:02.470
what are you doing why are you doing
that and maybe you do think that that is

02:25:02.470 --> 02:25:02.480
that and maybe you do think that that is
 

02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:03.820
that and maybe you do think that that is
actually your honor maybe you don't do

02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:03.830
actually your honor maybe you don't do
 

02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:05.920
actually your honor maybe you don't do
all that but I do I like you know I

02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:05.930
all that but I do I like you know I
 

02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:09.700
all that but I do I like you know I
honestly I like you know to live well so

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:09.710
honestly I like you know to live well so
 

02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:10.930
honestly I like you know to live well so
don't you think that that's actually

02:25:10.930 --> 02:25:10.940
don't you think that that's actually
 

02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:14.530
don't you think that that's actually

this issue that you're addressing so my
 

02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:16.210
this issue that you're addressing so my
response to that is we're caught in
