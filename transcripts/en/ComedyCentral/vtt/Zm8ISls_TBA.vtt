00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:03.169
Now, of all the feuds
Trump has going,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:05.505
my favorite is his beef
with rapper Mac Miller.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.874
Now, Mac made a song called
"Donald Trump" in 2011.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:11.310
<i> Trump initially...
 he initially lauded the song.</i>

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.813
The "Donald Trump" song
just hit over 20 million.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:16.249
That's not so bad.
I'm very proud of that.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.784
This kid is the new Eminem.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.455
Is he doing an impression
of himself there?

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.123
Okay, so, however,
the song went platinum

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:26.125
and then Trump
threatened to sue Miller

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.795
for royalties
for use of his name.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.897
So in turn, Mac Miller
denounced Trump,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.331
telling his Twitter followers

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.467
"Just please don't
elect this (bleep) man."

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.369
All right?
This is true.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.739
This is all true, right?
It's great. Okay. So...

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.908
Now, on one hand,

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.311
this is just Trump being Trump.
But on the other hand,

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.246
Mac Miller is here,
and he's pissed.

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.282
So please welcome
multiplatinum-selling rapper

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.817
and noted
Trump feud participant

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.318
Mac Miller, everybody!

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.287
-♪ ♪
-(cheering, whooping, applause)

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:07.600
Thank you, Larry.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.036
I only have one thing to say.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.006
I (bleep) hate you,
Donald Trump.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.013
So you wanted to sue me,
but then you realized

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.683
you can't sue somebody
just for being super talented

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:27.019
and incredibly good-looking.
You-you say

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.688
you want
to make America great again,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.690
but we all know
what that really means.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.359
You know, ban Muslims,
Mexicans are rapists,

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:36.162
black lives don't matter.
Make America great again?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:39.365
I think you want
to make America white again.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:42.568
So I come here today,
as a white man,

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.704
with the hope
that maybe you'll listen to me.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.640
In other words,
let me white-splain this to you,

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:48.975
you racist son of a bitch.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.944
(cheering and applause)

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.217
You see, you're lowering the bar
for our nation's intelligence.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.353
Your only goal
is to stay in the spotlight,

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.421
no matter how much
it fuels the fire of hate groups

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.423
that you apparently know nothing
about,

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:07.760
like, uh, the KKK and neo-Nazis.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.229
You have people at your rallies
who openly assault

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:13.766
black teenage girls
because, hey, that's American.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.837
The messed up thing is I don't
even really know if you're evil.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.873
I think you're just such an
egomaniacal, attention-thirsty,

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:23.142
psychopathic, power-hungry,
delusional waste

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:27.613
of skin and bones that you'll...
that you'll...

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:31.284
that you'll do, say,
or allow anything

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:34.754
if it means you'll just get one
more minute in the limelight.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.090
The thing is, it says more
about us as a country.

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:40.092
I guess we're finally showing
our true colors.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.495
Not only are we letting
this (bleep) slide--

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:45.031
we're (bleep) supporting you.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.166
And if we're stupid enough
to elect you,

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.502
I know exactly
what everyone's gonna say.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.305
"I'm moving to Canada. I don't
want to live in a country

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.973
"where Donald Trump
is president.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.508
I'm getting out of here."

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.510
You know what I'm-a do
if you get elected?

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:00.646
I'm staying right
the (bleep) here. That's right.

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.615
(cheering and applause)

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.624
♪ I'm not going anywhere ♪

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:14.894
I'm-a be here every day telling
the world how much I hate you,

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:18.231
how much of a clown you are, and
how we as a nation are better

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:21.067
than you will ever be
as a racist (bleep) of a human.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.603
Because I love America,
and I'm never giving it up

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.702
to a troll like you, you bitch!
