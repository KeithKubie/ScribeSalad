Hey, Dan. want to see our weather app, so far, that we've been building?

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.400
&gt;&gt; Pretty cool. But I want something more.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.250
&gt;&gt; Well, we're not done yet. We just started

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.090
two lessons ago. Give us a break. But fair

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.750
enough, there's still a bunch more work left to

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.780
do. What do you think we should do next?

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.130
&gt;&gt; Well for starters, let's make the list

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.300
item do something when you click on it.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.952
&gt;&gt; Well, since you seem to be the expert on clicking on

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:30.130
list items, why don't you do it? I'm going to go eat some jellybeans.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.659
&gt;&gt; I think Catherine was mocking me there.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.910
Speaking of mocks, let's go do some UI.
