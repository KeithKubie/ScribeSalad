Congratulations.

00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:04.610
I hope you gain a stronger understanding of working with fractions. More

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:08.665
importantly, I hope you have learned why and how we add, subtract, multiply and

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:12.590
divide fractions. Try your hand at solving some problems with fractions. And,

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:16.135
treat yourself to some chocolate when you're done. You've worked hard.
