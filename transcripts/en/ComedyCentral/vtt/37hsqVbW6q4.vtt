YOUR HOST, LARRY, LARRY, LARRY,

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:24.357 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
BEFORE WE GET GOING, LAST NIGHT

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.925 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS THE SUPER BOWL,
CONGRATULATIONS PATIOTS

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GLAD YOU WON. AND I'M A
SEAHAWKS FAN.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.295 align:start position:0% line:91%
I REALLY SLAMMED THE PATS ON
THURSDAY'S SHOW.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:36.202 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, I HIT YOUR TEAM LIKE THE
WICKED HAHD.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.671 size:84% position:42% line:85%
AND THEN I PUT THIS ONLINE.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:43.209 line:91%
IF THE PATRIOTS WIN, I WILL EAT
A BOWL OF, WHATEVER YOU CALL IT,

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:49.715 size:78% position:39% line:85%
NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER.

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:53.986 align:start position:0% line:85%
THERE YOU GO.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:54.553 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEP.

00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:57.723 size:75% position:38% line:85%
SO I'M A MAN OF MY WORD.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.926 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'VE GOT A BIG BOWL OF
NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.463 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD,
ACTUALLY.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.430 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SHOULD I GET SOME CRACKERS?

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:18.111 align:start position:0% line:85%
NAH, I'LL JUST EAT IT.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:18.445 align:start position:0% line:85%
MMM!

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.446 align:start position:0% line:85%
VERY GOOD!

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.215 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S NOT "CHEATING," PATRIOTS
FANS.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.950 line:91%
I JUST DEFLATED THE SIZE OF THE
BOWL SO IT'S EASIER TO GRIP.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:28.354 align:start position:0% line:85%
BAM!

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:38.397 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HORRIBLE! WICKED HAHD

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HORRIBLE! WICKED HAHD

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.845 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN THE
GAME WAS THE COMMERCIALS.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:55.014 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I COULDN'T GROW UP 'CUZ I
DIED FROM AN ACCIDENT.

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:55.848 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: JESUS!

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.350 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WANTED TO WATCH A FOOTBALL
GAME.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:03.456 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD TO PREPARE A
EULOGY FOR A CHILD.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.191 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I WAS ALREADY FEELING CRAPPY
ENOUGH FROM EATING MY FAMOUS

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEVEN-LAYER CORN-TITO DOUBLE-DIP

CREAM-STUFFED CRUST PANINI.

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.165 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRADEMARK!

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.233 line:85%
DON'T ACT LIKE IT WAS JUST ME.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:17.170 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU GUYS HAD YOUR BUTTON POPPED
BY HALFTIME.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.273 line:91%
ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, AMERICANS
CONSUMED ROUGHLY 1.25 BILLION

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:24.443 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHICKEN WINGS,
11.2 MILLION-POUND OF POTATO

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:30.650 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHIPS, AND 49.2 MILLION CASES OF
BEER.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.485 size:81% position:41% line:85%
SUCK ON THAT, THIRD WORLD!

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:33.186 align:start position:0% line:85%
U.S.A.!

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.690 align:start position:0% line:85%
U.S.A.!

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:46.299 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE CHANTING)
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE TIME TO

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:46.766 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHANT.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.068 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.336 align:start position:0% line:91%
AMERICA, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR
AN INTERVENTION.

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.672 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU FAT.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.441 line:91%
SERIOUSLY, GALLUP JUST RELEASED
THE OBESITY STATS FOR 2014, AND

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.977 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THE NUMBERS SPIKED TO 27.7%.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEARLY A THIRD OF OUR COUNTRY IS
OBESE.

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:09.322 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A
JOKE ABOUT THAT.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.890 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THE LAST THING WE SHOULD BE
DOING IS MAKING FUN OF FAT

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:12.558 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW IN THIS TIME OF
OBVIOUS CRISIS.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.027 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I CONDEMN ANYONE OUT THERE
MAKING CHEAP FAT JOKES.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.163 align:start position:0% line:91%
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET AT
MICHAEL MOORE FOR THROWING SHADE

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:20.299 line:91%
AT SNIPERS, BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS,
HE THROWS SHADE ON EVERYTHING IN

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:24.971 align:start position:0% line:85%
HIS IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:28.941 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M SORRY.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:31.277 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT EVERYONE CAN MAKE A MISTAKE
ONCE.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.913 align:start position:0% line:91%
"TOP GUN" TAUGHT US THAT WE NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS,

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:39.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE SOME OUR SOLDIERS AGE
WELL AND SOME DON'T.

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.721 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
LOOKS LIKE THE ICE MAN BECAME

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.956 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE ICE CREAM MAN.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:44.991 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.326 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.695 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN LIGHT OF THIS NEW
INFORMATION, I JUST NOW RELEASED

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:50.863 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS STATEMENT.

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:54.667 align:start position:0% line:91%
I AM TERRIBLY ASHAMED OF MY
COMMENTS.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.369 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY WERE MADE IN A MOMENT OF
WEAKNESS UPON SEEING VAL

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.671 align:start position:0% line:85%
KILMER'S FACE.

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.373 size:78% position:39% line:85%
HE REALLY LET HIMSELF GO.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.442 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THAT IS NO EXCUSE FOR MAKING
FUN OF HIM.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:06.512 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I MAKE NO APOLOGIZE FOR MY
STATEMENTS REGARDING MICHAEL

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:07.480 size:75% position:38% line:85%
MOORE'S SHADOW, HOWEVER.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:11.050 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:15.855 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
OBESITY IS CLEARLY A PROBLEM

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:21.661 align:start position:0% line:91%
HERE IN THE U.S., BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE REST OF THE WORLD?

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.096 line:91%
&gt;&gt; EUROPE'S HIGHEST COURT HAS
RULED THAT OBESITY CAN CAN, IN

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.832 align:start position:0% line:91%
CERTAIN CASES, BE CONSIDERED A
DISABILITY.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.367 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MY EYEBROWS ARE UP HERE.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.172 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: CALM DOWN, BRITISH
DON LEMON.

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:35.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, SO SO OBESITY IS A
DISABILITY IN EUROPE.

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:36.309 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT SO IS WORKING.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:36.876 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND BATHING.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.013 align:start position:0% line:85%
BOOM!

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.214 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M SORRY!

00:04:42.247 --> 00:04:43.616 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M SORRY!

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.218 align:start position:0% line:91%
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
THAT.

00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:49.155 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.256 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
I HAVE JUST RELEASED AN APOLOGY
TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE.

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:52.958 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO THE
BRITISH PEOPLE.

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.226 line:85%
THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.494 line:91%
I STILL MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR MY
STATEMENTS ABOUT MICHAEL MOORE'S

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:56.094 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHADOW, HOWEVER.

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:58.531 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THAT'S STILL JUST SCIENCE.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:04.737 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
SO, IN EUROPE, OBESITY HAS BEEN

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.739 size:84% position:42% line:85%
CLASSIFIED AS A DISABILITY.

00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:09.608 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S NOT HOW WE PLAY IN
AMERICA.

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:13.045 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE HOSPITAL'S INSTITUTING A
HIRING POLICY THAT EXCLUDES

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:15.381 align:start position:0% line:85%
OVERWEIGHT CANDIDATES.

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:18.851 align:start position:0% line:91%
OVERWEIGHT PILOTS WITH A BMI OF
AT LEAST 40 OR WITH A NECK

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:22.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S AT LEAST 17 INCHES MUST
BE EVALUATED.

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.623 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WAITRESSES CAN BE FIRED FOR
GAINING MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:25.991 align:start position:0% line:85%
ORIGINAL BODY WEIGHT.

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:28.427 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OVERWEIGHT WOMEN EARN SMALLER
PAYCHECKS THAN AVERAGE SIZE

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.528 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOMEN.

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:30.296 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:37.203 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.205 align:start position:0% line:91%
YO MOMMA'S SO FAT -- OKAY, YO
MOMMA'S SO FAT, SHE SUFFERS FROM

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.107 align:start position:0% line:91%
SYSTEMIC BIAS IN A JOB MARKET
THAT MARGINALIZES HER JUST BASED

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.108 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON HER APPEARANCE.

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:46.212 align:start position:0% line:85%
OHHHHHH!

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:49.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
AND IT DOESN'T END THERE.

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.484 line:91%
IN MOST OF THE COUNTRY, YOU CAN
STILL FIRE SOMEONE FOR BEING

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.652 align:start position:0% line:85%
OBESE.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.220 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED,
YOU'RE LIKELY TO GAIN MORE

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:57.857 align:start position:0% line:91%
WEIGHT, MAKING IT HARDER TO FIND
A JOB.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.626 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S A VICIOUS SOUL CYCLE OF
INJUSTICE.

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.194 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO IF WE'RE ACTIVELY
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OBESE

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:04.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE, IT BRINGS UP THE
QUESTION:  SHOULD OBESITY BE

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.166 line:85%
TREATED AS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE?

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.268 align:start position:0% line:85%
I GET IT.

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S TOUGH BEING OVERWEIGHT IN
TODAY'S SOCIETY.

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.674 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
MAGAZINES, TELEVISION AND
MOVIES ARE FULL OF IMAGES OF A

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:17.576 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIN PERSON HAVING GOOD STUFF
HAPPEN TO THEM.

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:19.545 line:91%
EVEN IF YOU GO TO CHURCH, YOU
SEE A P90X VERSION OF JESUS ON

00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:23.849 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE CROSS.

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:27.086 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:31.557 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
TALK ABOUT CROSS-FIT.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.060 align:start position:0% line:85%
AM I RIGHT?

00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:37.029 line:85%
AM I RIGHT, CHRISTIAN LADIES?

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:38.130 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:41.734 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'D LIKE TO ISSUE AN APOLOGY TO
MY CHRISTIAN LADIES.

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:44.503 align:start position:0% line:91%
MY MOCKERY OF JESUS, THOUGH
ACCURATE, WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

00:06:44.536 --> 00:06:54.113 align:start position:0% line:91%
UNLIKE THE MICHAEL MOORE BLAH
BLAH BLAH, ET AL.

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:57.783 size:88% position:44% line:91%
MY POINT IS, IF JESUS LOOKED
LIKE THIS, MORE GALIFIANAKIS

00:06:57.816 --> 00:07:02.121 line:91%
THAN CAVIEZEL, MAYBE WE WOULDN'T
HEAR PEOPLE -- IN THIS CASE, A

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:03.856 line:91%
POLITICIAN -- FINDING THIS AS
THE CAUSE OF ERIC GARNER'S

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.825 align:start position:0% line:85%
DEATH.

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:09.795 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD A 350-POUND PERSON
WHO WAS RESISTING ARREST.

00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:12.631 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF HE HAD NOT HAD ASTHMA AND A
HEART CONDITION AND WAS SO

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:15.234 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBESE, ALMOST DEFINITELY HE
WOULD NOT HAVE DIED.

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:19.238 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW.

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:23.042 align:start position:0% line:91%
(BOOING)
LOOK, I'M NOT SURE IF OBESITY IS

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.577 line:91%
