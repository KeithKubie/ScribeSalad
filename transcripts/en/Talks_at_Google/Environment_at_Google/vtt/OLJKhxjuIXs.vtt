SPEAKER 1: Jose Ocano, who
is the Pacific Regional

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.840
Director of Best
Friends Animal Society

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.210
and also oversees the NKLA
initiative by Best Friends.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.430
So without further ado, Jose?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.930
JOSE OCANO: Hi, everybody.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.080
Get my clicker.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.290
So my name's Jose.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.320
I just moved here in May.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.350
So I'm brand new to all of
these traffic and parking

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.710
situation in LA, from Tucson.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.140
And so a little
bit about my story

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.707
is I grew up in Tucson, Arizona.

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:39.040
So first of all, you're welcome.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.210
That's me as a child and my dog.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.970
And I literally
grew up, literally,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.650
on the wrong side of the tracks.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.330
That's my house.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.770
And you know, it was actually a
really tough place to grow up.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.290
And my mom was acutely
aware of the environment.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.080
And so she was
really adamant that I

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.379
had the least amount of
exposure to really bad stuff.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.110
And the way she
kept me occupied was

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.120
by allowing me to have
whatever animal I wanted.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.020
So I had dogs and
chickens and goats

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.780
and a peacock at one point.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.380
And I learned a whole lot
about just responsibility

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.060
and connecting
with these animals.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.420
And you know, I never
actually understood

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.500
what that would mean in
the big picture of my life

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.030
until something really sudden
happened-- when I was 16

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.560
and my dad passed away.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.360
It was quite sudden.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.680
And I think when something
like that happens,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.390
you just naturally start to
question your own mortality.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.690
And you start to
question why am I here?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.060
And one of the things that
I started to think about

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.070
is all of the people
that did grow up

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.840
in the neighborhood
that were my age,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.673
the people who I either
went to school with,

00:01:54.673 --> 00:01:56.530
the neighbors, the
neighborhood kids.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.154
And I just started
realizing that there

00:01:58.154 --> 00:02:04.460
was a trend of like drugs, in
jail, or dead, some of them.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.470
And I just was unsure why
that didn't happen for me.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.050
And I remembered
the following day

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.350
I was going through pictures
for this collage in preparation

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.430
for the funeral.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.370
And I actually
found that picture.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.020
And I realized the difference
was that I had this dog.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.880
And I realized, I
connected the dots,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.820
that animals had saved my life.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.280
And I made this kind
of promise to myself

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.360
that I would spend the rest
of my life dedicated to saving

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.010
as many animals as possible.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.300
And so I finished
high school early.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.880
And I thought I wanted to
be a veterinarian until I

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.710
took O Chem and realized
that's not going to happen.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.230
You're not smart
enough for that.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.510
And so I thought,
OK, well, I still

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.380
want to work with animals
in a shelter possibly.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.000
So I went to a vet tech school.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.150
And I found myself working
in a small practice.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.780
And I was really
bored, honestly.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.850
And so one day I got this
task that no one ever wanted.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.685
I actually jumped at
the opportunity for it.

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:10.790
We had to go to the local pound
to drop off some paperwork,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.040
some licenses.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.080
And so I was, like,
please send me,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.560
because I can't handle one
more of these boring exams.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.400
So I went to the
local animal shelter.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.400
And I remember growing
up, going there as a kid.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.420
And it was just--

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.370
it really was a pound.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.760
So I walk in, and it's dark,
and it smells, and it's loud,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.380
and it's kind of depressing.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.600
And I thought, I
should work here.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.280
So I don't know what
that says about me,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.490
but I really just thought
this would be a great idea.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.890
And I applied for a job there.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.470
And like any government
job, it took six months

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.450
to just even get an interview.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.550
I thought, I have already
let go of that dream.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.430
And so I got the job.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.930
And it was--

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.840
I think it actually--

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.870
there it is.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.210
That was actually my first
week working at the shelter.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.760
So I remember walking
in and thinking,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.650
like, I'm here to save animals.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.820
That's the whole reason.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.700
I'm going to get to save
so many animals working

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.110
at this shelter.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.329
And the supervisor's
interviewing me,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.370
just asking me questions.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.070
I already had gotten
the job, onboarding me.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.800
And then she started asking
me a really interesting line

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.060
of questioning.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.950
And the first one is--

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.950
so have you given
injections before?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.550
And I thought, yeah, as a vet
tech, I do that all the time.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.900
And so she's like how do you
feel about restraining animals?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.480
And I was, like, I'm
comfortable restraining animals.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.130
That's something
I do all the time.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.610
So she says, OK, stop.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.290
Come with me to the
back real quick.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.890
And I thought she was just going
to give me a tour or something.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.120
And she takes me to this
room in the very back,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.610
and there's a line
of dogs there.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.520
And she drops this giant
black toolbox on the table.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.310
And then she opens it,
and I see what clearly

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.090
is like euthanasia solution.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.860
It's blue-- like, all of us who
work in this industry call it.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.070
It's very distinctive.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.170
You know exactly what
you're looking at.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.700
And I looked at her
really confused.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.910
And I'm, like, well,
I'm not a doctor.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.460
Because I came from a practice
where only doctors were

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.300
allowed to do that.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.120
And so she was, like, no, no.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.580
This is going to be your job.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.310
And I need you to do
all those animals,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.660
and you have 10 minutes.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.530
And I thought, OK, well,
let me try and understand

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.830
why this is something that
they're thinking needs

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.370
to happen.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.890
And so I asked simple questions.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.240
Why is this happening?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.210
What's wrong with these animals?

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.430
And so she just
starts to say, well,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.490
that one sneezed, and they were
all kind of in the same row.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.730
And we got 100
dogs in yesterday.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.120
And there's no room for them.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.510
And so this is your job.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.420
If you can't do it, then
don't waste our time.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.020
And I realized, at that time,
they lose so many people

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.080
that they really did not want
to invest any time in any one

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.410
unless they could do this.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.240
And I quickly realized, oh,
this is what this job is.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.990
It's actually not
about saving animals.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.420
So she kind of said, if you
can't do this, just leave.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.920
And she walked out.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.000
So I'm just looking at these
dogs for the first few minutes.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.780
And just-- my heart
beating so fast.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.760
And I called my grandmother.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.302
And I tell her what
they're asking me to do.

00:06:37.302 --> 00:06:39.760
And she said something to me
that's carried through with me

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.380
my entire career.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.790
And she said, you
have two choices.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.950
You can leave, and that's OK.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.710
You don't have to do this.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.830
But someone has
to stay some day.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.680
If you really believe that
you can change something,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.740
then you're going to have
to work in a broken system.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.910
And you're going have to
do what they ask you to do.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.580
And I got off the phone.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.200
And at first, I
was going to leave.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.180
But then I really thought
about the fact of--

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.532
I want to help animals.

00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:11.240
This is where they're
coming in, and this

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.110
is where they're dying.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.470
I'm going to have to work
in this broken system.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.610
And so I did what they asked
me to do for many, many years.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.770
And so I worked as what I
thought was a kennel tech.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.450
It actually turned out the real
position, the working title,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.250
was Euthanasia Technician.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.460
But they don't
post that online--

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.850
shocker.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.820
And I was a part of that
for many, many years.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.060
But I always believed that
we could change things.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.290
And so I slowly
got to know people.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.340
And little by little, I started
trying to make gradual changes.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.830
And I worked my way
up within the shelter,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.250
always believing that I
could change something

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.610
that we could change something
because what we were doing

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.740
was not OK.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.530
And I mean I did a lot of--

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.920
I broke a lot of protocols for
the sake of saving animals.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.210
We had what we called the
Underground Railroad of rescue.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.580
So what I learned
is that they had

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.030
three shifts for euthanasia--
the morning, and afternoon,

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.260
and at night.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.450
And I realized that
the night shift--

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.880
usually that was where
the most amount of animals

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.560
were to be euthanized, but
all the supervisors were gone.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.790
Everyone was gone, actually.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.520
It was just the two closing
euthanasia technicians who

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.410
were there to do everything.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.789
So we would-- because we were
really smart about this, too.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.409
So we would pull the
euthanasia solution.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.929
We'd pour it down the drain.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.690
So you could see, if
they did drug inventory,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.840
this is really bad,
against so many FDA things.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.270
But you do what you got
to do to save animals.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.420
And out the door, they'd
go to a reputable rescue.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.240
And we had this whole
system of how we were

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.800
saving hundreds of animals.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.060
And I just thought we really
shouldn't have to save animals

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.561
in the dead of night.

00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:01.310
That's ridiculous.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.920
But we did what we had to do.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.540
And over time, through being
in new positions-- and so then,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.550
when I became the
rescue coordinator,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.700
I was able to implement
protocols and practices

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.260
so that animals
had a shot at life.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.890
And I remember in the
beginning, it was very much so--

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.487
you have two hours to
get this animal out.

00:09:21.487 --> 00:09:23.570
That's intense, especially
when they're giving you

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.880
a list of 100 animals that my
job is to get out in two hours.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.670
But I was happy just
the chance to have it.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.370
And then two hours
became two days.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.710
And two days became a week.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.260
And then, I eventually
convinced the medical team,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.430
you could treat these
animals, and if you prescribe

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.500
the medication, I will give it.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.010
I will make that part of my job.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.310
I will find time to do that.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.360
And little by little, we
really started to change that.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.970
And it began this total shift.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.760
So actually, that is a picture
of the pound where I worked at,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.800
and that's what
it looks like now.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.920
And it just is kind
of this representation

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.360
of how far we came.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.280
You know, when I
started there, we

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.070
were a shelter that
took in 30,000 animals.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.670
And the vast majority
would come in the door

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.730
and out through a cooler
and end up at the dump.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.300
And now it's a place
where less animals come in

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.010
because of spay-neuter.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.340
Because we changed
the idea that people

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.789
actually want to help animals.

00:10:30.789 --> 00:10:33.330
They don't actually want to turn
their animal into a shelter.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.780
So how do we become
supportive of that, as opposed

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.670
to just judging them?

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.900
And so through all
those different things,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.920
intake went from
30,000 to 17,000,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.860
and now the shelter
is saving 90% of them.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.080
So it's really cool.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.280
And some of the things that
happened throughout those times

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.120
is we had this bond
where we basically

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.830
said we want a new shelter.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.780
And it was for $22.5 million.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.235
And I don't think any
of us ever thought

00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:03.860
this would actually
pass, because there

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.430
were so many things up for
bond election that year.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.510
And everything failed
except the animal shelter.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.280
And I actually--
because I was there

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.730
in the implementation
of going for the bond,

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.241
but I left for
this job right when

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:20.990
they were breaking
ground and building it.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.448
And I actually just saw it for
the first time two days ago.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:24.860
I just got back from Tucson.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.560
And it's this beautiful
building that's

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.800
built around life-saving--
and how far we've come.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.560
And this is just kind of
an indication of where

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.530
we are, actually, as a country.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.730
There is a shift now happening
where animals aren't just

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.810
a lawn ornament.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.140
They're just not a commodity.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.777
There these sentient beings that
are part of life, our lives.

00:11:46.777 --> 00:11:48.110
To the point where even people--

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.677
I know lots of people who don't
own an animal because they just

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:54.260
don't feel like they could give
that animal the time that they

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.155
need-- that shows that even the
thoughtfulness of them bringing

00:11:57.155 --> 00:11:59.660
on an animal into their life.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.750
So things were
going really great

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.740
at [INAUDIBLE] Animal Care
Center this time last year.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.570
And I was talking
to Jeff earlier,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.140
because we have a common
friend in a woman named Candy.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.910
And so Candy works
for Best Friends.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.160
And I met her at a
conference when I was

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.840
speaking at it in Las Vegas.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.730
And so she was in town, because
her mom lives in Tucson.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.040
And she's, like,
let's go for a drink.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.210
And I thought, fun.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.880
Of course, I will
always say yes to that.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.370
And we go-- and through
this conversation,

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.930
she's, like, have
you ever thought

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.221
about working for Best Friends?

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:38.060
And I was, like, no, I'm
so dedicated to my team.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.890
And I think part of
the reason for that

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:45.190
is when you're bonded by a lot
of sadness, a lot of us who

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.940
worked there, worked
there in the trenches

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.170
during the hardest time.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.970
And we kind of
brought it up together

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.770
and changed the
shelter together.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.780
You feel this deep sense of--

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.690
I can't lead this team ever.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.860
And so it was not
even an option,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.310
but I said I'd be open to it.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.350
And she took that
and ran with it.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.710
And before you knew it,
I was in conversations

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.690
about a regional
director position.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.130
I had no idea where it would be.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.570
I had no idea that it was
going to be in LA or anything.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.660
And for months and months,
we kind of talked about it.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.200
And I was just so
unsure what to do.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.700
Do I stay and help the
community oversee the shelter

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.860
and actually get
to enjoy actually

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.890
working in a lifesaving
shelter that we

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.840
dreamt about for over a decade?

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.540
Or do I go to Best Friends,
this organization that

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.570
has been around
for 34 years, built

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.290
around kindness, compassion?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.970
What's really neat
about Best Friends--

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.480
and I've always been a fan--

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.280
is Best Friends started off
with this group of founders

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.301
to just build the largest
sanctuary in the country.

00:13:46.301 --> 00:13:47.550
That's what they wanted to do.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.758
And that's what they did
initially, because they just

00:13:49.758 --> 00:13:52.490
have a firm belief that
no animal should die

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.380
because it doesn't have a home.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.440
And so they started the
sanctuary, which still exists.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.560
It's in Kanab, Utah.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.350
And it's still the
largest sanctuary.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.030
I think there's
over 2,000 animals.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.340
It's in the most
beautiful place,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.070
and so much life
saving happens there.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.100
But over time, Best
Friends started

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.320
to have regional cities
and regional programs.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.410
So we have programs here in LA.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.840
We have programs in
Salt Lake and in Kanab.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.000
And in New York City,
we have one in Soho.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.770
One in Atlanta--
and we're always

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:26.060
looking at where can we have
strategic presence in order

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.920
to save animals' lives.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.870
And so there's all
these incredible things

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.800
that I just love
about Best Friends.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.100
And so it was really, really
hard to figure out what to do.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.890
I'm here.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.240
And I think one night
I was thinking about--

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.710
how am I going to
make this decision.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.340
And I started to think
about this number.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.760
This is how many
animals, to this day,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.620
die every single
day in shelters.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.160
4,100 animals, healthy,
treatable animals

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.790
in this country are
dying every day.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.660
And I just realized--

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.700
what would that 16-year-old
kid who realized my purpose is

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.230
to save animals' lives--

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.160
what would he do?

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.790
And that was a no
brainer for me.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.160
It's all about having the
greatest amount of impact.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.850
Because this comes out to
1.5 million animals a year.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.780
And that's progress.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.910
Because when the
founders started,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.730
that number was actually
believed to be 17 million.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.960
So 34 years ago it was
believed to be 17 million.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.240
Now we're at 1.5 million--

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.770
that's still way too many.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.560
And the thing that's so
crazy, when I talk to people,

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.742
they have no idea this
is still happening.

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:43.950
And we'll talk a little bit
about Southern California

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:44.449
later.

00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:46.260
But in Southern
California, it's happening

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
in all of our backyards,
especially here.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.940
And so I made the
decision to come to LA.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.440
And what's really neat
about where we live is--

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.990
so Best Friends always
had presence here.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.560
Best Friends was
here doing a lot

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.266
of different types
of cultivation--

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:08.640
whether that was just getting
supporters and telling them

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.514
about all the cool things
that were happening

00:16:10.514 --> 00:16:12.430
at the sanctuary in Utah.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.470
And so it's interesting.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.510
When I talked to
Francis Battista, who

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.180
is one of the founders, and
he's the chair of our board,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.860
and you know, he
started with this idea.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.160
And then they were
doing tabletops here

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.390
at different grocery stores.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.270
And now we have these huge
adoption centers here.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:31.790
So it's always cool to see the
founder's reaction to things.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.380
The thing that I think is
so interesting about LA

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:39.330
and why I was so excited about
coming and ultimately selecting

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.260
this program and this region
is because of the NKLA

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:43.800
initiative--

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.790
No-Kill Los Angeles.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.590
So we were here.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.230
We had a really good
understanding of everything

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.040
that was happening in
LA, the amount of animals

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.830
that were dying in the
city shelter system.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.560
So LA, actually the
city of Los Angeles,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.570
has one of the largest shelter
systems in the entire country.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.339
And when the initiative
first started bubbling up,

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:11.700
it was, like, 54,000 animals
were going into that shelter

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.640
a year and about 20,000
of them were dying.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.500
And so their save rate was
in the 50s, the high mid-50%.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.960
And there was a really
unique opportunity

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.329
with the pet adoption and
spay and neuter center.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:28.200
So that actually was going
to be a seventh city shelter,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.490
because there's six of them.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.239
So they built this
shelter with bond dollars.

00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:33.780
And then when the
recession hit, they

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.460
couldn't afford to staff it.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.900
And so it sat vacant.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:42.370
This lifesaving center sat
vacant for quite some time.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.856
And that's when
they put out a bid,

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:47.980
or put out a request to
see who would be interested

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.210
in operating the.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.884
Center so one of
the things that is

00:17:52.884 --> 00:17:54.550
really cool about
Best Friends, and I've

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.670
said this to you earlier,
Best Friends has balls.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.270
They really go for it.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.730
And so they thought, let's
put in for this contract,

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.270
and let's operate a
giant shelter in LA.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.090
Because that's what it is--
it's designed to be a shelter.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.840
And we'll do it in partnership
with the City of LA.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.040
And we'll bring on all
of these key partners,

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.620
and we'll create a coalition.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.540
And we're going to
work in sync together,

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.420
and we're going to collaborate,
and we're going to coalesce.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.040
And we're going to save animals.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.350
And we're going to get
the city shelter system--

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.725
and we're going
to get to a place

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:29.440
where they're
saving 90% of them.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.880
And that 90% is important.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.100
Because you'll hear the
word no-kill a lot--

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:38.410
and so the baseline for no-kill
is that 90% of the animals

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.640
are being saved.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.270
The thing that I'll say about
no-kill and 90% is that--

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.010
one of my good friends,
Arlen, said this.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.330
And it always stuck with me.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.150
90 percent is the
floor, not the ceiling.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.102
It's just that first benchmark.

00:18:52.102 --> 00:18:53.560
Because you have
places like Austin

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.070
who are saving
97.7% of the animals

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.860
that are going into their
large shelter system.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.290
So that was where this
whole coalition came from.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.530
And the idea was that
all of our efforts

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.910
will be to directly pull animals
from the city shelter system.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.580
And so that's what we do at
the Mission Hills location

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.630
in the valley.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.350
So we take in thousands of
animals from the city there.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.140
We rehabilitate them, and
then we adopt them out.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.370
And we do offer
public spay-neuter.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.700
That's now actually
provided by Snip LA,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.400
a local nonprofit in town.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.820
And as that was happening,
there was an idea

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.950
about the NKLA Pet
Adoption Center,

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.810
which is not too far from here.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.900
It's on the West Side, opposite
Sepulveda and Santa Monica.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.110
And what's so interesting
about the adoption center

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.170
is that half the animals
are Best Friends,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.440
and half the animals are
from different groups.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.350
I don't know if any of you
have worked with animal rescue

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.270
or have been involved?

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.310
There's a lot of opinions and
emotions on how to save lives.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.700
And I always say there's
1,001 ways to save animals,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.440
and necessarily, none of
them are necessarily wrong.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.700
But because of that, people
are visceral about how they

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.780
think animals should be saved.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.180
So to get several
dozen organizations,

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.870
rescue groups to all agree
to be in one adoption center

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.270
and agree to the same
adoption application

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.360
and adoption philosophies,
which our adoption philosophies

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.310
are people are good.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.670
People do good.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.570
And so you're not going to
have to qualify yourself

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.280
to get an animal, and give me
your first born and a blood

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:31.780
sample.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.196
Because there are
some places that

00:20:33.196 --> 00:20:35.320
can be really, really intense.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.750
I have a friend who-- they're in
the process of adopting a baby.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.750
And they're, like, it was
harder to get our dog.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.900
[LAUGHS] And I was,
like, I believe it.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.840
And so it took a lot
of coordinated effort

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.757
to get everyone to
be on the same page.

00:20:48.757 --> 00:20:50.590
And that's what the
NKLA Adoption Center is.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.850
So another 5,000
animals get adopted out

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.740
of this adoption center.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.712
And it's really unique, because
what's different about it

00:20:59.712 --> 00:21:00.670
than Mission Hills is--

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.130
Mission Hills was
built to be a shelter.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.670
It was built with all of
those kinds of things in mind.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.680
The NKLA Adoption
Center was built

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.720
around what is the animal's
experience going to be there?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.027
And what is the person's
experience going to be there?

00:21:14.027 --> 00:21:16.360
Because a lot of times-- who
here has been to a shelter?

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.771
Have you guys been?

00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:19.270
Most of the time,
it's overwhelming.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.850
You're on sensory overload.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.220
And when you're on
sensory overload,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.840
you might not be
in the best space

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.540
to adopt an animal,
to find your animal.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.240
And so everything about
this space is about--

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.670
how do we show animals
in the very best light?

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.310
How do we use technology
actually, as well,

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.921
to kind of promote
these animals?

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:39.670
The thing that is great
about Best Friends

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.490
is you'll never see
animals behind bars

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.110
in a kennel with a really sad
song playing in the background.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.994
We always show them out of a
kennel, really good pictures,

00:21:48.994 --> 00:21:50.410
trying to get that
smile off them.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.320
Because that is what people
are going to be drawn to.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.740
So when you walk into the
NKLA Pet Adoption Center,

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.145
it has that feel.

00:21:58.145 --> 00:21:59.020
You want to be there.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.436
When I work there
half the week, I

00:22:00.436 --> 00:22:03.280
love working there, because
it just has such a good vibe.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.530
And you can kind of see
that when people go in--

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.180
they want to be there.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.763
Some people just go
there to hang out.

00:22:07.763 --> 00:22:10.240
And I think that's so
important because animals

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.170
are so intrinsic to our lives.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.700
And so the more we kind of
redesign how we show animals--

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.730
I think it's going to be
really important how we engage

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.650
the people moving forward.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.960
So these are our main
initiatives here in LA,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.600
and we are making huge progress.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.710
So when we started
the whole initiative

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.710
the total save rate--

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.130
it's the measurement
for that 90%--

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.730
for dogs and cats was at 57%.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.220
And last year,
it's closing at 87.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:53.570
That's huge, to get to those
metrics in a five year period

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.950
is really incredible.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.500
And actually, when you
look at dogs versus cats,

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.720
you'll see that
dogs actually are

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.420
exceeding that 90% threshold.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.250
With cats, we have
so much work to do.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.780
And that's because LA is very
different in a lot of ways.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.790
But in LA, there is a
lawsuit against the city

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.232
that doesn't allow them to do
progressive cat programming.

00:23:17.232 --> 00:23:19.190
So for instance, there
is something called TNR.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.900
Have you guys ever
heard of TNR before?

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.990
Trap, neuter, return-- it's
the idea of feral cats.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.270
Everyone is familiar
with what a feral cat is?

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.980
We call them community cats.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.569
So it's just a cat
who lives outdoors.

00:23:30.569 --> 00:23:32.360
And so the best thing
to do with those cats

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.800
is to trap them, spay-neuter
them, vaccinate them.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.480
You cut the tip of
their ear so you

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.760
can see that they've
been part of the program,

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.260
and then you put them back.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.630
Because those cats
are not social,

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.910
so they're not
adoptable, and so they

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.780
die in shelters because of their
behavior and their temperament.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.506
In LA, they're not allowed
to do any of those kinds of--

00:23:53.506 --> 00:23:55.880
they're not allowed to do
those programs for animals that

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.070
enter the city shelter system.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.134
So because of that,
animals aren't

00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:02.300
getting spayed-neutered in
the community at the rate

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:02.960
they need to.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.330
And when those
animals do go into LA,

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.730
it becomes almost a
near death sentence,

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.130
unless you find some other
loophole to get them out,

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.270
which is really, really hard.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.240
So for instance, LA alone
gets 10,000 kittens a year--

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.199
10,000 kittens,
eight weeks or under.

00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:22.490
And when you get those kittens,
especially when they're

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.610
four weeks and under, which
is a huge percentage of them--

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.770
most people also don't
realize that the majority

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.530
of those tiny baby kittens--

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.287
they die.

00:24:31.287 --> 00:24:33.620
Because there's no way to
feed them-- the amount of time

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.684
they need to be fed.

00:24:34.684 --> 00:24:37.100
And the staff doesn't have the
resources to care for them.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.370
So unless a rescue group
or Best Friends pulls them,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.660
they don't have
lifesaving options.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.660
And so because we can't
run the kind of programs

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.420
we need to actually
solve the problem,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.980
the kittens are
just-- every year

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.760
there's more and more kittens,
or the population sustains.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.980
So with dogs, we've
seen dog intake go down,

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.810
and we've seen live
outcomes go up.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.030
And because we haven't been
able to do what we really

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.180
want to do with cats, we
just see them coming in.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.580
And so we have to
basically implement

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.680
programs like nurseries
and different things,

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.570
which are lifesaving.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.210
But they're band-aids
to actually solving

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.260
the real problem.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.900
But we'll continue to do that,
because it's the right thing

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.640
to do to save those
animals' lives.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.560
So it's really,
really incredible

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.280
to see how far we've
come in the past five

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.610
years of the initiative.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:28.220
And so this year everything
we do is built around data.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.880
And that's where I think Best
Friends is really unique.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.150
So much of animal welfare
is built around anecdotes.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:41.060
Or I feel like people return
animals because of this reason.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.280
We don't even have a good
system for many years

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.550
of actually collecting,
well, statistically--

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.500
when are animals
returned, why are they

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.270
returned, what
are the zip codes?

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.892
You know, actually using
data to solve the problem.

00:25:52.892 --> 00:25:55.100
And so everything we do with
Best Friends is actually

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.200
extremely data driven.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.380
It's the basis-- whenever
I'm talking to groups,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.720
and they start with I feel, I'm,
like, what does the data say?

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.510
Not that your feelings
are not important,

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.660
but there is a data answer
in what you're about to say.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.880
So let's actually solve
the problem correctly.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.800
So we just went through our big
strategic planning for 2018,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.550
and everything we did was
built around data and trends

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.780
so that we can be the most
resourceful with the resources

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.500
that we have.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.810
And the future is actually
looking really, really cool

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:29.920
for Best Friends.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.520
So I think it was in 2016.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.040
I was in Salt Lake City at
the Best Friends National

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.590
Conference, and I was
just there as a speaker.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.230
And I'm sitting there,
and Julie Castle--

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.050
who's our Chief Development
Officer, marketing,

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.390
communications, all
of that good stuff--

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.790
goes onstage and
says, we're going

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.770
to launch a 2025 initiative.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.200
And we're going to
get the whole country

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.894
to no-kill by the year 2025.

00:26:56.894 --> 00:26:59.310
And it's kind of funny, because
I remember thinking-- god,

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.768
I feel bad for that
team of people.

00:27:00.768 --> 00:27:02.620
They're going to
have so much work.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:06.020
Well, it's now my
work in this job.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.920
And that's where, with
the 2025 initiative,

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.650
one of the things we did
was look at national data.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:16.090
And we realized we don't
even have a good metric

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.430
to describe the problem.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.880
We're describing the problem
possibly wrong for so long.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.150
Because two years ago, if
you looked on any website,

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.250
it would say three to
four million animals

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.920
are dying every
year, total guess.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.130
I have no clue where that
number even came from.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.060
So we did this really
intense data discovery

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.750
where we basically looked at
every county in the country,

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:45.500
every shelter, and collected as
much data as we possibly could.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.120
So we could actually see
how many animals are dying,

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.030
where are they dying,
why are they dying,

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.290
and what are we
going to do about it.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.940
And so my role as a
Pacific Regional Director

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.950
is to kind of focus
our initiatives

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.280
in California, Washington,
Oregon, Hawaii, and Alaska,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.450
so that's my part of the country
that I'm responsible for.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.400
And I was so surprised when I
looked at Southern California.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.370
So Southern California accounts
for 10% of all the known

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.590
deaths in the country.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.720
And it makes sense,
because Southern California

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.790
has, in general, some
of the largest shelters

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.430
in the country.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.420
So you have San Bernardino
that has a massive intake,

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.970
LA County, Bakersfield.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.310
All of these different
places that so many animals

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.030
are going in there.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.020
And because there's that high
concentration, a lot of them

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.910
are not making it out alive.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.690
So we have a lot of work to
do in Southern California,

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.810
but the reality is
it really is doable.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:50.525
That's the thing that, when you
look at 2025, and I thought,

00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:52.400
I don't know how that's
going to be possible.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.550
But when you actually
look at the data,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.660
and look at-- if we just make
a 2% impact every single year

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.940
in our region, we'll get there.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.010
And that's a really
doable thing.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.780
And that's something
that I really

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.350
appreciate about Best Friends
is the fact that we utilize

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.220
the data to actually inform
all of the strategies

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.590
and all of those
funding priorities.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:19.210
Before, perhaps we'd have
organizations who would say,

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.010
I want to do this
program because I

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.260
think it's really cool, and
it'll save a lot of lives.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.002
We now know-- let me look
at the data from your COUNTY

00:29:27.002 --> 00:29:28.960
and let me see if that
would be more impactful.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.440
And in fact, I've had to make
some tough decisions sometimes.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.370
And look at, actually,
you guys are OK,

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.170
and I need to put
this resource here.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:41.560
Because that's actually where
they really, really need it.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.411
But it's a really exciting
time in animal welfare.

00:29:45.411 --> 00:29:46.910
And this is where
it's so important.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.420
This is my pitch to all
of you to get involved.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.469
Because Best Friends and just
all of us crazy animal people,

00:29:53.469 --> 00:29:54.760
we're not going to do it alone.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.320
We really truly aren't.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.610
We're not going to achieve it.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.380
We're not going to sustain it.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.690
We need people who are
going to really help.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.290
And there's so many
ways you can help.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:04.360
It's adopting.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.490
Who here has animals?

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.515
Go get another one.

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:09.390
No, I'm just kidding.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.800
I have two, and
I'm at my wits end.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.180
It's even fostering.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.600
That's a temporary commitment.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.710
Especially in LA,
fostering of kittens--

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.270
you have all these
organizations who

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.340
are willing to pull these at
risk kittens from the shelter,

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.160
but they need people
to just let them

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.450
crash at their place
for six to eight weeks.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.150
If you have a spare bedroom,
a litter box and some water,

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.400
it's pretty easy,
actually, to save kittens.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.860
That's why when I see,
when kittens are dying,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.360
it's so easy.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.390
The solution for them is they
need a bathroom and some time.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.120
Or any room-- and some
time to just grow up

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.420
to be big enough to be at an
adoptable age, which is usually

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.265
two months.

00:30:47.265 --> 00:30:48.640
And even volunteering--
you know,

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.880
volunteering is
really important.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.504
We have so many
different opportunities

00:30:51.504 --> 00:30:53.987
within Best Friends,
the local shelters,

00:30:53.987 --> 00:30:55.570
lots of different
rescue organizations

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.730
can always use volunteers.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.950
And of course, we can
always use donations,

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.310
because there's a lot
of work to be done.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.260
And there is a lot of that
work requires resources.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.180
It requires funding.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.730
Groups who want to do
even more, or groups

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.770
who want to do something but
need some seeds to really grow

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:15.580
it.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.170
At minimum, I feel like
everyone can advocate,

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.040
like, you know more now.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.150
How many of you, I'm
curious, about this.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:29.486
How many of you knew that this
many animals were dying a year?

00:31:29.486 --> 00:31:31.360
How many of you knew
that Southern California

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.580
was one of the worst places
in the country for animals?

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.600
Most don't.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.610
I for sure didn't.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.330
I think I associated
Southern California

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.360
and I saw some of the
really good shelters.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.980
And I also associate--

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.440
there's a different kind of
resource in Southern California

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.290
that there's not, because of the
entertainment industry, that's

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:54.100
not prevalent in other
parts of the country.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.040
And so there's really no
reason why Southern California

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.850
is in one of those really
hot spots for the country.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.940
So at minimum, talk
about it to people.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.880
Because people just
have no clue about it.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.820
My biggest takeaway
is that it's possible.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.410
It really is possible.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.320
And so I invite all of you
to go to BestFriendsLA.org

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.150
and learn more.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.020
That's it.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.264
All right.

00:32:24.264 --> 00:32:32.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.210
AUDIENCE: Sorry about that.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.610
So we had, a couple
of years ago,

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.970
a talk about another
book that was actually

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:40.900
very upsetting to me.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.649
And I kind of want to
get your take on it.

00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:47.530
But it's from the perspective
of cats are evil in all forms

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:52.180
and have to be destroyed, that
TNR programs are not working,

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.250
are not effective,
and we basically

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.590
just need to eliminate
the domesticated

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.650
and feral domesticated cats.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:00.717
What do you think about?

00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:01.800
JOSE OCANO: He's so right.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.675
No, I'm just kidding.

00:33:02.675 --> 00:33:03.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:03.595 --> 00:33:05.540
He's really wrong.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.350
This is always my answer
and my experience.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.650
We've been trapping and
actually killing cats

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.410
as a best practice for decades.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.690
We did it at the shelter
that I started at.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:21.370
And every year we just saw more
and more and more coming in.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:22.617
It just doesn't work.

00:33:22.617 --> 00:33:24.200
And you know, it's
really interesting,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.100
because a lot of times these
arguments come from the birding

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.600
community.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.020
Because the idea
is these cats are

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.480
going to kill these
birds, especially when you

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.560
go to places where there may be
endangered species or animals

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.300
that are on the protected list.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:45.070
And so they get very amped up
about the cat conversation.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.560
And I feel we're in this
place sometimes-- why is it

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.370
either/or?

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:50.080
I love birds, too.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.690
And the only way to actually
stabilize and reduce

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:57.250
cat population-- the only thing
that's been proven is TNR.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:02.230
So having less cats in
the community in general

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.620
means that there will be
less cats eating birds.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.860
And so I'm always baffled when
I talk to some of those folks.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.670
We want the same thing.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.710
We truly do.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:15.100
The group that filed the
injunction against the city,

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.429
that's one of the big reasons.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.370
It's just the
impact on wildlife.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.300
And it's not either/or.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.940
We can totally save
cats, save birds.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.940
And actually, the
only way to save birds

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.280
is by saving cats this way.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.294
Which book was it?

00:34:32.294 --> 00:34:33.710
AUDIENCE: It was
called-- hold on.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:34.711
I had the email up here.

00:34:34.711 --> 00:34:35.793
JOSE OCANO: Was it recent?

00:34:35.793 --> 00:34:37.540
Was it one of those
recent "Cat Wars"?

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.850
AUDIENCE: It was, yeah, 2016.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.659
October 2016-- it was "Cat Wars,
The Devastating Consequences

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:44.959
of a Cuddly Killer."

00:34:44.959 --> 00:34:46.000
And they were basically--

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.291
JOSE OCANO: Such a great title.

00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:51.139
AUDIENCE: --that the cats
had been responsible--

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:53.800
like, personally responsible
for the extinction

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.500
of many species of birds.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.020
And my problem with
the talk, aside

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.500
from the fact that I like cats,
is that they didn't really

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.820
have any evidence of that.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.780
How did they know it
was the cats doing that,

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.780
not the people who moved
into those communities,

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.150
not the deforestation,
that we're taking away

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.600
the plants, the trees that
the birds need to live in?

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.400
They're just saying,
oh, no, it's all cats.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.830
JOSE OCANO: Yeah,
community cats just

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.120
get this giant target on them.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.070
And I don't know if
that's just because it's

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.030
an easy kind of
assumption to make.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.670
But there actually isn't--

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.550
even when you look at the
data that they provide,

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:32.020
and anyone who will analyze it,
you'll see tons of holes in it.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.460
There's all these
other variances

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.480
that are not even taken
into consideration

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.250
on why a certain population
of bird is decreasing.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.810
But they just run
with the cat thing

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.180
because it fits their narrative.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.030
And there's a real
inability to look

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.790
beyond that, because they're
just holding onto it so tight.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:51.290
AUDIENCE: And I think the thing
that people don't appreciate

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:55.330
about the wild cats that we
have, the feral cat community,

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.060
is that they're actually helping
with other problems like rats

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:03.070
and mice and other small animals
that are pests in our yard.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:07.660
And people kind of forget about
the whole Black Plague thing.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.770
It's too long ago.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.222
People don't remember it.

00:36:10.222 --> 00:36:10.930
JOSE OCANO: Yeah.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.360
I always think of cats
as, like, cats are just

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.454
part of the landscape
in the community.

00:36:16.454 --> 00:36:18.370
I mean, yeah, there's a
squirrel that's really

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:19.330
annoys my dog all the time.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.320
Are we going to
start an initiative

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.403
to kill all the squirrels?

00:36:21.403 --> 00:36:22.720
You know what I mean?

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.190
At what point--
where do you stop?

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:28.840
Because there is something
like the circle of life.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.190
Birds eat insects.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.210
Save the insects.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.110
You know what I mean?

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.185
Where does it come and
end, if all life matters.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.350
AUDIENCE: Anyone?

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.805
Oh, sorry.

00:36:41.805 --> 00:36:42.775
Sorry.

00:36:42.775 --> 00:36:45.700
AUDIENCE: No worries.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:50.970
So on the topic
of community cats,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.610
I've seen a number of feral
cats myself in my neighborhood

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:55.940
and this bothers me.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.970
It bothers me
immensely, to the point

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:01.780
where I'm pretty much willing
to just put my money where

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.360
my mouth is, find
a rescue group,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.960
and just fund their
TNR in my neighborhood.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.520
My worry with
something like that

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.360
is I know one of my neighbors,
a few houses down, they

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.780
have a cat that is not
spayed and neutered,

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.110
but it is their cat.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:24.010
In that sense, I'm worried
like, hey, what's my liability?

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.940
What's my thing?

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.159
I'm kind of assuming that
you have a general answer.

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:29.450
Like, you guys have been there.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.100
You've done that.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.690
You've dealt with
some owner who said,

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.950
no, I have purposely kept
my cat unspayed, unneutered,

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.310
and now you've just
destroyed that.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.432
AUDIENCE: Is it chipped?

00:37:39.432 --> 00:37:40.390
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:42.420
I haven't caught the cat.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.845
That would be my first question.

00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:45.428
Because if it's not
chipped, then it's

00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:47.170
fair game for a TNR program.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.531
JOSE OCANO: And the cat's
running around at large.

00:37:49.531 --> 00:37:50.530
I mean, I think that's--

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.633
JOSE OCANO: Yeah,
and I mean, if there

00:37:52.633 --> 00:37:55.390
is no indication that there is
an owner, so there is no chip.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.370
And that's something, even
when we trap cats, you know,

00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:59.620
we're scanning for microchips.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.320
There's nothing that indicates
it's an owned animal.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.420
It is just a loose
cat, you know?

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.440
And so there is onus on that
person who allows their cat

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.790
to go out and free roam.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.790
But also the cat has no
identification, you know?

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:17.420
And so we practice TNR
programs all over the country.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.540
I think we're actually
like the expert on it,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.707
because we do it really well.

00:38:21.707 --> 00:38:23.290
My first introduction
to Best Friends,

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:27.800
actually, was we received a huge
million dollar grant to start

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.010
a TNR program in Tucson.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.830
And there was no
liability, necessarily,

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.530
on the animal
shelter, on the groups

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.080
who were also participating
it, or on Best Friends.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.550
Because they're strays.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:44.020
And they're at
will and at large.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.010
So do it.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.495
AUDIENCE: Can I get
your business card,

00:38:48.495 --> 00:38:50.270
so you can hopefully get me in
touch with a group to do that?

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.120
JOSE OCANO: Sure.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.880
AUDIENCE: Do you return the
cat if it's already chipped?

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.260
If you catch a cat
for the TNR program,

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.118
do you just give it back,
or take it back to the owner

00:39:03.118 --> 00:39:04.050
if it's chipped?

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.380
You don't spay or neuter it?

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.046
JOSE OCANO: Yes.

00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:09.135
So if an animal actually were
to come in with identification,

00:39:09.135 --> 00:39:10.510
then we're going
to do everything

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.640
we can to find that owner.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.620
Usually that involves
a holding period.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.220
So in the shelter
system, if you brought

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.549
in a cat that normally would
qualify for that program,

00:39:20.549 --> 00:39:22.090
and it had a chip,
then you just have

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.130
to hold it the mandated
time and do the things

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.129
that the ordinance says.

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:28.090
Which is you have to make
attempts to contact the owner,

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.420
so you're calling the
number that's associated.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420
You're sending a letter.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.809
And you have to hold it
for a minimum time period.

00:39:33.809 --> 00:39:35.350
If no one comes
forward, then the cat

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.690
would get TNR'd that
way, and then go back.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:43.130
And you know what's interesting
is cats in animal sheltering--

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.470
actually they die
really a lot of times

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.610
disproportionately to dogs.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.120
And there's lots of
research out there

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.860
that shows by TNRing the
cat and putting it back,

00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:00.590
it's way more likely
to go home because it

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.820
knows where it lives.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.550
People don't reclaim
their cats in shelters.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:08.240
I think the average
rate is maybe 1% to 2%,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.600
while dogs is in the
20% to 25% nationally.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.840
And so, when a cat
goes into a shelter,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.020
it's very unlikely that its
owner is ever going to find it.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.990
But if you actually put that
cat back where it came from,

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.597
the chances are so
much more higher

00:40:22.597 --> 00:40:23.930
that it's going to go back home.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:26.240
So it's always interesting.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.106
Yeah?

00:40:27.106 --> 00:40:29.480
AUDIENCE: I have two questions,
but they're fairly quick.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.820
The first one is a personal
thank you for using data.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.720
It tells a really
powerful story.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.600
So that's helpful.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.530
My question, though, is we
talk a lot about dogs and cats.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.910
I'm curious about other
animals and initiatives

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:43.430
that maybe Best Friends is
involved with for rabbits

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.080
or other animals as well.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.770
JOSE OCANO: Yes, so at our
sanctuary we have livestock.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:49.760
We have birds.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.080
We have wildlife.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.810
But at one point,
Best Friends was

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:57.600
trying to do it all in so
many different aspects.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.250
And we realized we need to
have a concentrated effort.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.680
And so because it's
cats and dogs that

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.320
are dying in shelters,
that's where we decided

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.510
to really focus in our efforts.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.630
It doesn't mean that
after 2025 or something

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.500
that an initiative won't change
to include something different.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.870
And certainly when
we were in Houston

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.780
for the hurricane,
which was intense,

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.510
people would come with animals
that weren't cats and dogs.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.850
And it wasn't, like,
sorry, we don't do that.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.460
If they came to us, we're
going to figure it out,

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.290
or we'll refer them
to someone who can.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.570
But it was really a
conscious decision

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.970
to really zero in on
something so that we

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.277
could be the most
impactful as possible,

00:41:37.277 --> 00:41:38.735
so that our efforts
aren't diluted.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.860
AUDIENCE: My other question
is, I think, even quicker.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.490
Which is, Strut Your Mutt--

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.306
super cool event.

00:41:45.306 --> 00:41:47.180
I had a chance to
participate in it one year.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.914
Can you talk about
that event a little bit

00:41:49.914 --> 00:41:51.080
and how we can get involved?

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.930
And maybe if there's
2018 events on the books.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:55.670
JOSE OCANO: Yes, I
don't know if they're

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.044
on the books for
Strut Your Mutt.

00:41:57.044 --> 00:41:59.310
But Strut Your Mutt is
actually really, really cool.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.300
So we do this
giant kind of event

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.280
where people can bring
their own animals,

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.390
and they can fundraise.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.950
And all of the
proceeds that we bring

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:14.040
onboard actually go directly
back to the rescue groups.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.850
So for instance, if I was
a rescue organization,

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.650
I could start a Strut
Your Mutt campaign

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.290
and get all my friends to join.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.240
And they all show up,
and they register,

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.520
and they donate, and
100% of those proceeds

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.560
goes back to that organization.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.300
So Best Friends is
a national brand.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.750
And we are really good
about telling our story

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.400
and telling other
people's story.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.860
So it's important for
us to use our platform

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.860
to also serve our
network partners

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.790
and the organizations
that are hand-in-hand

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:47.459
with us doing a lot of
the work in the trenches.

00:42:47.459 --> 00:42:49.250
So Strut Your Mutt is
something really fun.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.030
You can volunteer.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.380
You can bring your own animal.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.080
Even if you don't,
it's just a cool place.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.940
It has a cool festival vibe.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.230
Even going to hang
out is really neat.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.680
So actually, I'll give you
information as it gets closer,

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.790
and then you can disperse it in
case anyone wants to volunteer

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.890
or partake in the festivities.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:08.090
I think I have to emcee it.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.631
I've been trying to
dodge it, but I'm

00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:12.390
pretty sure that's happening.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:13.434
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:13.434 --> 00:43:14.350
JOSE OCANO: All right.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:22.950
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that when you were initially

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:26.550
working at the shelter
that you at midnight

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.161
you would be trying
to get these--

00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:29.994
JOSE OCANO: Broke all
of our protocols, mhm.

00:43:29.994 --> 00:43:31.890
AUDIENCE: Uh huh.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:35.430
Why was there any resistance
to handing these dogs off

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:39.360
to these rescue groups?

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.030
JOSE OCANO: That is
such a good question.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:43.960
I think it's twofold.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.720
The first is this idea
that the community is

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.070
like public enemy number one.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.150
People suck.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.939
People are bad.

00:43:51.939 --> 00:43:53.730
These rescue groups,
they're just hoarders.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:57.810
You know, they don't really
want to help animals.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:03.150
The secondary thing is when
you have to euthanize and kill

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.880
tens of thousands of animals--

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.730
I'm thinking of the generation
who was there before me--

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.120
they had to find
ways to make that OK.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.990
So even suggesting to
do something different

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.860
makes them have to deal
with what they've done.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.420
And I've been in
that exact boat.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.170
You know, I remember when a new
program would come on board.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:27.410
And my gut reaction
was always, like, I

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.730
can't believe we killed all
these cats all these years,

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.280
and the solution was so simple.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.110
So I mean, the
shame that you deal

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.400
with working in this environment
is real, and it is so deep.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.840
And that's why, even in my
role, I approach everything

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.490
with curiosity.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.170
I'll go into the worst shelter.

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.586
I'll look at their
data, and then,

00:44:47.586 --> 00:44:50.255
like, literally everything
going in there is dying.

00:44:50.255 --> 00:44:51.630
And I approach it
with curiosity.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.880
For me, it's just,
like, I'm on that quest

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.770
for knowledge,
free of judgment--

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.130
because I don't
know their reality.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.050
I don't know what
their experience is.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.860
I don't know how many really
good people went in there

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.800
and left.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.280
How many people have
just been beaten down.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.800
And that's why I think it's
so important that, even when

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.780
we interact with the shelter
systems who aren't doing

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.360
the work that's
saving animals lives,

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.070
I always start with
compassion first.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:23.340
You know, it's very
rare, and it's not even

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.550
in my nature to make it
adversarial because I was them.

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:31.410
And that's part of why I tell
that story about my first day

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:32.220
to a lot of people.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.760
Because it equalizes and it's
my way of connecting to them

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.450
and saying I really
truly get it,

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.180
and it doesn't have to
be this way anymore.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.420
Because the other thing about
folks in animal welfare,

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.730
you really convince
yourself, and maybe there's

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:49.920
some truth to it--
no one understands.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.480
And so you're siloed.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.130
And so the only
people that you have

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.040
are people doing the same
things validating you.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.280
And so it becomes this
really unhealthy cycle,

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.160
and then you get cemented
in your belief system.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.950
And so so much of what we're
doing, even with Best Friends,

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:08.820
is working with these shelters
in a non-adversarial way,

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.760
and saying--
there's another way.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.320
And let's do it together.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.260
And it can be a slow
or fast as a process--

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.350
preferably fast-- as
you're comfortable with.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.271
The end, yes?

00:46:26.271 --> 00:46:26.770
All right.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.420
SPEAKER 1: We promise you don't
have to public speak anymore.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.420
JOSE OCANO: Thank you.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.160
AUDIENCE: Today.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.390
JOSE OCANO: Today-- today, yeah.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.390
Well, thank you so much.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:35.848
I really appreciate
the time, guys.

00:46:35.848 --> 00:46:38.350
