MARK DOUGLAS: Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:03.680
TODD WOMACK: Hey,
everybody, how are you?

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.631
Yay!

00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:05.630
Look who we brought you.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.822
Grace Helbig, everyone.

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:08.577
Let her hear it.

00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:10.160
MARK DOUGLAS: She's
going to sit here.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.900
TODD WOMACK: Between us.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.483
GRACE HELBIG: I'm
here to fix your car

00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:13.970
and answer your questions.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.750
MARK DOUGLAS: I was hoping to
do a big, epic intro, where

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.820
I said some of your
stats, and then you

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.210
came running in like, "Woo!"

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.533
But then, you were like, I
don't want to do that shit.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.060
GRACE HELBIG: No, yeah, that
feels very self-serving.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.180
It feels like I'm here now.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.550
MARK DOUGLAS: You're
supposed to be a Youtuber.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.310
You're supposed to
be like, look at me.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.430
GRACE HELBIG: Well,
that's true, yeah.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.520
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, in
case you guys don't know,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.900
Grace Helbig has almost
2 million subscribers

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.170
on her YouTube channel,
the Grace Helbig

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.340
channel, which is new.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.580
You did that in a week
or something, right?

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.690
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, it's
new as of January, 2014,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.960
which is very exciting.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.450
MARK DOUGLAS: Camp Dakota is
one of the first big movies

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.879
that YouTubers
just did, and it--

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.920
TODD WOMACK: I think it
was the first one, right?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.878
GRACE HELBIG: Well, there
were a couple before.

00:00:55.878 --> 00:00:58.820
But we really pride ourselves
on creating a new model that

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.990
didn't exist before
for distribution.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.471
MARK DOUGLAS: I mean, Fred.

00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:04.720
GRACE HELBIG: Fred, I mean,
who could live up to that?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.470
Basically, Hannah,
Mamrie, and I are just

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.120
three Freds at summer camp.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.690
That's how we pitched it.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.780
MARK DOUGLAS: I think I
saw that in the tagline.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.120
You have a pilot
for E that you shot.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.927
GRACE HELBIG: Yes.

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:17.260
MARK DOUGLAS: You know what's
funny is the last time-- I

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.590
remember one of the last
times speaking to you,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.190
we were talking about you
doing an appearance on Chelsea

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.320
Handler's show and
being nervous about.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.190
GRACE HELBIG: I
was so terrified.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.840
MARK DOUGLAS: And now you're
just going to go in there

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.920
and take over for her.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.800
GRACE HELBIG: Well, I don't know
if take over as just quietly

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.540
be present there.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.319
Yeah, I'm here also.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.360
It was really terrifying.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.820
But the pilot, I'm
really proud of it.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.620
It has a lot of influences
and elements of new media

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.410
and internet.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.960
And I think it's really cool.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.860
And here's hoping
that they pick it up.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.880
TODD WOMACK: Can you
spill any secrets about it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.269
to us, in terms of that?

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:52.685
GRACE HELBIG: I've
been calling it

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.950
an introvert's
late-night talk show.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.690
It's a lot like the way
I make my web videos.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.870
It happens in my personal space.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.630
But it's built out
a little bigger,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.980
with some bigger guests
and some bigger shticks,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.340
so that it kind of fits into
the television mold or model.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.040
But it's really infused
with ideas and suggestions

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860
directly from
Twitter, and Tumblr,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.060
and all the internet spaces.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.560
It's cool.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.990
TODD WOMACK: Good answer.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.900
Correct.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.290
GRACE HELBIG: Thank you.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.970
MARK DOUGLAS: Today we're mainly
here to talk about your book.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.560
It's kind of a self-help
book, "Grace's Guide--

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.430
the Art of Pretending
to be a Grown-Up."

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.210
Seems like you're doing a
pretty good job of pretending.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.610
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, no one
knows what they're doing.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.985
MARK DOUGLAS: I get tired when
I think about all the crap

00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:36.005
that you do.

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.360
Todd and I are not--
I think we're probably

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.812
the laziest YouTubers, right?

00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:41.270
TODD WOMACK: We're
also on YouTube.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.905
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:42.760
Did you know that?

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.830
We are on YouTube, too.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.220
GRACE HELBIG: That's great.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.600
MARK DOUGLAS: Anybody?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.900
No?

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.720
GRACE HELBIG: That's awesome.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.428
MARK DOUGLAS: OK.

00:02:46.428 --> 00:02:49.111
They're just trying to
get their work done.

00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.110
They just thought they'd
come into a quiet space

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.250
and get some work done today.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.730
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
and they're like,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.770
what's this newly designed
room with curtains?

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.745
No.

00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:58.856
MARK DOUGLAS: What
made you do this.

00:02:58.856 --> 00:02:59.355
Why?

00:02:59.355 --> 00:02:59.800
Why?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.550
GRACE HELBIG: Why?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.531
Why?

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:02.030
Why?

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.150
I, after I graduated
college, got really obsessed

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.470
with self-help, because all
of these self-help books that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.159
were out there seemed
variations of each other.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.450
They all seemed really similar.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.550
They all seemed to give
kind of the same advice.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.680
TODD WOMACK: They're in the
same section at the bookstore.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.090
GRACE HELBIG: They're
in the same section.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.480
It was just like, ugh,
what is this, Nazi Germany?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.240
I hate this.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.440
MARK DOUGLAS: All the self-help
books will get in the van.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.430
GRACE HELBIG: I just
had to get that out

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.596
within the first 10 minutes.

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:32.220
Now I'm good.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.560
I wanted to make something
that was a little bit more,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.430
I guess, realistic,
not so holding people

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.014
to such high
expectations on life,

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:41.680
because no one knows
what they're doing.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.850
But I've learned some
stuff for myself.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.340
And I really wish that when I
was a teenager or early '20s

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.010
that I had someone
kind of telling me

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.030
more informational
things about what

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.180
happened to them so
I could avoid that.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.680
TODD WOMACK: It's
a really fun book,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.730
because it does-- it's
the first thing that

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.260
plugs the gap between a
real self-help book that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.730
would be in these sessions.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.270
MARK DOUGLAS: But then
you have actual nuggets

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.310
in there of real things
where-- they kind of sneak up

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.840
on you-- where you're
like, oh this is silly.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.714
Oh, well that is actually
really good advice.

00:04:12.714 --> 00:04:15.292
GRACE HELBIG:
Deodorant, who knew?

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:16.991
MARK DOUGLAS: Deodorants.

00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:18.240
It's just basic health habits.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.209
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
it got to a point

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.339
where my editor, Lauren,
who's here, she was like,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.250
you've mentioned
diarrhea 11 times.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.280
You really need to
scale this back.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.040
And I was like--

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.540
TODD WOMACK: I see there's
actually a note from you to her

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.390
in the thank you
at the end, where

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.722
you've used it only four times.

00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:31.430
Good job, Lauren.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.013
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
thank you, Lauren.

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:34.780
That's what an editor
can do for you.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.071
MARK DOUGLAS: But that is
interesting to bring that up,

00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:39.510
because-- about
the advice, really.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.020
I think a lot of YouTubers,
and you in particular,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.300
are almost kind of
like an older sister

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.590
to a lot of your fanbase.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.910
It tends to be a young fanbase.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.280
So I think this is sort of
a natural kind of thing.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.780
GRACE HELBIG: I didn't expect
to have such a young fanbase.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.560
I tell everyone that the way
I started making videos was

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.260
that I was dating a
guy that I thought

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.676
was the funniest
guy in the world.

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:02.290
And every time I
created a video,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.410
I just thought would
this one guy laugh at it.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.230
And that 30-year-old
comedy writer

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.510
incited an audience
of 16-year-old girls.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.380
So I don't know
how that happened.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.870
MARK DOUGLAS: So it's
really-- he's the brains.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.320
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, he's
the brains behind this.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.402
And I'm just the meat puppet.

00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:16.280
MARK DOUGLAS: What
happened to him?

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.330
GRACE HELBIG: He's succeeding
in the entertainment world.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.204
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, OK.

00:05:19.204 --> 00:05:19.850
Good for him.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.350
TODD WOMACK: Sounds
very successful.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.407
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
he's really great.

00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:25.240
TODD WOMACK: Now, who
is your demo for this?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.614
Did you sit down
and write and go

00:05:26.614 --> 00:05:28.332
I'm going to make
something for--

00:05:28.332 --> 00:05:30.540
GRACE HELBIG: No, I mean
the thing is I didn't think,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.200
I want a 16-year-old girl
to read this and think,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.080
oh, now I know how to do things.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.980
I just kind of wanted to
share my point of view

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.340
and what I've learned.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.470
And also, to kind of
start a conversation,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.050
because I don't know how
to do everything, clearly.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.000
And so through doing
YouTube videos,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.190
you get so much feedback
from people constantly.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.680
And the internet
loves to tell you

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.340
everything you're doing wrong.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.510
So I kind of now created a
more tangible way for them

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.509
to tell me what I'm
doing wrong with my life.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.050
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah
this is the thesis

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.300
on what you're doing wrong
with your life right here.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.090
TODD WOMACK: You should
have left a little section--

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.920
GRACE HELBIG: A
comments section?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.335
TODD WOMACK: --empty.

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:07.750
Yeah, a comments sections.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.180
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, with
just a self-addressed,

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.820
stamped envelope, and they could
mail me all their comments.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.570
TODD WOMACK: Or just
leave it in the book.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.320
Because sometimes I
wish people would just

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.180
type their comments-- a mean
comment-- into the keyboard

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.240
and then just go away
and be happy with that.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.030
And then not actually
send it anywhere.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.613
MARK DOUGLAS: And
it disappears, yeah.

00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:25.220
Well, one of the
things that is-- I

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.420
mean, amongst all of
the fun and goofiness,

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.300
I think the one
part that you really

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.620
do strive is you really do
have to be a hard worker.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.700
It looks like you're having
a ton of fun all the time.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.420
But one particular part of
the book that I really enjoyed

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.330
was where you had
a nervous breakdown

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.780
from working at Applebee's
and Dave and Buster's

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.170
at the same time.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.460
And you were in a
Target parking lot .

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.935
That's such a
suburban nightmare.

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:50.310
GRACE HELBIG:
Yeah, I mean, those

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.780
are all my sponsors
for the book.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.280
So I just wanted to put
them all in one story.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.776
MARK DOUGLAS: And then
I threw up at Pizza Hut.

00:06:56.776 --> 00:07:00.410
GRACE HELBIG: And then
I used my ibuprofen.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:06.110
Yeah, I channeled all of
my energy as a young adult

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.300
in to working.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.710
I wasn't very social.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.840
But I knew how to work
and to try to make money.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.110
And so that's what I did.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.500
And yeah, one summer I split--
my parents are divorced.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.583
So they live in two different
parts of New Jersey.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:20.580
So I split my week working at an
Applebee's near my dad's house

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.770
and a Dave and Buster's
near my mom's house.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.370
And the Dave and
Buster's sucked a D.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.720
It was so bad, because all
of the cooks in the kitchen

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.997
were rehabilitated criminals
that were released from prison.

00:07:32.997 --> 00:07:35.080
So there was a security
guard that would walk me--

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.496
MARK DOUGLAS: Did
you get harassed

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:38.330
every time you went
to get tater tots.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.996
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
exactly, I was like,

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:43.530
can I-- I was like, can
I get a Caesar salad

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.220
and for you to never look
at me like that again.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.200
It was really great.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.820
But I used to drive my stepdad's
truck in to work over the Walt

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.481
Whitman bridge
into Philadelphia,

00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:54.730
work at the Dave and Buster's.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.646
And the security guard
would walk me to my car

00:07:56.646 --> 00:07:58.150
at the end of the night.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.402
I hated it so much.

00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:00.860
And I didn't know
what I was doing.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.568
And Dave and Buster's,
if you don't know,

00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:04.860
is just a miserable place.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.450
It's a half arcade,
half restaurant.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.290
So adults come in and for $10.99
they get ribs and 20 tokens.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.644
And it's just awful.

00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:16.060
MARK DOUGLAS: But don't they
have the chocolate waterfall?

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.750
GRACE HELBIG: I don't even know.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.400
MARK DOUGLAS: I
thought was where

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.770
they had the
chocolate waterfall.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.853
GRACE HELBIG: That was the
name of the chef, yeah.

00:08:20.853 --> 00:08:22.030
He was great.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.400
MARK DOUGLAS: That's what
you do after you eat there,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.296
chocolate waterfall.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.910
Oh boy.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:34.809
Well, speaking of the IBS,
you don't strike me as someone

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.250
from New Jersey, what we
think of as New Jersey.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.893
GRACE HELBIG: This
hair, these roots, what?

00:08:39.893 --> 00:08:41.309
MARK DOUGLAS: And
you have claimed

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.921
to be part white trash at
many points in your life.

00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:46.420
And I didn't believe
you until I got

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.340
to the cooking section
of your book, which

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.200
feels like something that--
like a stoned five-year-old

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.505
would make some of this
food, if that's possible.

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:58.880
Can we talk a little bit about
some of your recipes here?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.540
GRACE HELBIG: Sure.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.540
MARK DOUGLAS: Muchachos?

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.460
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, it's nachos,
but with macaroni and cheese

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.790
instead of just cheese.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.970
I'm obsessed with
the Food Network.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.740
I really, in my mind,
think I'm a great chef.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.170
But then I'm also like,
I can be creative.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.900
And I can appeal to people
that only like mac and cheese

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.030
and nachos.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.170
And so I try and
just combine things

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.530
that shouldn't be combined.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.050
I think one of the
things in there

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.850
is a "palzone", which is a
calzone stuffed with pizza

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.510
bagel bites, which, to
me, is just the greatest

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.947
form of inception of all time.

00:09:35.947 --> 00:09:37.530
MARK DOUGLAS: A lot
of carbs going on.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.800
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
it's all carbs.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.930
MARK DOUGLAS: Spam cakes?

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.580
GRACE HELBIG: Spam cakes
are just pancakes of spam.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.671
Yeah, it's really--
they're great.

00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.420
They're delicious.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.750
You can't deny the taste.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.550
MARK DOUGLAS: So
what do you-- do

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.758
you just work out constantly?

00:09:48.758 --> 00:09:53.060
Or you just shit it all out?

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.730
GRACE HELBIG: My
gastrointestinal system

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.940
is gone.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.060
No, this kind of came from--
on a lot of my videos,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.570
I make food.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.750
And I make these ridiculous
combinations of stuff.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.510
And I'll always
try them on camera.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.530
And they're delicious.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.470
And then instantly, my stomach
is like, no, please, no more.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.896
And so I-- everything
in moderation.

00:10:15.896 --> 00:10:16.395
Yeah.

00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:18.145
TODD WOMACK: Good way
to limit the intake.

00:10:18.145 --> 00:10:19.770
GRACE HELBIG: Exactly.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.130
MARK DOUGLAS: So your two
best friends, Mamrie Hart

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.360
and Hannah Hart, both have shows
about drinking on the internet.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.110
You've mentioned you
have a young fanbase.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.568
We kind of struggle
with this, too.

00:10:31.568 --> 00:10:35.245
We just started making stuff
that we thought was funny.

00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:37.620
And then you make one Justin
Bieber video, and next thing

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.000
you know, you've got
legions of 12-year-old fans.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.620
GRACE HELBIG: That
will murder you.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.390
MARK DOUGLAS: Do you
feel a responsibility

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.990
to ever tone it down?

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.080
Is there a line that you
have where you're like,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.940
I'd better not cross here.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.770
GRACE HELBIG: I think the reason
that Hannah and Mamrie are

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.600
so successful with
their channels,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.790
even though there is such
a presence of alcohol,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.550
is that they're really--
they're actually

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.460
really responsible
adults about it.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.680
And they're presenting
it in a real way.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.400
So many people sugar coat
drinking, and social drinking,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.320
and drinking for fun,
or drinking to excess.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.030
And they're
presenting it in a way

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.290
that I think is-- you get it.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.760
And it's never-- it doesn't feel
like-- Epic Meal time has built

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.220
a brand on total excess,
and total ridiculousness,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.732
and drinking bottles
of Jameson at a time.

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.440
And Hannah Hart gets
drunk, and it's just

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.410
like watching a
teddy bear do heroin.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.560
You're like, that's so cute.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.855
There's something
sweet about it.

00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:36.004
I do think that there is a
responsibility, absolutely.

00:11:36.004 --> 00:11:38.420
And someone asked me this at
a book signing the other day,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.160
how's it feel to be a role
model to a lot of young adults?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.264
And I don't-- that will
really stress me out,

00:11:45.264 --> 00:11:47.680
if I only think of myself as
a role model to young adults.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.400
So instead, I try and
think, as a human being that

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.380
exists in the world that
interacts with adults

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.660
of all ages, I just
want to be considered

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:01.550
a nice, respectful person and
hope that other people also

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.070
strive for that in their
lives, whether they learn it

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.310
from me or from who else.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.210
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, because
the stuff in the book is--

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.330
you haven't toned it down too
much to be you have to be--

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.089
GRACE HELBIG: And
I think-- yeah,

00:12:16.089 --> 00:12:17.255
none of it is specifically--

00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:18.340
TODD WOMACK: There's
some funny adult things.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.464
There's funny things--

00:12:19.464 --> 00:12:20.880
GRACE HELBIG: It's
just presenting

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.963
from my own point of view.

00:12:21.963 --> 00:12:23.520
And I think that
Hannah, and Mamrie,

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.850
and I became really good
friends because we all

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:32.560
have the same kind of quality of
comedy, of wanting to be nice.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.350
Nothing's ever
really mean-spirited,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.380
or super cutting, or
degrading in any way.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.930
And I think that's kind
of an unspoken rule

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.082
we all have amongst each other.

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:43.040
MARK DOUGLAS: I've never
seen you guys throw up

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.350
from drinking.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.667
GRACE HELBIG: No
we edit that out.

00:12:46.667 --> 00:12:48.750
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I mean,
you guys work so hard.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.920
I mean, there's no way you
could get all the things done

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.740
that you're getting
done if you were just

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.420
partying all the time.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.628
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, if we
were all raging alcoholics,

00:12:56.628 --> 00:12:58.850
I don't think that we
would be successful.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.891
MARK DOUGLAS: Remember
when I made that one video

00:13:00.891 --> 00:13:02.350
in my kitchen where
I was drinking?

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.180
I should have
followed up on that.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.400
GRACE HELBIG: I know.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.790
I mean, Hannah, to
her credit, she's

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.380
taken something
that could have been

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.190
a very much one-hit wonder.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.900
And she's developed
an entire brand

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.240
around it, and a really
respectable brand,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.297
which is so cool.

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:17.880
MARK DOUGLAS: Just
technical stuff, we

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.732
have Grace's book in the back.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.440
I don't know if it's
over there or there.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.400
She's signed a
bunch for you guys.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.770
If you want to walk off with
a copy, if you don't have one

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.200
yet.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.699
And also, at some
point, we're going

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:29.470
to open it up to questions from
the audience with those two

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.500
mics right there.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.010
And if you have a question,
just pop up there.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.220
And we'll recognize, and
you can ask your question

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.810
to the microphone.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.351
GRACE HELBIG: I
always feel like it's

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:39.270
a daytime-- a Jerry
Springer, when

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.965
there's mics in the audience.

00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:43.340
TODD WOMACK: We're going to
bring out your daddy's momma.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.130
GRACE HELBIG: You'd
better get yourself a job.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.390
MARK DOUGLAS: This is the one
to the girl in the coveralls,

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.320
you had told him-- this is
an interesting outfit you're

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.820
wearing today, coveralls.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.270
TODD WOMACK: Take us through it.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.000
Take us through your
mindset this morning.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.520
MARK DOUGLAS: It works.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.000
GRACE HELBIG: I just want to
be a poster child for the idea

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.690
that sometimes you
make choices in life,

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.148
and when you reflect
on them later,

00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:07.439
you realize they
weren't the best.

00:14:07.439 --> 00:14:09.480
TODD WOMACK: But at least
you made those choices.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.938
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, you've got
to start by making a choice,

00:14:11.938 --> 00:14:13.810
and then later reflect
on it and realize oh,

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.494
comfort-wise, great, using a
public restroom-wise, awful.

00:14:17.494 --> 00:14:18.910
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah,
that's why you

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.280
have to have the mic, because
when he was trying to--

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.030
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
he couldn't mic me up.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.529
I was like, I'm not
taking this off.

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:26.730
MARK DOUGLAS: It
got awkward quick.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.240
Hold on.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.740
GRACE HELBIG: No,
this is my defense

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.190
against any mic man touching me.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.110
It's just coveralls.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.357
Sorry, dude.

00:14:33.357 --> 00:14:35.190
MARK DOUGLAS: Well,
there's a little point--

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.140
I'm going to get a
little deep here.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.515
There's a point
in the book where

00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:39.760
you talk about some
anxiety attacks

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.900
you were having, not just
having to do with the fast food

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.390
restaurants, but just
from living in New York,

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.680
on the subway.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.940
Are you doing all right
back here in New York.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.650
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, I'm
repressing right now.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.450
Yeah, no, it's good.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.800
I've always been really hesitant
to talk about personal anxiety

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.821
issues, because especially
for being on YouTube,

00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:03.320
it's a conversation
that gets talked

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.570
about with a lot of people.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.700
And so for me, I
hate being like,

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.440
I also am dealing with that.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.350
I'm trendy, too.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.600
I have anxiety.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.009
And so I really didn't want--

00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:15.300
MARK DOUGLAS: It's really hard.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.841
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
it's really hard.

00:15:16.841 --> 00:15:19.020
Sometimes I get sad.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.020
So I really didn't
want to talk about it.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.590
But then I decided,
because I really

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.450
have-- I see a psychiatrist.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.970
It got to a point where I wasn't
able to go to my improv shows,

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.675
because I wasn't
getting on a subway.

00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:36.054
It was just mind
boggling, which is crazy,

00:15:36.054 --> 00:15:37.720
because I had lived
here for five years.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.290
And then all of a sudden, I
just couldn't get on a subway

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:40.940
anymore.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.460
And I took some time
to really deal with it.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.380
And so it's one of
those things, where

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.920
I can reflect on it now
and realize at that time,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.140
it felt so crazy that I
wanted to talk about it.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.120
Because people that are
having that moment--

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.100
I would have really
loved at that moment,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.530
to have someone else
talking about their anxiety

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.570
to me, to deflate how
serious it was in my brain.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.420
And I've gone a lot of--
that's probably the chapter,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.430
other than relationship
stuff, that I've

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.410
gotten the most
positive feedback on.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.480
Because, here's the thing,
everyone has anxiety.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.720
You're not, I guess,
removed from it.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.620
Everyone has some level of it,
whether they're conscious of it

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.590
or not.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.390
And I think it's something
just human and relatable.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.920
TODD WOMACK: Did you start
your YouTube career--

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.717
at what stage
during the anxiety--

00:16:31.717 --> 00:16:34.300
GRACE HELBIG: I started-- I feel
like when I moved to New York

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.330
I had a lot of anxiety
that was totally repressed.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.895
It was just oh, I'm in New York.

00:16:38.895 --> 00:16:39.850
MARK DOUGLAS: New York
just amplified it?

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.770
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
then all of a sudden,

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.140
the glamour of being
in New York wore off.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.882
And the realities of
being in New York,

00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:48.090
and there's a homeless man
masturbating on the subway

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.190
next to me, became very present.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.300
And I was like, oh, this
is really stressful.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.320
And also YouTube was not
my initial career path.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.470
I was auditioning
for TV and film stuff

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.910
while I was making web videos.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.130
And web videos became
my survival job.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.520
It allowed me to not have
to wait tables anymore

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.130
in the city.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.780
And I could sit at home and
do that while I auditioned.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.405
So I wasn't really-- I was
doing the hustle of trying

00:17:15.405 --> 00:17:17.530
to go to audition, after
audition, after tradition.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.310
And then you get
rejected so many times.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.960
And that adds to anxiety.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.420
And then you just can't get
a moment alone in New York,

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.119
no matter how hard you try.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.099
And once you really
actualize that,

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.880
it just grates on your brain.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.312
And then who knows?

00:17:31.312 --> 00:17:32.520
You're just waking up crying.

00:17:34.965 --> 00:17:37.090
MARK DOUGLAS: I started
thinking about it just now.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.381
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, sorry guys.

00:17:38.381 --> 00:17:41.291
This is a real
comfortable environment.

00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:43.290
MARK DOUGLAS: So you were
in the Miss New Jersey

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.600
pageant at one point?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.790
I just thought-- there's
not good segue for this.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.140
GRACE HELBIG: Speaking of
anxiety and terrible humans,

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.190
let's talk about a beauty
pageant you were in.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:53.481
MARK DOUGLAS: How old were you?

00:17:53.481 --> 00:17:54.450
What year was that?

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.120
GRACE HELBIG: So to just
preface this, my parents,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.850
from a very young age,
instilled this crazy idea in me

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.240
that I could do anything
that I set my mind to.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.300
So I took that as
a challenge when

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.197
I was a sophomore in college.

00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:11.030
Well, going back, when
I was in high school,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.670
a girl on my track team
was Miss Teen New Jersey.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.890
And I was like, she can do that?

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.690
How'd she do that?

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.115
I bet I could do that.

00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:21.209
And so when I got to college,
I wasn't a teen anymore,

00:18:21.209 --> 00:18:22.750
so I couldn't enter
the teen pageant.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.870
So I entered the Miss
New Jersey pageant.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.750
And it turns out, you don't have
to have any quantifiable skills

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.940
to enter a beauty pageant.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.330
You just need $1,200
and to sign off

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.380
on a piece of
paper, which I did.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.996
I worked so many shifts at
Applebee's to pay for this.

00:18:36.996 --> 00:18:38.620
MARK DOUGLAS: You
footed that yourself?

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.495
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, I
paid for it all myself,

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.990
because I was an
independent woman.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.430
Yeah, and I didn't tell
anyone that I was doing it.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.230
I just-- I didn't--
which is also weird.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.330
It was all weird.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.260
I don't know what brain I was
living under at that point.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.510
I didn't tell anyone.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.480
Except my boyfriend at the
time, I told very last minute.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.750
And he was like, oh cool.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.910
He didn't come to
support me at all.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.660
And I went, and I bought
a dress for Macy's.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.020
And I had it hanging
in my dorm room.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.564
And as I was leaving, my
roommate saw the dress,

00:19:09.564 --> 00:19:11.230
and she was like what
is this dress for?

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.430
And I was like, I'm doing the
Miss New Jersey pageant, bye.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.230
And ran out the door and did it.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:22.040
And I instantly learned that I
was not a beauty pageant-type

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.790
person.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.760
And there's very much a type of
person that's very good at it.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.140
And so I got there.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.290
There was a pizza
party for everyone

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.500
when we got there,
to elicit friendship.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.950
And I was like uh-uh.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.000
I'm going to go back
up to my hotel room

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.050
and watch "Real Housewives."

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.020
But it was so strange.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.650
There was an opening
dance number with scarves,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.530
I remember.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.120
And then there was an
evening gown competition,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.400
a bathing suit competition.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.050
And then they move 10
people on to the next round.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.500
And there was an
interview portion.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.130
And I got dressed in
my, what I thought

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.005
was my cool business casual
wear, that I got at Ross Dress

00:20:02.005 --> 00:20:03.300
for Less.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.872
Literally, I'm awesome.

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:06.580
And then these girls
are getting stitched

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.337
in to their handmade
Michael Kors gowns.

00:20:09.337 --> 00:20:10.920
MARK DOUGLAS: Were
they like Snookies?

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.211
GRACE HELBIG: No, they weren't.

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.750
This Polish girl
won, who was amazing.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.330
And you look at
the photos from it,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.590
you're like, oh, very
clearly that girl

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.740
has been in beauty
pageants her whole life.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.630
She's standing just
with her shoulders back.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:28.690
I'm just standing with a
sales rack Macy's dress on

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.110
and a fake spray tan.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.580
And I wore a poof in
my hair before Snooki

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.920
was a thing in Jersey.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.295
I don't know what
I was thinking.

00:20:35.295 --> 00:20:36.210
MARK DOUGLAS: Did
you have a bumpit?

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.376
GRACE HELBIG: No, no bumpit.

00:20:37.376 --> 00:20:39.737
Yeah, independent woman.

00:20:39.737 --> 00:20:41.320
MARK DOUGLAS: You
don't need a bumpit.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.040
It bumps itself.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.040
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
it bumped itself.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.460
Where's my extra points?

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.840
It's a hilarious
experience, looking back.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.840
I watch "Toddlers in
Tiaras" all the time.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.720
I think beauty pageants
can be really great

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.090
for the right type of person.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.586
For me, it's just a
learning experience of nah.

00:20:59.586 --> 00:21:00.710
TODD WOMACK: Did you place?

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.242
GRACE HELBIG: I
think I got seventh.

00:21:02.242 --> 00:21:04.200
TODD WOMACK: You made it
to the ten, all right.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.160
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
yeah, I remember--

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.030
TODD WOMACK: But
your posture just

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.238
wasn't good enough to win it.

00:21:07.238 --> 00:21:09.620
GRACE HELBIG: No, my posture,
my clothes, they're like,

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.770
maybe you should get an
ironing board sometime.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.690
That might work out for you.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.940
MARK DOUGLAS: Did they ask
you hard hitting questions?

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.480
GRACE HELBIG: No, they're
like, so you, and your dad,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.030
and brother have-- you write
down some stuff about yourself

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.380
that you think is interesting
that they can talk about.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.005
They're like, so you,
and your brother,

00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:29.820
and your dad had done some
half-triathlons together,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.900
which we did at the time.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.900
And I talked all about that.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.470
And then you don't get to
hear, really, anyone else

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.460
that's on stage.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.700
But then I found out
that every other girl

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.055
talked about the charity
that she was working for.

00:21:42.055 --> 00:21:46.130
And I was just like, yeah,
we're not good at swimming.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.450
I talked about that for--

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.491
TODD WOMACK: I'm just
running around with my dad.

00:21:49.491 --> 00:21:50.770
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, literally.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.695
And every other girl was like,
I am big advocate of UNICEF.

00:21:53.695 --> 00:21:56.748
And I was like, goddammit.

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:58.780
MARK DOUGLAS: You clearly
didn't take the class

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.845
that everyone else had taken.

00:21:59.845 --> 00:22:00.700
GRACE HELBIG: No, I missed.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.241
TODD WOMACK: I thought the New
Jersey one would be more like,

00:22:03.241 --> 00:22:06.170
so you're in deep to a loan
shark for 200 big ones.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.940
He's threatening to
break your knees.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.959
What do you do?

00:22:09.959 --> 00:22:11.708
MARK DOUGLAS: I just
drop my uncle's name,

00:22:11.708 --> 00:22:13.241
and he gets the
frick out of Dodge.

00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:14.116
GRACE HELBIG: I wish.

00:22:14.116 --> 00:22:16.282
TODD WOMACK: Put on my
leather jacket and freak out.

00:22:17.845 --> 00:22:19.470
MARK DOUGLAS: In the
book, you actually

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.560
said you're not the most
social person in the world.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.160
GRACE HELBIG: No.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.659
MARK DOUGLAS: But
you're a YouTuber.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:25.065
How does that--
explain yourself.

00:22:25.065 --> 00:22:26.690
GRACE HELBIG: Does
that not explain it?

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.200
MARK DOUGLAS: I don't know.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.141
TODD WOMACK: Well, no,
I do think that you--

00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:30.087
GRACE HELBIG: Have you
ever met a Youtuber-- other

00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:31.537
than yourselves?

00:22:31.537 --> 00:22:33.120
MARK DOUGLAS: It
does, but it doesn't.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.252
I mean, you have to be very--

00:22:35.252 --> 00:22:37.710
GRACE HELBIG: I'm an introvert
by nature, which for so much

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.610
of my life, I thought
being an introvert

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.860
was a really negative thing.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.470
I thought, oh, it means that
I don't know how to socialize,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.470
which isn't true.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.220
An introvert knows
how to socialize.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.500
It just makes them tired.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.690
MARK DOUGLAS: They
just don't want to.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.470
GRACE HELBIG: Being an
introvert makes you-- I

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.500
get really tired in
social situations.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.980
Whereas an extrovert takes
energy in social situations,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.050
loves it.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:04.960
And so I prefer working alone.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.610
I prefer-- some
of favorite nights

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.720
are ones that I've just spent
in by myself with my dog,

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.822
drinking and dancing.

00:23:12.822 --> 00:23:14.530
TODD WOMACK: And that's
in the book, too.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.190
You'll learn more in
the book, everyone.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.660
GRACE HELBIG: What dance was it?

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.206
Buy the book.

00:23:21.206 --> 00:23:22.751
TODD WOMACK: I do
think that you're

00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:24.750
one of the few people
that has a nice crossover.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.722
You do the YouTube thing,
where people really,

00:23:26.722 --> 00:23:27.930
really love your personality.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.210
And you have a lot of
cool things going on

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.160
in your channel.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.231
But I've seen you
interview people.

00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:35.230
At VidCon, you were
interviewing Chris Hardwick.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.530
And that was a
great conversation.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.946
You guys were very
funny together.

00:23:37.946 --> 00:23:42.770
And you actually have the
real, traditional media

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.477
skill set as well.

00:23:44.477 --> 00:23:46.310
I think you're maybe
one of the first people

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.620
to break through that, which
is really good for YouTubers.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.495
GRACE HELBIG: Thanks.

00:23:49.495 --> 00:23:52.520
And well, Chris Hardwick has
always been a huge inspiration.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.480
I met him doing
"Attack of the Show."

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.410
And right before he started his
whole Nerdist YouTube channel,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.340
we sat down and talked
all about YouTube.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.070
And he is an amazing host.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.400
He's an amazing interviewer.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.650
He really is so fantastic at
building someone up and making

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.380
them feel important,
and special, and funny,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.400
and interesting.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.664
And I always thought that
was such a great quality.

00:24:13.664 --> 00:24:15.080
MARK DOUGLAS: We
just want to say,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.550
we think you're really
great, by the way.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.508
GRACE HELBIG: You guys.

00:24:17.508 --> 00:24:18.069
You guys.

00:24:18.069 --> 00:24:20.610
TODD WOMACK: Are you sure you
didn't win that Miss New Jersey

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.224
pageant?

00:24:22.224 --> 00:24:23.390
GRACE HELBIG: No, next time.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.733
MARK DOUGLAS: OK, sorry.

00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:24.076
Go ahead.

00:24:24.076 --> 00:24:25.160
GRACE HELBIG: Let's
recount the votes.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.130
MARK DOUGLAS: Chris Hardwick.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.713
GRACE HELBIG: No,
it was really great.

00:24:27.713 --> 00:24:30.430
And I think he has
been my inspiration,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.620
because he does just that.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.910
He bridges the gap between
internet personality

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.940
and-- having an internet
presence, a really

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.940
strong internet
presence, and also

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.960
having a very traditional
media presence

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.480
that fuses the two together.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.720
But he's a boy, and I'm a girl.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.190
So I'd like to do it for
the female side of things.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.150
MARK DOUGLAS: He's
also-- another thing

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:55.124
he's got going for him is
he's a vampire who never ages.

00:24:55.124 --> 00:24:57.040
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
what's going on with that?

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.012
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:58.012 --> 00:24:59.470
GRACE HELBIG: Did
you know-- here's

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.020
what I've learned about
Chris Hardwick, fun fact.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.347
He was the very first Stacy
Jax in "Rock of Ages."

00:25:04.347 --> 00:25:05.680
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, I knew that.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.971
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, look it up.

00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:10.240
There's a really embarrassingly
great YouTube video

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.484
of him singing "Dead or Alive"
in white leather, head to toe.

00:25:13.484 --> 00:25:15.900
TODD WOMACK: He's also one of
the tech guys in "Terminator

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.990
3," but that's--

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.070
GRACE HELBIG: Really?

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.069
TODD WOMACK: Does anyone
want to ask a question?

00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:21.930
How about we get some--

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.840
MARK DOUGLAS: Does anyone have
a Chris Hardwick question?

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.970
TODD WOMACK: How about a
Grace question, anybody?

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:26.490
Over there?

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.300
Or over there?

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:27.970
They're open.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:28.670
Don't be shy.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.570
GRACE HELBIG: No pressure.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.560
TODD WOMACK: Don't
be shy-- there's one.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.330
MARK DOUGLAS: Here we go.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:31.830
Yes.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.640
GRACE HELBIG: Yay, hi.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.470
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, awesome book.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.140
So I have a cousin in
Australia who's a huge fan.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.430
I'm like, autographed copy,
this is going to be great.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.520
And then I flipped to how
to do the walk of shame,

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.140
I'm like no I'm not
going to do that.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.570
GRACE HELBIG: What?

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.400
MARK DOUGLAS: You're not
going to do the walk of shame?

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.191
AUDIENCE: No, I am.

00:25:48.191 --> 00:25:49.022
But she's 15.

00:25:49.022 --> 00:25:50.480
GRACE HELBIG: But
here's the thing.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.230
You don't set out to
do the walk of shame.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.389
The walk of shame just
happens to you sometimes.

00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:56.180
AUDIENCE: I will make
sure to let her know.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.080
GRACE HELBIG: And you've got to
let her know that it exists out

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.950
there, because unfortunately,
it can be a walk of fame,

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.480
if you do right.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.448
TODD WOMACK: I believe they
call it a walkie in Australia.

00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:07.656
AUDIENCE: In Australia, yeah.

00:26:07.656 --> 00:26:09.010
TODD WOMACK: Oh, I did
a walkie last night.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.550
MARK DOUGLAS: A
walkabout of shame.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.341
TODD WOMACK: A bit of
a walkabout of shame.

00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:14.734
MARK DOUGLAS: That's when
you've got a lot to regret.

00:26:14.734 --> 00:26:16.650
TODD WOMACK: But you had
a question for Grace.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:17.233
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:17.233 --> 00:26:18.890
A quick observation
and a question.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.580
So one, could you package up
all the photos you've taken here

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.340
and just put them
up on the internet?

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.570
Because I could use this
in every single PowerPoint

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:26.890
presentation I make.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.060
Because stock photos suck.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.030
And this is awesome.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.261
GRACE HELBIG: Oh
yeah, absolutely.

00:26:31.261 --> 00:26:32.010
AUDIENCE: Request.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.910
I will pay cash
money for that, too.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:34.812
GRACE HELBIG: Oh, OK.

00:26:34.812 --> 00:26:36.020
AUDIENCE: New business model.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.960
GRACE HELBIG: Wow, OK.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.680
I defer you to my
manager, Ken Treusch,

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.360
who is sitting in the back
of the audience somewhere.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.054
Yeah, sure.

00:26:45.054 --> 00:26:46.470
AUDIENCE: My
question was actually

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.011
related to what you
were talking mind

00:26:48.011 --> 00:26:51.370
in terms of mainstream
media and what you're doing.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.167
So vlogging was not a
thing, back in the day.

00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:56.000
I don't know if we
called it something else.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.958
But it was not a thing.

00:26:56.958 --> 00:26:58.207
And you guys made it a thing.

00:26:58.207 --> 00:26:59.290
It's an actual profession.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.730
And a lot of people want
to-- a lot of young kids

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.770
want to grow up to
become vloggers.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.040
But you've also transitioned
into this more mainstream world

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.250
of filmmaking or, quote unquote,
scripted content to an extent.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:16.080
I've heard a lot of YouTubers
come up and say, hey,

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.177
I'm drawing a line.

00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:19.010
Sawyer did this recently,
where he was like,

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.824
I'm drawing a line.

00:27:20.824 --> 00:27:22.490
I started off as a
blogger, but I really

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.800
want to be a filmmaker.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.490
That's how I identify myself.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.620
I've been doing snorting
cinnamon videos,

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.060
but that's not who I am.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.600
I'm going to not do those--
he actually said that.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.050
I'm not going to
do those anymore.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.620
Do you have-- are you seeing
more of this around you?

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.120
Do you have a point
of view on this?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.320
GRACE HELBIG: I mean,
I think JacksGap

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.486
did the same thing recently.

00:27:39.486 --> 00:27:41.250
They wanted to be
considered filmmakers

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.650
rather than YouTubers.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:47.430
And I mean, if you really
want to categorize yourself

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.140
or identify yourself
with something,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.690
cool, awesome,
more power to you.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.310
I think because media's
changing so much, constantly, ,

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:59.530
that those kind of
categories or identifications

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.970
aren't necessarily the
same as they used to be.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:07.090
I prefer to pioneer into maybe
some sort of hybrid zone.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.710
I think you can do both.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.330
And I think there
is value in both.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.871
And one of the things
that we set out

00:28:11.871 --> 00:28:14.990
to do with "Camp Dakota,"
that we're all really proud

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.190
was a success, was,
by taking something

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.570
like making a film, a
feature length piece of film

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.657
but making it personal
the way a vlog is.

00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:26.490
My YouTube channel at
the time, Daily Grace,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.990
became a behind the scenes look
every day while I was on set.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.680
I vlogged the
people in the crew.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.050
I vlogged the cast.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:36.120
I vlogged the entire process
of making a film from start

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.080
to finish, to the point that
our boom operator got recognized

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.510
in a Starbucks, because
he was in the vlogs.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:46.500
So when the film came out, the
audience, in my point of view,

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.150
has that much more
relationship with that piece.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.150
They knew what it
was like on set.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.890
They knew what it
was like to make it.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.410
And that's why vlogging,
I think is so interesting,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.050
because it allows you this
personal look in to someone's

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.130
life that you don't
normally get to see.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.900
And when you see films or
traditional television shows,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.520
it's very presentational
instead of conversational.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.980
And we really
wanted "Camp Dakota"

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.542
to be an interactive experience
in a very traditional form.

00:29:13.542 --> 00:29:15.500
And that's what I want
with my television show.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.770
That's what I want
with the book.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.400
That's what I want
with anything else

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.055
that I do in the future is
to have it be a conversation.

00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:25.180
I don't want to be an art
museum that just presents

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.280
a bunch of pieces of work, and
asks people to come look at it,

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.180
and then that's it.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.000
And they can either
like it or not.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.620
I want to be
standing next to it,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.040
saying what do
you think of this,

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.820
and find out what they think.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.470
And if they hate it, they're
out of the art museum.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.550
Thanks.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.843
MARK DOUGLAS: Great answer.

00:29:41.843 --> 00:29:44.500
GRACE HELBIG: Thanks.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.200
TODD WOMACK: Here's
one over here.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.110
GRACE HELBIG: Hi.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.600
AUDIENCE: I am on the Creative
Agency team here at Google.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.470
So this is a question
that keeps coming up

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:56.290
to us from agencies
and from clients.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.410
How do we work with YouTube
stars or YouTube influencers?

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.190
And how do you work with brands?

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.440
Or how do you decide which
brands you might work with?

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.130
GRACE HELBIG: Sure.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.860
This happens a lot, because
everyone wants to know,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.330
one, how do you make
money on YouTube?

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.455
And a lot of it has to do
with working with brands.

00:30:11.455 --> 00:30:14.690
And so it's a huge issue
or a thing to think about.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.850
For me, my most successful
brand partnership

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.210
was with Saint Ives.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.910
And it worked because
my parameters are,

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.110
is this a brand that I
like, on just a human level,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.150
outside of promoting
them in any way?

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.635
Two, is this a brand that makes
sense for my audience to like?

00:30:32.635 --> 00:30:35.460
Saint Ives, females,
makes sense.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.730
And three, do they
understand my brand

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.520
as much as I understand theirs?

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.710
And Saint Ives came
to me with an idea

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.970
to promote this new lotion
spray that they had.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:49.105
And I said, OK, can I make
the dumbest lotion commercial

00:30:49.105 --> 00:30:50.070
of all time?

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.400
And they said,
yes, within reason.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.740
And so they allowed me, through
collaboration with them,

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.530
to make this really
stupid lotion commercial

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.600
and to very openly talk about
how I made this stupid lotion

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.330
commercial.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.640
And it lived on their
YouTube channel.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.010
And all of the comments
were-- everyone

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.660
understood that it
was a commercial.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.201
And they understood because we
weren't trying to hide that it

00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:12.880
wasn't.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.880
And they really love
the fact that it

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.850
was just out in the open.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.650
The audience is very smart.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.444
And they don't-- they hate
you if you assume that

00:31:21.444 --> 00:31:23.860
they're dumb, and they're not
going to know that I'm going

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.920
to sneak this Pepsi
in this video,

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.090
and they'll have no idea.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.070
So I think for influencers
to work with brands,

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.560
the brand has to
respect-- the brand,

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.610
obviously, respects themselves.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.740
They built their own brand.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.290
So they have to
respect the influencer

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.290
to have created their
brand as strongly as they

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.790
think they've created their own.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.490
And so it changes
from person to person,

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.180
depending on what
their standards are.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.950
But I think having trust
in the relationship

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.840
that the influencer
has with their audience

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.340
is huge for a brand to do.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.200
MARK DOUGLAS: Because you
YouTube for-- this generation

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.390
is like-- it's like
punk rock, in a way.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.850
It's not as dirty.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.412
But it is definitely
revolutionary.

00:32:08.412 --> 00:32:10.870
And they don't want you slipping
something into their food.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:11.912
And they know.

00:32:11.912 --> 00:32:14.690
But if you say-- they
also get that people

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:15.910
need to make a living.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.430
And if you admit,
hey, we're doing this.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.780
You got to enjoy this
video because of Kit Kats.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.470
They're cool with it.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.020
But it's the sneaking it in the
middle of a two minute video,

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.580
where they're like,
what the crap?

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.210
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
kids are very ornery.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.340
Teenagers love to be
emotional about stuff.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.330
So don't give them any reason
to get upset about anything.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.980
Just be like, I told you.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.000
I told you this was
Kit Kat sponsored.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.090
So you can't get upset
that I didn't tell you.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.827
TODD WOMACK: Now eat
your damn Kit Kat.

00:32:45.827 --> 00:32:47.910
MARK DOUGLAS: And the nice
is the other commenters

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:50.966
will be like, she
said that it was--

00:32:50.966 --> 00:32:53.090
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, they're
all very self-policing,

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.140
which is very-- it's cool.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.550
I don't have to be the bad guy.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.760
They're all shitting on each
other for me, which is great.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.900
MARK DOUGLAS: You can just
walk away from the computer.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.600
Let it happen.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.690
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, that's
a good dynamic to set up.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.780
MARK DOUGLAS: Can we
be in "Camp Dakota 2"?

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.200
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, if
it ever existed, sure.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.200
MARK DOUGLAS: I wanted
to pitch some characters.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.092
GRACE HELBIG: Five Freds lost
in the woods, "Camp Dakota 2."

00:33:16.092 --> 00:33:18.550
MARK DOUGLAS: One of us could
be the old man who warns them

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.758
that the camp has a death curse.

00:33:20.758 --> 00:33:22.133
GRACE HELBIG: No,
a lot of people

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.919
ask us if we're doing
a "Camp Dakota 2,"

00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:24.960
and I don't think we are.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.530
Because "Camp Dakota" was
a really special experience

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:28.230
for all of us.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:32.340
We want to continue making
other potential long form

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.370
pieces of content.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:34.500
But "Camp Dakota"--

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.290
MARK DOUGLAS: About
different camps.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.170
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.707
"Camp Blakota."

00:33:38.707 --> 00:33:40.040
TODD WOMACK: But that's a thing.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.498
You establish
something on YouTube.

00:33:41.498 --> 00:33:44.620
Once it gets popular,
you oftentimes--

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.870
MARK DOUGLAS: Do more of that.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.770
TODD WOMACK: --everyone has
to stick to that formula.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.254
You referenced Epic Meal Time.

00:33:50.254 --> 00:33:51.920
They're definitely
doing the same thing.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.050
And they've done
a great job at it.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.300
How do you guys feel about that?

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.090
GRACE HELBIG: I think
you can't apologize

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.006
for trying something
different, I think.

00:34:03.006 --> 00:34:04.380
I tell people a
lot, when they're

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.130
trying to make their
own YouTube channels,

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.280
that your YouTube channel
is like hosting a party.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.560
And so you create all the
party rules for your party.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.679
As long as your guests know
this is a costume party.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.370
Everyone dress up
like blah, blah, blah.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.730
And they come, and they dress
up, and they have a great time.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.750
But if they don't know what
the rules are, and they show up

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:21.666
to your party, and they're
expecting something

00:34:21.666 --> 00:34:26.270
that you didn't tell them,
then that's a problem.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:30.310
If you want to veer off--
Sawyer wants to do more films.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.734
He told his audience, this
is how it's going to be,

00:34:32.734 --> 00:34:33.650
letting them all know.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.070
And I think just
being upfront, and not

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:42.551
apologizing for trying
things, is important.

00:34:42.551 --> 00:34:44.380
MARK DOUGLAS: That's
something that-- I've

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.400
had this writing workshop I've
been doing, writing comedy

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.429
for YouTube.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.949
One of your little tips
is actually in there,

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.400
where you said that you're
just thinking of the one guy--

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:53.880
GRACE HELBIG: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.255
MARK DOUGLAS: --that thinks
it's hilarious, and making it

00:34:56.255 --> 00:34:57.110
for him basically.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:02.090
But I always say that you have
to-- it's a lot easier for you

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.490
jump to other things if you
let the audience in and let

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:05.460
them know who you are.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.710
Because you do that very well.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.990
I think people will
follow you and Hannah

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.990
wherever you want to go.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.620
And it's not about
get drunk more.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.176
They just love Hannah.

00:35:15.176 --> 00:35:17.600
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, Hannah
has become a personality,

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.640
outside of just this
person that gets drunk.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.101
She is a brain with
thoughts and feelings.

00:35:24.101 --> 00:35:24.600
Who knew?

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.279
She's a human.

00:35:26.279 --> 00:35:28.070
MARK DOUGLAS: Who can
talk to the President

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.800
the United States without
blinking, or stuttering,

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.490
or mumbling.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.376
I was blown away by her.

00:35:34.376 --> 00:35:35.250
GRACE HELBIG: I know.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.080
She was so hopped up on that.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.961
Yeah, yeah.

00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:39.710
TODD WOMACK: We have
a question over here.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.090
Go ahead.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.450
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
how much planning you

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.935
do for your videos, because
it seems very much like just

00:35:46.935 --> 00:35:48.310
you're just having
fun, if you're

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.420
doing it with Hannah and Mamrie.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.020
But clearly, you
do a lot of work.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.540
And you have a lot of improv
skills and things like that.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.280
How much of that is pre-planned?

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.250
And how much is just
everything's crazy?

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.930
GRACE HELBIG: Well,
for years my videos

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.650
were-- I would either have--
either an idea would hit me,

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.240
in very vague general terms.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.590
And then I would turn my
camera on and just improvise

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:12.800
for 15 minutes.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.360
And then when I
edited it, that's

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.760
where I would sort
of put whatever

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.560
the story was together.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.417
And that was my
routine of doing that.

00:36:20.417 --> 00:36:21.500
And it worked really well.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.800
And I'm finding now that
sometimes that works for me.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.970
And then sometimes
having a little bit more

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.040
of a pre-plan, and a
little bit more thought,

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.280
and writing some things down,
and organizing my thoughts

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.930
is more helpful.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:36.430
My brain is a lot busier in a
lot of different mediums now.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.950
So I don't have all
of the capacity just

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.960
to focus on videos,
like I used to,

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.800
which is a bummer sometimes.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.456
So sitting down and
writing things out more

00:36:46.456 --> 00:36:48.570
has been more
helpful for me now.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.590
That said, it's still
literally the day before.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.220
I have to edit my video
tonight to put up tomorrow.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.550
And I shot it last night
and wrote it last night.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.207
So it's all still of the moment
kind of things happening.

00:37:00.207 --> 00:37:02.540
TODD WOMACK: Do you ever think
about-- I mean obviously,

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.140
you're big enough
to hire an editor.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.170
You live in Los
Angeles, where they're

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.600
like sidewalks out there.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.280
GRACE HELBIG: Yes.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.050
I've dabbled with
hiring an editor.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.130
And it is still
on my to-do list.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.000
I think a lot of
YouTubers-- and I'm

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.090
sure you guys can relate to
this-- are control freaks.

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:20.920
It's your content,
coming from your brain.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.570
MARK DOUGLAS: We just
hover over their shoulder.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.810
TODD WOMACK: It is a very--
you really have to match

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.550
styles and sensibilities.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.030
GRACE HELBIG: And
for me, I think

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.780
the editing became a huge part
of what my voice is online.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.640
It wasn't just this 10 minute,
unedited thing of me talking.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.380
It was--

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.338
MARK DOUGLAS: That's
where you write the thing.

00:37:40.338 --> 00:37:42.700
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, the
nuances-- and so for me,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.600
it's terrifying.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.975
Because a lot of
times, I'll just

00:37:44.975 --> 00:37:47.480
shoot 15 minutes of
complete and utter nonsense

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.480
that doesn't make sense.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.510
And for me to be
like, hey stranger.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.740
Here, take this 15
minutes of terrible

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.223
and make it into
something cool for me.

00:37:55.223 --> 00:37:57.754
TODD WOMACK: 15 more minutes
of my face, here you go.

00:37:57.754 --> 00:37:59.920
MARK DOUGLAS: I've heard a
lot of YouTubers struggle

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.490
with that.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:04.097
They get-- even Shay Carl had
an editor for five minutes

00:38:04.097 --> 00:38:05.680
and then just was
like, you know what?

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.570
Even though I'm a
millionaire now,

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.209
I still need to
get those moments.

00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:13.750
I don't trust anybody
else with them.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.880
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, I mean, I've
started this new podcast that's

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.320
half audio and half video.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.580
And there is an editor that
edits the video portions

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.700
of those, Because that's a
bigger three camera shoot.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.300
It's a bigger
project unto itself.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.826
But still the
smaller videos-- I do

00:38:27.826 --> 00:38:29.200
something called
fry diary, which

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.760
is my version of day
in the life vlogging.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.440
It's kind of a week in recap.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.740
And I edit those, because that's
really fun for me to edit.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.960
And I enjoy doing that.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.410
Eventually, if I get myself
into a rhythm or schedule,

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.830
an editor could be a good thing.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.020
But for right now-- also my
schedule's all over the place.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.470
Handing someone something at
midnight on a Tuesday night

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.557
and saying, I need this uploaded
in eight hours just sounds--

00:38:54.557 --> 00:38:56.890
MARK DOUGLAS: You just don't
want to do that to someone.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.931
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, there's
a human quality there

00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:00.190
that I feel really bad about.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.155
TODD WOMACK: That's
what the money's for.

00:39:02.155 --> 00:39:03.240
You would pay that person.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.350
And then they would expect--

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.891
GRACE HELBIG: So if anyone wants
to donate to the Kickstarter

00:39:06.891 --> 00:39:08.980
to make those editors that
they have get new jobs,

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.039
that'd be great.

00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:11.830
TODD WOMACK: Do you
have any more questions

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:12.900
from the audience?

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.170
I think we're-- we've
got a few more minutes.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:16.211
MARK DOUGLAS: Here we go.

00:39:18.864 --> 00:39:21.030
TODD WOMACK: You have to
walk around it three times.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.113
MARK DOUGLAS: He's going
over there-- there he is.

00:39:23.113 --> 00:39:25.057
AUDIENCE: You recently
did a Reddit AMA.

00:39:25.057 --> 00:39:25.890
GRACE HELBIG: I did.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.360
That was terrifying.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.200
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about that.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.180
I've always wondered, how
do you pick the questions

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:30.970
that you answer?

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.299
Because there's questions
being generated every second.

00:39:33.299 --> 00:39:35.340
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, that
was really overwhelming.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.970
I usually stay away from
Reddit, because Reddit

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.160
has torn my butthole apart.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.570
They do not like me.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:46.850
Redditors have a different
quality of comedy than I do.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.000
And they also only like me
if I'm naked, apparently.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.590
So I learned a lot.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.060
I tried to answer
questions that I might not

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.510
have answered other places,
because a lot of the people

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.150
that were asking
questions seemed

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.250
to have come from me
tweeting about this.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.500
So they might have seen a
lot of these answers before.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.320
So I tried to pick some
things that I haven't really

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.200
talked about.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.669
And then, it was mostly just
fast and furious, stream

00:40:10.669 --> 00:40:12.460
of consciousness-- the
way I wrote my book,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.876
very stream of
consciousness, just

00:40:13.876 --> 00:40:18.322
answering things that I saw that
I had an immediate answer for.

00:40:18.322 --> 00:40:20.280
Because there was a lot
of questions coming in,

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.520
I wanted to try
and answer as many

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.936
as I could in that
period of time,

00:40:22.936 --> 00:40:26.750
without spending too
much time on one thing.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:31.170
And also, because the book
is a more personal piece

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.530
of content for me,
trying to answer

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:37.750
the more personal questions
directly connected to it.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.940
Thank you for the question.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.234
So completely random.

00:40:40.234 --> 00:40:41.400
TODD WOMACK: This gentleman.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.430
AUDIENCE: Hey, Grace.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.180
Thanks for coming.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.400
GRACE HELBIG: Sure,
thank you for having me.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.774
AUDIENCE: You've
done a great job

00:40:45.774 --> 00:40:50.526
of packaging different types
of shows throughout the week.

00:40:50.526 --> 00:40:51.900
Can you talk about
the importance

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.810
of doing that, labeling
a type of video

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.530
a Friday or Saturday thing?

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.970
And what is the
importance of having that?

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.020
GRACE HELBIG: For a
long time, Daily Grace

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.630
was started through a website
called Mydamnchannel.com.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:10.530
And the videos from 2008 to 2010
lived only a Mydamnchannel.com.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.670
And in 2010, we brought
Daily Grace over to YouTube.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.290
And I sat down with
a development guy

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:17.400
at Mydamnchannel.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.930
And for the first two years,
it was literally every day

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.020
waking up, being like,
what is funny then

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.920
I can make a video
about for two minutes,

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.400
having no structure at all?

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.230
And so we sat down before
it launched on YouTube

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.650
to create a structure,
to create categories

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.620
for each of the days of the
week, so that I at least,

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.090
instead of pulling
from anything,

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.800
could pull within
these parameters.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.120
And I realized that
that was really helpful

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.050
in the growth of the channel,
because people knew--

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.555
the same way you watch
television, because you know,

00:41:49.555 --> 00:41:52.250
when "30 Rock" was on, it was
going to be on Thursday nights

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.880
at 10 o'clock.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.945
You knew exactly when
it was going to happen.

00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:56.820
People know if they want
to see me commenting

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.830
on comments, that'll
happen Tuesdays.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.080
And so they know what
day they want to tune in.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.040
It was, I think,
for the audience,

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.200
a really easy way for them
to consume the content,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.959
because they just knew.

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:11.500
They could see exactly what they
were getting themselves into

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.100
and exactly what
they wanted to watch

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.359
or what they wanted to avoid.

00:42:14.359 --> 00:42:16.400
And I think it's really
helpful for anyone that's

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.580
starting a channel,
also for your own brain,

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.260
so that you have structure
while you're creating it.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.180
And then they have
structure for consuming it.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:24.950
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:25.777
GRACE HELBIG: Sure.

00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:27.360
TODD WOMACK: We've
one more over here.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.776
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of Daily Grace,

00:42:28.776 --> 00:42:30.960
so what went into your
thoughts, switching

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.570
from being partnered with a
larger company to starting out

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.150
on your own?

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.840
And what are the key
differences in your job

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.900
that you've experienced
by making that transition?

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.050
TODD WOMACK: And can you
explain for the people

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.560
don't know what
you actually did?

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.310
GRACE HELBIG: Sure, so
my YouTube experience

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.310
started with a channel
called Daily Grace,

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.820
which was co-created
with a company called

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.570
Mydamnchannel.com in 2008.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.650
And like I said, I made
videos for them five days

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.650
a week on just their website.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.850
And in 2010, we moved
Daily Grace over

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.450
to its own YouTube channel.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:05.330
And from 2010 to end of
2013, end of last year,

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.410
it grew to 2.2
million subscribers.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.470
But I didn't own the content.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.770
All of the content was
owned by Mydamnchannel.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.750
I was paid as an
independent contractor.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:16.770
So to me--

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.860
TODD WOMACK: That damn channel.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.290
GRACE HELBIG: They're great.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:22.170
MARK DOUGLAS: They're
nice people, actually.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:23.753
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
they're very nice.

00:43:23.753 --> 00:43:28.550
So I had no idea that
YouTube could be a job,

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.210
and that owning your own
content was even a thing.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.590
It wasn't until I met
people like Hannah

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.340
that I started talking to them
about their new-found YouTube

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.080
careers and what that entailed.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.180
And that entailed
owning your content,

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.210
which was just such a--

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:43.460
MARK DOUGLAS: And maybe a car.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.640
GRACE HELBIG: --and maybe a car,
maybe a brand deal, who knew?

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:52.030
So I felt so-- oh, shit.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.510
I'm in a bad place right now.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.850
And I felt like-- any time I
went to a YouTube convention

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.600
or was around YouTube
people, I didn't

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.820
feel like an authentic
member of the community.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.620
Numbers to me didn't
really mean anything.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.950
I mean, they were, I guess,
validating on some level.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.300
But I wasn't getting
paid more or wasn't

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.310
seeing any financial differences
the way a lot of people were.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:18.570
And so it was, in
that way, really great

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.630
to only have to
focus on the comedy.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:22.690
And that was it.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:23.710
That was really nice.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.430
So at the end of 2013,
we couldn't really

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.500
reach a mutual negotiation
that worked for both parties.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.110
So I decided to leave
Mydamnchannel and start

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:36.270
my own channel, It's
Grace, on YouTube

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.740
at the beginning of this
year, which was amazing.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.650
I felt like I have arrived.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.410
I'm a real member
of YouTube now.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.330
This is so cool.

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:45.090
I own my content.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.121
Wow, this is crazy.

00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:47.003
TODD WOMACK: It took six years.

00:44:47.003 --> 00:44:48.336
GRACE HELBIG: It took six years.

00:44:48.336 --> 00:44:48.990
But I'm here.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.805
And so--

00:44:49.805 --> 00:44:52.430
MARK DOUGLAS: It must have been
nice to get that daily word out

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.940
of there.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.170
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah, yeah,
that was part of it, too.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.420
MARK DOUGLAS: Quarterly Grace.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.040
GRACE HELBIG: Yeah,
I was making--

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.670
I started It's Grace trying to
make it as similar as legally

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.500
possible as I could
to Daily Grace,

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.025
so that the audience
didn't feel.

00:45:05.025 --> 00:45:07.550
I mean teenagers, like
I said, are emotional.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:08.440
They hate change.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.380
So I wanted to be
as-- make it as easy

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.590
a transition as
possible for them.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.660
And then I realized, with
everything that's happening,

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.550
writing a book and
all this, I couldn't

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.370
create the quality
of video that I

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:22.860
wanted to create
five days a week.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.760
So in the beginning of August,
I went down to three videos

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.420
a week.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.660
And that was really cool,
because I could do that.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.000
Because I own my channel.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.170
And I was my boss.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:33.820
And so that was
one of the things

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.680
that I learned, starting
this new channel,

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.790
is that I have the
creative control.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:38.570
It's my party.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.530
I get to create the rules.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.980
And it's been really great.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.790
And now, I feel like I'm
in another transitional,

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:49.180
evolutionary period
of my comedy and voice

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.670
and going to the next level.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.320
And what is the next thing?

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.460
Doing all of this
other media stuff.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.704
It's been really cool.

00:45:56.704 --> 00:45:57.620
It's been really cool.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.328
I don't know what's
going to happen next.

00:45:59.328 --> 00:46:00.517
But I'm enjoying it so far.

00:46:00.517 --> 00:46:01.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.030
GRACE HELBIG: Thank you.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.350
TODD WOMACK: I think that is
about the time that we have,

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:08.250
unless you would
like to say anything

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.070
to the fine people
assembled here.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:11.210
GRACE HELBIG: No,
thank you guys for--

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.110
TODD WOMACK: The real
reason we brought you here.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.060
MARK DOUGLAS: It's amazing
that you own your content,

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.180
by the way, just
on a personal note.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.090
Because you are the
people that helped

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.700
invent what this whole thing is.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.540
When I think of quintessential
YouTuber, I think of you.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:22.910
GRACE HELBIG: Oh,
that's very sweet.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.340
MARK DOUGLAS: And thanks for
coming out and talking to us.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.500
GRACE HELBIG: Thank
you for having me.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.393
Thank you for coming.

00:46:26.393 --> 00:46:28.476
TODD WOMACK: Don't forget
forget to get the books.

00:46:28.476 --> 00:46:29.230
The books.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.860
There they are.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.582
GRACE HELBIG: They're
signed by my hands.
