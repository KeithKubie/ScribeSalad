00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.990
Okay.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.570
Here's the object I came up with.

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:07.330
We can see that restoring name, role and contacts, as well as,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.250
welcome message and skills as the keys in this object.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.980
John Doe is the value for name, web developer is the value for role.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.180
Notice how there are commas after every value.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.650
Inside context, we're storing an object.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.020
We know it's an object because we see the curly braces here and here.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.410
Inside this object, we have a few more keys and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.759
a few more values for contact information.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.210
After the object, we have a comma then we have our welcome message.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.770
And then array for our skills.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.130
Inside the array, noted by these square brackets, we see four skills.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.980
Then we finish up with bioPic, which is a link to a URL with our image.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.380
Notice that after this last value, we don't have a coma,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.210
and then we finish up the object with another curly brace.
