&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj:

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.600
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.110
[ Silence ]

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Laila
Enayat-Seraj, a person from my past,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.910
a, a wonderful woman
that I met many years ago

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.290
on the campus at American
University.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.450
She, she was the daughter of the
Ambassador of Afghanistan in Cairo,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.260
and she came to the
American University

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.270
in Cairo to study economics.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.060
And we all thought she was the,
the most elegant lady on campus.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.500
And she is, she was and she
is a very accomplished woman.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.370
And Leila, tell us a little bit.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.670
Where were you born?

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.020
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj:
I was born in Kabul.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.320
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.620
And --

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.920
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: And
then I finished my studies

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.490
in the Malalai High School
for Girls, and then I went

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.470
with my father on diplomatic
missions, and then it brought me

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.060
to Cairo where I went to
the American University

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.480
where I had the pleasure to meet
you and my other classmates.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.320
And from Cairo I went
to America to continue.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.430
Since my father went
back to Afghanistan,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.940
I went there to continue my
studies, and the first university

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.660
that answered me was Loyola.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.740
I had written to many
universities, but I couldn't wait.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.530 position:56%
I didn't want to waste time, so I
went to Chicago in Loyola University

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.440
and continued my studies
there, and I got a BA

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.090
in Economics, Political Science.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.700
And then I worked on my MA.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.150
At that point I dropped the
economics and I, I concentrated

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.760
on international relations
in United Nations.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.520
And because it was my father's
wish to, to go into politics,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.560
although myself, I wanted to,
I'm a born poet if you will

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.290
and I want to do literature.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.290
My father said to me that you will
learn literature any time yourself.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.320
So I, my official studies
were in the field of politics.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.050
But when I came to Afghanistan,
probably my father had in mind

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.100
for me to go and work
in the foreign office.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.300
That never worked out because
then the revolution came.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.740
Not quite revolution but the
White Revolution as they call it,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.960
during Prince Daoud's [inaudible].

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.910
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So you spent,
after your, after your, your MA

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.760
and when you returned
to Afghanistan.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.420
How long did you stay
in Afghanistan?

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.720
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Two years.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.020
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Two years.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.320
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Mm-hmm.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.170
And then I left Afghanistan
because I felt

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.110
that I could not continue my
studies there because I had

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.480
to write my thesis for my
doctorate, which I had passed the,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.270
the exams for, the entry for.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.570
What do you call it?

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.870
Entrance --

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.170
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Yeah, entrance exam.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.470
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj:
Examination for doctorate.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.450
But I could not find the
material, so I thought I'd go

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.060
out somewhere in Europe or America.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.930
And I sat for an, an examination
at Fulbright, for which I did pass,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.470
and I was awarded the, the
grant, but unfortunately --

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.220
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: You were
still in Afghanistan at the time?

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.890
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Yeah,
in Kabul, in Kabul, yeah.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.190
Yeah.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.490
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: You
were awarded the --

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.790
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Yeah.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.090
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Fulbright.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.390
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: The
grant, the Fulbright grant, yeah.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.690
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
-- in Afghanistan.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.990
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: That, that
would have been a fantastic thing.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.290
That's exactly what, what I
wanted to go out and work again

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.840
and then some American school for
my doctorate, but unfortunately

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.660
that did not materialize
because the regime had changed,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.710
and when I went for permission.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.090
I had to go and have the permission
of the Minister of Education,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.710
and the minister said to me that
I had seen Europe and America,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.520 position:56%
and this was now, I should give
this right to other Afghans to have,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.610
to have their opportunity
to go and see America.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.090
And I told him that it was my
merit and I studied for it.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.750
I worked for it and I passed it.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.220
So unfortunately I was not
granted, the Fullbright said to me,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.520
the Office of Fulbright in Kabul.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.580 position:56%
They, they were distressed about it,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.040
but they said they couldn't
do anything because --

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.340
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Because the government --

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.640
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: -- the
government had to accept you.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.940
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
-- had to accept you.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.240
That's right.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.540
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj:
-- approve of it.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.990
Then the first opportunity that I,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.390
that arose that we could buy a
passport, I bought a passport

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.230
for Switzerland, and I left
Afghanistan with, with a suitcase

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.580
of 20 kilos, summer clothes.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Had the Soviet --

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.190
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: No,
Soviet had not come yet, no.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.490
Just pre-Soviet.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.790
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yeah.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.090
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj:
But you could feel it.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.390
You could feel that
everything was very [inaudible].

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.270
Then I went to, chose
to go to Switzerland,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.570
where my brother was working
in Switzerland at that time,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.430
and I thought I'd go for a while

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.450
and then maybe the situation
will improve and come back.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.310
I never thought that that
would be the last time

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.610
that I'd see my country.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.900
So then in Switzerland I had the,
the good luck of finding a job

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.900
in the United Nations in Geneva

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.200
since I had specialized
in the United Nations.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.710
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So what
office was it at United Nations

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.180
where you, where you worked?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.280
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: I worked in
the Economic Commission for Europe,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.330
which is a very old, one of the
old offices of the United Nations,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.140
which is directly connected with
the ECOSOC, and it was very useful

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.270 position:56%
at the time of what we call the Cold
War because we were, we were dealing

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.000
with economic, with investments

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.710
and economic contracts
between governments.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.570
So then our office
would actually sort

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.510
of a [inaudible] for
them or immediate.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.940 position:56%
No, not immediate, a bridge between
because they could not have anything

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.800
on private, private sections.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.210
It had to be through government.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.590
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So
your economics did help!

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.550
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: It did
a little bit, a little bit,

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.040
although I, I edited,
I edited the magazine,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.130
which was called a newsletter.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.020
It was a newsletter,
Joint Ventures Investment,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.590
because they started this joint
venture business in south,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.720
in European, Eastern Europe,
under Soviet block at the time.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.030
And then it worked very well
until the fall of communism.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.480
But still, then I was sent
to, I was sort of put, I, I,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.610
I had signed up for many missions,
peace missions because I thought

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.130
at least I will also continue
with something to, to,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.380
the peace work of the
United Nations.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Around the world.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.980
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj:
Around the world.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.280
And since I was a member,
staff member,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.420
permanent staff member
of the United Nations.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.670
So then I went to Haiti.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.100
But unfortunately I was, I fell ill

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.210
and I could not, you
couldn't do that.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.810
But in the meantime, I had
also, while I was working

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.840
in the United Nations, I
wanted to be a translator.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.430 position:56%
So I passed the exam with Cambridge.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.730
I passed the exam.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.610
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And you
speak several languages?

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.910
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Yeah.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.210
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Mm-hmm.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.510
Which, which language.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.810
Well, you're fluent
in English, French --

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.330
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: English,
French, Arabic I studied,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.270
which I never managed to speak.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.570
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
And Persian as well.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.760
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Persian is
my mother tongue, and a little bit

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.030
of pashtun which is also
our national language.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.330
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.630
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: I know a
little German because when I was

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.850
in Prague I refused to learn
Czech language, so I learned --

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.150
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: German --

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.450
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: And
that helped me in Cairo

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.690
because there were quite a few of
my classmates that spoke German,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.450
so we used to practice our German.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.750
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.760
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: And so then
what the, the most important thing

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.030
that I did was that, of
course, I got a, a degree from,

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.730
from Cambridge, which is a degree
in literature where my, my --

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.180
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So you
went back to your passion.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.280
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: And
because I wanted to learn,

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.500
I wanted to translate the work of
art of Afghanistan and literature

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.620
and poems of, Persian poems, and --

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.570
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: [inaudible]
by this wonderful translations

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.180
that you've done of
Afghanistan poetesses.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.830
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: As it
happened, well UNESCO had a,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:15.550 position:56%
a kind of a, well no, the United
Nations actually designated the year

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.500
2000 as the year of women.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.860 position:56%
Since I'm also defender of women and
I have worked a lot, dedicated a lot

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.970
of my time to, to the
defense of Afghan women,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.960
not only for political
right but also other rights

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.630
and the literature as well.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.760
So then UNESCO was celebrating
that year and they had asked me

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.840
to translate poems of, by
Afghan poet women, which I did,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.690
and I'm very happy that I, it came
out as a very, very, really a very,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.320
very good work because
it was the first time

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.920
that anyone had taken the
initiative to translate our poetry

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.170
into a, a European language.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.470
And I chose --

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.330
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Your poetry go
back, it goes back 1,000 years.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.630
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Exactly.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.830
Exactly. The very first poet Afghan
woman, who was an Afghan princess

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:13.570
from Balkh, Rabeha Balkhi, who
was contemporary of Roudaki,

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.720
the first male poet of
the Persian language.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.510
So I translated her poems and
then also contemporary poets,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.230
about 20 Afghan poets,
and we compiled this

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.900
and this anthology exists.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.480
It's called The Hidden
Face of Afghan Women.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.900
The idea for me was that I wanted
to show a, the, a positive side

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.530
of Afghan women and
Afghan women's contribution

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.220
to our heritage, cultural heritage.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.570
And this was translated into
French as well, and, and,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.600
and I did the English
translation, so that's the --

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.880
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
you're a multifaceted artist.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.130
I know that you were
interested in dancing as well.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.290
Tell me, tell me the
lovely story of the dance

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.770
of Katya Kuryende [phonetic]
in Cairo.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.070
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj: Yeah.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.490
Well I was a student then.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.370
A student's class, and I was
very, very interested in it,

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.270
and my teacher was a Russian
emigre, liked me very, very much.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.110
She said that I did not know a
good, I didn't have good technique

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.160
because I hadn't done enough
years for the, hadn't devoted

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.430
to the technical aspect of
it, but I had natural grace.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.730
That's what she used to say.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.250
So then I was chosen to, to
dance solo the, of [inaudible]

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.660
and be the bride and dance
on the stage for school

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.570
for our, for our university.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.610
And just half an hour before
we had our last rehearsal,

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.520
she was very disappointed.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.460
She said listen, I don't
know if you can manage it.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.340
I, I really don't think so.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.530
But then as I entered the,
the scene and the applause

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.860
of the audience really
transported me.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.710 position:56%
I had this feeling of, extraordinary
feeling of actually flying,

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.580
so I didn't realize what
I was doing good or bad,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.420
but apparently it turned
out to be very --

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.720
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.020
&gt;&gt; Leila Enayat-Seraj:
-- successful.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.320
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: It was,
it was, you had rave reviews,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.310
and you were absolutely dashing.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.170
But thank you so much, Leila,
for having shared a little bit

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.960
of your life and your
achievements with us,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.630
and I wish you all the best.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.800
I know that you will be doing
wonderful things in the future.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.260
And I was again so happy to see
you again after all those years.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.460
Thank you.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.120
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
