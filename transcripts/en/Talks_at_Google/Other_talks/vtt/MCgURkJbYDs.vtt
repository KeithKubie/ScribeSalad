00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.420
Hal Varian: Okay, I'm Hal Varian.
I'm the chief economist here at Google, and

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.700
it's my pleasure to introduce Yoram Bauman.
He claims to be the world's only "stand-up

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.660
economist."
And I thought, "Gee, there's a chance for

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.039
entry here.
I could maybe try this myself."

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.560
And when Ann told me to do the introduction,
I said, "Is that really fair?" because after

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.529
all, I'm a really tough act to follow. [laughter]
But despite this, you know, I said, "Okay,

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.320
I'll give it a try."
And, "What's so hard about being a stand-up

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.080
economist?
After all, you just go to Google; you type

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.070
in 'economics jokes.'" So I tried that.
And then, a few minutes later, I typed in

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.170
"funny economics jokes." [laughter]
And then, I tried "funny economics jokes I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.640
haven't heard."
And you know, it just goes on.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.610
I realize there was more to it than really
met the naked eye.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.510
But I did come up with a story that I want
to use to introduce him.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.600
I'm not sure if this specifically applies
to economists, but at least it's a nice academic

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.530
story.
It's about the full professor and the associate

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.749
professor who are holding a debate about what
fraction of sex is fun and what fraction is

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:16.060
work.
So the full professor says, "75 percent work.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.590
25 percent fun."
And the associate professor says, "No. It's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.460
50/50."
So they're arguing, they're getting citations,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.569
they're Googling things -- and an assistant
professor comes by.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.219
They ask his opinion.
He says, "Well, I think it's 75 fun and 25

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.100
percent work."
So they argue along for awhile.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.969
Finally, a research assistant comes by.
They say, "What's your opinion?"

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.270
The research assistant says, "This is totally
obvious.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.630
It's obvious. It's 100 percent fun."
He said, "How could you be so sure?"

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.889
He said, "Well, if there were any work involved,
they'd make us do it." [laughter]

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:58.119
So, with that, I would like to introduce -- not
the assistant professor, not the associate

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.880
professor, not the full professor -- the dean
of economic comedy -- Yoram Bauman.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.340
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:17.160
Yoram Bauman: Thank you for that lovely introduction.
The setup was a bit long, but the punch line

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.390
was good.
I should -- before I forget, I should show

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.480
you my T-shirt. [laughter]
It says, "Stimulate the economy. Buy me a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.970
drink."
I used to wear one that said, "Enjoy capitalism,"

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.120
sort of in the Coca-Cola lettering.
But, as long as unemployment is above whatever

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.550
 -- 9 percent -- I think that that one's in
the closet.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.980
I also forget to tell people, "Here's a joke
that I'm really proud of," because it's not

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.940
very often that you can make up a knock-knock
joke.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.110
But I made up a knock-knock joke.
It's an economics knock-knock joke that's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.030
sweeping England.
So I have to put on my terrible British accent.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.030
Ready? Here we go.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.210
Q [Imitating a British accent] Knock knock.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.210
A Who's there?

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.210
Q Economist.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.210
A Economist who?

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.230
Q Ei cah na missed the financial crisis, but
I promise I'll do better next time.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.961
[laughter]
And the great thing about that joke is that

00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.320
I'll be able to keep telling that forever,
right?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.640
Because whatever happens in the world economy,
you can be pretty sure that, as an economist,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.120
I'll be able to say that "Ei cah na missed
it," right?

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.110
Anyway, so it's a pleasure to be here with
all of you today.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.370
And, in Hal's honor, I thought I would start
with a piece called, "What to Expect When

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.070
You're Expecting the Nobel Prize." [laughter]
So for any of you that are -- well, first

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.560
of all, I should say that I also teach part-time
at a high school in Seattle.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.080
And I share this with my high school students.
And I said, "Do you guys get the joke?"

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.150
And one of them said, "Isn't there like a
baby book called 'What to Expect When You're

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.200
Expecting?'"
And I was like, "Yeah, that's very good. How

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.210
did you know that?"
And he said, "I saw it in the movie 'Knocked

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.030
Up.'" [laughter]
So that's how education happens these days,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.850
I guess.
So this is "What to Expect When You're Expecting

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.840
the Nobel Prize."
So, first of all, you should expect an early

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.490
morning phone call from a long-dead economist.
So, when you win the Nobel Prize -- just in

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.350
case you're getting ready for that -- they
call you up at a reasonable hour Sweden time

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.860
I guess, but it's 6:00 in the morning East
Coast time -- 3:00 in the morning West Coast

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.720
time -- when they tell you that you won the
Nobel Prize.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.380
And then, a fellow calls up from the Nobel
Prize website and does an interview with you

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.709
that they record and transcribe and then post
on their website.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.790
So here's some snippets from the Nobel Prize
interview.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.910
So, the first one is with Edmund Phelps in
2006.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.470
And the interview is conducted by the editor
in chief of NobelPrize.org, whose name you'll

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.490
see in a moment.
So here's the interview, "Hello, may I speak

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.600
to Professor Phelps, please?"
And he says, "Who's calling?"

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600
And the response is, "I'm from the Nobel Foundation,
and my name is Adam Smith."

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:53.820
[laughter]
And Edmund Phelps says, "Ha ha ha."

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.340
And then, Adam Smith says, "I know it could
be a hoax call with a name like that.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.960
It's a terrible burden I carry." [laughter]
So, one of the things that you see from these

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.150
transcripts of these interviews with the Nobel
Prize winners is part of what I think US Weekly

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.560
should start running a segment called, "Nobel
Prize winners: They're just like us."

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.230
So here's more from Edmund Phelps.
The question comes in, "How are you going

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.870
to celebrate winning the Nobel Prize?" Right?
And he says, "Well, right now I'm thinking

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.490
about breakfast." [laughter]
And Adam Smith says, "Yeah, I bet it's got

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.340
to be a 2-egg day at least."
And then, Edmund Phelps starts talking about

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.230
cholesterol.
Here, Edmund's scared of cholesterol for a

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.960
long time.
But I understand the white of the egg is quite

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.170
safe.
I'll ask my wife whether perchance she has

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:45.370
an egg in the house.
One of the funniest exchanges in the transcripts

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.190
comes from Leonid Hurwicz, who's the oldest
person to win a Nobel Prize in any field.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.449
So he and his wife Evelyn -- and this is their
phone call from October 2007.

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.690
So, the phone call comes in, "Good morning,
Professor Hurwicz."

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.139
And he says, "Hello?"
And the other end says -- and his wife says,

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.980
"He's hard-of-hearing." [laughter]
And the Nobel Prize dialer says, "I'm sorry,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.030
I'll speak louder.
Can you hear me now?"

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.480
And his wife says, "Yes." [laughter]
And then, "Thank you. My name is Adam Smith."

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:27.370
And awghh! [Laughter]
So, these transcripts are actually quite funny.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.650
And one of the things that they used to do
that they no longer do -- they used to ask

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.650
the Nobel Prize winner to explain in simple
layperson's terms what they won the Nobel

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.320
Prize for.
And they no longer ask them that question.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.121
And instead what they do is, they tell them
what they won the Nobel Prize for.

00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:45.961
And then, they say, "Is that right?" [laughter]
So then, all the Nobel Prize winner has to

00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:50.040
do is say "yes."
And it actually is -- like, one of the challenges

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.389
there is really explaining, I think, your
research in real simple terms.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.020
And so, I'm here promoting this book, "The
Cartoon Introduction to Economics," which

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.370
is a super fun book.
Really, it was really fun to work on the book

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.419
with Grady Klein, who's not an economist,
but he now knows a fair amount about economics

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.210
and is a terrific illustrator.
It was a neat format -- kind of "graphic nonfiction."

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.210
And one of the fun pieces that we have throughout
the book are these cartoons about "Congratulations,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.460
You Win the Nobel Prize." So here's Jim Tobin
saying, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket."

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.960
And the king of Sweden says, "Congratulations,
you win the Nobel Prize."

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.770
And this was actually based on a true story.
And this was the impetus for this line of

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.370
jokes, because his obituary in the New York
Times told the story about how, when he went

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.010
to accept the Nobel Prize and went to give
his -- at the press conference, the reporter

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.270
said, "Well, you know, explain what you won
the Nobel Prize for."

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.860
And he did it for Portfolio Selection Theory,
which is about investment stuff.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.669
And he said, "Well, like there's alpha and
there's beta."

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:47.770
And the reporters were like, "No, no, no -- that's
too hard," right?

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.229
"Make it simple."
And he said, "Well, it's kind of like 'Don't

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.210
put all your eggs in one basket.'"
And then, headlines around the world the next

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:59.210
day said, "Economist wins Nobel Prize for
'Don't Put All Your Eggs in One Basket." [laughter]

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.040
So this is a true story, and it was the impetus
for the other jokes that we have on this.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.870
So here's John Nash who won for Game Theory,
who's figured out the optimal strategy for

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:12.870
"Rock, Paper, Scissors."
George Akerlof, who won for "Adverse Selection,"

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.150
which is related to individual health insurance
markets, saying, "Buying an individual health

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.230
insurance policy can be a real pain in the
neck."

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.789
Joseph Stiglitz "Sometimes the Invisible Hand
is Invisible Because It's Not There." [laughter]

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:26.780
 -- which is actually a classic Joseph Stiglitz
line.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.690
Daniel Kahneman, "Human beings are not always
rational."

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.020
And so, he's actually a psychologist who won
the Nobel Prize in economics for sort of his

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.890
pioneering work in behavioral economics and
looking at, you know, "When do people really

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.770
fulfill sort of the rational model that economists
sometimes use?"

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.200
So, those are some of the cool panels from
the cartoon book.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.440
And then, here's one -- I think -- my prediction
is that Marty Weitzman from Harvard is going

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.360
to win one of these days for his work on environmental
economics.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.430
And since I'm an environmental economist,
I always bet on Marty.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.200
Harvard runs a betting pool every year for
the Nobel Prize.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.690
So, I lost five dollars last year, because
he didn't win.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.130
But he did kind of pioneering work on this
idea that I'll come back and chat about a

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.580
little more later on.
So, I do call myself "The World's First and

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.270
Only Stand-up Economist."
I really only have one thing going for me

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.590
and that's low expectations. [Laughter]
Actually, that's not true.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.430
I have one other thing going for me -- I get
to make fun of macroeconomists.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.630
You know, I'm a real economist, because I
can make fun of sub-disciplines that are totally

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.500
indistinguishable to people on the outside.
You know, like people in Washington State

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.180
 -- where I live -- make fun of people in
Oregon.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.070
People in Alabama make fun of people in Mississippi.
People in prison make fun of people in graduate

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.490
school. [laughter]
I did go through five years of graduate school.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.930
I got my Ph.D. in economics only to decide
that I wanted to do stand-up comedy.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.330
You can imagine how much this thrilled my
father.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.880
He told me I'd never make it as a stand-up
economist, and I said, "Why not?"

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.880
And he said, "There's no demand." [laughter]
First joke I ever told on stage.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.510
I said, "Don't worry about it. I'm a supply-side
economist." [laughter]

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.360
I just stand up and let the jokes trickle
down.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:13.920
I believe in the Laffer Curve.
You can also tell I'm a real economist, because

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.320
I can translate plain English into incomprehensible
gibberish.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.440
But briefly, while I was in graduate school,
I had the opposite ability -- I could translate

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.230
economic gibberish into plain English.
And that's where this next bit I want to do

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.250
for you comes from.
I think some of you may have seen this on

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.290
YouTube.
If you have, don't worry -- there's new stuff

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.500
coming -- but, this is Mankiw's Principles
of Economics.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.380
So Greg Mankiw, a Harvard professor, chair
of the Counsel of Economic Advisors for President

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.959
Bush for a couple of years -- which, I'm guessing,
is probably not at the top of his resumé.

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:41.830
Also wrote the best-selling economics textbook
in the country.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.170
It's based on these ten principles.
I know the font is small, but I generally

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.080
tell people not to bother reading these.
Just take my word that you pretty much need

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.331
a Ph.D. in economics to understand them.
Fortunately, I have one.

00:10:52.331 --> 00:10:57.149
So, I've taken it upon myself to translate
these principles for the more fortunate.

00:10:57.149 --> 00:11:01.240
We're going to begin by separating them into
the first seven principles, which are microeconomics,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.870
and the last three, which are macroeconomics
 -- the difference of course being that microeconomists

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:10.660
are wrong about specific things and macroeconomists
are wrong about things in general. [laughter]

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.180
Beginning with the macroprinciples -- eight,
nine, and ten -- these all have the exact

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.550
same translation, namely "Blah, blah, blah."
[laughter]

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.779
As proof I need only remind you that macroeconomists
have successfully predicted nine out of the

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:30.170
last five recessions. [laughter]
And it's further proof we can now go up one

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.649
font size.
So, let's go back to the microprinciples.

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:36.730
The first one -- People Face Trade-offs.
The translation here is easy, "Choices are

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.080
bad."
This is a simple syllogism -- trade-offs are

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.460
bad.
Any time you have choices, you have trade-offs,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.779
therefore choices have to be bad.
As evidence that I'm actually driving the

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:50.280
research literature in economics, here's a
paper that came out in 2008 called, "Why Fewer

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.671
Options may be Better." No duh.
If you don't understand why choices are bad

00:11:56.671 --> 00:11:59.230
though, take a look at the second principle
 -- "The Cost of Something is What You Give

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.380
Up to Get It."
Translation: "Choices are Really Bad."

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.921
Now, I have a simple demonstration of this
fact.

00:12:03.921 --> 00:12:08.501
Let's say that somebody offers you a Snickers
bar, all right -- that you value at a dollar.

00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:10.840
All right?
Then what you are loosely going to think of

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.709
as your economic profit in this situation
is the dollar of this Snickers bar minus the

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:16.899
cost of what you go up to get it, which is
nothing.

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:23.220
Your economic profit is a dollar.
Thanks, Google. [laughter]

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.500
Now, to begin to see why choices are bad.
Imagine someone offers you a choice between

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.750
the Snickers bar that you value at a dollar,
right? -- and some M&amp;Ms that you value at

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.960
70 cents.
Okay, now your economic profit is only 30

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.200
cents.
You begin to understand why choices are bad.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.880
The worst possible situation, in fact, is
being offered a choice between a Snickers

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:52.670
bar and an identical Snickers bar. [laughter]
Now, people who are not trained in economics

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.149
might think that that's no different than
just being offered one Snickers bar, but that

00:12:56.149 --> 00:13:02.790
kind of sloppy thinking will never get you
a tenure-track position. [laughter]

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.279
Summarizing then: Choices are bad. Choices
are really bad.

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:08.310
I'm not going to beat around the bush with
you people.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.720
If you don't understand why choices are bad,
you're probably stupid. [chuckles]

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.291
Moving on. Principle Number 3 -- rational
People Think of the Margin.

00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:22.670
Translation: People are stupid. [laughter]
It is immediately obvious to the most casual

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.110
observer with the meanest intelligence that
people do not think of the margin.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.180
Nobody goes to the grocery store and says,
"I'm going to buy an orange.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.209
I'm going to buy another orange. I'm going
to buy another orange."

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:36.610
That joke only makes sense to economists.
[laughter]

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.329
People don't think like that, all right?
But if people don't think of the margin -- and

00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:44.959
if, as Mankiw says, "Rational people DO think
of the margin" -- we are led to a most unhappy

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:49.240
conclusion, "People are not rational."
People, in other words, are stupid.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.620
But before you despair for humanity, take
a look at the next principle -- People Respond

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.400
to Incentives.
Now, the dictionary says that 'incentive'

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.810
is a noun.
That means "Something that influences to action.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.710
Synonym: motive."
So when Mankiw says that people respond to

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:06.760
incentives, what he's saying is that people
are motivated by motives.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.100
You might think this is a bit like saying
that "Tautologies are tautological," right?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.240
I mean, people would have to be pretty stupid
to be unmotivated by motives.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.649
But remember, Principle 3 -- [laughter] -- People
are Stupid.

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:26.519
Hence, the need for Principle 4 to tell us
that People Aren't That Stupid. [laughter]

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:29.350
Summarizing again -- we move on to every economist's
favorite topic -- free trade.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.151
Principle 5 -- trade can make everyone better
off.

00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:33.810
Translation: Trade can make everyone worse
off.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.640
You may wonder how the translation of Principle
5 is the opposite of the principle itself.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.760
I have a simple proof of this fact that will
blow your mind.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.800
Here we go. I want you to compare two statements.
One of them is, "Trade can make everyone better

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.110
off" and the other one is "Trade will make
everyone better off."

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.440
Now, if you had to pick one of those two statements
to put in your best-selling economics textbook,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.630
right?
It's no contest. The second statement is clearly

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.920
better.
But Mankiw uses the first statement instead.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.410
And if you think about "Why?" there's only
one possible explanation.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.140
The second statement has got to be wrong.
[laughter]

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.460
In other words, trade can make some people
worse off, and from there, it's just a hop,

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.820
skip, and a jump to "Trade can make everyone
worse off." [laughter]

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.420
I figured some of you had some questions about
this, so I added a footnote with some details

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:26.209
 -- eat your heart out. [laughter]
Now that we've cleared that up, I want you

00:15:26.209 --> 00:15:30.740
to see the last two principles follow immediately
from Principle 5 in its translation, right?

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.870
Markets are usually a good way to organize
economic activity.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.850
In other words, Governments are Stupid.
Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.610
Governments aren't that stupid.
Follow immediately from five in its translation,

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.680
if trade can make everyone better off, then
what the heck do we need government for? Just

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.950
let people trade, right?
But, if trade can make everyone worse off,

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.029
we better have a government around to stop
people from trading, right?

00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:53.740
So there are the ten principles of economics
translated.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.501
And what I want you to notice here is how
subtle economics is, all right?

00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:01.430
Like, "People are stupid, but they're not
that stupid."

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.630
"Governments are stupid, but they're not that
stupid."

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.380
The only thing that's not subtle in economics
is that "Choices are always really, really

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.570
bad."
So, I filmed this at a science convention

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:16.370
and put it up on my website, standupeconomist.com
 -- and also on YouTube -- a couple years

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:22.540
ago, not thinking very much of it.
And I'm a little embarrassed to say that it's

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:28.000
heading for a million hits on YouTube -- [whistling
 &amp; applause] -- which is a lot for economics

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.779
jokes, okay? [laughter]
Not a lot for videos about like, puppies,

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:35.829
but it's a lot for economics jokes.
And many of the hits are because the video

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:40.639
was posted on Greg Mankiw's blog.
It turns out that he's a fan of my parody,

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:44.040
or at the very least comes from the, "There's
no such thing as bad publicity" school of

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.270
thought.
And, in fact, I got to perform in his class

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.880
at Harvard.
He teaches the introductory Ec 10 class at

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.180
Harvard, and I got to perform in his class
as the last leg of my 2008 Supply-Side World

00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:00.550
Tour -- [laughter] -- which was mostly a trip
to Israel with my father. [laughter]

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.529
But as long as I was there, I did some comedy.
And then, on my way back, I stopped at Greg's

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:05.829
class at Harvard.
And he told us -- he wasn't going to tell

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.059
his students that I was coming.
He just said there was a surprise guest who

00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:11.070
was coming to class.
But then he had to tell them that I was coming,

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.679
because some students came to his office hours
and said that there was a rumor going around

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:20.770
campus that Ben Bernanke was coming to class.
[laughter]

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:29.360
I like to think that they got the better end
of the deal on that one, but. [laughter]

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.570
So, this routine is what I like to think of
as part of a renaissance in economics humor.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.210
The idea of a renaissance -- or a resurgence
 -- in economics humor may come as a surprise

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.581
to those of you who didn't know that there
was ever a first 'surgence' of economics humor.

00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:42.900
But in fact there was.
It was in the 70s and in the early 80s and

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:48.140
included papers like "A Theory of Interstellar
Trade" by Paul Krugman, [laughter] which is

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.910
a fabulous paper.
And I'm thrilled to say that we're going to

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:56.670
be publishing it in Economic Inquiry 30 years,
or whatever, after he wrote it. So, Paul Krugman

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.930
won the Nobel Prize two years ago for his
work on Trade Theory.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.919
And he's also a big fan of science fiction.
And this paper is about if you have interstellar

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:07.429
trade -- so, if you have trade between the
solar systems -- then you probably have spaceships

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:11.299
that are traveling close to the speed of light.
So you no longer have time simultaneity.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:14.711
So, the question is, "Which clocks do you
use for calculating interest rates?" [laughter]

00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:21.720
The clocks on the spaceships or the clocks
on the planets?

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.050
Truly an amazing, amazing hilarious fabulous
paper.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.490
One, I think -- in my professional opinion
 -- it's one of the top two funniest economics

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.880
papers of all time.
The other contestant being this one, "Life

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.070
Among the Econ" by Axel Unpronounceable.
[laughter] which is a fake anthropology paper

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.240
about the Econ tribe that lives in the bleak
north.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:45.200
That also came out of Economic Inquiry.
I'm happy to say that I'm the humor editor

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.419
 -- the miscellany editor -- for Economic
Inquiry.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:54.640
So, if any of you have economics-related funny
papers, then send them my way.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.640
I tend to get things from folks who have funny
economics papers, or -- more often -- people

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.620
who think that they have funny economics papers.
Tell you about some more recent developments

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.780
in the world of economics comedy.
This paper called "Japan's Phillips Curve,"

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.730
looks like Japan.
So, if you need a refresher on the Phillips

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.090
Curve, it's this idea that came out in the
50s and 60s that there's a trade-off between

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.460
inflation and unemployment.
You can have high inflation, low unemployment,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.790
or vice versa.
But somewhere, you're always along that Phillips

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.140
Curve line, right?
And then, the 70s and 80s, we had stagflation

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.110
 -- high inflation, also high unemployment.
Robert Lucas developed the Theory of Rational

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.500
Expectations.
Economists realized it was more complicated

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.340
 -- everywhere, except in Japan.
So this paper was named the Funniest Economics

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.150
Paper of 2008.
There was considerable competition for that.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:41.130
And it was written by a Canadian, Gregor Smith.
And one of the great things about this paper

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.650
is, it's linked from his website.
And the link on his website says that the

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:53.440
"title of the paper is also the abstract,
and frankly, most of the text." [laughter]

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.370
 -- which is pretty much what we should be
aiming for in all academic papers, I think.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:04.260
The rest of the paper is taken up by this
graph here. [laughter]

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.420
So, on the x-axis, we have the unemployment
rate in Japan between 1980 and 2005.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.340
On the y-axis, we have the inflation rate.
For ease of viewing, the author rotates this

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:22.400
around the y-axis, right?
And then, there's a map of Japan. [laughter]

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.570
Extremely impressive research. [laughter]
Tell you a little bit of my own research in

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.990
economics humor.
So first of all, this paper is called "Incentive

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.740
Compatibility in the Hospital."
So this is an example of what's called a "pain

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.820
scale."
This is an actual thing that doctors and nurses

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.520
use to communicate with patients -- like,
if they don't share a common language, at

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.450
least you can point and indicate how much
pain you're in.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:45.920
So, in the US, health care accounts for about
16 percent of GDP.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.460
That hurts a whole lot. [laughter]
It's roughly like one-and-a-half to two times

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.700
more than most other rich countries pay for
health care.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.510
And compounding the problem is that a lot
of those resources are wasted because of things

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.669
that health economists study like "adverse
selection" or "moral hazard."

00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:05.990
Or the particular issue that I'm going to
focus on today is with patients who are malingering.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:11.050
So malingering is an actual medical phenomenon.
Stereotypically, somebody who's lonely -- they'll

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.240
just go to the hospital and complain of low
back pain just so someone will pay attention

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.919
to them.
And this happens enough that medical professionals

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:20.120
have tests for malingering.
So there's what's called the Axial Load Test.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.170
So if you complain of low back pain, they
might push down on your head like this and

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.120
ask you if the pain is getting worse, all
right?

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.630
If you go, "Ow, ow, ow, ow!" then they know
that you're faking it, okay?

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.770
Physiologically, it's now possible to have
enhanced low back pain as a result of that

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.530
axial load.
But my question is, why can't we just use

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.710
economic incentives instead, what economists
call "incentive compatibility"?

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.880
So my modest proposal is that, instead of
asking people this question, "How much does

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.690
the pain hurt?"
Instead, we should just ask them, "How much

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.510
would you be willing to pay to make the pain
go away?" [laughter]

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:57.970
And then, you just pick a bubble.
And so, macroeconomics -- I mentioned Robert

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.169
Lucas a few minutes ago.
He won the Nobel Prize for his work on Rational

00:22:01.169 --> 00:22:05.580
Expectations.
So, I have what I modestly call "The Lucas-Bauman

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.681
Hypothesis."
Modestly, because I could have called it "The

00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:11.020
Bauman-Lucas Hypothesis."
Let me show you what it says graphically.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.020
If we look at the amount of knowledge that
we have about macroeconomics, that we've gained

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.400
over the last 150 years, right?
It's been a steady upward trend.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:25.160
But if we look at our level of understanding
of the macroeconomy, [laughter], it's been

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.330
flat.
The Lucas-Bauman Hypothesis explains why.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.390
The answer, of course, being that "Advances
in macroeconomics produce complexities in

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:38.280
the macroeconomy" -- think like credit-default
swaps -- that offset the theoretical advances.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.299
Or in very simple layperson's terms, Macroeconomics
is Pointless.

00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:48.030
[laughter] Finally, some more economics of
global warming.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.000
So this is what I work on when I'm being an
academic.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.281
So I'll tell some jokes, then I'll tell a
little bit of serious stuff.

00:22:53.281 --> 00:22:55.000
Then, I'll go back and tell some more jokes
at the end.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.311
So, there are a bunch of economists who work
on climate change.

00:22:57.311 --> 00:23:01.110
I'm one of them.
And there are folks who also do like cost-benefit

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.860
analysis modeling of climate change.
The most famous model is Bill Nordhaus' model.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.080
At Yale, it's called the "DICE" model -- the
"Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.610
Economy."
A few years ago, he came up with a regional

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:16.039
version of this model.
That is, of course, called the "RICE" model.

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:21.250
For obvious reasons, there is no local version
of this model. [laughter]

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.770
I have my own model of climate and the economy.
It's called "The Value-laden, Assumption-laden,

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.299
Nicely Linear Approximation, Integrated model
of Climate and the Economy" or the "Vanilla

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:34.780
Ice" model. [laughter]
The Vanilla Ice Model has some theory; it

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.140
has some policy.
So, the theory actually goes back to this

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.870
footnote here, right?
-- about trade making everyone worse off.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.841
And it's actually true in a very "made-up
economics model" sort of way that you can

00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:46.039
have a situation where trade makes everyone
worse off.

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:48.919
And since this is related to climate change,
I'm just going to talk you through this for

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:51.300
a minute.
So, imagine we live in a small town, right?

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.990
Small town has just three people in it -- Orange,
Pink, and Blue.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.390
They all live in this town.
Town has an air pollution problem, and they're

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.710
all good Americans, so they each have a garage
full of stuff that they don't use. All right?

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.390
So now, we're going to see some trades.
So first, Orange is going to sell a lawnmower

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.730
 -- let's say -- to Pink. All right?
They both get a hundred dollars in value from

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.991
the trade.
Orange sells the lawnmower for a hundred dollars

00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:13.640
that was just sitting in her garage.
Pink values the lawn mower at $200.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.179
She only has to pay a hundred for it.
So she gets a hundred dollars in net benefits.

00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:21.020
The problem is that, when Pink starts using
the lawn mower that was just sitting in Orange's

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.900
garage, all right? -- you get a little bit
of air pollution in the town.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.980
And again, this is a made-up economics model,
right?

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.741
So maybe there's health impacts that we can
monetize at like $80 per person. All right?

00:24:31.741 --> 00:24:33.600
Not just for Orange and Pink, but also for
Blue.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.169
All right -- the negative externality in this
case.

00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:39.530
So note that Orange and Pink are going to
continue to make the trade, because they each

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.820
get $20 in net benefits.
So, now we'll see another trade.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.870
Pink sells something to Blue -- a snowblower.
They each get a hundred dollars in value from

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.320
the trade -- Pink from selling the snowblower
for a hundred dollars, Blue values it at 200,

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.230
she only has to pay a hundred, right?
But when Blue starts using the snowblower

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.530
that was just sitting in Pink's garage, air
pollution gets worse.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.630
Maybe an additional $80 in health care costs
for everybody.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.970
And now, we can just complete the circle.
Blue sells a leaf blower to Orange.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.450
They get a hundred dollars in benefits.
Air pollution gets worse -- an additional

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.520
$80 in health care costs for everyone.
And now, if you add up any one of these columns,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.210
you see that the sum of all three of those
trades together leaves everybody at minus

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.350
40.
So, this is the tragedy of the commons, the

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.981
prisoner's dilemma.
And the economic idea here is that each of

00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:26.350
those people's trades are individually rational.
If you ask them if they want to take back

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.820
any of the trades that they engaged in, they'll
say "No." All right?

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.850
Because they get $20 in net benefits each
for each trade that they are engaged in.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.900
But altogether, the trades end up hurting
everyone.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.440
If you want to belabor the point and make
a connection to climate change, we could -- I

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.860
don't know -- like label the people or something.
[laughter]

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.059
So this is kind of the economic model -- a
very simple model -- the way that economists

00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:49.020
think about climate change.
I'll mention a couple of things about climate

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.590
change.
So, I'm not a climate scientist, but I do

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.520
hang out with climate scientists at the University
of Washington and elsewhere.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.940
So one thing to note is, carbon emissions
are going up.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.160
People are very good at burning fossil fuels.
Projected at double roughly between 1990 and

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.190
2030.
And a lot of that growth is coming in the

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.850
developing world, all right?
So the red and the green here are the U.S.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.610
and the rest of the rich world.
The purple is China and the yellow is the

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:16.809
rest of the developing world.
So very rapid projections for increasing CO2

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:20.440
emissions, especially in the developing part
of the world.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.240
Second thing you need to know is just the
basics of the greenhouse effect.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.270
So you probably learned this from Al Gore,
right?

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.720
But the idea is that you got energy in from
the sun and then some of that energy gets

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.730
radiated back out into space.
And greenhouse gases are this blanket of heat

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:37.789
trapping gases that partially reflect some
of that outgoing radiation back to the earth.

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:39.800
This is not controversial among scientists
anyway.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.580
And one of the first people to work on this
was this fellow, Arrhenius, who was a chemist

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.620
in Sweden in 1896.
He did the first estimate of what would temperatures

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.740
 -- by how much temperatures would go up if
we doubled CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.750
And his point estimate is still in the range
that climate scientists talk about today.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:00.480
One big difference between where he was and
where we are now is that, he thought climate

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.820
change was going to be awesome, because he
lived in Sweden. [laughter] In 1896.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.380
And we think it's a little -- probably going
to be a little less awesome these days.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.770
And here's temperature trends.
So, you may see a lot of stuff in the media

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:18.090
about what's going on with temperatures.
And temperatures bounce around a lot, but

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.210
they're going up pretty much just like the
climate scientists projected -- by about .2,

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.650
.15 degrees centigrade per decade, and that's
projected to continue for the next couple

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.500
of decades.
Now, if you don't believe in climate change,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.840
that's okay.
I'll find common ground with you anyway.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.120
But, it's worth just keeping an eye on the
temperature projections.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.340
One of the cool things about science is, they
make testable predictions, right?

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.690
And so, if you don't believe in climate change,
you just kind of wait five or ten years, and

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:47.870
then see what happens.
So, the economics of climate change -- which

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.640
I work on -- is pretty simple.
It's based -- that's the policy part of the

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.450
Vanilla Ice model -- and the policy part is
based on a simple idea, right -- which is

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.100
that, the way to get less pollution is to
make polluting expensive.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.200
And you can do that sort of.
Economists talk about two flavors of that

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.730
 -- one of them is like a carbon tax, the
other is an auction 'Cap and Trade' system.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.730
We tend to think that they're pretty similar,
more similar than they are different.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:15.419
And in both cases, the goal of those policies
is to raise the price of fossil fuels so that

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:20.090
you get capitalism and free market economics
and stuff working to develop alternatives

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:27.240
to promote conservation -- all that great
stuff that's the power of free enterprise.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.200
And trying to get that to work for the environment.
So what I work on as a economist is, How do

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.520
we use the tools of economics to protect the
environment?

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:42.950
Fossil fuel prices are going to go up.
And lots of folks would like to get - they'd

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.779
like to get all that innovation and clean
energy and stuff without fossil fuel prices

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:49.320
going up.
And I happen to think that that's going to

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.990
be real hard.
I think you're going to need the price stable

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.049
to make that happen.
There's a little bit of good news.

00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:57.549
And the good news is that, with either of
these systems -- with a carbon tax or with

00:28:57.549 --> 00:29:00.429
auction Cap and Trade -- you get a pile of
money.

00:29:00.429 --> 00:29:02.520
And you can do great stuff with that pile
of money.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.960
You probably have your own ideas about spending
it on mass transit or clean energy research

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.370
or whatever.
What I talk to folks about is the idea of

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.200
using it to reduce or eliminate existing taxes.
So environmental tax reform -- revenue-neutral

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.840
tax shift -- or some of the names that folks
talk about. All right?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.550
And the underlying idea here is that, for
economists, the way that you should organize

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.730
a tax system is, you should start by taxing
things that you want less of, instead of taxing

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.770
things that you want more of. All right?
So right now we tax employment, we tax savings,

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.770
we tax investment.
Those are all things that we'd like to have

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.640
more of.
So we shouldn't be discouraging them.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.450
So we should get rid of some of those taxes,
and instead have taxes on carbon emissions

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.309
and things that we want less of.
So the underlying vision here that I go around

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:51.080
and talk to folks about is that we could be
replacing part of our tax code with carbon

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.809
pricing.
And there's actually a great model for this

00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:56.840
north of where I am in Seattle in the province
of British Columbia. They did this.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:03.419
There was -- the premier there, actually from
a right-of-center party, implemented a $30

00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:07.350
per ton of CO2 carbon tax.
So that's like 30 cents a gallon of gasoline.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.289
So that's not nothing.
And then, use the money -- a hundred percent

00:30:10.289 --> 00:30:14.790
of the money went to rebate personal and corporate
income taxes at the provincial level in a

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:19.409
way that sort of offset impacts on low-income
households.

00:30:19.409 --> 00:30:22.330
And a super great policy.
So I'm working with some folks in Washington

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.110
State to probably run a ballot measure or
something there.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.860
I can always dream to make that happen in
Washington.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.940
And it's something that you could do here
in California also, right?

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.429
And it would be a great thing for all sorts
of reasons. Even if you don't believe in climate

00:30:37.429 --> 00:30:41.950
change, there are national security reasons,
right? -- for wanting to reduce the dependence

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:48.870
on foreign oil, the market price of oil.
And probably the best story I have about this

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:51.039
is -- I mentioned earlier, I teach at a high
school in Seattle.

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:55.190
It's a fancy private school, and they brought
George Will in -- the Washington Post columnist

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.530
 -- to talk to the students.
And he doesn't even believe that climate change

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.570
is caused by human activity.
But I asked him if he would support replacing

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:07.220
the payroll tax with a carbon tax, and he
said, "Yes."

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:12.140
And he actually said that -- his words were
he would favor replacing the payroll tax with

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:18.580
a yogurt tax -- [laughter] -- is what he said.
But I don't care why he supports it, right?

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.090
It's just the idea that he happens to hate
the payroll tax so much that he's happy to

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.760
replace with it something that's roughly like
a consumption tax which a lot of economists

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.331
think is pretty good idea.
So there's kind of support -- at least across

00:31:30.331 --> 00:31:34.090
the economic spectrum, if not the political
spectrum -- for this idea.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.799
And it's one that sort of I spend -- it's
one that I'm going to spend my life talking

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:41.320
to people about.
So that's why I'm talking about it with you

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.929
also.
Thanks for bearing with me.

00:31:42.929 --> 00:31:47.490
I'll tell you some jokes now. [laughter]
And then, we'll have some time for questions

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:51.429
about serious stuff or about comedy.
It's been an amazing year for economics comedy.

00:31:51.429 --> 00:31:55.220
So let me just tell you the top five stories
in the last year in economics comedy.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.099
Number 5 story. I got to be on the PBS News
Hour with Jim Lehrer.

00:31:58.099 --> 00:31:59.099
&gt;&gt; Whoo!

00:31:59.099 --> 00:32:03.700
Yoram Bauman: Yeah, thank you.
Now, I don't know how much you all know about

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.850
the world of stand-up comedy, but let me just
tell you this, people.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:13.850
In the world of stand-up comedy, it does not
get any bigger -- [laughter] -- than the PBS

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:20.660
News Hour -- [laughter] -- with Jim Lehrer.
I have been getting phone calls nonstop on

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.460
my rotary dial telephone. [laughter]
It was actually in San Francisco.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.990
They interviewed me at the Economics Association
meeting there, and it was pretty amazing.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.370
They interviewed Ken Arrow, who won the Nobel
Prize.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.970
They interviewed Joseph Stiglitz, who won
the Nobel Prize.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:38.200
And they interviewed me. [laughter]
I felt like kind of a self-aware version of

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:47.529
Sarah Palin. [laughter]
I only tell that joke, because her book is

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:51.080
outselling mine.
And what did they ask me on my moment of TV

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.039
fame?
They asked me if I'd ever bombed on stage,

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:57.010
right?
And I had to confess to them that, in fact,

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.870
I had bombed on stage.
The worse show I ever did. All right?

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.010
Comedy is a violent business -- you either
kill or you bomb. All right?

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:06.260
And the worst show I ever did was in October
of 2008.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.700
If you remember what the stock market was
doing in October of 2008?

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:14.760
I did a show for some bankers -- [laughter]
 -- in Colorado Springs, all right?

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.422
Terrible -- did terrible.
And I actually did so poorly that I spent

00:33:17.422 --> 00:33:21.549
a lot of time afterwards kind of soul-searching,
like trying to figure out what had gone wrong

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:25.549
with this audience of bankers in Colorado
Springs in October of 2008.

00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:28.851
And I finally realized that I lost them -- like
where did I lost them?

00:33:28.851 --> 00:33:31.040
And I realized that I lost them on my opening
line.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.910
And my opening line was, "Hey, how's it going?"
[laughter]

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:43.250
Apparently, it wasn't going very well.
That was actually a really interesting time

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:47.090
to be doing comedy, because October of 2008
was also right before the election.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:52.820
And in late October of 2008, I had the pleasure
of doing some comedy in Wichita, Kansas, which

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.590
I found out quickly was on kind of the conservative
end of the conservative wing of the conservative

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.610
spectrum.
And I found this out because I sat down for

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.610
dinner there with some folks I was doing comedy
for.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.920
And, by way of introduction, one of the women
at my table said that she was afraid that,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.369
if Obama was elected president -- she was
afraid that, in five years, she was going

00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:16.849
to be wearing a burka. True story.
So, after the election, I sent her a catalog.

00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:22.690
[laughter]
And I put a note on the catalog.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.279
And the note said, "Look, I'm not trying to
rub it in, it's just that the economy needs

00:34:26.279 --> 00:34:34.961
you to buy the burka now." [laughter]
Can't wait five years for you to buy the burka.

00:34:34.961 --> 00:34:40.629
So that's Number 5 story in economics comedy.
Number 4 story -- competition from Austan

00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:42.700
Goolsbee.
So Austan Goolsbee is one of Obama's chief

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.770
economic advisors.
As Hal mentioned -- as I said earlier -- I

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.450
like to call myself "The World's First and
Only Stand-up Economist."

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.959
So you can imagine how I reacted when somebody
sent me this from the Wall Street Journal

00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:57.920
blog: Austan Goolsbee -- Stand-up Economist.
And it turns out he's been named like the

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.160
"funniest politico in D.C."
Here's a picture of him doing a little set

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.030
at the D.C. Improv.
Fortunately, I come from two fields -- stand-up

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:11.269
comedy and economics -- where we tend to think
that competition is pretty awesome. All right?

00:35:11.269 --> 00:35:16.730
And so, what I did was, I posted a note on
my blog, inviting him to come to the American

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.430
Economics Association Humor Session and perform
there. All right?

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:26.670
I said that I welcome competition even from
the government. [laughter]

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.700
Especially from the government.
And I told him we even have a name for his

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:38.239
act, we would call it "Stand-up Economics:
The Public Option." [laughter] He didn't come.

00:35:38.239 --> 00:35:41.769
But he did say he might come after he finishes
his work in D.C.

00:35:41.769 --> 00:35:45.099
So that was the Number 4 story.
Number 3 story -- I was in discussions with

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:49.609
Fox Business Network about having a show -- a
regular show -- on the Fox Business Network.

00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:51.539
Don't get too impressed -- the discussions
didn't go anywhere.

00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:55.489
It turned out that they didn't need my help
in order to become a joke. [laughter]

00:35:55.489 --> 00:36:01.140
Number 2 story is the book that I have out,
right -- The Cartoon Introduction to Economics.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.450
I'm working on the macrobook.
And I'm happy to say, lots of economists have

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.009
said nice things about the book.
In particular, Greg Mankiw called it, "A Painless

00:36:08.009 --> 00:36:13.160
Way to Learn Economics," which I thought was
especially generous of Greg, given what I

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.940
said about his book, right?
In my parody.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.819
I mean, I think that -- really, the only thing
that I could have done that would have been

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:22.130
meaner to Greg Mankiw would have been to post
something on my blog calling his book, "A

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:30.140
Painful Way to Learn Economics." [Laughter]
which I didn't do.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.069
But still, it was very nice of him to call
my book "A Painless Way to Learn Economics."

00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:35.819
And you can draw all sorts of conclusions
from this -- that he's a nice guy, that he's

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:38.731
forgiving.
The conclusion that I draw is that Greg Mankiw

00:36:38.731 --> 00:36:43.390
is not a game theorist.
And I know this, because we sent the book

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:46.660
out.
So we sent the book out for blurbs to a bunch

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:52.130
of folks to try to get -- you know, blurbs
for the back of the book.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:57.589
And one of them was a famous game theorist
 -- whose name shall not be mentioned here.

00:36:57.589 --> 00:37:01.390
But here's the e-mail that came back from
famous game theorist about the blurb.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.900
It says, "You're wrong; the book is great."
Say, "How about this blurb -- 'This book is

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:15.619
not funny at all.'" [Laughter]
You can really see how game theorists think,

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:17.329
right? [laughter]
Because in his mind, this is an awesome blurb

00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:21.710
for the back of the book.
He goes on to say, "Readers are likely to

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:25.520
understand basic economic ideas much better
than they would from books full of equations

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.249
and real life examples." [laughter]
To this day, I still have no idea whether

00:37:30.249 --> 00:37:33.489
or not famous game theorist actually liked
the book.

00:37:33.489 --> 00:37:37.520
I should say, at this point, we also sent
a galley of the book to Hal Varian, trying

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.200
to get a quote from him for the back of the
book.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.819
My apologies to Hal -- the quote did not make
the back of the book.

00:37:42.819 --> 00:37:45.390
You can judge for yourselves whether that
was appropriate or not.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.940
But Hal Varian's quote for the back of the
book was that it was -- he said nice things

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:56.869
about the book, and said that the book "Put
the cartoon before the course." [laughter]

00:37:56.869 --> 00:38:00.509
Stand up and take a bow, Hal -- excellent!
[laughter]

00:38:00.509 --> 00:38:04.590
So that's the Number 2 story in economics
comedy.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.440
And the Number 1 story in economics comedy
 -- I run a humor session every year at the

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.779
American Economic Association Meeting, and
the next one is going to be in Denver.

00:38:11.779 --> 00:38:17.960
It's going to be 8 p.m. January 8, 2011.
It's the only session at the American Economic

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.579
Association Meeting that is free and open
to the public.

00:38:21.579 --> 00:38:24.650
And so, you're all invited.
The session that we did this last year in

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:29.979
Atlanta was super fun. I was there.
A woman who's a grad student at Harvard, named

00:38:29.979 --> 00:38:34.680
Jodi Beggs, was there.
She runs a website called economistsdoitwithmodels.com.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.890
[laughter]
A fellow named Hugo Mialon, who's up for tenure

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:46.170
next month at Emory, presented a paper on
"The Economics of Faking Orgasms."

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:51.859
And a fellow who's a financial analyst by
day and by night, he sings country music songs

00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:59.219
about economics under the stage name of Merle
Hazard.

00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:05.190
So, he performed, and we had a super fun time.
So I invite you all to come out to Denver

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:08.749
in January of 2011.
Thank you for bringing me here for the day.

00:39:08.749 --> 00:39:12.719
This has been fabulous.
And I have time to take questions if there

00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:16.059
are some questions.
And if you have to go work or stuff, then

00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:20.209
you can do that too.
Can you use...? Yeah, sure.

00:39:20.209 --> 00:39:22.630
You can use this mic for questions, and I
will go to the podium.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.559
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:26.489
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:30.349
&gt;&gt; Any questions?

00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:35.650
Yoram Bauman: I suppose I should plug my website
too.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:39.140
So, standupeconomist.com is my website.
There's my e-mail. You can get on my mailing

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:46.849
list and stuff like that.

00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:50.630
&gt;&gt; [indistinct voices]

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:55.390
Q So, I'll break the ice.
What's the funniest thing you found on Google?

00:39:55.390 --> 00:40:14.969
Yoram Bauman: What's the funniest thing that
I've found on Google. [pause]

00:40:14.969 --> 00:40:19.829
I don't know. I think probably the funniest
thing that comes to mind right now is, apparently

00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:22.809
 -- I'm sure you all know about this -- but
there's something called "Let me Google that

00:40:22.809 --> 00:40:28.630
for you" -- which one of my TAs told me about,
because they get e-mails from students that

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.930
are like, "How do I find out the population
of Japan?"

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.961
And so, I guess there's this website out there
that's called, "Let me Google that for you."

00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:39.059
Where it's -- you know -- whatever code it
is, where you can send them an e-mail or a

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:42.009
website address and that the website that
actually types in for them.

00:40:42.009 --> 00:40:46.059
You know, like when you go to the website,
it types in "Google.com" and then it types

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:48.599
in the question, like "What's the population
of Japan?"

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:50.859
And then, it kicks up the answer for them,
so.

00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:53.609
Q Anybody else?

00:40:53.609 --> 00:40:57.250
Yoram Bauman: I can just tell more jokes for
15 minutes.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:02.869
Oh, you got to take the mic.

00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:11.099
Q On your mailing list, do you have a separate
mailing list for your research as opposed

00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:12.099
to your stand-up comedy?

00:41:12.099 --> 00:41:14.829
Yoram Bauman: I don't have a mailing list
for my research.

00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:21.049
I just -- I'm kind of -- I'm a pretty bad
economist, and I'm a pretty bad comedian,

00:41:21.049 --> 00:41:25.059
but I'm a pretty good economics comedian.
So, I have a little bit of time for research.

00:41:25.059 --> 00:41:29.759
If you're really interested, like I'm one
of the world experts on the impacts of climate

00:41:29.759 --> 00:41:32.869
change on dairy production in the Pacific
Northwest.

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:36.979
So if that happens to be something that you're
super passionate about, then drop me a line.

00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:42.910
I do a little bit of research, mostly coauthored
with folks who are smarter than I am.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:47.219
We did a paper on whether -- one of my colleagues
at University of Washington, Elaina Rose,

00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:52.699
and I just came out with a working paper on
whether taking economics classes makes people

00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:58.589
selfish. [laughter]
So it's definitely true, yeah.

00:41:58.589 --> 00:42:00.059
Q Anybody else?

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:05.449
Yoram Bauman: I could do ten more minutes
of comedy unless you have questions.

00:42:05.449 --> 00:42:06.759
Oh, okay -- more questions.

00:42:06.759 --> 00:42:10.130
Q Question relating to that -- could you tell
us like a few more jokes for the next 10,

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.130
15 minutes? [laughter]

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.610
Yoram Bauman: Do you want to hear more jokes?

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [clapping]

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:31.859
Yoram Bauman: All right. [pause]
Can I do magic tricks? I don't do magic tricks.

00:42:31.859 --> 00:42:34.400
All right.
So I'll tell you that -- so when I started

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.161
doing comedy, I started doing a little bit
of economics jokes.

00:42:36.161 --> 00:42:40.719
And then, I started going to open mic nights
at the Comedy Underground in Seattle.

00:42:40.719 --> 00:42:44.079
One of the great things about comedy is that
there's no barriers to entry.

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:47.599
Like, anybody just shows up on Sunday night
and puts your name on a list and you get two

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:50.849
minutes at open mic night -- which is also
why most people don't make any money from

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:54.890
doing stand-up comedy.
So, I quickly realized that I had to start

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.599
doing some routines that weren't just about
economics.

00:42:56.599 --> 00:43:00.180
I needed something easier to do jokes about.
This was in 2004.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.089
So I started doing some jokes about the war
in Iraq that I thought would appeal to people

00:43:04.089 --> 00:43:09.279
across the political spectrum.
So I'll do those for you now, and we'll see

00:43:09.279 --> 00:43:13.369
whether you still like them.
The challenge with those jokes is that it's

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:15.609
really hard to find a political spectrum in
America.

00:43:15.609 --> 00:43:17.940
Like, everywhere you go is either far left
or far right or whatever.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.649
So, with your permission -- and this is the
audience participation part of the afternoon

00:43:22.649 --> 00:43:24.930
 -- I'm going to divide you up across the
political spectrum.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:28.769
So you folks over here on my left -- just
for the next couple of minutes -- I need you

00:43:28.769 --> 00:43:33.150
guys to participate.
You guys are going to be my left wing. [laughter]

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:39.400
That was actually an appropriate amount of
enthusiasm for the left wing. [laughter]

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.040
Watch this -- you folks over here to my right
 -- all you folks over here, I need you to

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.400
participate.
You guys get to be my right wing.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.599
&gt;&gt; [half-hearted cheering]

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:50.749
Yoram Bauman: That was good, but I need you
guys to dig down and find your inner red meat

00:43:50.749 --> 00:43:53.499
okay? [laughter]
Put yourselves in the mind frame of people

00:43:53.499 --> 00:43:59.829
who believe in social Darwinism.
[laughter and clapping]

00:43:59.829 --> 00:44:07.249
Put yourselves in the mind frame of people
who believe in social Darwinism, but don't

00:44:07.249 --> 00:44:11.449
believe in Darwin's theory of evolution. [laughter]
You guys over here. You guys are my right

00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:12.449
wing.

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.449
&gt;&gt; [sparse cheering]

00:44:13.449 --> 00:44:16.529
Yoram Bauman: That was a little better, but
when I did this in Texas last month, they

00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:20.539
started chanting "USA." [laughter]
I want you to do that for me. You guys are

00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:21.539
my right wing!

00:44:21.539 --> 00:44:23.400
&gt;&gt; [chanting] USA! USA!

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:28.209
Yoram Bauman: That was okay.
You guys on the left wing, though -- you guys

00:44:28.209 --> 00:44:32.319
are perfect. [laughter]
Because while the right wing was chanting

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:36.380
"USA," you were just sitting there looking
befuddled and vaguely unpatriotic. [laughter]

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.979
Don't know how it happens to the left wing;
it always does.

00:44:39.979 --> 00:44:44.080
I haven't forgotten about you people.
You all are the most important part of the

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.199
political spectrum.
You're the swing voters. Your job is to be

00:44:49.199 --> 00:44:54.240
clueless and apathetic.
And then, every four years, you determine

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.259
the fate of the free world. [laughter]
I know it sounds like a big responsibility,

00:44:59.259 --> 00:45:06.739
but don't give it a second thought. [laughter]
You guys are like the idiot savants of democracy.

00:45:06.739 --> 00:45:10.650
Of course, the most amusing parts of the political
spectrum are the far extremes.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:14.319
So the far right of the political spectrum
 -- you folks over there by the cafe and stuff

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:21.380
 -- you guys get to be my libertarians.
That's cool. You can do what you want. [laughter]

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.359
Far left of the political spectrum, on this
wall over here -- far left -- you guys get

00:45:24.359 --> 00:45:33.489
to be my libertarians. [laughter]
Did you swing voters get that joke?

00:45:33.489 --> 00:45:39.630
Libertarians. They're not the people that
check books out for you. [laughter]

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.969
Libertarians are freedom lovers. All right?
They come in two flavors, right?

00:45:42.969 --> 00:45:47.969
There are right wing libertarians -- they
want everyone to be free to have guns.

00:45:47.969 --> 00:45:54.199
Left wing libertarians -- they want everyone
to be free to have drugs. [laughter]

00:45:54.199 --> 00:45:59.680
Both wings of the libertarian party want to
abolish Social Security.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.089
Right -- which makes total sense, because
who's going to make it to 65? [laughter]

00:46:04.089 --> 00:46:05.089
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:10.140
Yoram Bauman: -- when the world is full of
pistol-packing pot heads.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:16.859
All right.
I promised you some jokes about the war that'll

00:46:16.859 --> 00:46:19.359
appeal to people across the political spectrum.
So let me start with this.

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:21.099
I'm going to do these jokes at West Point
next week.

00:46:21.099 --> 00:46:24.130
So I'm going to try them out on you.
I don't care how you feel about the war.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.579
I don't care how you feel about President
Bush or President Obama.

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:28.880
I think the individual troops over there deserve
our support.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.280
So I hope you join me in a round of applause.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.309
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:40.230
Yoram Bauman: Nice work, left wing.
I can't believe I have to give a disclaimer

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.299
before asking for a round of applause for
the troops, but the political situation in

00:46:43.299 --> 00:46:46.579
this country, ladies and gentlemen, has become
so divisive.

00:46:46.579 --> 00:46:51.059
I experienced that divisiveness firsthand
a few years ago when I moved from liberal

00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:56.029
Seattle to conservative eastern Washington
with a bumper sticker on my car.

00:46:56.029 --> 00:47:00.631
I brought a copy to show you here.
The bumper sticker said, "Bring the Troops

00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:05.279
Home."
Not a big deal in Seattle, right?

00:47:05.279 --> 00:47:11.979
But after getting my butt kicked multiple
times outside of Barnaby's pub in Walla Walla,

00:47:11.979 --> 00:47:15.299
I decided I needed to do something different
to fit in, right?

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:19.339
So I traded in that bumper sticker.
I got a new bumper sticker that said, "Leave

00:47:19.339 --> 00:47:32.630
the Troops There." [laughter]
That one didn't work either.

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:36.260
So then I went for something neutral, right?
I got a bumper sticker that said, "I don't

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:42.569
know about the troops." [laughter]
Yes, I am selling these bumper stickers.

00:47:42.569 --> 00:47:47.640
And can I just say, this is going much better
than when I did this routine in Texas last

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.219
month?
Because when I did this routine in Texas,

00:47:50.219 --> 00:47:53.869
this great big dude jumped up in the back.
And he was like, "That is the most offensive

00:47:53.869 --> 00:47:58.269
bumper sticker I've ever seen!" [laughter]
Well, maybe I've been hanging out with economists

00:47:58.269 --> 00:48:05.289
too long or something, but I took that as
a challenge.

00:48:05.289 --> 00:48:08.809
I looked at him, and I said, "You think that's
the most offensive bumper sticker you've ever

00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:11.059
seen?"
And I reached into my bag, and I said, "Apparently,

00:48:11.059 --> 00:48:13.749
you haven't seen this one."
It says, "If the troops weren't all in Iraq,

00:48:13.749 --> 00:48:24.200
I'd shoot one myself." [laughter]
Now, "This!" I said, "This is an offensive

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.449
bumper sticker."
This guy in Texas, ladies and gentlemen -- you

00:48:28.449 --> 00:48:33.289
should have seen the look on his face.
I mean, I knew that I had won the argument

00:48:33.289 --> 00:48:37.009
about which was the more offensive bumper
sticker.

00:48:37.009 --> 00:48:40.849
What I didn't know was that he was going to
be an incredibly sore loser. [laughter]

00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:45.789
Apparently what I thought of as my rights
under the First Amendment were in conflict

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:49.950
with what he thought of as his rights under
the Second Amendment. [laughter]

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.599
But I don't back down, people.
So when this guy asked me if I was selling

00:48:52.599 --> 00:48:56.729
this bumper sticker too, I said "Heck, yes.
How many would you like to buy?"

00:48:56.729 --> 00:49:00.411
He flipped out. He jumped up on the stage.
He ripped the bumper sticker out of my hand.

00:49:00.411 --> 00:49:04.090
He got right up in my face.
He said, "I would never buy that bumper sticker

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.559
and put it on my car."
And I said, "You dummy, you're not supposed

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:12.190
to put it on your own car." [laughter]

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.549
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:22.209
Yoram Bauman: It's got instructions right
on the back.

00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:31.789
Step 1 -- Locate Hummer.
Step 2 -- Place over gas tank.

00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:36.469
Step 3 -- Run.
Sometimes people doubt my patriotism when

00:49:36.469 --> 00:49:38.880
I do that routine.
So let me be clear about my point, right?

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.709
If you're driving a Humvee around Baghdad,
I want to thank you for the sacrifices that

00:49:42.709 --> 00:49:46.180
you're making for our country.
If you're driving a Humvee around the Bay

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:51.469
Area, I want to put my foot up your ass.
I mean, I totally support the troops.

00:49:51.469 --> 00:49:55.439
I have extra respect for the troops, because
I'd be such a terrible fit for the military.

00:49:55.439 --> 00:49:59.890
No -- I mean, look at my arms. [laughter]
I'm like human veal.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:05.390
If I went to boot camp, I'd be afraid the
drill sergeant would tell me to drop and give

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:08.209
him five push-ups.
And, as far as the military is concerned,

00:50:08.209 --> 00:50:16.160
I only have one thing going for me.
I'm not openly homosexual.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.951
But if they reinstate the draft, ladies and
gentlemen, that is going to change.

00:50:18.951 --> 00:50:27.719
It is going to change in a snap. [laughter]
It's not just me, though, because that's the

00:50:27.719 --> 00:50:30.949
military's policy, right?
If you're "out," you can't get "in."

00:50:30.949 --> 00:50:36.459
You can't even get by if you're "bi."
So if they reinstate the draft, gay is going

00:50:36.459 --> 00:50:40.519
to be the new Canada. [laughter]
Thanks a lot, everybody.

00:50:40.519 --> 00:50:41.519
Have a good rest of the day.

00:50:41.519 --> 00:50:41.759
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
