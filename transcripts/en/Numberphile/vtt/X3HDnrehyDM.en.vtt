00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.949
this is a game that frogs play whenever

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.560
they are not being witnessed by humans

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.620
and the way that they play it you can

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.969
imagine that these are lily pads, and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.859
there's five frogs. five frogs that want

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.730
to have a party on the same lily pad. One

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.320
frog jumps one space. Two frogs jump two

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.960
spaces. one frog jumps one space. got four

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.809
frogs on here so 4 frogs  jump

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.680
four spaces these. These frogs are happy

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.920
because they are celebrating a party on

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.100
their own lily pad. now it's your job you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.170
have to figure out: is this possible?

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.090
the day after whenever a new frog comes

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.350
to town. Is  this possible? one extra rule:

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.590
you cannot jump frogs on to an empty

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.199
lily pad. so I could jump one frog there,

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.799
i can jump one frog here I could jump

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.610
one frog here and two frogs I could jump

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.509
here. 4 frogs must jump 4 spaces.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.780
1,2,3,4, Oh, this is an empty lily pad so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.340
you can't do that.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.710
so this is an example of a failure. Can

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.189
we manage to do this with six frogs and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.829
six lily pads? Can we manage to do this with

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.549
N frogs and N lily pads? so this is a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.590
puzzle that doesn't have an obvious

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.290
answer before we solve six I want you to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.180
imagine you've only got 2 lily pads

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.250
and 2 frogs. well that's easy to solve

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.820
so now we're going to use that i'm going

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.189
to split this into two and first of all

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.170
going to solve for the left and i'm going to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.119
solve the right in exactly the same way.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.010
this looks suspiciously similar to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.040
having two frogs and two lily pads. here

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.860
we have three frogs and three frogs

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.210
separated by three. so this can be solved

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.020
in exactly the same way as 2 frogs can.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.420
be solved in 2 lily pads.   so now that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.720
we've solved six, is it easy to solve 36?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.110
of course it is because we can design 36

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.590
we can solve for this six in the same

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.140
way you can solve for this six, this six,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.900
this six, this six. we've solved for all

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.370
the sixes. we now have six stacks of six

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.040
all separated by six. then that's just kind of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.530
like a giant six. doesn't just give us a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.440
solution for even numbers. it also gives

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.220
the solutions for numbers like 9. 3 x 3

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:03.260
because you could imagine with nine, with

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.690
nine we solve like this... okay?

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.470
now you can see we've really got a big

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.200
version of just the three. so we do the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.380
same thing. we solved it. can we solve for

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.450
prime numbers? can we solve for prime numbers?

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.489
so the answer is yes and let me show you

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.300
this is another ...you should, you should

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.400
take time and try to solve for prime

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.590
numbers but let's set let's extend this

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.920
we'll go to 11 here. i'm going to show you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.530
how to do it and you'll immediately see

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.110
that you could do all integers two three

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.850
four five six seven eight nine ten

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.340
eleven. Solved!

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.500
that will work for everything. To make

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.930
problem a little bit more interesting

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.500
now that we solve for every integer,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.480
now what we're going to do is we're

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.560
going to say well one of these frogs is

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.170
actually the Queen frog. and the Queen

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.890
frog must always be on the top of any

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.320
pile, so you can think:

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.840
can you solve for that? Now for example

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.460
you could go to here but then you

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.410
couldn't move this on the top of the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.320
Queen you could move to here. this then

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.050
becomes a challenge is this always

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.880
possible and visit isn't always possible

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.370
no matter where the queen is? If the Queen

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.790
starts over here, is this possible?

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.410
so you should take a moment and you

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.900
should figure out is this possible or

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.000
impossible? what I'm going to try to do

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.340
is I'm going to use this same technique

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.170
of back and forth and back and forth and

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.970
back and forth and and i'm going to end

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.280
up here. right, so let me do that first

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.080
so what do i need to do now? i need to

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.610
somehow end up on this place here and

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.450
that that is doable by the same

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.820
technique i go back and forth i'm going

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.740
to start here and I'll go back and forth.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.160
and just by choosing correctly, i can

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.890
make sure that this stack is going to

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.580
end up on top so this is also solvable

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.300
for all integers. A little bit less obvious.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.990
now let's remove the Queen and give

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.590
instead lazy told you where would you

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.630
like the lady told to be

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.240
in third position that ok so the lazy

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.620
told doesn't move so we have got to have

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.380
the party on this lily pad is this

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.340
possible

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.320
so take a second try to figure out it's

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.870
just always going to be possible or not

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.150
and the answer is yes this is always

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.980
going to be possible in the same with

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.960
the same system so here I'm going to

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.190
choose this one I'm going to move over

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.950
here and go on top here i'm going to

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.240
choose something in the middle and you

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.920
just have to figure out what I wanted to

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.710
jump this way and yes so I jumped this

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.350
way and we've solved it

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.860
this is solvable for all integers you

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.570
might want to experiment with one lazy

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.210
toad and one Queen that have to be on

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.850
top and everything else wrong and see if

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.960
that is possible

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.430
sometimes it's possible sometimes you

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.750
know now i'm going to share a problem

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.450
that i don't know the answer to

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.560
and this one we have the frogs and

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.840
unfortunately two of the lilypad are

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.620
waterlogged the end one second from the

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.830
end on either side so know frogs can go

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.150
on here i do not know if this is ever

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.840
solvable for any number of lily pads

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.090
I've never been able to solve a single

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.940
one of these so that's that's my open

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.980
problem here will show your failure so I

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.930
need to get this frog somehow because it

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.610
can't move here so i need to go over and

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.930
grab it so let me grab it by this

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.130
technique I'll go to that gives three

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.410
now I come over here

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.050
that's four 1234 I can come over and

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.420
rescue this one that's five one two

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.010
three four and I UCI i'm stuck here I've

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.090
got this one by itself not what can I do

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.669
well I can at least get this one but

00:07:56.669 --> 00:08:00.600
then that's 12345 I can't move this back

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.130
how that goes under the waterlogged

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.730
lilypad I can't move this stack 123 and

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.890
I can't move this sec so I'm stuck here

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.710
so I've never been able to solve any of

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.990
these for any length but it's not

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.850
obvious at all of this can't be solved

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.530
for some length of lily pads just the 11

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.980
away from the end on each side being

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.460
waterlogged not low enough so what we do

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.910
we do we could split this into an ache

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.669
here and 12 we could do that and so now

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:40.010
our score is 12-4 is equal to 8
