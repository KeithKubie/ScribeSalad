00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.880
Hi Michael.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.890
&gt;&gt; Hey Charles. How you been?

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.120
&gt;&gt; I've been doing just fine. How've you been?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.110
&gt;&gt; Good. It's been a while. I understand you went to Africa.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.280
&gt;&gt; I went to Africa. The entire continent, or at least parts of it.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.710
&gt;&gt; How's Africa?

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.550
&gt;&gt; It's fine. It's, warm.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.984
&gt;&gt; The entire continent?

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The entire continent. Or at least Kenya and Nigeria.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.158
&gt;&gt; Particularly in Nigeria. Which was

00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:24.442
80 something degrees and 4,000% humidity. [LAUGH]

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:25.477
&gt;&gt; So, do you want to do a shout

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:27.280
out to any of, any of your friends from there?

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like to say hi to Chairman and I'd like to say hi

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.900
to Prof. Oh, and Good Times. I would like to say hi to Good Times. He

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.360
was awesome. Okay, so Michael. I am back now so that we can talk about the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.510
last little section. That we're going to do in this class, and it's game theory.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.350
&gt;&gt; That sounds cool. What does that have to do with machine learning?

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.620
&gt;&gt; So that's an interesting question because,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.530
in fact, game theory comes from a tradition

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.060
way outside of machine learning in A.I. but you'll see

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.570
in a moment why it is I care about game

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.900
theory, and really this is a very natural extension to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.240
all the stuff we've been talking about with reinforcement learning.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.410
&gt;&gt; Interesting. Are we talking about games like Monopoly?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.490
&gt;&gt; In some sense, we are. Because all of life is like

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.770
Monopoly. So in fact, what is game theory? Maybe that's what we can

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.480
do. We can just try to define game theory, and maybe it'll

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.840
be clear why it is we're worried about this at all. Seem fair?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.790
&gt;&gt; Okay.
