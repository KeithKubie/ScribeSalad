00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:01.768
AS WE GO TO OUR NEXT GAME.

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.103
BAPTISM BY FIRED.

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.307
BAPTISM BY FIRED.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.110
JON STEWART IS LEAVING "THE
DAILY SHOW" THIS WEEK.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.078
THIS IS THE END OF AN ERA.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.714
THIS MAN CHANGED TELEVISION.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:18.852
HE EVOLVED COMEDY. HE'S WON A
MILLION EMMYS.

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:20.988
HE'S DONE SUCH AN AMAZING JOB.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.124
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; AND AS WE LOOK BACK AT

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.960
HIS LEGACY, ONE THING THAT
STANDS OUT IS HOW MANY

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.395
CAREERS HE HAS HELPED
LAUNCH.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.098
NOT JUST THESE GUYS BUT SO
MANY OTHER PEOPLE.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.700
AND ALSO, KIND OF MY CAREER
TOO.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.102
THE YEAR WAS 2000.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.038
JON WAS INTERVIEWING MY
FORMER "SINGLED OUT" CO-STAR

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.875
JENNY MCCARTHY, BEFORE
SHE UNDISCOVERED VACCINES.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.514
AND I, BY THE WAY, WAS FAT,
DRUNK, HALF ASLEEP. MY LIFE

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.384
WAS COMPLETE [BLEEP] AND
THEN THIS CAME ON,

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.753
WHICH WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
SHOWS AT THE TIME.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.021
AND THIS HAPPENED.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.656
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IS GOING
AWESOME.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:56.623
&gt;&gt; IT'S TERRIFIC.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.859
AND IT'S FUNNY, CHRIS
HARDWICK WORKS HERE NOW.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:00:59.359
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.360
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:00.761
&gt;&gt; AND THE SHOW IS CALLED,
THE SITCOM WHAT IS IT

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:01.195
CALLED?

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:01.695
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.498
HE DOES THE COFFEE.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.134
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.670
DEFINING MOMENTS IN MY LIFE,
BECAUSE THIS WAS A PUBLIC

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:12.406
INTERVENTION, AND IT WAS THIS
ON TELEVISION WHEN I SORT OF

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.309
LOOKED AROUND AND SAW THESE
EMPTY PIZZA BOXES AND BEER

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:18.612
BOTTLES, I WAS LIKE OH,
[BLEEP], HE'S RIGHT.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:19.580
AND PEOPLE LAUGHED.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:22.282
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALLY
STARTED GOING, "HEY, I

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.318
SHOULD NOT DRINK AND GET MY
LIFE TOGETHER."

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:28.222
SO I OWE JON STEWART A HUGE
DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:32.559
ACTUALLY [BLEEP] ON ME IN
PUBLIC AND CREATING A HUGE

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.162
WAKE-UP CALL.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.265
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN IT WASN'T HIS
INTENTION TO HELP ME IN

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.901
ANY WAY BUT THAT WAS THE RESULT.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.836
&gt;&gt; I HUNG OUT WITH PARTY
CHRIS HARDWICK.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.174
HE WAS PRETTY AWESOME.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:51.512
&gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE MAD AT
JON STEWART FOR FOISTING YOU

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:52.946
UPON US.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.849
&gt;&gt; YES, THIS DID GET ME
THINKING, WHETHER IT'S

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:59.319
MAKING COFFEE OR CLEANING UP
THE @MIDNIGHT GREEN ROOM

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:02.723

WE'VE ALL HAD OUR FAIR SHARE

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.091
