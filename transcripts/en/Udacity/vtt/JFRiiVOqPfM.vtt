00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.670
Andy Rubin, head of 
Google's Android team until 2013

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.680
famously defined Android's 
openness with this Tweet,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.920
offering the instructions for
downloading and building

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.580
the Android source code.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.630
As app developers,
it's handy to be able to peak

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.910
behind the curtains and see
how the framework actually works.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.760
And it's an excellent way
to find answers

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.030
to tricky Stack Overflow questions.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.710
But the Android Open Source Project, 
or AOSP as its commonly known,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.290
is much more than that.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.420
The source code is available
under the Apache 2 license,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.200
so anyone can take it 
and do anything they want with it,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.428
including modifying it
and redistributing it.

00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:35.946
And they have.

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:38.354
Android has always had
a passionate community of modders,

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:41.082
from Steve Kondik
and the Cyanogen community

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.050
to XDA and many others
who have been distributing

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200
modified images of Android

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.070
for phone owners
brave enough to try them.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.800
Even big companies like Amazon
have taken the Android source code

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.300
and modified it for use 
in their own line of products.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.230
That openness extends 
to the apps themselves.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.410
The AOSP includes key mobile apps 
like the dialer, app launcher,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.140
calendar, and email.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.930
And Google offers its
own versions of each as well.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.450
In the early days those native apps
were tightly bound

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.760
to the framework and could only
get updated along with the platform.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.270
Which admittedly in the early days 
seemed like every few weeks.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.230
But as the time between
platform releases grew,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.100
so did the efforts
to unbundle those apps,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.850
allowing them to be updated 
through Google Play.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.950
That was great news for users, 
but it had an even better side effect

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.440
for us developers.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.363
Because apps like Gmail and Maps

00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:29.786
depend on a number
of proprietary Google APIs,

00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:32.150
Google released Google Play Services.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.700
Also code named after food 
to support the Google apps,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.626
while also giving us developers
Google specific APIs,

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:41.262
like Maps, Wallet, Drive, and YouTube.

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:42.824
So now we get
the latest and greatest

00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:45.596
Google specific APIs
every six weeks or so.

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:48.100
And rather than being 
tied to a specific platform,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.390
they're available on every device, 
back to Gingerbread.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.190
Oh, and of course every native app
is also entirely replaceable.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.470
So you can publish apps
to replace any of the apps

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.832
shipped with the device.

00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:02.421
And we can build our own SMS apps, 
homescreens or maps apps,

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:05.760
publish it on Play and give users
the choice to make it their default.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.150
When Android
was first announced,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.650
Andy Rubin described the AOSP as, 
all the software to run a mobile phone

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.910
but without the proprietary obstacles
that have hindered mobile innovation.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.000
Today, Android runs on more
than just mobiles,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.310
but the core of its purpose 
remains the same.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.143
A platform and ecosystem
that allows models, carriers,

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.030
OEMs and app developers 
to innovate and compete.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.030
So armed with an open, 
evolving platform

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.090
enriched by a growing
set of Google API's

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.290
and the ability to create
great apps that let users

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.910
customize every aspect
of their user experience,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.260
you can use other people's work
to help define the computing platform

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.668
of the future.

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:42.958
And that's my definition of open.
