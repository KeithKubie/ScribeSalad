00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.860
So, now you've seen graphical depictions of functions. We've talked about real

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.670
world examples of functions. And I think it's finally time to talk about what a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.181
function really is mathematically. So, overall what does a function do? Well, it

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.659
takes some value as it's input, does some stuff to that value, and then produces

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:22.516
a new number called the output. Then we can pair that input value with the

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:27.650
output value that it produces to graph our functions. So, over here we have our

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.561
x's and over here we have our y's, in general. So, for example, let's say I have

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:37.602
a function whose function is to increase the input value by 2. So, for example,

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:42.579
if our input is 2, so if you take 2 and throw it into our function machine, then

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.749
the function machine will spit out an output of 4. So instead of 2, our input is

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.333
5. What will the output be from the same function?
