00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.730
Baby talk is controversial, you wouldn't think
it would be, but it is.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.340
Many who baby talk believe they're teaching
their infant to crawl before they can walk,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.690
linguistically speaking.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.020
FIRST: I want to point out, there are different
types of "baby talk," "motherese" or "parentese."

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.129
Sing-songy, swooping language is good.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.460
Good baby talk involves actual words where
some sounds are held and some syllables are

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.040
emphasized.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.170
Analysis of babytalk found the average pitch
of baby talk is high, and the rate of speech

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.470
is slow.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.129
On the other hand, cutesy nonsense language
is bad.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.760
Saying "wubba woodle" might sound cute, but
that isn't a word!

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.390
When you're talking to someone who can't understand
you, do you purposefully make your words LESS

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.390
understandable?

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.390
NO!

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.390
Of course not!

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.500
So moving forward, we're ignoring nonsense
language, and sticking to the swoopy and sing-songy

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.500
kind[1].

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.750
We know it helps grow early vocab when parents
talk to their kids[2], but researchers believe

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.450
baby talk is a universally understandable
form of language.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.659
For a study in Psychological Science, researchers
played recordings of English speakers using

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.659
baby talk for a non-industrial tribe in Ecuador[3].

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.170
The tribe who, don't speak English, could
tell with 75-percent accuracy, whether the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.850
tone was approving or disapproving[4] and
with 73-percent accuracy if it was directed

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.840
at an adult or a baby.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.280
Obviously, the swooping, sing-songing speech
is somehow easier to comprehend.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.350
And other studies have shown its presence
ACROSS human culture, but it's not just us…

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.490
A study in Ethology found rhesus monkeys also
use baby talk.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.840
Researchers watched the rhesus interacting
with infant and adult monkeys and found when

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.259
talking to infants they tended to use more
excitement and a particular sound, called

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.670
the "girney" -- which, interestingly, other
studies have connected to the pre-development

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.870
of speech evolution in macaques…

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.750
According to researchers from Emory University,
WHAT is being said is less important than

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.611
the intonation of the speech.

00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:22.180
They found though, that the monkeys used Motherese,
another name for baby talk, only with OTHER

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.550
infants, and other mothers; not their own.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.370
Which makes a lot of sense, as it may bring
individual monkeys together, though not with

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.801
their OWN infants -- because they're with
their own babies all the time, and the other

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.080
babies are novel.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.140
They believe the practice of baby talk encourages
a bond between the mothers; bringing them

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.140
together[5].

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220
The thing is, all bets in baby talk are not
off.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.190
One baby talk hypothesis believed we were
speaking more CLEARLY to our infants, but

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.561
a study from researchers in France and Japan
explored if mothers were speaking more clearly

00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:56.240
with baby talk and interestingly, they weren't.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.920
This study, also in Psychological Science[6],
says mothers speaking to their infants using

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.010
baby talk are speaking less clearly than they
would to an adult!

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.810
But that's okay, the went on to hypothesize
this is for expressing emotions or engaging

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.780
attention -- which is sort of supported in
another place we use baby talk…

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.780
TO PETS.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.920
Seriously, look at that face[a].

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.640
How can you NOT WANT TO JUST LUV ON DAT LITTLE
FAACE.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.920
And that's exactly what we do.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.580
A study in Current Biology[7] says both children
and dogs are more likely to respond when we

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.860
speak in a high-pitched voice -- not unlike
baby talk.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.470
When actors were video recorded looking in
a direction and speaking in a high-pitched

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.480
tone, dogs and infants would follow their
gaze!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.030
So baby talk might be annoying to some, but
though we're not sure WHY, there's some reason

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.060
that infants love it!

00:03:46.060 --> 00:04:06.790
*babytalk* Why do you think that is?
