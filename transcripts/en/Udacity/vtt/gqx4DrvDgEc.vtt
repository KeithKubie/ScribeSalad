00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Sometimes the questions we come up with in this class are a little bit contrived,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but this one is actually practical.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's say your spaceship crashes onto a strange planet. It could happen to you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It could happen to you. You'll want to know what to do.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
At first you're not too happy, because you don't know where you are,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but then you see this strange tree over here with the vine dangling from one of the branches.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This makes you happy, because now you think, hey,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I can make a pendulum out of this and perhaps by doing that,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I can somehow figure out what the acceleration due to gravity is

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on this strange planet.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
To make this into a pendulum, you tie your space backpack filled with space weights

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
down at the bottom of this vine, which by the way has a length of 12 m.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Your goal is to find little g--the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of this strange planet.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What you do is you pull this back by a small amount and let it swing

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
back and forth and back and forth.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You time this swinging, and when you let it swing back and forth 10 times,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you find it takes 45 seconds.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I want you to tell me what is little g, the acceleration due to gravity,

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and you can enter your answer here in seconds.
