00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:02.212
- [Instructor] Which
slope field is generated

00:00:02.212 --> 00:00:04.074
by the differential
equation the derivative of y

00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:08.318
with respect to x is equal to x minus y?

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:09.775
And like always pause this video

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:12.413
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:13.683
Well the easiest way to think

00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:15.218
about a slope field, if I was, if i needed

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:17.679
to plot this slope field by hand,

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.483
I would sample a bunch of x and y points.

00:00:20.483 --> 00:00:21.444
And then I would figure out what

00:00:21.444 --> 00:00:23.830
the derivative would
have to be at that point.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.635
And so what we can do
here, since we've already

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.214
drawn some candidate slope fields for us,

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:30.105
is figure out what we
think the slope field

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.607
should be at some points and see

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:33.866
which of these diagrams, these graphs,

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.355
or these slope fields actually show that.

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:39.850
So let's, let me make a little table here,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.350
so I'm gonna have,

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.280
x, y and then the derivative

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.590
of y with respect to x.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.591
And we can do it at a bunch of values,

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:51.542
so let's think about it.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:54.461
Let's think about when, we're
at this point right over here.

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:56.339
When x is two and y is two.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.517
When x is two and y is two, the derivative

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.858
of y with respect to x is
going to be two minus two.

00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:05.320
It's going to be equal to zero.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.123
And just with that, let's
see, here this slope

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:10.281
on this slope field does
not look like it's zero.

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:12.136
This looks like it's negative one.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:14.345
So already I can rule this one out.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.870
This slope right over looks
like it's positive one.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.890
So I'll rule that out,
it's definitely not zero.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.243
This slope also looks like positive one.

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:22.547
So I can rule that one out.

00:01:22.547 --> 00:01:26.003
This slope at two comma two
actually does look like zero.

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.714
So I'm liking this one right over here.

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.402
This slope at two comma
two looks larger than one

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:32.815
so I can rule that out.

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:35.136
So it was that straight forward to deduce

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:38.487
that this choice right over here is,

00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:39.945
if any of these are going to be

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:41.660
the accurate slope field, it's this one.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.395
But just for kicks we could keep going

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.392
to verify that this is
indeed the slope field.

00:01:46.392 --> 00:01:48.262
So let's think about what happens

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:52.429
when x is equal to a one,
whenever x is equal to y,

00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:55.704
you're gonna get the
derivative equaling zero.

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:57.801
And you see that here,
when you're at four, four,

00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:58.921
derivative equals zero.

00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:00.809
When it's six, six,
derivative equals zero.

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:03.647
At negative two, negative
two, derivative equals zero.

00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:07.693
So that feels good, that this
is the right slope field.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.003
And then we could pick
other arbitrary points.

00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:13.803
Let's say when x is four, y is two,

00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:17.195
then the derivative here
should be four minus two,

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:18.382
which is going to be two.

00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:20.977
So when x is four, y is
two, we do indeed see

00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:23.453
that the slope field is indicating a slope

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:25.671
that looks like two right over here.

00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:27.239
And if it was the other way around,

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.989
when x is let's say, x is negative four

00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:36.725
and y is negative two.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:39.868
The negative four, negative two.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.814
Well negative four minus negative two

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:44.967
is going to be negative two.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.172
And you can see that right over here.

00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:47.821
Negative four, negative two, you can see

00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:48.844
the slope right over here.

00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:51.502
It's a little harder to see,
looks like negative two.

00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:54.702
So once again using even
just this first two comma two

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:57.359
coordinates we were able to
deduce this was the choice.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.526
But it just continues to
confirm our original answer.
