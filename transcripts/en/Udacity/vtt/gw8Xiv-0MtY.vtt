We've come a long way. Now we have the equation y equals 1 3rd times x plus 1.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.932
How does this equation relate to the one we stared out with? Well, it's it's

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:13.982
inverse. Let's make that a bit more obvious though with our notation. Please

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:18.518
replace y in this equation with something to show that this is the inverse of

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.879
f.
