00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:01.166
- [Instructor] What I wanna do now

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.436
is start thinking about
ancient civilizations.

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:06.890
And we're gonna start with Mesopotamia.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.796
And Mesopotamia, the word
is literally referring to

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:11.024
the fact that this region is,

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:14.090
for the most part, between two rivers.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.676
You have the Tigris River
and the Euphrates River.

00:00:18.676 --> 00:00:21.544
And, when we talk about
ancient Mesopotamia,

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:24.369
most people are referring to the period

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.810
between around 3000 BCE, or maybe even

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.940
going a little bit before that,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.515
so 3000 Before the Common Era.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.790
And then, going up to
about the time of Christ

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.428
or a little bit before that.

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:41.844
So we might go to 1000 BCE
or maybe a little bit later.

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.594
Maybe around 500 BCE.

00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:45.606
And, what I've done here, is

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:47.937
we clearly have a map of the region.

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:52.514
I also have timelines for
different geographies.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:55.664
So, this timeline that I
have right here in blue,

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:58.664
this is my timeline for Mesopotamia.

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.666
Right over here.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.549
And you can see that I
have different colors

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:07.737
along this timeline.

00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:09.497
You can also see what other civilizations

00:01:09.497 --> 00:01:12.484
were around at the same time in history.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:14.613
This is not a comprehensive list here.

00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:18.502
So, what we have in this
yellow, this is ancient Egypt.

00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:20.998
And you can see that them
sprouting out around the Nile.

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:23.412
It's no coincidence that
these are around rivers.

00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:26.359
The rivers flood and
provide fertile ground

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.710
where you can have agriculture.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.714
Where you can support population centers.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:30.902
So, it's no coincidence that you have

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:32.457
a civilization around the Nile.

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:35.036
You have a civilization in Mesopotamia

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:37.779
between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.743
So, this is the Egyptians right over here.

00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:41.833
This is ancient Mesopotamia.

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.656
Right over here, I have the
Indus Valley civilization.

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:45.723
And then we have China.

00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:47.277
Once again, not comprehensive.

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:48.996
We have other civilizations going on.

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:52.429
But these are ones you will
often hear being spoken about.

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.309
Now, in Mesopotamia,
especially when we are

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:56.477
talking about ancient Mesopotamia,

00:01:56.477 --> 00:01:58.847
you will hear about different groups

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:00.363
and different languages.

00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:02.984
And so, you'll hear about the Sumerians.

00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:06.383
Oftentimes, they are most famous, today,

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:08.716
for their cuneiform writing.

00:02:08.716 --> 00:02:10.928
And we'll do probably a
whole series of videos...

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:13.345
It's one of the original ways

00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:19.068
of symbolic writing that
the Sumerians developed.

00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:22.302
You might also hear about the Akkadians.

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:25.253
And the Akkadians were both...

00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:29.925
Akkadian could be referring
to an actual empire

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.159
or it could be referring
to the Akkadian language.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.533
And same thing about Sumerian.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.450
You might hear about the Assyrians.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.263
You might hear about the Babylonians.

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:50.443
And all of these groups are
associated with Mesopotamia.

00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:54.093
The Sumerians lived generally

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.877
in this area right around here.

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:00.796
In a future video, we might talk about

00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:04.475
Abraham from the Old Testament is from Ur,

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:07.380
which is a Sumerian city.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.961
And Sumerian is also a language.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:12.254
It's a language that's not related

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:15.489
to the languages that we now
associate with the region

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.319
or the languages that were
spoken by the Akkadians.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.462
The Akkadians...

00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:22.853
So, if we're talking about languages

00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:25.390
that are similar to
modern spoken languages,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.133
Akkadian was a Semitic language.

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:29.157
Let me write that down.

00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:30.407
It was Semitic.

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:35.899
So, Akkadian is related
to Arabic and Hebrew and,

00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:41.881
if we think about more
ancient times, Aramaic.

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:46.691
So, all of these things were related.

00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:48.727
And the Assyrians and Babylonians,

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:51.477
they spoke the Akkadian language.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.503
Or, if we go later on, they spoke Aramaic.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.919
But they were in constant
contact with the Sumerians.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.515
So they even have Akkadian

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:04.098
being written with a
cuneiform-type script.

00:04:05.627 --> 00:04:07.757
And the general geographies where

00:04:07.757 --> 00:04:09.314
these different civilizations,

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:11.691
these different empires, sprung up from...

00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:15.211
So, you have Nineveh right over here.

00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:19.715
That is the historical capital
of the Assyrian Empire.

00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:22.349
And, on my little line here,
and this isn't exact....

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.811
We're learning more and more about

00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:25.572
this time period all of the time.

00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:28.637
You have to realize we're
talking about 3000 BCE.

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:31.176
That's over 5000 years ago.

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:32.364
So, we're still trying to

00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:34.655
put all the puzzle pieces together.

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:36.656
But we believe around 3000 BCE

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:41.199
there was a somewhat
unified Akkadian Empire.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.267
Then it started to break up and split up.

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:47.350
At some points, you had the Assyrians

00:04:49.478 --> 00:04:51.965
more or less in control of the region.

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:55.076
At other points, you had the Babylonians

00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:57.246
with the capital at Babylon.

00:04:57.246 --> 00:05:00.153
And we'll talk about
famous Babylonian kings,

00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:02.607
like Hammurabi and Nebuchadnezzar.

00:05:02.607 --> 00:05:05.388
And, actually, Babylon gets
referred to a lot more.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.720
But, for most of this time
period we're talking about,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.077
the Assyrians were actually
the dominant empire

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.918
with their capital at Nineveh.

00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:15.087
Sumer, you see that here.

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:17.868
Ur where Abraham is from.

00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:21.868
That was more often part
of these other empires.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.973
And so, this is just a
start to get us acquainted

00:05:25.973 --> 00:05:28.720
with this region of the
world, with Mesopotamia.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.523
As we go off into the next two videos,

00:05:30.523 --> 00:05:32.038
we'll continue to dig deeper.

00:05:32.038 --> 00:05:33.513
We'll talk a little bit about...

00:05:33.513 --> 00:05:35.800
We'll talk more about
the cuneiform writing.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.395
We'll talk more about Hammurabi

00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:39.235
and his famous code of laws

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:43.001
that seems to have
influenced the Old Testament.

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.334
We'll talk more about
Nebuchadnezzar and his role.

00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:48.363
And he actually has a role in
the Old Testament, as well.

00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:51.760
And the interactions between
these different civilizations.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.868
It gets quite interesting.
