00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.700
Another review role is that of the reader. Reviews should be systematic and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.460
thorough. One way to deal with this need is to explicitly address each part of

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.950
the artifact being reviewed. For example, in the code review, each line should

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.280
be individually looked at. The reader is the person responsible for

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.150
enforcing this thoroughness by leading the participants through the artifact and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.780
for each part paraphrasing what, what the artifact is expressing for

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.590
that part. The paraphrasing should be its, should be descriptive, and

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.320
not try to say why that particular part is there. Some organizations run their

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.360
reviews with the artifact's authors being the readers. Other organizations make

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.240
sure that someone else does the reading. I think in the case of the first type

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.970
of organization, the thought is that an author might buy us the discussion

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.680
by emphasizing certain things, the author felt as important, even at the expense

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.300
of perhaps hiding some details which need to be looked at more carefully.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.620
In either case, the reader should use impersonal pronouns such as it,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.080
referring to the artifact, rather than referring directly to the author with I,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.330
or he, or she, or something like that. Personalizing a review by using I and,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.440
and you, and, and so on, can raise the defensiveness level of

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.960
the participants thereby reducing the review's effectiveness.
