00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello! Welcome back to another episode of my cats reviewing things.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.560
As a crazy cat mom, I gotta try out all these kinds of different products, see what my cats enjoy.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.100
Then spread I the knowledge.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.060
So today my cats are going to go in this stroller that I found on Amazon.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.220
And we'll see if they like- uh- the outside world!

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.560
Let's start oldest,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.480
'cause Lily's already here.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.280
Oh, she's expressing her excitement.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.160
And it's got like a mesh interior

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.260
which is cool...

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.520
And then you can just lock them in there!
Like a lil-like a little prisoner!

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.640
Are you excited Lily?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.420
Let's go see the outside world, my love.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.140
Oh, there's a lot of people coming by... so that'll- that'll freak her out.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.920
It's okay! *Lily meows*

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.760
(Unintelligible words)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.260
You're sitting the wrong way! You're supposed to enjoy the view of outside

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.560
Oh they sound so loud

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.380
Okay, ready? You ready?

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.300
Let's do this.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.260
I see her little face from the mesh- Oh!

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.620
It's okay! It's supposed to be fun!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.880
*Lily meows* You always want to go outside!

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.380
We'll go to the roof so there's less people

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.460
Oh look, I just bumped into the- *laughs*

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.560
I think she's really scared... I'm gonna take her back down

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.920
Maybe Congress could handle

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.460
But she's been out here a couple times now

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.720
*aggressively pushing close button* Byyyyyyyyyyye! We gotta go back down now!

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560
You try to do good things for your cats

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.800
And- uh- it turns out they just like boxes and staying at home.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.900
They're not very adventurous.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.580
Here you go, you're free now!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.760
I tried.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.740
Next one!

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.180
Oh you look ready to go, Jimbo!

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.000
You look ready!

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.660
Oh you look rea-

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.500
*cat fighting back* You look ready to go!

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.100
Oh you look ready to go!

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.880
YOU LOOK READY TO GO BOY

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.180
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE!

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.220
Okay! Let's do Abigail!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400
Here you go, my love

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.900
Watch your lil head, watch your little tail

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.280
Watch the tail, k watch the little head

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.060
Got the mesh on ya

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.220
*Abigail meows*

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.840
*Abigail meows even more* Oh my goodness, already

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.140
Oh no

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.820
Nope! No, going back. Can't do it, can't do it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.180
I feel like there's no point in taking fucking Jimmy outside

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.960
If they don't like it, Jimmy ain't gonna like it

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.020
I thought you would enjoy it, I'm sorry Abigail

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.100
I'm sorry. I thought you- you always want to look at the outside world

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.320
I got this for you and for Congo

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.560
...and for Jimmy

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.580
Well... at least try a new thing, right Jimbo?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.600
We'll try a new thing, and if you don't like it, that's fine!

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.680
Well, if you don't like it, I'll take you back immediately.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.920
*Struggling*

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.180
This is not a good sign... this is not a good sign at all.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.960
Okay *sighs*!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.720
Let's see if we can get 3 steps before he declares his hatred of it.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.280
*Jimmy meows* ...Nope *laughs*

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.780
Okay! Buh-bye! Go ahead, bye bye!

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.680
Alright Congo. We'll see- ahh. You're the only one who liked the backpack

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.340
and the costume. We'll see if you like it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.580
Here you go!

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.060
We'll see how far we get with you! Little boy! Huh?!

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.960
Hi!

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.620
How you like it?

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.560
He seems... chill

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.640
I feel like- when they have to go to the vet, this would be great transportation

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.800
Instead of having to carry a heavy box, you know?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.120
And it's better than the backpack, I think

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.780
'cause at least they're not like jostling around with you

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.740
Plenty of space in there for you!

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.100
Oh he's just sitting!

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.280
Oh good boy! Good boy!

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.660
We're going to enjoy a nice stroll on the- on the roof.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.180
He seems very chill, watch our for that uh- couch

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.320
Chill-ass time

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.560
Oh my god! You're so good!

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.740
You're the only one who's into new things

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.900
Let's see if we can even uh- pop this thing off so he can, like, enjoy the view!

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.480
Are you okay?

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.300
Kinda looks scared

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.120
Good job, baby! We'll go down to the apartment!

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.780
Nope! Nope! Nope, baby! Nope! Okay

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.620
Called it good too soon. I see how that is... you stay in there

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.920
Nope, we're on a roof- you don't die today

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.820
Look, you can see his little face over here

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120
It's okay!

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.760
Duh, duh... congratulations!

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.820
So this seems like the perfect way to get them to the vet!

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.720
...except for maybe how to get this whole contraption in the car, perhaps?

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.140
But it's easier than I think a crate and lighter

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.080
And it seems nice cause I'll... I don't know, pushing around a cat in a stroller is kind of fun.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.740
And if you HAVE to take them somewhere and they hate it, might as well take them to the vet in this thing!

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.120
I would highly recommend it for transporting your cat to-and-fro!

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.480
Especially if your vet is walking distance!

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.220
But- uh- otherwise, I have no use for it!

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.320
Cause- uh- they didn't like it at all!
