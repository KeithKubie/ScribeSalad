00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.170
Let's look more formally at
what Cloud computing provides.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.200
Traditionally businesses would buy and

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.280
configure the resources that
are needed for their services.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.730
How many resources should be
purchased and configured?

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.930
So what is the capacity
of those resources?

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.550
Well that typically would be based on

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.520
some expectations regarding the demand
for that particular business, for

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.570
that particular service,
typically considering the peak demand.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.130
So if we have a situation in which
the Demand follows this pink or

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.240
this red line, then the business
would configure their resources,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.130
their capacity,
based on this blue line, so

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.040
that it can tolerate the expected
peak in the service demand.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.500
Now the expectations turn out
to be not quite accurate and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.260
the demand ends up exceeding
the provision capacity.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.570
The business will end up with
a situation in which requests have

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.305
to be dropped and
there will be a lost opportunity.

00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:02.840
In the case of given the very
rapid spike in the workload,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.700
this lost opportunity would
have been tremendous.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.080
Instead, what we would like
would be the ideal case

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.980
is if the following were to happen.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.630
The capacity or the available resources
should scale elastically with the demand

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.340
and the scaling should be instantaneous.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.740
As soon as the demand increases,
the capacity should increase too.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.370
And then in the other direction, too,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.780
as soon as the demand decreases
the capacity should decrease as well.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.510
Meaning that the cost to operate
these resources, the cost to support

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.440
this service should be proportional to
the demand to the revenue opportunity.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.400
All of this should happen
automatically without the need for

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.550
some hacking wizardry.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.993
And all these resources can be
accessed anytime from anywhere.

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:53.385
One potential [INAUDIBLE] here
is that you wouldn't necessarily

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:57.235
own these resources that
magically appear on demand.

00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:01.095
But that may be something that
you're willing to compromise on

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:05.520
provided that you really do
achieve these kinds of benefits.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.660
And that there is some kind of
proper assurance as to what exactly

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.690
can possibly go wrong with these
resources that you're accessing.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.970
So the goal of Cloud Computing is
to provide these capabilities that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.340
match the idea scenario
as much as possible.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.410
The resulting requirements
can be distilled as follows.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.930
Cloud computing should provide on
demand, elastic resources and services.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.760
There should be fine-grained
pricing based on usage.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.510
Not for actual or
potentially idle physical

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.370
servers like in the hosting data centers
that were the alternative at the time.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.280
All the resources should be
professionally managed and hosted.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.070
And all of this should be available via
APIs that can be used for remote access.
