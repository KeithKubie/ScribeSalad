00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.860
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.500
Hello.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.250
Give me a cheer.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.020
[CHEERING]

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.880
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.400
Good.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.650
Thank you so much for coming
to Talks at Google today.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.620
I'm very pleased to
introduce Simon Bradley.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.210
Simon is joint editor of
the celebrated "Pevsner

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.320
Architectural Guide" to which
he has contributed a number

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.650
of notable revised volumes.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.547
He started trainspotting
age 11, and his

00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:21.630
is interest in railways
has broadened and endured.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.750
He's the author of "St. Pancras"
Station, and lives in London.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.416
Please, join me in giving
Simon a huge round of applause.

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:32.509
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.000
SIMON BRADLEY: Well, thank you,
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.452
St. Pancras Station, I am going
to start here, because that's

00:00:39.452 --> 00:00:40.160
what you see you.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.993
What you are seeing is
the view from the top

00:00:41.993 --> 00:00:46.370
of that very tall train
shed, the covered area where

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.720
the trains come in and out,
a great Victorian building

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.770
of the 1860s.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.250
The gasometer there, the gas
holder is a bit of a giveaway.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.110
And I show you
this now lost view,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.040
because this is where they built
the Eurostar extension, just

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.400
to perhaps introduce a sense of
the railways as a world apart.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.360
You know, here's a technology,
which when it was first built

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.400
was really still
quite new, the 1860s.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.020
The first mature railways start
in the 1830s, or just before.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.880
And it has to make
up its own rules.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.470
It's a system.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.830
It's a network, and it's
invented in Britain.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.700
So a great many of
the innovations,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.840
a great many of the
conventions, the language,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.366
vocabulary-- it's
all starting here.

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.240
And railways are
interesting, anyway, really,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.400
if you're interested
in railways.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
But if you're going to
get seriously interested,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.040
this really is the best country
to do it, because for reasons

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.760
that Ill come on to, but the
diversity and the complexity,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.400
but also the sense of them as
a site of constant innovation

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.220
and they're a combination
of very old and very new

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.850
sometimes.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.025
It's a quite
complicated picture.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.480
But I've been
thinking about Google,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.220
and thinking about information,
and thinking about complexity

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.540
and all of those things
which I'm sure many of you

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.150
are working with all the time.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.199
This is how to do things before
you haven't got software.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.450
These are railway tickets, as
I'm sure you saw straight away.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.950
But they're of a
very specific type.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.890
These were the
standard type which

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.390
were in use into the one 1980s.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.690
They finally disappeared
into the 1990s.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.290
They were invented in 1838
in a weird, one-off way.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.410
The young railways drew
in all sorts of people

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.447
from all walks of life.

00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:35.530
You couldn't be an apprentice
to them or anything,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.446
because they were new.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:40.770
They had to find
people, able people.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.330
And an unsuccessful
cabinet maker from Carlisle

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.406
called Thomas
Edmondson got a job

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:48.030
at one of the stations
on the Newcastle

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.140
and Carlisle railway, one
of the very early lines.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.290
It was built completely
isolated from anything else

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.550
at that time.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.094
And in his spare
moments, he began

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:58.260
to think about how they
could improve the ticketing.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.990
Up to that point, tickets were
written out by hand, largely.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.610
You went in, and the booking
office was called the booking

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.380
office because you
booked your journey,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.720
and a clerk would have
some sort of printed form,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.600
but he would write them out.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.230
And this was very laborious
and also rather open to abuse.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.710
He could write one
thing in the book,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.427
and he could issue the ticket.

00:03:17.427 --> 00:03:19.260
He could take money,
and he could fiddle it.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.090
There was no record, no easy
way of keeping a record.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.600
So as well as being
time consuming and slow,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.070
it was also leaky.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.489
So Edmondson
thought, well, if you

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.530
print the tickets in
advance, but also you number

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.360
them in advance, then you
don't need to keep a record.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.930
You don't need to
account for it.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.625
The tickets themselves
are your record.

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:44.340
He more or less made
this all himself at home,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.060
a series of cylinders,
metal cylinders

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.300
with a spring at the bottom.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.070
It pushed the tickets up.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.110
You take the top ticket out.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.090
It's got a number on.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.080
You keep taking the tickets,
and the number remaining

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.040
gives you, by
subtraction, if you like,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.230
the number that you sold.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.180
And someone can
come along and check

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.290
that the amount of
money you've got,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.270
because everyone's
paying by cash,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.100
is equal to the number
of tickets sold.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.530
So this is a very
clever system, and he

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.430
tries to persuade his
superiors to adopt it.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.120
And they're not very
interested, but then

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.300
he just starts hawking it
around other companies,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.920
and within a couple of years,
he's got his own business.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.500
He's licensing his
system to other railways,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.220
and it conquers all
the other lines.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.480
And they're not very big.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.470
If you're a bit older, you
probably remember these things.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.000
They're about one inch by
two, quite easy to lose.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.850
And the convention
until fairly recently,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.677
coming into Victoria into
the early 70s, I think,

00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:45.510
was that the ticket
collector would tear it.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.300
If you had a return ticket,
he'd tear it in half

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.810
and give you back
the other half.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.440
So people talked
about the return half.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.940
So the half ticket,
one inch square,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.220
was even easier to lose.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.440
And you can imagine music
or jokes and things about,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.704
I've lost me return half.

00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:03.120
You were stranded, or you had
to buy another ticket, which

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.380
would be expensive.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.740
So there's the Edmondson System.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.850
And what Edmondson
didn't anticipate,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.635
and what nobody
anticipated, was what

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:14.718
was going to happen when
all these railways joined

00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:18.060
up, and from a series of
separate lines became a system

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.250
or a network.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.466
And that meant you
could travel through,

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.840
but you were travelling through
from the territory of one

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.750
company to another.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.150
You might be travelling through
several company territories.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.120
You might be traveling
or sending goods

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.130
through several company
territories as well.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.910
I won't talk much about
goods and freight,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.060
but they're at least as
important as the passengers

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.610
in terms of the
business side of things.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.780
So what happens then is
that in the Midlands,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.340
where lines first
really start coalescing,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.250
a few companies get together,
and they set up what's

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.610
called a railway clearinghouse.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.200
It's a place where all
the costs and income

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.630
can be assessed and
sorted out, usually

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.130
on the basis of mileage.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.280
So this requires a
very complicated series

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.010
of calculations.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.350
You have to work out exactly
how long all the lines are,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.980
and agree with one another
about how long the lines are,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.670
apportion a charge for carrying
a person, a half fare, parcels,

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.290
freight, all the rest of
it, pass your records on.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.310
So the photograph you see-- this
is the railway clearinghouse

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.910
in about 1930, I suppose.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.980
It's not a very well
recorded building at all.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.030
There are very few photographs
of what actually went on there.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.897
But what the women
there are doing--

00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:36.980
it does seem to be almost
entirely women-- they've

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.354
got on the table
in front of them

00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:40.890
huge bundles of these Edmondson
tickets, because the tickets

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.840
themselves then became, if you
like, the information, what

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.850
was passed on.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.820
The tickets became
their own receipts,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.170
their own counterfoils.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.170
And so they're checking.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.770
They're number crunching, I
think before anything even

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.900
like an adding machine.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.190
You certainly can't see one.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.725
Of course electronic media
can do more and more things

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:06.350
all the time, but
there's something awe

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.310
inspiring about the complexity
and the size and scale of what

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.680
the railways were
doing through entirely

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.890
old-fashioned pen and
paper sort of media,

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.399
again within living memory.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:26.190
It still exists, the
railway clearinghouse,

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.023
the buildings there.

00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:30.060
It's like an enormous and very,
very plain Georgian terrace

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.690
somewhere north
of Euston station.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.480
You could be
mistaken for thinking

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.800
it had been a box factory
or something like that.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.500
But it grew and grew,
because eventually

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.980
all the British companies,
except for a few very small

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.205
ones, all came onside.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.500
So now back to the origins.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.610
This is the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.200
It opened in 8:30, the first
mature passenger railway.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.970
There were other ways
of travelling by train,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.730
behind a horse, horse
drawn vehicles on rail,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.689
things like that.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.980
But this is the first one
that had publicly advertised,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.540
timetabled steam-hauled
trains, and was conceived

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.600
as such from the beginning.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.580
And this introduces
the question of class.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.230
Then there was first,
second, and third class.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.320
And it doesn't
take much thinking

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.740
to see which ones they are.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.490
The upper train is
all first class.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.720
They had separate first
class trains originally.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.700
And the carriages looked
like what they actually were,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.659
which is stagecoach bodies.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.880
Each carriage there is made up
of effectively three stagecoach

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.400
or private road carriage bodies.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.590
That's how they were
built. They were

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.089
built by the same people who
were building the stagecoaches,

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:44.390
because there wasn't suddenly
a new industry of railway

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.240
carriage building.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.740
You just found someone who would
build these things for you.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.970
And then right at
the very back, you

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.590
see what's called
a carriage truck.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.940
It's a flat wagon onto which
you could drive your carriage

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.530
if you happen to
be wealthy enough

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.340
to have your own carriage.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.010
So people having done that, they
would actually travel in them.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.195
And it sounds a bit outlandish,
and it was not entirely safe,

00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:06.570
because you would get cinders
from the locomotive falling

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.640
on you and things like that,
and it was certainly exposed.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.470
But the idea came back
when the Eurostar trains

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.510
started running.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.170
If you've ever done it,
you drive your vehicle

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.192
into a covered
wagon, in this case,

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:22.150
and you go through the
tunnel, and you come out

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.900
on the other side.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.130
So it's an idea that
came, went, and then

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.070
has come back again in
a very specific way.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.850
Below that, second class and
a version of third class,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.350
I think, we've got
more or less exposed.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.590
As it settled down, eventually,
third class-- and we'll

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.780
see some early examples later--
were actually completely open.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.100
They were almost like cattle
trucks without roofs, at least

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.600
in the early years
of the railway.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.610
So you're creating a
series of social spaces,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.860
because stagecoaches
were social spaces too.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.520
But more people are traveling,
and they're travelling further,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.985
and the experience of the
chance to travel is moving down

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:06.610
the social scale,
because it's cheaper.

00:10:09.052 --> 00:10:10.010
So this is first class.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.770
This is first class in 1855.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.780
A painting called "First
Class, the Meeting."

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:21.930
And I show it because it gives
the idea of close confinement

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.280
with strangers and
at its loveliest.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.280
Because what's happening
here is the young man--

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.654
you can see he's
an army officer.

00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:30.200
He's got his sword-- is meeting
the thoroughly respectable

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.400
gentleman, a papa, or guardian,
or an uncle, or something,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.680
and the young lady
who is with him,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.190
and they're falling in love.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.780
And it was all spelled out.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.820
But he's sitting
safely between them.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.410
He's earnest, and
obviously a good sort,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.910
and she's obviously
a good sort too,

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.912
because she's rather
modest and shy.

00:10:48.912 --> 00:10:50.120
But all these details matter.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.580
There was a previous
version of this painting

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.038
shown at the Royal
Academy the year

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:55.210
before with the same title.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.420
And the old gentleman is
sitting in the corner seat,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.300
and he's fallen asleep.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.660
And the young lady is
looking a bit less shy.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.950
And the young gentleman,
he's not an army officer.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.800
He's a fisherman.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.330
He's out.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.484
He's on the pull, you might say.

00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:11.650
And people thought this
painting was rather immoral.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.870
So this gives you a
sense of the slightly

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.220
stuffy and preposterous ways
in which the Victorians could

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.410
moralize their art.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.120
Art had to be improving,
or it had to be decorous.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.344
But it's also a precious
view of something

00:11:26.344 --> 00:11:28.760
which wasn't very well recorded
at the time-- the interior

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.800
of a railway compartment, a
first class rather compartment,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.080
as they reached
their early maturity.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.240
So you see lots of plush,
lots of upholstery.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.000
It's a luxurious space.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.330
Difficult to keep clean,
but it had lots of labor

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.827
to try and do it.

00:11:41.827 --> 00:11:43.660
There are things,
slightly mysterious things

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.380
known as grommets hanging
on the upright mullian thing

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.970
by the window.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.690
These were to help
you in and out.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.135
You grabbed on to them, or you
could rest your arm in them

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:55.510
if your arm got
tired apparently.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.840
That sounds more like a way of
cutting off your circulation.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.320
And these lingered until
the early 20th century.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.750
The thing above the
old gentleman's head,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.170
that's his hat.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.250
They had straps or strings
drawn across the roofs

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.370
of the carriages for
gentlemen's hats.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.187
Because hats were all
the stovepipe kind then.

00:12:20.187 --> 00:12:22.520
And you turned them upside
down, and you fitted them in.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.986
And you didn't tread on
them, or knock them over,

00:12:24.986 --> 00:12:26.860
because they were both
fragile and expensive.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.530
Now down to second class.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.760
This is about 1890,
so rather less idyllic

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.240
and probably a rather
more realistic view.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.420
Well, yes the recent
coinage manspreading,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.724
there's definitely some
manspreading going on here.

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:47.640
Also, there's smoking.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.556
You couldn't smoke in
early railway carriages,

00:12:49.556 --> 00:12:51.960
but as more and more
people in the wider world

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.780
started smoking-- cigarettes
came in, for instance,

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.366
in the 1850s-- and it got very
hard to police, one reason

00:12:58.366 --> 00:13:00.990
being that you couldn't walk up
and down the train checking who

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.770
was smoking, because the
trains were still made up

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.239
of these separate compartments.

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:05.780
So once you were in
your compartment,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.400
that was your space until you
got the chance to get out.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.650
And that might be for
hours, and hours, and hours.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.301
So you had to
think about how you

00:13:12.301 --> 00:13:13.800
dealt with lavatories,
how you dealt

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.970
with refreshments and food.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.040
There's a lot about
this in the book,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.500
and I won't go on about it.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.510
But gradually we get
the modern joined up

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.620
train with a carriage, with a
corridor, or the connections

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.832
between the carriages.

00:13:23.832 --> 00:13:25.290
And on a long
distance journey, you

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.325
might also have a buffet
car, a restaurant car,

00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:28.283
or something like that.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.630
So close confinement
with strangers.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.470
Well, there's something
edgy about it, potentially.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.830
And worse than that, it was
something dangerous, and very

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.340
occasionally something fatal.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.930
This is from a rather
disreputable publication

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.000
called "The Illustrated
Police News," which

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.740
was just true crime stuff.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.240
So very cheaply produced
commercial artists

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.390
summing up scenes from the
most lurid and exciting crime

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.324
stories.

00:14:02.324 --> 00:14:03.740
And this was its
front page story.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.580
This was the Balcombe
Tunnel Murder.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.080
Anyone come in from
Brighton or come

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.660
through the Balcombe Tunnel?

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.620
If you come that
way, then you're

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.570
passing through the site
of Britain's second railway

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.200
murder, by which
I mean an attack

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.460
on a stranger in a train.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.410
There was an unsuccessful
would-be actor.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.060
You see his rather unimpressive
profile at the bottom.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.120
And anxious for more money to
keep up his flash appearance,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.220
he attacked a banker,
stockbroker in the compartment

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.070
and robbed him of his
gold watch and money,

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.410
threw him out, was
caught and then escaped.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.610
The police didn't really
distinguish themselves.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.440
He was being watched in a house,
but they didn't watch the back,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.780
so he just escaped
out of the back.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.650
Then they found him.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.370
He went to ground
somewhere in London,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.940
and they found him in his
lodgings with false whiskers

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.090
and things from his
theatrical friends,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.770
trying to disguise himself.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.081
But it was no good, and
he was eventually hanged.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.560
So moving on from that
model of the compartment,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.380
this is an early central
gangway type carriage.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.240
This is from the Great
Western Railway in the 1930s.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.400
And this type was
known well before then,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.730
but the British system for
long distance journeys,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.500
the preferred form
remained the kind

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.430
with a corridor down one side
and a series of compartments

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.340
with sliding doors
opening off it.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.800
These were around on our system
until about 10 years ago,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.496
and going back
more like 15 years,

00:15:37.496 --> 00:15:38.870
you start to find
them especially

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.800
on Southern Electric, where
the first class remained

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.370
of that type.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.370
They become more common.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.350
So you probably will have
encountered some of these.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.120
Latterly, it tended
to be first class that

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.578
had their compartments, and
second class that was all open.

00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:52.839
But now even first
class is open.

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:54.380
And whenever they
did tests, whenever

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.019
they did a public
survey, everyone

00:15:58.019 --> 00:15:59.310
preferred the compartment type.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.490
There was something about
the early travelling

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.930
in compartments and getting
used to the idea that,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.540
for all its disadvantages in
terms of being stuck in one

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.620
space, and the difficulty
of moving through the train,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.780
that people preferred it.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.460
But finally the
railways persuaded us

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.751
that we should move into the
more space efficient kind,

00:16:16.751 --> 00:16:18.720
or would rather stop
giving us the choice.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.670
And now pretty well
everyone travels

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.500
in something rather
more like, if you like,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.460
the body of an airliner.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.390
And as we're on so close to
Victoria and Southern Electric

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.350
territory, I couldn't resist
showing this-- the double deck

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.920
train.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.870
This is it on the 1st of
November 1949 on a trial trip.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.322
Everyone looks a
bit apprehensive,

00:16:40.322 --> 00:16:42.030
and it entered service
the following day.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:46.240
There were only ever eight of
these carriages, two four car

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.150
units.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.530
And they worked out of Charing
Cross and Cannon Street

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.750
on the Dartford Loop.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.360
And they were an attempt
to fit more people in.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.670
it's a standard dilemma of
overcrowded trains in the rush

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.570
hour.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.870
The idea being that you
could put people on top,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.369
and you get more space.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.680
So there are little
staircases in there.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.609
They weren't a success.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.557
One reason is they
were just too cramped.

00:17:10.557 --> 00:17:13.140
There's a thing called a loading
gauge, which is a railway way

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.700
term for how big you
can make your vehicles,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.470
carriages, locomotives
before they start

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.760
hitting things, the
clearances around the tunnels,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.240
and the platforms, and the
buildings, and all of that,

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.529
and also the other tracks.

00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:28.690
It didn't really allow
British trains ever

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.430
to push to that
double deck stage,

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.422
but they're relatively
common on the continents

00:17:33.422 --> 00:17:34.380
and in other countries.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.660
You do find these double deck,
especially commuter carriages,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.110
but it didn't quite work here.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.790
So now leaving the
train and moving

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.060
into the network, the
infrastructure, the buildings--

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.900
all of those things.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.190
I'll show a few views
of railway stations.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.770
This is the very first
Euston Station, 1837.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.790
So only just
Victorian, if you like.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.270
That's when Queen Victoria
comes to the throne.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.250
So railways are a
pre-Victorian invention

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.880
in this country, at least.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.030
And there you can see,
lined up, those are some

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.590
opened third class carriages.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.327
So imagine I'm in 1837.

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:15.910
All you could do was
go to Birmingham,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.201
but that's still a long way
and took you several hours,

00:18:18.201 --> 00:18:20.370
because the train would
go at a maximum maybe 30,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.480
40 miles an hour
if you were lucky.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.310
But open carriages are
running to Scotland

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:31.170
by the time that they're
finally put a stop to,

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.340
because the government
starts steering

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.650
the quality of what we don't
might call the passenger

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.330
experience.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.100
They insist on certain
minimum standards.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.500
So this is the carriages.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.390
The Space.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.825
It's under, it's the absolute
novelty of all of this.

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:49.200
You have to think there's
nothing like this building that

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.260
had existed 10 years before.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.760
It's using all the
new technologies,

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.411
using mass production
of cast iron.

00:18:54.411 --> 00:18:56.410
And that gives you those
columns, and the arches

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.240
between, and the rather spidery
network of braces and hangers

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.810
which are sitting underneath
the roof and the framing

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.020
of the roof too.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:10.570
The roof itself has is wooden
with a few glass windows.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.360
This is quite a common
early type of railway train

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.250
shed, as we call them, the
shelter for the trains.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.410
Not so common now, because
most of them have gone,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.326
but actually if you go
to Dublin where there's

00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:25.330
been much less
pressure to rebuild

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.580
and much less expansion,
several of the railway termini

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.766
there are 1840s
buildings, and they still

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:32.640
have train sheds of just
this type, even down

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.450
to those rather elegant
arches, in the space

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.370
between the arch in the
horizontal above it,

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.605
those diminishing circles.

00:19:41.605 --> 00:19:42.480
You see that pattern.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.640
It was a way of giving lightness
and strength to something,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.590
but also in aesthetically
pleasing way,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.679
not quite like fractal,
but the same shape,

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:55.345
but diminishing in
size and in sequence.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.730
Now we jump forward, because
again, this is changing.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.790
This is all changing
very quickly,

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.331
and it's getting
bigger very quickly.

00:20:04.331 --> 00:20:07.990
And they're realizing
not quite that they've

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.090
created a monster that
they can't control,

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.490
but that the growing lad
is going to require rather

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.580
more by way of bigger clothes
and all the rest of it

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.440
for his future prosperity.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.430
So this is Paddington
in the 1850s.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.890
It's an 1860s image
of Paddington,

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.390
and Paddington is
built in the 1850s.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.070
It's a famous painting, or
was famous in its day, called

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.090
"The Railway Station."

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:39.602
And it shows you every type and
condition of person all about

00:20:39.602 --> 00:20:40.560
to travel on the train.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.120
It's full of incident.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.200
There's plainclothes
policemen arresting

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.082
a pickpocket in one corner.

00:20:46.082 --> 00:20:47.790
You can see who's
going off to the races.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.547
You can see who's respectable
and not quite so respectable,

00:20:50.547 --> 00:20:51.880
the different classes and types.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.140
Because again, this is the
railways as a social condenser,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.780
or a place where people come
into close proximity on much

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.760
more equal terms than
they might have expected.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.007
The duke and the peasant are
rubbing shoulders briefly,

00:21:07.007 --> 00:21:09.340
and they're both customers
of the Great Western Railway,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.464
even if they're going to
be travelling in different

00:21:11.464 --> 00:21:12.030
carriages.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.430
You see also that luggage
was put on top early on,

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.300
and then they'd put a tarpaulin
over it in case it rained.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.990
This arrangement didn't last.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.090
They started having separate
guards vans, usually, which

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.450
would take your baggage for
you, and then would put it out

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.874
at the correct station, so it
had to be correctly labeled.

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:32.040
More like the airline model.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.500
You did it with
your big luggage.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.750
You didn't travel with it.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.708
You couldn't try and take
it into the carriage.

00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:38.280
There just wasn't the room.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.420
But look at that roof up above.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.370
Now we've got something
arched, and the arch form

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:49.300
gives you more potential
to push the dimensions.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.336
So Paddington has got
three parallel arch spans,

00:21:52.336 --> 00:21:54.210
and they're wider than
the Euston ones, which

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.280
were just a simple up
and down ridged roof.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.060
I could go on and
on about all this,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.900
because the first
railway book I wrote

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.050
was a little monograph
on St. Pancras Station.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.780
And St. Pancras where
the climax comes,

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:13.069
because that was 245, 246 feet
across, over 100 feet high.

00:22:13.069 --> 00:22:14.860
I have to get the exact
metric equivalents,

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.910
but that was the widest single
span structure in the world.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.380
And it kept that
record for 20 years.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.000
So again, it's the railway
forcing innovation and pushing

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.850
technology to its limit.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.090
So it's an exciting story.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.900
Up until about 1880, 1900,
quite a few major themes

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.750
in the roadway are just
about bigger, faster, better.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.040
And faster, obviously,
goes on into our own times.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.840
So Paddington Station,
well, one more image.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.210
Another instance of
railways driving forward

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.040
without even really planning
or expecting to do so.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.280
Hotels, they don't
start building hotels,

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.002
but then they think, well,
we've got a captive market.

00:23:02.002 --> 00:23:03.710
People are going to
want to travel early.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.790
People are going to
arrive late at night.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.960
How nice to have a hotel
ready and waiting for them?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.580
Or, looking at it another way,
why should all this custom

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.520
go to people who aren't
part of our company?

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.090
So stations start being
planned with hotels,

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.830
and Paddington is
one of the earliest.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.950
That hotel is still there.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.180
The image is one of the little
pictures, carriage pictures,

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.410
that used to be put up in
those railway compartments.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.820
So if the railway is
advertising itself, if you like.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.949
to its passengers.

00:23:30.949 --> 00:23:31.990
They weren't all adverts.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.580
Sometimes, they were
just pretty views.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.121
But then again, the
pretty views were

00:23:35.121 --> 00:23:37.610
of places you could
go to on the railways.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.690
And these carriage pictures
would sit there for decades.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.130
There were still Edwardian
Victorian ones knocking around

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.612
in the system in the '50s.

00:23:46.612 --> 00:23:48.070
And I think that's
something that's

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.470
been lost from the
system now, the sense

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.099
of the very old stuff still
working alongside the very new.

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.640
You have to look at
the buildings now

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.370
to get that sense of the
depth of historical time.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:05.756
And the genius behind the
Great Western was Brunel.

00:24:05.756 --> 00:24:07.380
And Brunel's a rather
culty figure now,

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.290
and I think he fits a
certain modern idea of what

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.255
a genius and
innovator should be,

00:24:13.255 --> 00:24:14.630
because he's a
bit of a maverick.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.420
He's a bit of an outsider.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.460
He cuts a dash.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.760
You can probably visualize him
with his hat and his cigar.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.470
And he forces his ideas through.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.080
People think the ideas
won't work, and they will.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.097
Well, a great deal
of this is true.

00:24:30.097 --> 00:24:32.180
And he was a genius, and
he was a magnetic figure.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.250
And we're lucky to have
him, or have had him.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.730
But it didn't all
work quite as planned.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.940
So this image, it's
called "Glocester,

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.570
the Change of Gauge."

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.194
And the point being that
the original railways,

00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:48.860
the first railways
built in this country

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.170
and then taken around the world,
were to the same size-- 4 feet

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.940
8 and 1/2 inches
between the rails.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.910
So that's the gauge,
as the term goes.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.914
So you can take a
train from Britain,

00:24:59.914 --> 00:25:02.080
and you can run it all the
way across the continent.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.380
You can run it all the way
from the top of the Americas

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.300
down to the bottom.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.070
There are parts of the world
where the gauge is different.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.750
India is one.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:08.830
Russia is another.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.120
But as a rule, there is
what's called standard gauge.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.150
It's there in Australia.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.233
It's there in New Zealand.

00:25:14.233 --> 00:25:15.060
It's the same here.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.800
And that's not just because
of Britain being the model.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.340
It's partly that.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.280
But it's for obvious reasons
of being able to run through.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.330
Brunel, before this had become
quite so clear as it rapidly

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.074
did become, looked
at the system,

00:25:30.074 --> 00:25:32.740
and thought he was going to redo
it from scratch, because that's

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.614
how he liked to work.

00:25:33.614 --> 00:25:35.530
So he thought, this
gauge is too small.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.200
Make it wider.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.080
Make it half as wide again.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.680
Seven foot and one fourth
inch, in this instance.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.720
Then you could have
more stable trains.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.080
You can have trains that
will therefore run faster.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.696
Advantages all around-- bigger
and bigger carrying capacity

00:25:48.696 --> 00:25:51.320
you'll need fewer carriages and
wagons to carry the same stuff.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.750
It all worked perfectly
except for the question

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.727
of what happens when you have to
carry stuff across the country.

00:25:56.727 --> 00:25:58.310
Going from London
to Bristol and back,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.476
the original Great Western,
it was a better railway.

00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:02.510
It smoother, faster,
all of those things.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.110
But if you wanted to take your
produce from the west country

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.280
up to the north or vice
versa, then everything

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.450
had to be taken off the wagons
and put onto other wagons.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.207
And this was extremely
expensive and inconvenient.

00:26:14.207 --> 00:26:16.040
Passengers, not quite
so bad, because people

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.510
were used to
changing trains, used

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.301
to having their luggage
taken off one train

00:26:19.301 --> 00:26:20.200
and put on another.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.540
But goods don't walk
across platforms.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.870
You've got to do it yourself.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.420
So there was a
great deal of this.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.340
And what happened
as a compromise

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.460
was that we had what
was called mixed gauge.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.410
You would have tracks
with both widths

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.610
so you could run
both kinds of train.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.160
And then gradually after that,
the broad gauge withered away.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.540
And it was a long time dying.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.900
The last broad gauge
trains ran in the 1890s.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.000
And they were
extraordinary things,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.170
great, big, broad,
squat-looking locomotives.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:48.820
Very stable.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.810
Stability was an
early preoccupation

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.780
before they'd worked out that
the better you made the track,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.320
the faster you could run trains
and still keep them stable.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.920
So in a sense, Brunel was
trying to solve a problem that

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.875
rapidly didn't exist.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.410
And it gets stranger.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.540
This is the only appearance of
the word cyberpunk in my book,

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.890
because the atmospheric railway
is so unearthly, and weird,

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.490
and ghostly.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:17.840
Brunel didn't invent it.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.900
I'll explain the
principle first.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.300
Rather than having a locomotive
burning coal, generating steam,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.550
pulling the train,
the idea was that you

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.280
would take that power
generating function

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.320
and just put it to one side.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.730
You'd build a pumping station.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:34.980
There, the steam is generated.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.479
The engine goes up
and down, and you

00:27:36.479 --> 00:27:38.715
pump air out of a big
cast iron pipe that

00:27:38.715 --> 00:27:41.170
runs down the middle of
the rails, as you see.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.000
This is all
pre-photography, so this

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.570
is a very good reconstruction
drawing from about 20

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.590
years ago, I think.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.140
And then the train has a
thing like a piston inside.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.920
And on top of the
cast iron pipe,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.220
there's a flap
which is sealable.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.590
And as the air is pulled out,
pumped out, I should say,

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.870
of the pipe, the
train is drawn along.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.580
And then you can brake the
train by releasing the vacuum

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.760
in the pipe and so on.

00:28:08.674 --> 00:28:10.340
So this actually did
work, but it worked

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.423
in only very limited ways.

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:14.232
So the first successful use of
it is a little line in Dublin,

00:28:14.232 --> 00:28:15.440
and it just goes up and down.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.360
It goes up every half
hour or something,

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.580
and as you keep pumping,
the vacuum is recreated.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.620
And you can run it
back down by gravity,

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.770
because it's all on a slope.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.530
So that's a good model.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.640
And they try and make it work
in the London to Croydon Line.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.580
Again, we're in the
Victoria territory.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.420
And they almost make it
work, but all the things

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.700
that don't work-- what
happens when two lines meet?

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.630
What do your pipes do?

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.810
They had to build a flyover.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.257
It was first railway flyover
to cross from one line

00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:45.340
to the other, because these
lines were effectively

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.340
self-contained.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.760
How do you reverse?

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.350
What happens if one pumping
station breaks down?

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.160
So they could just
about make it work.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.410
And Brunel implemented
it on a huge scale

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.060
on the line down
in the south Devon.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.030
You may remember
where the sea broke

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.890
through the dawlish
a winter or so ago,

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.640
and severed the
line for a while?

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.990
Well, that's the place.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.780
Other things that went
wrong-- the sea air

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.730
was much more damaging to
the technology of the pipe

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.767
than it had been further inland.

00:29:15.767 --> 00:29:18.350
There's a legend, which I think
must have some basis in truth,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.610
that the sealant of the slot
along the top of the pipe,

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.810
which was made of
leather, greased leather,

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.811
that rats came and ate it.

00:29:25.811 --> 00:29:27.560
That wasn't the main
fault. The main fault

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.893
was it got too brittle and hard.

00:29:28.893 --> 00:29:30.602
But you're going to
get rats, aren't you?

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:32.392
And they're going to
have a good old nibble

00:29:32.392 --> 00:29:33.660
if they get the chance.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.890
So this thing cost a fortune.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.730
Brunel invested a
lot of money in it

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.380
himself, because that
division between the engineer

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.570
and the capital raising
function was blurred back then.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.210
You would invest in
your own projects.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.490
You had a stake in them.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.340
And that was meant to
create confidence too.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.590
But eventually they gave up.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.519
So it worked.

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:56.310
It worked for a few
weeks, or a few months.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.940
It half worked.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.060
But it was a terrible idea,
and Brunel had his good friend

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.480
but often friendly
rival Robert Stephenson,

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.220
son of George Stephenson,
telling him so.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.670
It wasn't for the
want of telling.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:12.500
So this is Brunel, if you
like, at his most dedicated,

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.890
and dogged, and innovative,
but also just completely,

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.685
completely wrong.

00:30:16.685 --> 00:30:17.810
But it's a wonderful story.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.950
So now moving away, and
moving closer to our own time,

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.180
I'll just say something
about modernization, or what

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.010
actually we now call branding.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.440
In the '50,s mid-50s,
British Rail said, right,

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.610
we're going to modernize.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.540
We're going to have
electric and diesel trains.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.170
And a lot of the ways in
which that was planned

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.710
were misconceived, because they
couldn't anticipate the effect,

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.730
especially of road transport,
both for passengers

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.990
and for freight.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.190
So then there was a convulsion
in the early '60s, mid-60s,

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.290
with the Beeching cuts,
as well remembered.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.190
A lot of lines, rural
lines, less used lines

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.370
were closed down.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.520
But the positive side
of that was an attempt

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.937
to modernize their own
[INAUDIBLE] branch.

00:31:02.937 --> 00:31:04.770
And that meant thinking
about how it looked.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.353
That meant, for the
first time really,

00:31:06.353 --> 00:31:08.810
thinking about railways
as a national brand.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.670
So that was when British
Railways became British Rail.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.780
That was when the long
familiar but now vanished

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.600
colors of blue
and white, or just

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.990
all blue for the carriages,
came in with the yellow ends.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.600
So you see an early version
of that there in this model.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.300
And that was where the
double arrow sign came in.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.930
It was one of about 60 or 80
designs supplied by the design

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.550
research unit, which was a very
innovative all purpose design

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.050
house.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.280
It was designed by a
21-year-old who's still around,

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.380
Michael Jerry Barney.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.505
And he just happened to
come up with the best idea.

00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:44.160
It was like in an
advertising agency,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.867
the young cub gets the
best idea sort of story.

00:31:46.867 --> 00:31:48.450
And you should see
some of the others.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.070
They're so fussy and confusing.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.319
But the idea of the two
trains passing, or the speed,

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:52.860
or something.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.925
Anyway, it whatever
it was, that took.

00:31:55.925 --> 00:31:56.800
And there you see it.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.120
And there's Tamworth
Station in Staffordshire,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.524
which was being rebuilt as part
of an electrification scheme

00:32:02.524 --> 00:32:03.440
going up to the north.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.060
So this is a whole new railway.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.390
Everything is new except
for the very line itself.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.290
The route itself is a
very early Victorian line,

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.280
but everything else is new--
trains, track, electrification,

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.820
architecture, signage, the lot.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.640
And there is a design guide,
which with amazing control

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.120
freakery, showed you exactly how
the lettering should be done,

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.120
the intervals between the
lettering, how to proportion,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.930
everything aligned,
everything [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:34.372
It's a rather uptight,
modernist designers' paradise,

00:32:34.372 --> 00:32:36.080
this sense that
everything's on the grid.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.038
Everything is designed.

00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:39.060
But it was a very,
very good design.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.950
And I learned quite late
in writing the book in time

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.920
to put it in that the
Danish state railways liked

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.410
the look, the corporate
image of British Rail

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.877
so much that they just
bought it, basically.

00:32:50.877 --> 00:32:52.460
I haven't been to
Denmark, and I don't

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.876
know how far the stations still
have all the same signage,

00:32:54.876 --> 00:32:57.556
but the photographs of Danish
railways in the 70s, everything

00:32:57.556 --> 00:32:59.430
just looks like British
Rail signage used to,

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.090
but with those Danish
diacritical marks

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.366
and sort of funny signs
on the letters and things.

00:33:04.366 --> 00:33:05.740
But it must be
the only instance,

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.734
I think, of Scandinavian
public design

00:33:07.734 --> 00:33:09.900
copying British public
design, because normally it's

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.480
always going the other way.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.050
So there-- pride
in British Rail.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.300
If you've been at
the station in 1948,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.930
you might have seen
my father trying

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.110
to find a pair of binoculars
that he'd just been

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.640
given by a well-off auntie.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.700
Binoculars were an even more
expensive thing than now.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.442
Because he'd gone
there trainspotting.

00:33:34.442 --> 00:33:36.150
He had come from
Birmingham, but Tamworth

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.570
was where you saw faster,
better trains, expresses.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.370
And some bastard had
stolen his binoculars.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:44.780
And he never got them back, and
he never dared tell his auntie.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.570
But I've talked finally
about the trainspotting

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.290
side, or the enthusiasm side.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.630
I'm used to just people
kind of collapsing

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.810
the enthusiast-- the historian
even-- into the trainspotter.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:59.340
But I don't really mind, because
I was a trainspotter too.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.200
And in the '40s and
'50s, and into the '60s,

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.420
it wasn't a marginal thing.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.240
This is the what actually
sometimes gets forgotten.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.460
It was an absolutely ordinary
common boyhood thing, really.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.500
Boyhood and adolescence.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.010
It was like an interest
in anything else

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.199
you might be interested
in at that age.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:19.780
And it was free,
or cheap anyway.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.170
You bought a little book,
you ticked off the numbers.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.253
You did with your friends.

00:34:23.253 --> 00:34:25.550
It was a social activity.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:32.270
So that's the first proper
trainspotters handbook in 1943.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:37.020
So all the signs of the
generosity of certain sorts

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.315
of wartime censorship.

00:34:38.315 --> 00:34:40.449
A private publisher
published the details

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.487
of all Britain's
locomotives on their numbers

00:34:43.487 --> 00:34:45.070
in the midst of the
war, while I don't

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.949
suppose on the other side they
thought this information was

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:48.949
for general circulation.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:52.920
It might have been
militarily sensitive.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.679
And that's Newcastle
Central Station.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:35:02.610
And in fact, by the age of 15
the family moved back north.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:07.970
And so the lads on the right
are in the uniform of my school,

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.210
the Royal Grammar School.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:11.793
So that gives you an idea of it
being a social thing, I think.

00:35:11.793 --> 00:35:14.740
This isn't some kind of
sad loner with his anorak

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.420
and thermos flask.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.699
There are lots of these boys.

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:18.490
They're having fun.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.121
They're together.

00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:22.370
No they're [INAUDIBLE] pushing
and shoving and things.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.040
We know this because
the reason they

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.500
were on the castle-- that's
the great castle of Newcastle

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.100
itself-- was that
they'd all been

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.070
banned from the station
for misbehavior.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.040
So the station was
closed to trainspotters.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.180
Exactly the same thing
happened at Tamworth.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.405
Tamworth was the first
station closed trainspotters,

00:35:38.405 --> 00:35:40.530
because they were rushing
up and down the platforms

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.140
and generally
getting in the way.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.360
So that was probably when it
became a national phenomenon.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.090
And tracked the story through
the national newspapers.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:56.350
The word trainspotter first
appears around 1947, '48,

00:35:56.350 --> 00:36:00.260
with other variants
of the same name.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.892
And it's a youth culture.

00:36:01.892 --> 00:36:02.850
It comes up from below.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.266
No one's really encouraging
it apart from a few publishers

00:36:05.266 --> 00:36:06.550
who are profiting from it.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:09.250
The railways are of
two minds about it,

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.580
because they can be
a damned nuisance.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.340
But gradually, they come
to an accommodation.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:21.740
And finally, what came out
of that great convulsive

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.880
modernization, I
think more drastic

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.880
than that in any other
country, steam disappears

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.890
far quicker than people expect.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.640
Masses of lines
are closed, which

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.680
people thought and expected
were going to stay open.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.070
There's this big redesign.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.090
Suddenly, everything
looks different.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.715
Everything is all
modernist, and it had

00:36:36.715 --> 00:36:38.400
been a bit more traditional.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.220
And so this creates
a gigantic nostalgia

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.320
among the generation who
were spotters, especially

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.850
and a desire to save things.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.870
And what starts as little
local ventures here

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:53.550
and there gradually becomes
a national movement.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.580
And now you can travel.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.746
You can travel back in time.

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:59.060
This is the Mid Hants
Railway down in Hampshire,

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.640
which aims at just that
period, really-- '50s and '60s.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.870
So there you see
locomotives of the time,

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.112
and carriages and the
livery of that time,

00:37:07.112 --> 00:37:08.570
and engine shed
built from scratch.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.980
It's on a closed down line.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.502
It's on one of the lines that
fell victim to Dr. Beeching.

00:37:13.502 --> 00:37:15.710
And as you probably know,
there are dozens and dozens

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.080
of these lines, some of them
are excellent, some of them

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.872
not quite so good.

00:37:18.872 --> 00:37:20.830
If you're curious and
you've never been to one,

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.870
I recommend you start
with the Blue Bell Railway

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:23.950
down in Sussex.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.250
Easy, easy access from
Victoria and a connection

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.480
to the main line.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.370
That was the first
one to take over

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.380
a disused part of
the main network,

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.230
and that's been running
now for 55 years.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:38.330
So this is part of the British
way of life, you might say.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.712
But there's always something
distant as well about the past

00:37:41.712 --> 00:37:42.670
that you can't capture.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.961
So I'm going to end with an
image which I think conveys

00:37:44.961 --> 00:37:46.580
that quite well.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.910
These are men of the Lancashire
and Yorkshire Railway

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:52.850
in about 1910,
demonstrating with

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:57.090
wonderful unselfconsciousness
some of the hand signals used

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.940
when shunting.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.383
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:38:01.383 --> 00:38:03.788
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:08.170
AUDIENCE: I thought
trainspotting

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.120
was almost an extension of
collecting [INAUDIBLE] cards.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.240
It's ticking off--

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:11.820
SIMON BRADLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.676
AUDIENCE: And wanting to
collect the whole set.

00:38:13.676 --> 00:38:14.509
SIMON BRADLEY: Yeah.

00:38:14.509 --> 00:38:16.990
It's the collecting
instinct, but there was also

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.640
the excitement of the
unpredictability of it.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.780
And also, it was a bit edgy, and
that always sounds ridiculous,

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.400
but standing on a
platform, that's easy.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.350
Anyone can do that.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.027
But what you want to do is get
to where the best trains are.

00:38:29.027 --> 00:38:30.610
And that ultimately,
probably is going

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.520
to mean trespassing, or at
least you try and talk your way

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.320
into places.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.175
So places where
there were engine

00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:38.550
sheds, locomotive sheds, that
was where you wanted to be,

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.566
because then you could
just hoover the things up.

00:38:41.566 --> 00:38:46.980
And if you couldn't get
in by and arranged visit,

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.590
you might just of
go around anyway.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.900
And you did get caught, and you
did get thrown out sometimes,

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.524
and threatened to
have your name taken.

00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:56.010
MALE SPEAKER: Any questions?

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.360
Any questions?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.650
Yes, and if you could
repeat the question back.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.490
AUDIENCE: What
lessons from history

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:08.106
could improve the state
of the railways today?

00:39:08.106 --> 00:39:10.660
And the example I would give
is that we had had either wider

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.420
gauge from the
beginning, so if we

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.700
had gone from being able
to run faster trains,

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.334
or if we were able to, you
mentioned clearances before,

00:39:18.334 --> 00:39:20.250
if you could just lower
all the lines two feet

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.157
and run [INAUDIBLE]
trains, for example.

00:39:22.157 --> 00:39:23.740
Are there any of
these things that you

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.240
think aren't part
of current policy,

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.370
but could be implemented today?

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.190
SIMON BRADLEY: Well,
lessons from history,

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.080
this gets a bit
political, I suppose,

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.200
because the railways
were nationalized.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.200
And then they were privatized.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.980
And the nationalized
system, well this

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.370
is complicated territory.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.170
But you can certainly
point to the figure

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:49.550
that British Rail had as a
subsidy in its latter day

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.560
existence, which is
about 1 billion a year.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.860
And it was run on a shoestring,
but it was lean and efficient,

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.068
and it knew what it did well.

00:39:55.068 --> 00:39:59.200
And it knew what it would do if
it had a bit more money, more

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.400
electrification especially,
reopening some old lines,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.640
things like that.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.700
The privatized system now has a
subsidy of about 4.55 billion,

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.469
but it has twice
as many passengers.

00:40:10.469 --> 00:40:12.260
But twice as many
passengers doesn't always

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.009
mean that your line's
going to get cheaper

00:40:14.009 --> 00:40:17.530
to run, but to be honest,
if your turnover doubles

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.660
and your fares go massively up,
you should be able to do that.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.370
So we now have a system
which is more expensive,

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.370
has a much higher turnover,
and also requires more subsidy.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:30.330
And the reason, frankly, is
the way it was privatized.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:34.640
It was Christian Wolmar,
the writer on railways

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.940
and transport, said that it
took a single system that

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.671
ran at a modest subsidy, and
broke it up into about 100

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.170
companies, every
single one of which

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.090
was required to show a profit.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.270
So how do you do that?

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.900
And the answer is,
there are subsidies

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.660
fed in all sorts of ways,
including that Network Rail,

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.100
the publicly owned
body that owns

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.790
the track and the stations,
just racks up huge, huge debts.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.390
So that's got to 34 billion.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.485
And then when the EU
said that this is a con.

00:41:04.485 --> 00:41:06.610
You're using this to keep
it off the balance sheet,

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.026
because this is part of the
national debt, that's now been

00:41:09.026 --> 00:41:10.632
added to the national debt.

00:41:10.632 --> 00:41:12.590
So that's the privatized
system behind the sort

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.330
of headline figures.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.370
And it's just amazes
me that these, frankly,

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:21.930
rather scandalous arrangements
aren't that well known.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:27.530
So I would bring more
of it, as much of it

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.900
as you can back into
public ownership

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.890
or public-private partnership.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.310
And it's heartening in a modest
way with the overground system,

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.870
because those take lines which
were previously franchised out

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:41.580
to various operators, like the
North London Line, North London

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.320
Link.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.580
And they then become part
of the transport for London.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.450
And the service always
improves, and it always

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:52.900
becomes more efficient, but it's
no longer having to pay out.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.433
So there we are-- politics.

00:41:54.433 --> 00:41:55.974
AUDIENCE: I would
follow that up just

00:41:55.974 --> 00:41:59.295
to ask that if it's a
privatisation or a bringing

00:41:59.295 --> 00:42:02.110
it all back under
one roof happened,

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.069
if you were running
that group, what

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:05.860
would be the first
things you might change,

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.235
maybe more again from the
technical perspective in terms

00:42:08.235 --> 00:42:11.221
of being able to do more
now with what you now

00:42:11.221 --> 00:42:12.577
have brought together?

00:42:12.577 --> 00:42:14.160
SIMON BRADLEY: I
think electrification

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.200
is the one that does work,
and was very pleased that just

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.676
yesterday was it?

00:42:18.676 --> 00:42:21.300
That the pause, as it was called
on some of the electrification

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.705
projects on the main lines,
that's been unpaused.

00:42:25.705 --> 00:42:27.580
I don't think people in
the industry expected

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.680
that to happen. they thought
it might drift and drift

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.670
for years, but a lot of
that work had started.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:36.820
So before too long, you'll be
able to go to major cities--

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.340
Cardiff, Bristol, that
was already happening,

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:45.680
but Sheffield, Nottingham, and
really just do more of that,

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.485
actually.

00:42:46.485 --> 00:42:48.860
Not every line, because it
doesn't pay for smaller lines,

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.609
but you could electrify
up to Aberdeen.

00:42:51.609 --> 00:42:52.400
That would be good.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.009
You could electrify
down to Plymouth.

00:42:55.009 --> 00:42:55.800
That would be good.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.133
There's quite a lot still to
do, and Britain's massively

00:42:58.133 --> 00:43:00.895
behind the continent in how
far the lines are electrified.

00:43:04.254 --> 00:43:05.587
MALE SPEAKER: Round to the back.

00:43:11.503 --> 00:43:13.968
AUDIENCE: So this follows
on quite well from that.

00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:16.510
What do you of
[INAUDIBLE] Good idea?

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.251
Bad idea?

00:43:17.251 --> 00:43:19.840
More important, less important
than electrification?

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.250
SIMON BRADLEY: Yeah,
HS2, what do I think?

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:26.750
Well, slightly mixed feelings.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.280
Partly because there
are existing lines

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.340
which could be delivered
by electrification

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.050
and other relatively
modest improvements,

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:35.130
could deliver a lot.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.310
But it is disruptive to
electrify and improve

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:38.050
an existing line.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.660
You have to take
possession of the track.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.951
You have to put people on
buses over bank holidays, all

00:43:41.951 --> 00:43:43.940
of that.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.750
The best argument for it, I
think, is to increase capacity.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.590
Because if numbers carry
on going up and up,

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.951
then the existing
lines, eventually they

00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:52.700
reach their limit.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.460
However good the signalling,
however fast and long

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.060
and crammed the trains.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.780
So to have an extra route, that
would be a very good thing.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.430
And I think that's a better
argument than the accelerating

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:07.850
thing, because as a
lot of business people

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.660
said when they first
suggested we're

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.062
going to shave 15 minutes of
the journey to Birmingham,

00:44:15.062 --> 00:44:17.065
well, now train
time is work time.

00:44:17.065 --> 00:44:20.540
One of the themes
in railway history

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.227
is what you do
with all that time.

00:44:22.227 --> 00:44:23.810
There was a great
explosion in reading

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.220
and publications and
things aimed specifically

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.452
at travelers.

00:44:28.452 --> 00:44:29.160
And you can work.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.060
And then of course, as
technology advances,

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.550
you can do almost
anything, really.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.850
You can have your business
meeting on the train

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.930
through Wi-Fi.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:41.530
Railways is a
difficult technology

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:45.440
to make all the remote
wireless technologies work.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.090
I couldn't give you
chapter and verse,

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.960
but something about the
huge amounts of metal

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.584
moving at high speeds against
other huge amount of metal,

00:44:54.584 --> 00:44:56.250
it's not just going
through the tunnels.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.960
It's something
electro-magnetic going on.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.810
So it will always be
difficult, I think.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.030
And probably airlines
will be easier.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:09.120
But that's the basic figures
for the travel, I think.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.120
The time savings at
least for the first phase

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:18.040
are not so amazing as
we're sometimes told.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.328
AUDIENCE: Which is your
favorite station in the UK?

00:45:20.328 --> 00:45:21.119
SIMON BRADLEY: Ooh.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.744
AUDIENCE: And why?

00:45:25.744 --> 00:45:26.910
SIMON BRADLEY: That's tough.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:30.280
I might go all sort of
wistful and say Ravenglass,

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:37.160
which is on the Cumbrian coast,
where we tend to have holidays.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.220
But there's a change to a
narrow gauge railway, and almost

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.230
a miniature railway it's
called, because it's so small.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.714
It's a sort of one-third
model of the national system.

00:45:46.714 --> 00:45:48.380
It's worked mostly
by steam locomotives.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.520
It goes right up into
the hills in the Fells.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.806
And it's a proper piece
of public transport,

00:45:53.806 --> 00:45:55.430
because there aren't
buses or anything.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.056
So you get off the
train at Ravenglass,

00:45:57.056 --> 00:45:59.096
and then there's this tiny
train waiting for you,

00:45:59.096 --> 00:46:01.110
and it takes you five
miles up into the hills.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.473
So yeah, I'd say Ravenglass.

00:46:02.473 --> 00:46:03.389
AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:46:06.347 --> 00:46:10.291
AUDIENCE: How inefficient
were steam trains compared

00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:12.900
to the [INAUDIBLE] modern ones?

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.274
[INAUDIBLE] 10 pounds
for a five mile trip

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:19.263
on the [INAUDIBLE]
railway, and you

00:46:19.263 --> 00:46:21.096
get to [INAUDIBLE] and
you pay seven pounds,

00:46:21.096 --> 00:46:24.670
[INAUDIBLE] throughout
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.652
How much of that is steam's
really, really expensive,

00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:31.102
and how much of that is just
because [INAUDIBLE] huge costs?

00:46:31.102 --> 00:46:32.810
SIMON BRADLEY: How
inefficient was steam?

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.500
It was massively, crippling,
staggeringly inefficient

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.432
is the answer.

00:46:36.432 --> 00:46:38.140
When it's the only
way of doing anything,

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.090
yes, it's more efficient than
a horse, and a horse and cart.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.320
But a great deal of the
coal burnt by the locomotive

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.840
just flies out of the chimney.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.530
It doesn't burn
it as efficiently

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:49.930
as a power station does.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:52.400
So that's one reason
why electrification

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.350
is more efficient
than steam, and why

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.225
they tried to electrify
as soon as they could

00:46:56.225 --> 00:46:58.030
when they could afford it.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.010
Other than that, they
spent a huge amount of time

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.440
just coming to the boil,
or having to be emptied

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.570
and cleaned out afterwards.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.340
Because you can't just keep
them burning the whole time.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:13.490
You have to make up the
fire, and then take fire out.

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:16.692
The water clogs the
boiler up with scale.

00:47:16.692 --> 00:47:18.650
They've got huge numbers
of moving parts, which

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:21.320
require constant attention.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.610
Where do you stop, really?

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:24.220
So and they were cheap to build.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.178
That's the other thing.

00:47:25.178 --> 00:47:27.650
They were much cheaper to build
than diesels or electrics.

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.817
So one of the wrong
turnings in railway history

00:47:29.817 --> 00:47:31.900
after the Second World War
was to say, well, look.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.700
Here we are.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.932
We've got all this coal.

00:47:34.932 --> 00:47:36.390
Oil is something
we have to import,

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.592
because there was no
North Sea oil then.

00:47:38.592 --> 00:47:41.020
And electrification will do
it when we can afford it.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.860
But in the meantime, we've got
lots more steam locomotives.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.030
This is extraordinary.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.110
The last steam locomotive
for the national system

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:51.452
for British Railways
was built in 1960.

00:47:51.452 --> 00:47:53.160
And even then, they
thought it might have

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.670
a working life of 20 years.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:59.160
And in 1955, they were
talking about steam maybe

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.939
lasting into the mid-1980s.

00:48:01.939 --> 00:48:04.480
And that sounds weird until you
look at some other countries.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.010
Because West Germany, as it
used to be before reunification,

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.330
which had a much more phased
program of modernization

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:14.690
and didn't have the mass
closures that we had,

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.330
the last steamhaul
passenger trains

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:18.130
in West Germany,
modern West Germany,

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:22.020
where all the modern stuff
comes from, ran in 1977.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:26.021
So railway history is full
of surprises like that.

00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:27.354
MALE SPEAKER: I've got one here.

00:48:27.354 --> 00:48:29.764
AUDIENCE: So you said in
European [INAUDIBLE] railways

00:48:29.764 --> 00:48:32.174
being continuously
rocked by innovation.

00:48:32.174 --> 00:48:35.786
As a naive observer, it
looks like nothing much has

00:48:35.786 --> 00:48:36.994
changed in the last 30 years.

00:48:36.994 --> 00:48:38.035
Is that impression right?

00:48:38.035 --> 00:48:40.152
Or has a lot of stuff changed?

00:48:40.152 --> 00:48:42.360
SIMON BRADLEY: Has innovation
stopped on the railway?

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.438
Yeah, I don't think it has.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.970
At the headline end, the British
Rail did have a research centre

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.665
at Darby.

00:48:53.665 --> 00:48:55.290
It still goes on
doing bits and pieces,

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.456
but that was one of the
casualties of privatisation,

00:48:57.456 --> 00:48:58.460
really.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.330
And the railways had,
from innovation happening

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.270
in haphazard ways, like
Edmondson inventing

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:07.150
his tickets, the railways
to tried to harness it.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.151
So there was a staff
college, and then

00:49:09.151 --> 00:49:10.150
laboratories and things.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.358
All that happens in the '30s.

00:49:11.358 --> 00:49:14.050
So it has about a
50 year lifespan

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:18.440
of being at the core of what
the railways are trying to do.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.560
But I think it's gone
massively international,

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.600
and that's part of it.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.950
In this country, it's
suffered from privatisation,

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:29.440
because all the
uncertainties associated

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.900
with it, rather than necessarily
the private model in itself.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:38.672
But track continues
to evolve and change.

00:49:38.672 --> 00:49:40.880
The ways in which things
are done are more efficient.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.330
And I think what isn't seen
quite so much is safety.

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.970
The critics within
the system say

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.330
the railways are now
too obsessed with safety

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:50.820
down to tiny little
imagined hazards,

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.680
little fences going up
at the ends of platforms.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.530
For what?

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:56.120
To stop stray dogs or something?

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:56.790
Or to stop you walking off?

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.664
If you want to jump onto
a train, believe me.

00:49:58.664 --> 00:49:59.880
You're going to do it.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.330
But there's a lot of
spotting the possible hazard

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:05.430
thing going on.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.460
It's quite expensive
to make those changes,

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.590
but the general
impetus is a good one.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:16.910
I think it's eight years now
since a passenger or a worker

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.149
was killed on the railways.

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.940
Eight used to be about
the number of people

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.314
killed on the
railways every day.

00:50:22.314 --> 00:50:26.690
That was when there were so
many men working on the tracks

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.670
coupling things up like
the people you see there.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:32.420
Huge wagons are being
shunted up and down.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.350
You've got to go between
them to couple them together.

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:38.320
The driver isn't paying
attention, or somebody's tired,

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.080
or somebody slips.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.120
At the very least,
you might lose a limb.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.980
So the railways used to
kill people all the time,

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.200
and now they don't.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.230
So I think part of it
is about risk as well.

00:50:53.874 --> 00:50:54.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.740
SIMON BRADLEY: No.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.490
I would have loved to
have seen it happen.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:11.040
Sleeper trains are a
special private enthusiasm.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.820
Do go on them if
you get a chance.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.110
They're still there.

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:17.964
But what you can't do is
sleep under the tunnel.

00:51:17.964 --> 00:51:20.380
You used to be able to do it
on something called the night

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.756
ferry, incidentally, that
left Victoria and was

00:51:22.756 --> 00:51:25.130
pushed onto a train ferry and
taken off at the other end.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.546
You would sleep
your way to Paris,

00:51:26.546 --> 00:51:29.080
but that stopped in 1980.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:34.690
But no, the answer is actually
it's a fall in air prices.

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:38.050
Air travel prices,
cheap flights,

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.360
the deregulation
of air travel, that

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.850
was what really wrecked
the business model.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.680
But it was too late to stop
them from building lots and lots

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.365
of very high spec
sleeper carriages,

00:51:49.365 --> 00:51:50.740
which were meant
to do just that.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.615
You would have been able
to get on the train.

00:51:52.615 --> 00:51:53.890
And it was very political.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:56.479
You had to have direct services
from Wales and Scotland

00:51:56.479 --> 00:51:57.270
as well as England.

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:00.170
You would be able to get
on the train in Glasgow,

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.592
and then you would dine as
you passed through England.

00:52:03.592 --> 00:52:05.050
And then you'd go
under the tunnel,

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.770
and you'd wake up in
Berlin or something.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:09.880
And they built these things.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.650
But then the project was
cancelled before they'd even

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.900
turned a wheel in
actual service.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.680
And these great white
elephant-- you can understand

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.826
there was a lot of
desire to hush this up,

00:52:20.826 --> 00:52:22.450
because it was all
rather embarrassing.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.870
And I excavated a bit of the
story in this John Prescott

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:30.050
rant to the House of Commons
in 1999 or something,

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.565
saying that I've
suddenly been asked

00:52:32.565 --> 00:52:36.261
to come up with 200 million
for these carriages.

00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:37.260
There's no use for them.

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.260
They don't work, and
they're sitting in a field,

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.290
or something like that.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.770
But they did manage to sell
some of them to, I think,

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:44.270
the Canadian railways.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:50.350
And now you can sleep your
way through the Rockies

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:54.410
or wherever the great Canadian
cross-continental journeys go.

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:57.230
But yeah, it was thought to
be the future with the Channel

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.807
Tunnel and the continuing
sleeper service.

00:53:00.807 --> 00:53:02.890
And the answer is that,
yes, it's air competition.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:05.290
Again, it's almost like
a miniature retread

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:06.910
of what British
railways got wrong

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:10.830
in the '50s of not plotting
the graph as to bigger lorries,

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:12.090
better lorries, motorways.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.450
They didn't see
motorways coming.

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.529
So yeah.

00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:18.577
MALE SPEAKER: Time for
one more quick question.

00:53:18.577 --> 00:53:19.910
There's a gentleman [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:24.257 --> 00:53:25.668
Right here.

00:53:25.668 --> 00:53:27.167
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
just wondering how

00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:29.846
you feel the British
rail service compares

00:53:29.846 --> 00:53:32.768
against the international
competitors.

00:53:32.768 --> 00:53:37.638
Do you think the British people
are too harsh on rail service?

00:53:37.638 --> 00:53:39.586
[INAUDIBLE] international
service to the EU

00:53:39.586 --> 00:53:42.434
would be admired
significantly more

00:53:42.434 --> 00:53:43.600
than what we have in the UK?

00:53:46.908 --> 00:53:49.720
SIMON BRADLEY: Yes,
foreign comparisons.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.484
I'm not the best
person to answer that,

00:53:51.484 --> 00:53:53.650
partly because while I've
been working on this book,

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:55.910
I've been traveling
on the British railway

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:59.620
system for research
purposes in my spare time

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.730
rather than traveling
abroad so much.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.790
But I think one
thing that is missed

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:07.480
is the density
density of traffic.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:13.690
It's the number of fast
and efficient trains

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:15.352
that are running all the time.

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:17.560
It's the sheer numbers on
the move, the numbers going

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.851
in and out of Berlin, numbers
going in and out of Paris

00:54:19.851 --> 00:54:23.710
by train, the numbers shuttling
back and forth between cities

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:24.210
abroad.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:26.360
It just doesn't compare.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.712
And it's always been like that.

00:54:28.712 --> 00:54:32.490
The British steamhauled
railways had the highest number

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.640
of the fastest
trains in the world.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.950
The special high speed
lines, that's shifting it.

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.300
But what we've only
got one of those,

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.640
and it only goes from London
to the Channel Tunnel.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.150
So it's what's been achieved
on what's essentially a 19th

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:53.260
century route map, and
very often 19th century

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.790
infrastructure--- bridges,
viaducts, and things--

00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:58.120
within the limits.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.570
Because when they built the
Liverpool and Manchester

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.400
in 1830, the idea
that trains would ever

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.560
be electrified and travel
at 100 miles an hour,

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.930
and weigh 8 to 10 times as much,
and the whole thing not fall

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.530
apart, that would
have been mysterious.

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:17.374
If they'd had better ability
to calculate their risk factors

00:55:17.374 --> 00:55:18.790
and loadings and
things, then they

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.980
wouldn't have built them
as sturdily as they did.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.390
But they tended to err
on the side of caution.

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:27.130
So a Victorian railway viaduct,
Brunel's extraordinarily

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:31.780
elegant spare and an
amazingly flat bridge

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:35.120
across the Thames at Maidenhead
has carried the high speed

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.430
trains for years and years.

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.846
And now it's going to carry
the electric trains going even

00:55:38.846 --> 00:55:41.400
faster, and it's still there.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.950
Who'd have guessed it?

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:48.000
So I wouldn't say it's
doing the best of a bad job,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.850
but really pushing the what
we've got to its limits.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:58.900
Actually that should be a cause
for modest national pride,

00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.617
perhaps.

00:55:59.617 --> 00:56:01.450
MALE SPEAKER: Please
join me, and thank you.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.000
Thank you so much.
