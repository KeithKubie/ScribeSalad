00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.820
One of the questions that I set out to answer
in the book is, why do we like what we like

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.820
in music?

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.080
What makes music catchy?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.920
Where do “earworms” come from?

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.570
And to answer this really complex question
I started with the simplest possible question,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.420
which is: what is music?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.760
Why does the brain process some sounds as
cacophony and other sounds very clearly as

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760
song?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.490
And to start to answer this question you have
to go to Diana Deutsch.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.990
And she is a musicologist at the University
of California San Diego.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.870
And Diana was listening to herself talk at
her house one evening, and she put a sentence

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.559
of hers on repeat and she realized if you
take a bit of speech stream and you take a

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.079
sliver of it and you start repeating it again,
start repeating it again, start repeating

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.920
it again, start repeating it again, start
repeat –obviously you can sort of hear it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.469
if you’re listening that the brain suddenly
starts to hear a melody in this repetition,

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.070
and a rhythm and a beat, and it starts to
hear that which was formally just speech as

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.170
song.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.500
And so what she would say, what I would say,
is that repetition is the God-particle of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.870
music, it is the thing that distinguishes
the cacophony of the world from that which

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.250
we cannot help but recognize as music.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.030
So that’s interesting, but it’s not an
answer to the fundamental question, which

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.190
is: what makes music catchy?

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.870
Because if I go into a music studio and I
say, “start repeating it again, start repeating

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.980
it again” I’ll be laughed out of the studio
immediately.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.960
So there has to be a repetition and variety.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.150
What is the scientific way to think about
the balance?

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.840
And to answer that question you have to fly
northeast from San Diego to Ohio State University

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.990
in Columbus Ohio, where David Huron did this
famous study involving mice where he played

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
a note for a mouse, let’s call it a B note.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.570
And the mouse would turn its head like this.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.080
And he would play B again, and the mouse would
turn its head.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.170
And he would play B-B-B and the mouse’s
head is just doing this thing.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.040
And eventually the mouse habituates, it learns
to ignore the stimulus.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.260
And habituation is common in culture and life.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.450
We learn to ignore things that are too familiar.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.280
But if instead at the very moment the mouse
is about to habituate from the B note he instead

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.590
plays a C note, the mouse attends to the C
note and is dishabituated from the B note.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.010
So now he can go back to scaring the mouse
with the B note.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.340
And it turns out that if you want to scare
a mouse for the longest period of time with

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.879
the fewest number of notes there’s a very
specific pattern that you play, and it goes:

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.659
B-B-C-B-C-D note to habituate from both from
the B and the C note.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.670
And as I was reading this study and talking
to David I thought, well if you take the letter

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.019
“B” and you replace it with the word “verse”
and you take the letter “C” and you replace

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.780
it with the word “chorus “and you take
the letter “D” and you replace it with

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.849
the word “bridge,” you have the following
song structure: verse-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge,

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.389
which is essentially the most common pop song
structure of the 20th century.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:08.950
So what seemed so fundamentally interesting
to me about this idea is that this same formulaic

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.340
relationship between repetition and variety
that can scare a mouse in a laboratory setting

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.150
also makes us attend to Top 40 radio in cars.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.150
But throughout the book I’m constantly thinking
about what are the most important implications

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.580
of each of these ideas, not only for entertainment,
which is interesting but maybe not important,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.450
but also for something like politics?

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.340
And it’s interesting when thinking about
repetition and speech and persuasiveness,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.529
and realizing that every great rhetorical
device is essentially a form of repetition.

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:47.520
There is anaphora, which is repetition at
the beginning of a sentence.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.390
Winston Churchill, “We shall fight them
in the landing fields, we shall fight them

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.499
on the air.”

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:57.079
You have tricolon, which is repetition in
triplicate.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.030
Abraham Lincoln, “Government of the people,
by the people, for the people.”

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.389
There is a lilt to repetition in human speech.

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.329
But most impressively and maybe most utilized
is this thing called antimetabole.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:17.500
And that’s impossible to remember or spell
or pronounce so think of antimetabole as A-B-B-A,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.860
“Ask not what your country can do for you,
ask what you can do for your country.”

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.860
A-B-B-A.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.370
“It’s not the size of the dog in the fight,
it’s the size of the fight in the dog.”

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.430
Or Hillary Clinton, “Human rights are women’s
rights and women’s rights are human rights,”

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.169
A-B-B-A, antimetabole.

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.259
And what I think is so interesting about antimetabole
is that it is the most used rhetorical device

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:50.290
I think, because it is just musical enough
to disguise the fact that it is essentially

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.760
song, that it is essentially turning human
speech into that which the brain wants to

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.430
process as fluent music.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.490
And so sometimes we hear both great ideas
and terrible ideas as antimetabole and the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.520
brain wants them to be true, and so we like
them before we even know to think about them.
