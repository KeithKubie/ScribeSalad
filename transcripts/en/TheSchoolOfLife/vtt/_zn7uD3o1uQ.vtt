00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.400
It can be strangely appealing to be very down about the future of humanity.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.980
When we think of the future, apocalyptic scenarios come so naturally:

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.360
flooded cities, energy crises, civil wars...

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.520
We’re afraid of being naive.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.600
After all, we were once promised jetpacks and won’t be so easily taken in again.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.280
We like to tell ourselves we’re too intelligent to be excited by the future.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.580
But there’s another possible explanation.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.120
We’re oddly a bit resentful: it can be painful to imagine all the things we’re going to miss out on.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.720
Imagine going back in time to 14th-century Europe

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.580
and confronting people with the solutions which – a few centuries later – became readily available.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.000
One might meet a woman whose six-year-old daughter has just died of scarlet fever.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.800
She’d be hysterical with grief.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.320
One would then explain that in 744 years time,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.900
there would be (on the very spot where she was standing) a chemist where – for £2.50 –

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.520
she could have got the antibiotics that would have saved her beloved child.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.740
Or imagine describing Heathrow Airport and the Boeing Dreamliner to a man who had starved,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.280
suffered seasickness and been taken prisoner on a three-year-round pilgrimage from Berkshire to Jerusalem.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.720
Or telling a guy with toothache about the anesthetics which he wouldn’t be able to get for another 623 years.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.880
Or confronting Jamshīd al-Kāshī

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.100
– a 15th-century mathematician who spent years of his life doing vastly complicated calculations

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.860
to work out the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle –

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.800
with the fact that his sums would one day be do-able with a small plastic box

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.660
picked up next to the express checkout at the supermarket.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.840
We could imagine such people coming to deeply resent news about the future.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.720
Instead of seeming inevitable, our miseries can come to appear like cruel, temporary accidents.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.960
We realise that in the broad span of history, people don’t have to suffer many of the things we’re going through

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.440
– we just happen to be condemned to them because we’ve been born at the wrong time.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.820
A visitor from the future will no doubt pity us as much as we pity our medieval ancestors.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.160
They’ll feel so sorry that we had to have an unhappy marriage

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.960
– 27 seven years of anguish, shame and frustration for both parties –

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.540
which would so easily have been solved in a few minutes

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.740
by having a minor adjustment made to the Ventral tegmental area of the midbrain of one of the parties.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.060
They’ll feel appalled that we had to die of pancreatic cancer.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.260
Or work so hard in a more or less meaningless job

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.800
when, at last, robots are truly doing everything

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.060
and there’s a guaranteed income for everyone on the planet equivalent to what a Swiss dentist earns today.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.000
We’re often negative about the future to defend ourselves against recognition of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.720
how absurd much of our suffering will seem from the position of 300 years from now.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.180
We are faced with the cruel thought that solutions to some truly horrible problems of today might be just over the horizon.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.360
But unfortunately, still too late for us.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.620
The 19th-century French painter Gericault

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.820
focused on the agonies of just this kind of missing out in his monumental depiction The Raft of the Medusa.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.640
The sailors of the shipwrecked vessel Medusa had drifted for two weeks.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.760
In the painting, Gericault shows us the moment when the survivors who are still clinging to the raft

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.220
finally catch sight of the ship that will rescue them

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.960
– the tiny sail can just be seen on the horizon.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.760
But for many the rescue was too late: they died just before the ship could reach them.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.840
A few days, or even hours, sooner and they would have been spared the most horrible agonies.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.720
We too are like the survivors on the raft.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.060
The rescue ship will come – but often too late.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.480
We should feel a reasonable and appropriate pity for ourselves.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.660
We deserve compassion because – even if they are comparatively comfortable –

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.280
our lives are still actually very hard when considered in the light of the future.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.120
We can identify a new kind of comparative poverty that we are suffering from:

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.600
when a person is poor not in relation to what others around them have now,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.320
but poor in relation to what people will have

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.000
at some point in a dimly imaginable more advanced and more intelligent future.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400
 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.500
