[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.832 --> 00:00:08.540
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.570
So we'll get started.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.210
Annie Duke has devoted her
life to the study of decision

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.409
making under pressure.

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.450
During her career as a
professional poker player,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.714
she won over $4
million in tournaments,

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:21.380
earned a World Series
of Poker bracelet,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.350
and is the only woman to have
won the World Series of Poker

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.620
Tournament of Champions
and the NBC National Heads

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.150
Up Poker Championship.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.010
Retired from poker
since 2012, she

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.440
is now a corporate
speaker and a consultant

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.060
on decision strategy.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.030
Merging her poker expertise
and her graduate-level research

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.740
in psychology at the
University of Pennsylvania,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.860
she has authored five books, is
a co-founder of howIdecide.org,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.100
serves on the board of
After-School All-Stars,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340
and is a trustee of
The Franklin Institute.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.560
She's also won a
televised championship

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.230
in rock paper scissors.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.900
Was that a high-stakes game
of rock paper scissors?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.822
ANNIE DUKE: I think
I won, like, $10,000.

00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:00.530
SPEAKER 1: I would
say high stakes, yeah.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.100
[LAUGH]

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.640
A mom of four, and she
lives outside Philadelphia.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.330
So let's welcome her to Google.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.490
So Annie, you want to
start with what inspired

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.960
you to write this book?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.860
ANNIE DUKE: Oh.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.590
Oh, that's a very
broad question.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.250
So I used to joke--

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.840
the joke that I used
to make was for most

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.360
of my professional
career, I spent my life

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.280
taking advantage
of people who made

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.600
decisions that weren't so good.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
So maybe I should spend some
of my life trying to help

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.650
people make better decisions.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.620
So that's kind of
the cheeky answer.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.280
But I think that what
actually really inspired

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.320
me to write the book
was that I started off

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.820
my life in academics.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.280
I was at the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.300
I was studying
cognitive science.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.240
Which is really, of
course, a study of the way

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.640
that our brains interact
with the environment.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.990
How do we process
information as it comes in?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.411
I was getting my PhD in
that, had a National Science

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.160
Foundation Fellowship,
and I was on my way

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.370
to become a professor.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.360
And right at the end of that
journey, I actually got sick.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.360
I ended up with a stomach
problem that landed me

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.009
in the hospital for
a couple of weeks,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.490
and I ended up missing the
job market for that year,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.900
because it's seasonal.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.742
So I had to take time
off just to recuperate,

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:20.200
and I was going to go back out
on the market the next year,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.060
and I ended up in
that year, that's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.110
when I took what felt like this
very big left turn into poker.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.430
So I started playing poker,
and about eight years into it,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.350
I got asked by actually a
retreat of options traders

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.720
if I could come speak
to them about the way

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.570
that poker might inform
their decision making

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.640
and how they handle risk.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.730
And it was this moment where I
realized, you know, oh, gosh.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.490
I thought I took this
really huge left turn out

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.170
of academics, but I didn't.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.040
I landed in just a really
amazing natural laboratory

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.730
to study, how do we make
decisions under conditions

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.120
of uncertainty when the
outcomes of those decisions

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.300
are not very well
connected to the quality

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.020
of the decision making itself?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.644
It's just a very
noisy environment.

00:03:08.644 --> 00:03:10.060
And how are you
pulling the signal

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.560
out, and how are you learning
under those circumstances?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.950
And the answer is,
not so well, really.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.884
And it was this moment of
kind of revelation for me

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:24.550
as I was thinking,
like, what am I going

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.560
to say to this group of people?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.750
Because it was this kind
of moment where it all

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.484
came together for
me where I said,

00:03:30.484 --> 00:03:31.900
you know, it's
really interesting,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.510
because I was taught
in graduate school

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.880
that learning occurs under
conditions where you have

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.360
lots and lots of feedback tied
closely in time to decisions

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.710
and actions.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.320
And as I'm going to go talk to
these people, what I realize

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.950
is poker is the ultimate
lots and lots of feedback

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.080
tied closely in time.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.080
I mean, within 30 seconds of
time to decisions and actions.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.000
And yet what I saw was
that learning was not

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.970
occurring very well.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.360
And so it was that moment of
wanting to square those two

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.650
things together.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.350
And after that first
talk, I just went--

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.040
I was like, oh.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.210
And I started building
this second career

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.840
and speaking to audiences
about how poker's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.280
kind of a really great
platform and framework for kind

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.610
of understanding not only what
are the problems in decision

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.149
making, but how can we
kind of solve for them?

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.310
And I sort of feel
like from 2002

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.680
I was just workshopping
this material,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.280
and that I was finding this
incredible joy in sharing

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.180
these ideas with people
in a way that felt really

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.560
different to me than poker.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.590
In poker, I'm thinking about
these ideas in a way that's

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.790
very zero sum, right?

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.530
I'm going to win,
you're going to lose.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.780
You're going to win,
I'm going to lose.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.086
And you know, when I
started doing this in 2002,

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:44.710
I started growing
that business, and it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.330
started to become a much
bigger part of my life,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.538
actually, than the poker was.

00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:50.260
And it just felt in
this really nice way

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.860
like I was adding water
sort of back into the ocean.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.380
And you know, this book sort of
came out of that whole journey

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.970
that I took.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.550
SPEAKER 1: So can we talk
about what prevents people

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.144
from making good decisions?

00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:07.060
ANNIE DUKE: Oh, that's--
because that's that--

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.520
do we want to narrow
that down at all?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.650
What prevents people from
making good decisions?

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.440
I think it's a collision
of a couple of problems.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.390
I think that the first
piece is uncertainty,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.260
and uncertainty comes
from two places.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.920
It comes from
hidden information.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.250
So this is where we
can see how poker

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.360
might be a really good way
to look at decision making.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.720
The first place it comes
from is hidden information.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.440
So in poker, the
cards are face down.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.080
Guess what?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.610
In life as well.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.180
There's very often a lot of
information asymmetry, right?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.100
And there's lots of
stuff that we can't know,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.230
and there's lots of
things that we don't know.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.410
So that's the first place
that uncertainty comes from.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.420
But even if we did have perfect
information-- say, for example,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.170
about a coin, and we
know that heads or tails,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.490
it's going to flip
50% of the time,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.640
we also have the intervention
of luck, which is

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.960
the other form of uncertainty.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.130
So even if I know everything
I need to know about the coin

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.736
so there's no hidden information
about the coin, that doesn't

00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:07.360
mean I can predict
whether it will flip

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.280
heads or tails on next try.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.260
I can say something
over 10,000 tries.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.840
I can tell you how it's
going to work out over time.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.730
But most of what we're
doing is actually

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.270
sort of these
one-trial scenarios.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.000
And particularly as we're trying
to make decisions and learn

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.650
from the outcomes
of our decisions,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.983
we're not very good aggregators.

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:26.690
So we're not sitting back--

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.900
well, first of all, most
of the decisions we make,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.940
we couldn't get
10,000 trials even so.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.200
But even if we could, the data's
kind of coming in one at a time

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.330
as we're out sort
of in the field,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.500
making our own decisions.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.396
And so we're sort of encoding
everything one at a time.

00:06:41.396 --> 00:06:43.270
We're not sitting back
and saying, let me not

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.386
make any decisions until I
have lots and lots of data.

00:06:46.386 --> 00:06:48.010
And in fact, that
would be impractical,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.820
because for example,
you would never,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.950
say, get married to
somebody then, right?

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.750
Because you'd have
to get so many trials

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.330
in order to know
that you were sure.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.149
So it's not practical
to do anyway.

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:01.690
So the first piece,
the first problem

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.520
is that there's all
this uncertainty.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.320
And then the second
problem is that nature,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.690
the way that our
brains are built

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.140
has given us a lot of rope
to sort of hang ourselves

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.120
with the uncertainty.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.830
And we can sort
of go back to sort

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.720
of the beginning,
which is, what are

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.960
the types of errors that
evolution built us to make?

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.320
So there are a type 1
errors and type 2 errors.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.700
Type 1 errors are false
positives and type 2 errors

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.080
are false negatives.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.960
And we're really, really
built for false positives.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.690
We connect things together,
we think they're causal,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.480
we think they go together much
more often than they actually

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.590
do.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.420
So we're big at patterns.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.890
We love things to be
connected together,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.230
and that causes a problem.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.780
So that's sort of
problem number one.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.360
And we can think about
that in the sense of,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.710
which is worse, if you're on the
savanna and you hear rustling,

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.040
you know, among
the reeds, are you

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.950
going to wait and see, oh, let
me try to figure out if there's

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.000
actually a lion here?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.260
Or are you going to run away?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.760
Right?

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.590
So obviously, we're
going to run away.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.500
So that's number one.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.040
Number two is we're
built for tribes.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.990
So there was a lot
of advantage for us

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.900
surviving if we came together
in groups and we had tribes.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.490
And so that causes
a problem as well

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.130
for decision making, because
it causes these problems

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.710
in the way that we process
information from things

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.840
that are outside of our tribe.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.020
So that's kind of the
number two problem.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.570
And then the number
three problem is really,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.820
I talk about this
a lot in the book

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.210
is that we aren't really
built to disconfirm the things

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.480
that we already believe.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.765
We're very much built
to affirm our priors.

00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:40.390
And so when you think about the
uncertainty and the way that we

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.580
sort of interpret
information as it comes in,

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.940
there's so much
uncertainty in the data

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.260
that we're getting that it gives
us the room to just process

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.151
the world in a way to make us
feel right about the things

00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:55.150
that we already believe.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.410
And when you have that
collision between that,

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.830
the false positive problem
and then the tribal problem

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.749
on top of that, things
really fall apart.

00:09:02.749 --> 00:09:05.290
SPEAKER 1: Now your book-- you
were talking about this belief

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.706
people have about showing the
right information to people,

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:10.150
and somehow it will get them
to see things correctly.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.782
Can you talk more
about that too?

00:09:11.782 --> 00:09:12.490
ANNIE DUKE: Sure.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.281
So I think that this
is part of the problem

00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:18.800
is that we have these ways
that we process information.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.084
So an example that I
talk about in my book

00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:23.750
is something called
motivated reasoning.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.070
So I think you've all probably
heard about confirmation bias.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.550
So motivated reasoning
is a larger problem

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.610
than confirmation bias.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.350
So in confirmation bias, we
have some sort of prior belief,

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.916
and we'll notice stuff
that confirms the belief,

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:40.540
and we just kind of
won't notice things

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.010
that disconfirm the belief.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.600
Motivated reasoning
is, let's think

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.060
about this as an umbrella
problem of which confirmation

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.066
bias is part, which is that
we actually are motivated

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:52.690
to confirm the beliefs we have,
and that drives our information

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.690
processing.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.570
So that means that
not only will we

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.610
sort of notice stuff
that confirms us and not

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.590
notice things that
disconfirm us,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.530
but also when confronted
with information

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.280
that disconfirms
us, we work very,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.190
very hard to discredit it.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.440
And when confronted with
information that confirms us,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.023
we actually don't put any effort
into the discrediting at all.

00:10:14.023 --> 00:10:17.359
So we don't really
vet it very hard.

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:19.150
And you guys can probably
feel that, right?

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.550
When I read an article that,
say, politically agrees

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.560
with me, I'm like, wow.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.970
That's a really smart article.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.340
And when it disagrees with
me politically, I am like,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.180
you know, they're looking at the
study and the N is too small,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.780
and they weren't
looking at this data,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.488
and they were asking
the wrong questions,

00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:38.200
and the person isn't
reliable anyway,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.920
and they forgot all
this other stuff,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.544
and they're totally biased.

00:10:41.544 --> 00:10:43.210
And you know, it's
weird, because I just

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.710
don't go through that
process with the things that

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.293
agree with me.

00:10:45.293 --> 00:10:47.110
Strange.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.100
OK.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.120
So not only that.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.010
Then we have this
other issue, which

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.850
is that when we're in a tribe,
part of what a tribe gives

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.510
you is kind of forth-- it gives
you a sense of belongingness,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.980
a sense of
distinctiveness, right?

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.210
So you belong to a tribe.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.700
You're distinct from other
tribes in some way where you

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.620
process that as being superior.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.985
It gives you the idea
of sort of what's moral

00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:11.860
and what's not is also
included in the tribe.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.068
But then it also gives you
something really important

00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:16.780
for this talk today, which
is called epistemic closure,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.300
meaning that the
tribe is telling you

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.350
what knowledge is true and
trustworthy and what is not.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.830
So I think that a lot of
times what we sort of think--

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.560
and this is where we understand
this, the motivated reasoning

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.650
with the collision of
the tribal problem.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.130
What we sort of think is, oh.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.492
If other people just
had the information,

00:11:35.492 --> 00:11:37.450
we'd all be fine, because
then we'd all sort of

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.000
believe the same things.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.500
Right?

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.100
So if we were all working with
the exact same information,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.320
we'd all be good.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.020
But that's assuming that
we live in something--

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.880
that we're all living
in epistemic bubbles

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.020
versus echo chambers.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.380
So let me just explain
what the difference is.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.130
An epistemic bubble is
you have information

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.370
and you don't have other
information, period.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.110
So if you're in
an epidemic bubble

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.317
where you just haven't
gotten the information,

00:12:05.317 --> 00:12:07.900
then if you get exposed to the
information, you incorporate it

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.950
and you're all good.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.050
But epistemic bubbles
are pretty rare.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.920
What we mostly live
in is echo chambers.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.254
So echo chambers are, it
doesn't matter whether we

00:12:15.254 --> 00:12:16.420
have the information or not.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.954
People outside the group
are not trusted sources.

00:12:18.954 --> 00:12:20.620
So if you get information
that disagrees

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.560
with you that's coming from
someone outside the group,

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.760
it's not trusted anyway.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.440
And you can see how
you can use that

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.714
in order to accomplish the
goals in motivated reasoning.

00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:31.630
So when you're now
confronted with information

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.610
that disagrees with you, one
of the ways you discredit it

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.030
is to talk about the
trustworthiness of the source.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.170
So you know, what we want to
be really careful about is

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.400
we want to try to apply as
we're trying to imagine--

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.110
and I talk about
this in the book--

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.080
as we're trying to sort of
vet information that comes in,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.560
we want to apply a particular
norm called universalism, which

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.570
is separating the
person who's delivering

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.090
the news from whether the
news itself is correct or not.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.730
So the way I put
it in the book is

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.760
doesn't really
matter whether it's

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.430
Copernicus or Mussolini
or your mom who tells you

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.370
that the Earth is round.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.390
The fact of the
roundness of the Earth

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.160
is independent of those sources.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.350
So in order to actually
be good universalists,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.240
it's usually pretty
good as you're

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.850
sort of having these
reactions to information

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.580
to try to imagine it
absent of the source,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.130
or to try to imagine it
being delivered from a source

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.210
that you actually trust.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.310
And that actually helps
you to vet the information

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.643
independently of the source,
which we're really, really,

00:13:38.643 --> 00:13:42.220
really bad at, and it's part of
this problem of echo chambers.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.800
SPEAKER 1: So you were
talking about systems

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.660
of how we can overcome
that and looking

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.919
at decisions in terms of bets.

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.210
Could you talk more about that?

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.960
ANNIE DUKE: Sure.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.480
Yeah.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.900
So the book is called
"Thinking in Bets."

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.890
And the premise is that if we
were more explicit in imagining

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.460
or in actually just making clear
that every decision that we

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.270
make is a bet, that we would
actually be better off,

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.294
and it would create a
lot more open-mindedness.

00:14:10.294 --> 00:14:10.960
And why is that?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.510
Well, first of all, let me
try to convince you guys

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.640
that every decision is a bet.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.920
So that's the first step.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.700
So actually, I'll
tell a story that I

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.060
tell in here, which is kind
of a fun story, I think.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.610
So there was a guy named John
Hennigan, a really, really,

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.980
really great poker player
known to have a lot of gamble.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.880
And in the '90s, when he was
in his 20s, he was really--

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.030
if you were to think
about, what is a--

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:43.060
if you imagined a stereotype
of a poker player in 1995,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.440
John Hennigan would be the guy.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.660
Like, he never saw the sun.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.950
He was only playing at night.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.780
He was a total action junkie.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.300
Like, when he was finished
at the poker table,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.590
he just wanted to gamble more.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.060
Like, he was really--

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.060
he was very good, but he
really liked a lot of action.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.340
So he was sitting at
a poker table one day,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.561
and a discussion broke
out about state capitals,

00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:05.810
and people were quizzing
each other on state capitals.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.290
So Des Moines comes up.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.420
And John Hennigan actually
announces at the table

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.628
as they're discussing Des
Moines, oh, I could totally

00:15:12.628 --> 00:15:13.660
live in Des Moines.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.790
And you know, Des
Moines obviously,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.460
reputation is kind of sleepy.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.200
Maybe if you were to
think about sort of,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.820
what's the antithesis
of Las Vegas,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.530
maybe you would think of
Des Moines as an example.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.970
So the players at the table
were like, oh, come on.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.150
Like, there's no way you
could live from Des Moines.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.550
But Hennigan actually
at that time in his life

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.930
was sort of thinking, like, oh.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.550
You know, I never see
the sun, and so maybe it

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.180
would be really nice to go
and sort of detox from Vegas

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.194
a little bit.

00:15:41.194 --> 00:15:42.610
And then he also
had another thing

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.980
in mind, which is that poker
players gamble on golf a lot.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.210
And he thought, well,
then I could actually

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.910
really spend some time on
golf without the distraction

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.410
of the actual poker.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.450
So they negotiate a bet.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.130
So at the table,
they negotiate a bet

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.250
that John Hennigan's going to
move to Las Vegas for 30 days--

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.760
I mean, to Des Moines,
rather, for 30 days.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.610
They add a little bit of a
diabolical condition, which

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.554
is the hotel that he's
on is only one street,

00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:07.470
and there's only one
restaurant on the street.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.511
And there's, like, no
bars, there's no nightlife,

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:10.376
there's nothing.

00:16:10.376 --> 00:16:12.500
He's confined to the one
street when he moves there

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.860
for the 30 days, except
there is a specific golf

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.480
course he's allowed to go to to
practice golf during the day.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.460
So they settle on 30 days, and
the bet is set for $30,000.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.060
So if he can stay in Las Vegas
for 30 days, he wins $30,000.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.190
If he can't stay
there and he has

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.680
to come back from
Des Moines, then he's

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.820
going to lose $30,000.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.030
So literally the next day,
he moved to Des Moines.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.990
So two days later, he
calls up the group.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.120
And he says, hey.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.870
I'm in Des Moines.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.536
I'm obviously, like--
I've completely up

00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:46.550
and moved to Des Moines.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.382
Clearly, I'm good to go.

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:49.340
I'm going to stay here.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:54.189
So if you'd like to settle,
you guys can pay me $15,000

00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:55.730
and I'll come home,
and I'll save you

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.705
the misery of losing
the whole $30,000.

00:16:57.705 --> 00:16:59.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.224
Yeah, that was the
group's reaction.

00:17:02.224 --> 00:17:03.140
So they were like, no.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.569
We're good, John.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.250
You know, why don't
you stay there?

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.282
So a week later, John Hennigan
had moved back from Des Moines,

00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:13.490
he was living in Las Vegas,
and he had paid the group

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.079
$15,000 for the privilege.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.650
So I tell this story because
it sounds like, oh my gosh.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.720
These crazy poker
players making this bet

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.770
on where John was going to move.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.160
But if you think
about it, it's really

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.107
no different than any decision
that you've ever made.

00:17:28.107 --> 00:17:30.440
I mean, your decision to come
and work at Google, right?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.648
You have other opportunities.

00:17:31.648 --> 00:17:32.949
You're thinking about what--

00:17:32.949 --> 00:17:35.240
John has to think about, am
I going to like Des Moines?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.910
He doesn't know, because he
hasn't lived there before,

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:38.450
right?

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.356
The money that I'm going
to make if I win this bet,

00:17:41.356 --> 00:17:42.980
is it going to be
better than the money

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.880
that I'm going to make
if I stay in Las Vegas?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.463
And if I'm actually
taking less money,

00:17:46.463 --> 00:17:48.500
is that OK, because I'm
creating different types

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.790
of opportunities for myself?

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.248
Like, I'm going to
feel like I live

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:53.840
a healthier life for
that month, and that's

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.520
worth making less money.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.170
Or I'm going to work
on my golf game,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.545
and that's going
to have payoffs.

00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:00.260
Which would be sort
of the same as, I'm

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.420
thinking about taking
a job in Des Moines,

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.430
and I have to think
about, how is Des Moines

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.410
going to compare to the
place that I live now?

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.010
I don't know.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.970
I've never lived there.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.280
Am I going to like it
versus any other place

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.780
that I might possibly move?

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.820
Is the salary good
enough for me to feel

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.127
like I'm willing to
take that risk in terms

00:18:16.127 --> 00:18:17.210
of going and moving there?

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.010
What are the opportunities
for advancement?

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.020
What other kinds
of money, you know,

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.040
could I make in the future?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.850
And when you choose
to move to Des Moines

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.620
or relocate or take
the job at Google,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.080
you're obviously forgoing
all other possibilities

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.010
available to you.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.810
You can only make
the one decision,

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.610
which was true for
John Hennigan as well.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.650
So basically, Hennigan had a
certain set of beliefs about

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.990
whether or not he would like
Des Moines, whether or not

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.610
it would be worth it to him.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.170
And when he made
the choice, he was

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.080
foregoing all other choices,
including staying in Las Vegas

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.080
and staying with the status quo,
or moving any other place where

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.820
he might maybe detox or go, you
know, detox from the nightlife

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.820
or go and practice his golf,
or whatever it might be.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.060
And there was a whole set
of possible futures that

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.130
could occur from
that, one where he

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.410
stayed in Des Moines for
30 days and loved it,

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.370
one where he loved Des Moines
so much he never moved back,

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.540
one where he met the love
of his life in Des Moines.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.550
You know, one where he calls
up after two days and says,

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.250
hey, I want to settle.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.530
And the thing is
that you don't know.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.189
You're making an estimation of
what the probability of each

00:19:21.189 --> 00:19:22.730
of those futures
might be, and you're

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.560
deciding that whatever
you have to invest--

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.209
and it doesn't have to be money.

00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:28.250
It can be your health,
your happiness, your time,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.124
whatever it might be.

00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:30.680
Usually, it's all of the above.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.660
Whatever you're
investing in the decision

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.730
that you actually
go with, that that's

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.040
going to hurtle you to the
best set of possible futures

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.040
as compared to any other
decision that you might make.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.520
So the poker players really
just make that explicit.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.860
And that's really what you're
doing when you're betting

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.040
is you're making it
explicit that a decision is

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.440
a bet informed by your beliefs
on a set of possible futures

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.840
that you might be
hurtling yourself to.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.146
So once we kind of
understand that frame,

00:20:00.146 --> 00:20:01.520
I think that it
actually can help

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.290
us overcome some
of these problems

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.040
that we have with
decision making.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.070
And I'll show you a
really simple example.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.232
So here's something that's
been in the news a lot lately,

00:20:11.232 --> 00:20:13.190
because I hear it every
single day on the news.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.740
The Democrats are going to
take the House in the fall.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.270
So OK.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.622
So let's say that
you said to me,

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:23.830
the Democrats are going to
win the House in the fall.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.288
And let's say that
my response was,

00:20:25.288 --> 00:20:27.050
do you want to bet on that?

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.810
So think for yourselves,
what does that do to you?

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.800
It causes you to retreat
from a place of certainty

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.110
into a place of probabilistic
thinking, right?

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.870
Because now what you start
to think is, OK, well, wait.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.920
Why do I think that?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.169
Ooh, there's a lot of time
between now and November.

00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:44.210
There's a lot of things
that could happen, right?

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.879
Like, Trump could
solve North Korea.

00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:47.420
I don't know.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.870
That might change things, right?

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.265
We don't know.

00:20:51.265 --> 00:20:52.640
There's all sorts
of other things

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.848
that might happen with Trump.

00:20:53.848 --> 00:20:55.911
Trump is somewhat unpredictable.

00:20:55.911 --> 00:20:58.160
There are things that could
happen with the Democrats.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.050
You know, I mean,
the number of things

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.290
that can intervene on
the luck side between now

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.170
and six months from now
is pretty large, right?

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.270
And so you'll start
to think about that.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.730
It brings-- it bubbles that
uncertainty up to the fore.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.662
And then you also
start to think, well,

00:21:12.662 --> 00:21:14.870
have I been reading opinions
that disagree with that?

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.490
Like, what does the person
who's challenging me to the bet

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.480
know or think that
I haven't thought of

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.980
or that I don't know?

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.500
I have to start thinking
about, why might I be wrong

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.290
here before I'm willing to
actually put that kind of skin

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.880
into the game, right?

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.390
And so essentially,
what this element of,

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.540
let me think about my decisions
explicitly as bets does

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.690
is it forces you into more
probabilistic thinking,

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.700
into more the recognizing of
these two forms of uncertainty.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.700
That I don't ever have
perfect information for pretty

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.060
much anything, right?

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.130
We just don't.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.870
And that the future
is always uncertain.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.270
That no matter how well
I think about the future

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.860
or how much I
predict the future,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.820
even if the only bad outcome
can occur 1% of the time,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.500
it can still happen.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.720
So I need to think
about that as I'm

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.940
sort of announcing these
things with certainty.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.090
Once you start to bubble up
the uncertainty in any decision

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:12.440
that you make, it causes you
to be much more open-minded.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.660
Because now what happens is
that you're thinking about,

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.440
well, if I can
only think about--

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.040
if my beliefs are probabilistic
and my predictions

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.930
about the future
are probabilistic,

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.420
then I need to be
information hungry.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.390
Because what I need to do
is start refining my beliefs

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.204
and refining my predictions,
because I actually

00:22:31.204 --> 00:22:33.370
have to bet on these things
with things like my time

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.920
and things like my money
and things like my health,

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.510
and these limited
resources that I have.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:42.070
And if I can only make
one decision at a time

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.110
and I'm thinking about
this probabilistically,

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.970
I'd better start
really working to try

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.590
to refine all of this stuff.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.890
And how am I going to do that?

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.000
Well, it's going to cause me
to be open-minded in particular

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.760
to why I'm wrong.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.209
Open-minded to opinions and
beliefs that disagree with me,

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:58.750
because I already
know why I'm right.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.550
That's how I got to a place of
certainty in the first place.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.310
So once I start
backing off of that,

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.390
I've got to start
thinking about, again,

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.000
what does the other person
know that I don't know?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.870
And I think that that's why it's
such a good frame for trying

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.560
to solve for some
of these problems.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.101
SPEAKER 1: So you
make the bet and it

00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:15.250
doesn't work out for you.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.930
Like, what should
your next steps

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.749
be on how to analyze
what happened?

00:23:18.749 --> 00:23:21.040
ANNIE DUKE: So you make the
bet and it doesn't work out

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.970
for you, right?

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.650
And so what should
your next steps be?

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.530
So that's a very good question.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.910
So actually, one
of the big problems

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:35.930
is that once you have
a result, it really

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.850
distorts your ability to go
back in and analyze the decision

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.350
process.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.300
It's a problem called resulting.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.234
So another story from
the book that I'll

00:23:43.234 --> 00:23:44.900
give to sort of
illustrate this problem,

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.300
and then we can talk
about solutions for this,

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.150
so do you guys
remember the 2015 Super

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.200
Bowl, Seahawks versus Patriots?

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:54.920
Yeah.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.080
So you're in the right area
to remember that, right?

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.580
OK.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.010
So it's the last play
of the Super Bowl.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.980
The Seahawks are on the
1-yard line, 26 seconds left.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.440
It's second down.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.520
They have one time-out,
and they're down by 4.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.030
So this is obviously a
really important decision

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.355
that's going on here,
because if they score,

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:18.230
the Patriots are unlikely
to have enough time

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.480
to be able to march back down
the field and score again.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.540
So if they can get
a touchdown here,

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.735
this probably would
even be the game winner,

00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:27.110
which would be a
really big deal,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.797
because the Patriots never lose
the Super Bowl until this year.

00:24:29.797 --> 00:24:31.130
And I'm from Philly, but we'll--

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:34.400
I'm just saying, I was
pretty excited about that.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.290
So OK.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.480
So what is Pete Carroll do here?

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.972
He's got a running back on
his team named Marshawn Lynch.

00:24:41.972 --> 00:24:43.430
Amazing short
yardage running back.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.888
Everybody's expecting him to
hand it off to Marshawn Lynch.

00:24:45.888 --> 00:24:48.510
And instead, he calls pass play.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.490
Russell Wilson passes
the ball, and the ball

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.071
is intercepted pretty
famously, and boom.

00:24:54.071 --> 00:24:54.570
Done.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.028
Malcolm Butler
intercepts the ball.

00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:57.940
The game is over.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.050
The end game calling
from Cris Collinsworth

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.350
is pretty brutal
on this decision.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.760
You know, Pete Carroll, I
can't even believe this call.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.287
This is such a horrible call.

00:25:08.287 --> 00:25:10.620
And the next day, I have to
say that most of the pundits

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.270
did not disagree.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.510
There seemed to be an
argument among major outlets

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.242
about whether it was the worst
call in Super Bowl history,

00:25:18.242 --> 00:25:19.200
which was most of them.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.824
But "USA Today" actually said it
was the worst call in football

00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:22.560
history, period.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.590
So that seems to be where
the disagreement lay.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.500
So this is a really good
example of resulting.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.560
So we know what-- the
result was horrible, right?

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.870
I mean, the result was one of
the worst results in Super Bowl

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.369
history.

00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:35.664
We can agree on that.

00:25:35.664 --> 00:25:37.080
But that does not
mean that it was

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.880
one of the worst decisions
in Super Bowl history.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.750
And I think to just declare
that Pete Carroll hadn't

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.510
put any thought into it, I
mean, this is Pete Carroll.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.310
He's in the Super
Bowl for a reason.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.470
You know, that was
pretty spectacular.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.314
So like, I'll just ask you
guys to do a thought experiment

00:25:53.314 --> 00:25:54.730
so we can see what
the problem is.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.250
What do you do once
you have the result?

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.290
Imagine that Pete Carroll
passes that ball and the ball

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.210
is caught for a touchdown
in the end zone.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.080
Just take a moment
to think about that.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.640
Now how does that
decision feel now?

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.900
Brilliant.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.660
But how it turns out
on that one outcome

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.640
shouldn't actually
affect the way

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.710
that we think about
the decision, right?

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:20.490
I mean, that's like saying if I
flip a coin and you call heads

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.220
and it lands heads, that that
was a brilliant decision.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.680
But if it lands tails, that
was a really dumb decision.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.940
Like, one outcome
tells us nothing.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.030
But you can feel it.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:31.770
You can feel it.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.800
Like, the result acts
like a gravity well.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.770
And you can't climb out of it
to look at whether the decision

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.940
process was good or not.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.440
It's really hard.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.970
Now just to not leave you with
a cliffhanger, just so you know,

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.180
the probability of an
interception in that spot

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.600
depends on how many seasons
you aggregate across,

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.830
but it's probably somewhere
hovering around 1% or 2%.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:56.760
Right?

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.880
So here they declared this
the worst decision ever,

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.860
and like a 1 percenter
hit basically.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.957
So I don't think
that should really

00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:07.290
say very much about whether
the quality of that decision

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.160
was any good.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.910
Also, by the way, for anybody
who understands options theory,

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.010
remember they only
had one time-out.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.390
So if [INAUDIBLE] I think
it's about 40% of the time

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.340
that the ball just
isn't complete there.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.940
What happens?

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.050
The ball stops.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.970
And guess what
they have time for?

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.600
Two running plays.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.990
So if they hand the ball
off to Marshawn Lynch,

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.640
they're going to run so
much time out that they're

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.181
only to be able to
get two plays off,

00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:33.600
even with being able
to call the time-out,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.000
so they're only going
to get two plays.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.694
If they pass the ball
and it's dropped,

00:27:37.694 --> 00:27:39.360
they actually get
three plays, including

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.920
those two running plays
that everybody wanted

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.211
them to run in the first place.

00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:43.520
So it's a somewhat free option.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.860
It costs you this
interception rate of about 1%.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.170
For a more detailed
analysis, Benjamin Morris

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.540
on FiveThirtyEight
has a great one.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.462
Highly recommend you go read it.

00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:56.160
But so this is where
we can see that once we

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.320
know the outcome, once we
know whether it's good or bad,

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.720
it's incredibly hard for us not
to then retrofit the decision

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.800
quality to the outcome.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.420
So the answer is unless you're
running a Monte Carlo, which

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.170
we can't for most
things, what do

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.420
we do once an outcome
has occurred in terms of,

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.470
how do we move forward?

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.660
It's like, ignore the
outcome as much as possible

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.946
is actually the
weird answer to that.

00:28:20.946 --> 00:28:22.570
And I understand it's
counterintuitive,

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.486
but it's kind of the
only way to move forward.

00:28:24.486 --> 00:28:25.110
It's like, OK.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:26.257
It was one outcome.

00:28:26.257 --> 00:28:28.590
I've got to think about the
decision in absence of that.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.510
And if you want, we can
talk about strategies

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.330
for doing that.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.621
SPEAKER 1: That would be great.

00:28:32.621 --> 00:28:35.310
Because you mentioned
Phil Ivey as one side

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.630
of looking at every situation.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:38.950
Look at the skill aspect of it.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.741
What can I control?

00:28:39.741 --> 00:28:40.740
What can I improve?

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.680
And then you have Hellmuth
who, I guess his quote is,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.902
"I would be the best
poker player of all time

00:28:45.902 --> 00:28:46.860
if it wasn't for luck."

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.130
ANNIE DUKE: Yes.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.700
[LAUGH]

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.535
SPEAKER 1: So maybe we can
talk about that spectrum

00:28:49.535 --> 00:28:50.200
and strategies.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.060
ANNIE DUKE: Sure.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.860
So there's only two
things that determine

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.950
the way our lives turn
out, luck and the quality

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.010
of our decisions.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.167
So we can't really
control the luck element,

00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:00.750
so we should try to
get down and focus

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.250
on the quality of the decision.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.570
So you mentioned Phil Ivey I
think as a really good example

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.900
part of the way to do this.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.010
So I tell a story about-- he
won a really huge tournament

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.760
against really an
all-star final table.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.772
Phil Ivey is one of the best
poker players in history.

00:29:15.772 --> 00:29:17.730
And he actually went to
dinner with my brother,

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.146
and he spent the whole time
talking about all the mistakes

00:29:20.146 --> 00:29:21.460
that he had made.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.720
So obviously, he's got
an interesting cognitive

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.930
style, probably
one that's partly

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.510
responsible for how good he is.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.570
But he gives us actually
a clue of how to handle

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.750
these kinds of situations.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.112
So there's a variety
of different--

00:29:38.112 --> 00:29:39.820
what we're trying to
do is get to a point

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.070
where we can all be Phil Ivey.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.470
It's very hard to do.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.890
It's very hard to sort of
take our great outcomes

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:45.850
and look for mistakes.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.730
It's very hard to take our bad
outcomes, actually, and look

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:49.720
for mistakes as well.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.090
We kind of want to pawn
that off onto luck.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.030
So what I really talk
about in the book

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.980
is that the way into
this is actually

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.747
to try to separate outcomes
from decision quality

00:29:59.747 --> 00:30:00.580
as much as possible.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.002
So how can we do that?

00:30:02.002 --> 00:30:03.710
There's a variety of
ways we can do that.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.770
Let's talk sort of
strategy number one.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.084
All of this is done much
better in a group, by the way,

00:30:09.084 --> 00:30:11.500
and part of that reason is
because of this kind of gravity

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.197
well that we end up down in.

00:30:13.197 --> 00:30:14.530
This is the way our brains work.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.280
It's very hard for us
to parse this apart.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.127
But other people
can see our bias

00:30:18.127 --> 00:30:19.960
much better than we can
see it in ourselves.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.552
I mean, you can spot bias
thinking a mile away, right?

00:30:22.552 --> 00:30:24.010
So like, get some
people in a group

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.616
with you who will
spot your bias,

00:30:25.616 --> 00:30:26.740
and you'll spot their bias.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.910
And then here are
some things that you

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.110
can do with that group.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.080
Thing number one is when
possible, deconstruct decisions

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.670
before outcomes have occurred.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.280
So that's really,
really good to do.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.900
And memorialize it.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.830
So now as you're thinking
about the decision

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.441
and what the outcomes
might be, you

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.940
can write down what you think
all the possible outcomes are.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.710
So we can think about this
in terms of the Pete Carroll

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.209
example.

00:30:48.209 --> 00:30:49.790
And there's like, OK.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.249
Maybe the ball will be caught.

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.540
Maybe the ball will be dropped.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.748
Maybe it will be intercepted.

00:30:53.748 --> 00:30:55.630
You try to assign some
sort of probability

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.667
to each of those
possible scenarios.

00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:00.250
You think about what the extra
things you're getting out of it

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:00.340
are.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.900
So what is the
payoff in that case?

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.970
I'm getting two
running plays anyway.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.290
So now what happens is that
when the ball gets intercepted,

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.090
you know, you're not
overreacting to it,

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.340
because you've actually
thought about this in advance,

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.244
and you can actually
point and say,

00:31:14.244 --> 00:31:15.910
well, there's the
interception scenario.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.400
We thought about that when we
thought about the decision,

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.570
and it happens 1% of the time.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.970
So let's not overreact
to that and go now change

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.220
our decision the way that
we decide in the future

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.910
to not call that play again,
because it's already up there.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:34.060
So like, a trial lawyer
can deconstruct their trial

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.179
strategy before they
get, you know, a verdict.

00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:38.470
So that's one thing you can do.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.690
When possible, do
as much of the work

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.860
before you get the outcome.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.150
That's really good.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.331
Now in poker that's actually,
like, literally impossible,

00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:48.080
because you get the
outcome in 30 seconds.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.800
So there's not a lot of work
you can do in that 30 seconds,

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.170
and you certainly can't
go off to a group and say,

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.700
can we work out
the decision tree,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.500
and then I'll come
back to the table

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.750
and actually make my decision?

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.625
So you can't do that.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:01.120
So in that case, what
you can do is when you go

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.636
and you work with whatever
your truth seeking group

00:32:03.636 --> 00:32:05.260
is that you've sort
of formed together,

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.040
the people that you deconstruct
decisions with, only

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.550
describe the hand or the
question or the decision

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.980
up to the point that you
need help, and no further.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.210
So like, an example I could
give from poker would be, OK.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.905
I've got to hand.

00:32:21.905 --> 00:32:24.860
You know, let's say
I have king, queen.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.880
And I open the pot for a raise,
and this other guy re-raises,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.940
and he's very aggressive,
and he actually raises a lot.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.680
And so I was trying to
decide, should I fold?

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.750
Or maybe I should re-raise him.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.310
What do you think?

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.390
So notice, I don't--

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.400
I know how the hand turned out.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.339
I know how the person responded.

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:48.630
I know I would give a lot
more detail than that leading

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.860
up to that, but I know
exactly what happened.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.040
But if I'm asking you,
I'm not telling you.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.580
Because our own bias, these
problems are infectious.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.580
So once I tell you the
way it turned out, like,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.310
let's say that I told you,
so I decided to re-raise

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:05.340
and you then moved
all in on me, you're

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.470
going to now make a
story that makes sense,

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.140
and you're going to now
tell me about the decision

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.360
in a way that's going
to make the fact

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.555
that that particular
result happened make sense,

00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:16.680
because that's just the
way our minds like to work.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.090
So I'm just going
to leave it out,

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.560
and I'm only going to
tell you to the point

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.560
that I have a decision.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.330
So that's one thing I can do.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.420
Another thing I can
do is to one person,

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.160
I can tell you it
worked out well.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.070
And to another person, I can
tell them it worked out poorly.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.170
So I can change the story's end.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.510
I think that's a really
interesting exercise

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.240
to do, because
you will be amazed

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.000
at how different the
analyses you get,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.960
what the advice looks like
from the person you tell

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.420
that it ended well
versus the person

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.014
that you tell it ended poorly.

00:33:47.014 --> 00:33:48.555
And I think that
then you can sort of

00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:50.430
look at those two
things and kind of work

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.280
to merge them together
in order to get

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.100
some fidelity in your ability
to actually understand

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.450
what the decision quality is.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:01.080
So that's another way that you
can sort of not infect people.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.860
And you can do this
in a variety of ways,

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.943
not just with outcomes,
but with your own beliefs.

00:34:04.943 --> 00:34:08.040
So here's a really simple-- so
there's a simple problem, which

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.279
is like, if you allow people
to talk to each other,

00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:11.820
they sort of try to
come to consensus

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.949
and make beliefs make sense,
and you're infecting everybody

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:14.889
with your beliefs.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:16.270
So here's an example.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.389
Let's say that you
have four people who

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.283
have interviewed somebody that
you're thinking about hiring.

00:34:21.283 --> 00:34:22.699
Don't let them
talk to each other.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.389
Make them give you
their opinions,

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.130
write down their
opinions separately.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.630
Because once they
talk to each other,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.820
you've literally infected.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.900
It's like a virus.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.885
Another thing is, let's
say that you're now

00:34:32.885 --> 00:34:34.260
in front of
everybody, and you've

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.750
gotten the advice from
people, and now you

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.060
want to start talking in
the room about the advice.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.360
Do not say who you think should
be hired, because that'll

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.800
ruin the whole thing, right?

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.260
So keep your own
beliefs to yourself

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.139
when you're trying to get
advice from other people.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.310
And this is a simple--
like, in everyday life,

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.880
I read an article on politics.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.790
If I'm asking you what your
opinion of the article is,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.770
I should not say what
my belief about that

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.840
is, because then I've
ruined the whole thing.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.650
So I think that that's really
what you should do with it,

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.010
is kind of like, unless you've
got a large enough N, which

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:13.060
is rare, you should
kind of leave it out.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.764
Where do outcomes help you?

00:35:14.764 --> 00:35:16.680
Well, you know, obviously
throughout your life

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.054
as you kind of get them in,
they might be prompts for you

00:35:19.054 --> 00:35:20.750
to go in and say,
well, maybe I should

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.387
look at the decision quality.

00:35:22.387 --> 00:35:24.470
But it should be-- both
in the case of whether you

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.636
won or lost, it should be
a prompt to go in and look

00:35:26.636 --> 00:35:27.685
at the decision quality.

00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:29.810
And when you go in and look
at the decision quality

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.954
and you want to talk to
other people about it,

00:35:31.954 --> 00:35:33.620
you're going to do
better because you've

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.080
been prompted by the outcome
to leave the outcome out

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.930
as you're going to actually
improve the decision quality.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.430
It's a little counterintuitive.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.222
SPEAKER 1: Is there
are some situations

00:35:42.222 --> 00:35:44.180
where just sitting out,
not making the decision

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:44.660
makes sense?

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.868
Because you mentioned that
most poker players-- like,

00:35:46.868 --> 00:35:49.247
80% of the hands, they
don't make any actions on,

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:51.620
and there's only
20% that they play?

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:57.124
ANNIE DUKE: Yeah,
so in poker, one

00:35:57.124 --> 00:35:58.790
of the biggest mistakes
that people make

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.419
is actually playing
way too many hands.

00:36:01.419 --> 00:36:03.710
And you always need to think
about when you're actually

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.440
going to enter into something,
you need to be selective.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.830
So I want to talk about sort
of both sides of this puzzle.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:11.812
One is that just doing
stuff isn't enough.

00:36:11.812 --> 00:36:13.270
Like, I think a
lot of times people

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:15.160
are like, just throw a lot of
spaghetti against the wall.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.118
But you should actually
think about each strand

00:36:17.118 --> 00:36:19.640
and make sure you're getting
a payoff for the strand.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.416
So the fact is, yes.

00:36:21.416 --> 00:36:23.540
If you throw a bunch of
spaghetti against the wall,

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.499
some of that will pay
off and some of it won't.

00:36:26.499 --> 00:36:28.790
And I think that people look
at that, and they look at,

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:31.640
for example, VCs and they think
that's what their strategy is,

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.514
that they're just sort
of playing every hand,

00:36:33.514 --> 00:36:35.120
and then some of them pay off.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.369
And you know, when they pay
off, they're really heavy.

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:38.264
But that's not true.

00:36:38.264 --> 00:36:40.430
They are spreading their
bets across a large basket,

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.520
but they're actually
vetting each of the bets

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.170
that they're making to make
sure that given what they know,

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.750
they think that the payoff
is going to be big enough.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.060
So that's similar to
what a poker player does.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.530
So that's number one.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.770
But then number two that I think
is really important to think

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.440
about is that, don't take
that to the point of thinking

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.450
that somehow making a
decision is substantively

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.520
different from not
making a decision,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.320
because they're both decisions.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.860
So you have whatever
the status quo is.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.360
And when you're
going along and just

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.320
kind of going with the
status quo, trust me,

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.770
you're making a decision
every single time you do that.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.080
So I think that when we're
trying to sort of think

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.750
about doing these scenario
plans and imagining what

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.450
the future might look like, we
only think about it in terms

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.570
of decisions that we think
are new, where somehow we're

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.750
changing course.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.940
But not changing course is
a decision in and of itself.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.020
So you shouldn't be
taking time frequently

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.577
to look at what
the status quo is,

00:37:35.577 --> 00:37:37.410
to look at what you're
doing, the strategies

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.870
that you've always just
kind of been applying,

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.850
and do the exact
same kind of analysis

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.440
on that as if it
were a new decision.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.800
So let me give you a
super simple example.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.020
This is, like, the
simplest example ever.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.720
You're in a grocery
store, and there's,

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.550
you know, six lanes open.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.920
And you're Einstein
at this moment.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.600
Like, you're literally
doing some kind

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.584
of quantum physics
analysis about which line

00:37:59.584 --> 00:38:00.750
you're supposed to get into.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.580
You're laughing, because
you know it's true.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.163
So it's like, you
know, you're looking

00:38:04.163 --> 00:38:06.900
for the lady with the
coupons, and you know,

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.550
the cashier that looks
maybe like, you know,

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:13.170
oh, he seems a little slow or
he's new or he's a trainee,

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.930
or you know, the person
who has 17,000 things

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.670
in their car versus whatever.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.870
I mean, it's literally
like, you are completely

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.540
calculating this stuff out.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.950
OK.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.520
So that's a new decision, right?

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.860
So you're calculating
out all the scenarios,

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.630
trying to figure out,
like, which is going

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.650
to give me the best future?

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.566
Because you're now
investing your time, right?

00:38:33.566 --> 00:38:36.060
So this is very clearly a bet.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.430
You're betting on a line.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.350
And you think that
the you that results

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.840
from choosing whatever
line it is that you go to

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.530
is going to save time over the
you that results from whatever

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.880
other line you might choose.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.130
And that's what most bets are.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.796
You're not betting
against other people.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:54.240
You're betting against other
versions of yourself, right?

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.880
Like, Annie that chooses
line A versus Annie

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.240
that chooses line B. Or
like, I'm in the restaurant.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.800
Annie that chooses the chicken
or Annie that uses the fish,

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.670
or whatever.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.020
So Annie that chooses Des
Moines versus Annie that

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.581
chooses Las Vegas.

00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:07.080
OK.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.980
So now you choose a line.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.570
And you get in the line, and
the line turns out to be slow.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.590
What do you do?

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.000
You stay in the line.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.380
You don't move.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.520
But it's a new decision.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.710
Like, once you figure out
the line is slow, switch.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.276
But you don't,
because you know why?

00:39:24.276 --> 00:39:26.150
Because you're worried
about now if I switch,

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.547
what if that line-- my
line starts moving faster?

00:39:28.547 --> 00:39:29.880
I'll feel like I made a mistake.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.440
But at any moment,
it's the same decision.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.120
So if you treat the status
quo as if that's not

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.610
a decision in and of
itself, what happens is

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.590
you actually end up not
changing course enough.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.480
So we can go back to
the Pete Carroll example

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.740
to think about this.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.606
Let's do the other
thought experiment

00:39:49.606 --> 00:39:52.230
where Pete Carroll just doesn't
change his grocery line, right?

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.820
So he hands it off to
Marshawn Lynch, right?

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.945
That was the expected play.

00:39:54.945 --> 00:39:56.939
That's the status quo play.

00:39:56.939 --> 00:39:58.230
And let's say he doesn't score.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.150
What do you think the headlines
look like the next day?

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.330
Oh, New England's good.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.680
[LAUGH]

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.600
Literally, nobody's
like, oh, he's

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.160
the worst coach in
Super Bowl history

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.785
because he handed
off to Marshawn Lynch

00:40:08.785 --> 00:40:09.811
and he didn't score.

00:40:09.811 --> 00:40:10.310
Why?

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.250
Because people aren't viewing
that as a decision, right?

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.640
Like, that's just
the status quo.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.223
We already have
consensus around that.

00:40:16.223 --> 00:40:19.850
Clearly if he doesn't win, then
it's not the decision quality.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.550
Now we can firmly stick
it in the luck bucket,

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.874
because nobody's
questioning the status quo.

00:40:24.874 --> 00:40:27.290
So now it must be something
that's outside of his control.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.190
So included in luck
would be-- for example,

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.397
the quality of the defensive
line of New England

00:40:31.397 --> 00:40:32.480
would be included in luck.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.600
Luck is anything that you
yourself don't control.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.110
OK?

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.670
And that's because, all right.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.900
He chose his grocery line.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.520
Like, he's not switching.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.260
So the reason why
Pete Carroll got

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:46.010
so demolished in that
decision is because he

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.154
switched grocery lines.

00:40:47.154 --> 00:40:48.320
But he was right to do that.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.585
Like, that's how
progress gets made.

00:40:50.585 --> 00:40:51.335
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hmm.

00:40:51.335 --> 00:40:53.270
And I find in our
daily lives too,

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.120
sometimes after a
result happens, we'll

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.460
look at the person
who made the decision,

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.025
and then we'll say to ourselves,
well, if it went their way,

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:02.940
then odds are, it's luck.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.060
But if it would have
failed, it's like, you know,

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:09.500
it's mostly due to their
incompetencies or whatnot.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.660
Is there mechanisms where we
can be more cognizant of that

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.930
when we fall into that mode?

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:15.930
I think you talk about--

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:16.767
ANNIE DUKE: Yeah.

00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:19.100
So I've talked about this
particularly thing, resulting,

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:23.360
which is where we really tightly
connect outcomes and decisions.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.939
But there's two ways
that we do this.

00:41:24.939 --> 00:41:26.480
One is like, we're
looking at someone

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.450
from afar like Pete Carroll.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.440
OK, so he's not in our
reference group, right?

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.750
Like, we don't compare
ourselves to him.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.000
And so in that case, we
just look like, bad outcome

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.020
means bad decision.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.424
Good outcome means
good decision.

00:41:38.424 --> 00:41:40.840
So it's interesting, because
we do a pattern for ourselves

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.090
that's a little bit different.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.180
So if anybody's read
"Thinking Fast and Slow"

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.040
from Daniel Kahneman,
you'll remember this

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.498
from this, that
we're really trying

00:41:47.498 --> 00:41:49.756
to drive a positive narrative
of our lives, right?

00:41:49.756 --> 00:41:51.380
We want to think that
we're good actors

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.046
and we're smart, and
so on and so forth.

00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:56.420
So obviously, this goes in the
motivated reasoning category,

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.490
like, if we have a bad
outcome for ourselves.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.620
If I lose a hand at
poker, that doesn't really

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.510
jive with this positive
self-narrative,

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.400
at least not in the moment, OK?

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.900
So then what do we do?

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.180
Now remember, we've got this
noise in the system, right?

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.960
We've got the hidden
information and luck.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.420
When I lose a hand at
poker, it's because of luck.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.170
When I win a hand at poker,
it's because I'm a genius.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.692
That's called self-serving bias.

00:42:19.692 --> 00:42:21.650
I feel like it's a pretty
self-explanatory name

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.520
for that particular bias.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.760
And we do this in all
areas of our lives.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.210
When someone gets a promotion,
you know, it's bad luck for us.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.710
Like, it's not like we didn't
do the work or we didn't-- you

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.120
know, obviously, we deserved it.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.286
It was just, like, bad luck.

00:42:36.286 --> 00:42:37.430
It wasn't in our control.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.160
Actually, car accidents are
an interesting place to look.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.310
Over 90% of two-car
accidents are

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.917
reported as the
other person's fault.

00:42:45.917 --> 00:42:47.000
This is a pretty good one.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.630
I think it's 37%, I think,
of single-car accidents

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.420
as reported as not the
person's fault. I don't know.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.990
You go figure that one out.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:58.160
So that's how strong
this bias is, right?

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.960
Now what's interesting is--

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.787
but the number of decisions
that we make in our lives

00:43:02.787 --> 00:43:04.370
is obviously much
less than the number

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.340
of decisions we're able to
observe in other people.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.380
So let's assume that, OK,
we're crappy for ourselves,

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.260
but it doesn't matter,
because then we get

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.160
to feel good about ourselves.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.410
But we're really good at
analyzing everybody else's

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.005
decisions.

00:43:16.005 --> 00:43:18.380
But the problem is, as soon
as someone's in our reference

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.630
group, as soon as it's someone
that we feel like we're

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.910
comparing ourselves to,
to sort of figure out what

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.230
our self-worth is,
because we don't do that.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.470
Our happiness doesn't
derive an absence of the way

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.150
that we compare to other people.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:33.200
Now what we do is the
reverse pattern, right?

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.660
When they do something good,
it's because they got lucky,

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.160
and when they do
something bad, it's

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.095
because they're a really
bad decision maker.

00:43:39.095 --> 00:43:42.560
So when they win
a hand of poker,

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.742
it's because they got lucky.

00:43:43.742 --> 00:43:45.200
And when they lose
a hand of poker,

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.850
it's because they're
a bad decision maker.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.320
Now you can kind
of see, actually,

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.736
if you think about
poker, which is

00:43:49.736 --> 00:43:54.500
zero sum, how these two problems
might have emerged, right?

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.320
Because looking at a
zero-sum game like poker,

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.270
you can see how that
pattern happens.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:03.440
So if I'm trying to offload
my bad results to luck

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.660
and I lose a hand
specifically to you,

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.660
I can't say that you won
the hand because of skill.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.950
That doesn't work.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.470
So I have to say that you
lost the hand because of luck,

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.090
because I'm trying to
put my bet-- you know,

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:15.350
I'm trying to say
it's bad luck for me.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.180
So therefore, it must
be good luck for you.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.177
And if I win a hand
because of skill,

00:44:19.177 --> 00:44:21.260
rather, I can't say that
you lost because of luck.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:21.927
It doesn't jive.

00:44:21.927 --> 00:44:24.468
It's just that, you know, so we
sort of treat everything like

00:44:24.468 --> 00:44:25.934
it's zero sum when we shouldn't.

00:44:25.934 --> 00:44:28.100
But you can see how that
happens when I specifically

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.010
think I'm referring to you when
you're in my reference group,

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.730
right?

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.460
So again, how do
we solve for this?

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.380
Well, I'm going to go
back to that group idea.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.710
Form a really, really
good decision group

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.044
that has different values.

00:44:41.044 --> 00:44:43.460
So there's different ways that
we can derive good feelings

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.420
from ourselves, right?

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.132
So our natural tendency is to
try to offload it in the moment

00:44:48.132 --> 00:44:50.090
so that we don't have to
have a negative update

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.500
to our self-image,
and we don't ever

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.870
miss out on a positive update
to our self-image, right?

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.490
Because if I say that I
won because I got lucky,

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.770
I don't get that
positive update.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.686
And if I say that I lost
because of something I did,

00:45:01.686 --> 00:45:03.060
I don't get that
positive update.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.980
And that's sort
of the natural way

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.660
that we're, like,
getting our pellets.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.480
Like, we're pressing a
lever in a Skinner box.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.340
That's where our
pellets are coming from.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.650
But very early in
my poker career,

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.870
I went up to somebody
named Eric Seidel, who's

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.190
an amazing poker player.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.720
He's won over $38
million in his career,

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.450
so he's really, really good.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.310
I had met him when
I was actually 16,

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.430
and I didn't start playing poker
professional till I was 26.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.280
So he was just like
a buddy of mine.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.820
And then all of
the sudden, I'm 26,

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.940
and now he's a
professional peer.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.190
So I remember, I
was in a tournament

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.900
and I got knocked out.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.540
And obviously, something
unlucky happened to me, clearly.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.340
And I went up to Eric
Seidel, and I went

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.790
to go-- what's called moaning.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.430
I went to go complain to him.

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:48.497
Oh, I can't believe this.

00:45:48.497 --> 00:45:49.330
I had such bad luck.

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:50.030
I had this hand.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.540
Meh, meh, meh.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.890
The normal.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.320
And he actually laid
this out for me,

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.512
how do we solve for this
in the most beautiful way?

00:45:57.512 --> 00:45:58.970
It's going to sound
kind of brutal,

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.330
but I'm so thankful for it.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.320
So why are you telling me this?

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.910
Like, you think I'm
not losing myself?

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.750
Like, why are you offloading
your negative emotions onto me?

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.350
I don't need that.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.097
If you really lost
because of bad luck,

00:46:09.097 --> 00:46:10.680
there's nothing to
be learned from it.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.800
So I would like you to not
offload your emotional distress

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.580
onto me, thank you very much.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.050
However, if you have a
question, if there's something

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:23.400
that you're trying to ask me
about strategy, I'm all ears.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.470
So let's think about
what he did there.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.910
He said, if you're not focusing
on accuracy, I don't care.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.800
What does that mean,
this focus on accuracy?

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.950
Let's think about the
division between--

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.870
the distinction
between reasoning

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.040
to be accurate and
reasoning to be right.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.336
Reasoning to be right is, I
just want my priors to be right.

00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:44.460
So I'm just going to reason
to prove that I'm right

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.420
all the time, right?

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.810
Reasoning to be accurate--
that's funny that I said right

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.520
right after that--

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.140
reasoning to be
accurate is I'm trying

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.854
to construct the most accurate
model of the objective truth.

00:46:55.854 --> 00:46:57.270
And if you think
about who's going

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.790
to win in a bet, the person
who's reasoning to be right

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.929
versus the person who's
reasoning to be accurate,

00:47:02.929 --> 00:47:04.970
that's why when I say to
you, do you want to bet,

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.742
it takes you out of
the right mode right

00:47:06.742 --> 00:47:07.700
into the accurate mode.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.034
Because everybody understands
if I'm going to bet on it,

00:47:10.034 --> 00:47:11.658
I'd better be reasoning
to be accurate.

00:47:11.658 --> 00:47:13.970
So he told me, you have to
be reasoning to be accurate.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.710
What you're doing right now
is reasoning to be right.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:16.940
You're sad you lost.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.340
It's not your fault.
Blah, blah, blah.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.690
That doesn't help anybody.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:21.740
But if you have a
question, if you

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.870
want to know whether you
accurately played the hand,

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:24.720
let's talk about it.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.710
So he told me that I have to
think about accuracy if I'm

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:28.550
talking to him.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.931
He told me he was going to
hold me accountable to that.

00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:32.180
Because he did in that moment.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.370
He was holding me accountable
to the way I was thinking.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:35.745
And he said, you're
going to have

00:47:35.745 --> 00:47:37.730
to be open to maybe
things aren't the way

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:39.392
that you want them to be.

00:47:39.392 --> 00:47:41.600
So I was going to have to
be open to diverse opinions

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.580
and other people's perspectives.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.010
So let's take those three
things as a great group charter,

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:47.510
right?

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:49.593
You have to have a focus
on accuracy, a commitment

00:47:49.593 --> 00:47:50.307
to accuracy.

00:47:50.307 --> 00:47:52.640
You have to hold each other
accountable to these things,

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.630
and you have to be open
to diverse viewpoints.

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.640
That seems like a
pretty good charter.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.470
And what's really
wonderful about what Eric

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:00.820
did for me in that moment--

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:04.600
we remain friends, because
I was thankful for this.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.480
I was a little upset in the
moment, but I got over it.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.030
I saw the value eventually.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.140
But what he did for
me was two things.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.487
One is now I understood that
when I went and talked to him,

00:48:15.487 --> 00:48:16.570
he was going to mentor me.

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.260
He was going to
teach me how to play.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.400
So when I had hand questions, I
could actually deconstruct them

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.734
with him, and that was going
to be super helpful for me.

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.275
So that was a little
bit of the help.

00:48:25.275 --> 00:48:26.980
But the big help he
gave me was when I

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.460
went back and played on my own.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.850
So when you're playing
poker, it's all on your own.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.130
I was processing what was
happening at the table

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.640
differently.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.010
So I'm not processing,
oh, I got unlucky.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.730
Oh, I'm so smart.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:38.530
Oh, I got unlucky.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:39.590
Oh, I'm so smart.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.310
Because that's not good material
for me to go back to Eric with,

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:42.590
right?

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.940
And I know later on, he's
going to hold me accountable.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.273
And if I want to have a really
good discussion with him,

00:48:47.273 --> 00:48:49.034
I have to come to him
with good material.

00:48:49.034 --> 00:48:50.450
So now it changes
the way that I'm

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:52.790
viewing what's happening
at the table in the moment

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:54.860
so that I'm looking
for mistakes.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.970
I'm looking for questions.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.799
I'm looking for where other
people might be outplaying me,

00:48:58.799 --> 00:49:00.590
where they might be
winning because they're

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:01.812
better than I am.

00:49:01.812 --> 00:49:03.020
And I'm going to go tell him.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.640
And now this is what happens.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.230
This is so great.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.080
Two great things
happened from that.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.890
Thing number one, I go back to
him and I say, you know what?

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:11.120
I think I really
butchered a hand.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.453
I think I really made a mistake.

00:49:12.453 --> 00:49:14.330
And he gives me a pellet, right?

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:18.320
So he wasn't giving me
pellets for pressing the,

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:19.920
I just got unlucky lever.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.420
Right?

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.202
He's giving me pellets for the,
I think I made a mistake lever.

00:49:23.202 --> 00:49:24.160
So that's really great.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.960
So now that becomes part of
my self-narrative, right?

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.010
Eric Seidel wants to talk to me.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:30.520
He thinks I'm smart, right?

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.920
So I'm not, like--

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.930
I practice mindfulness,
but I don't

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:40.370
think I'm ever achieving, like,
on the mountain in Tibet, not

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:42.629
worried about what the
world thinks of me.

00:49:42.629 --> 00:49:44.420
I'm trying, but I'm
not going to get there.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.480
So Eric Seidel is
giving me that, right?

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.420
He's helping me to think
better by giving me

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.980
the right kind of pellet, right?

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.780
That's number one.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.530
And then number two,
again, back to the,

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:57.410
I'm trying to be a monk on
top of a mountain in Tibet,

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:01.580
I'm really trying hard for
that, that ultimate mindfulness

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.890
practice, but I'm I'm
kind of failing at it,

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:04.840
but I'm working on it.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.339
I'm trying.

00:50:05.339 --> 00:50:06.390
I'm practicing it.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:09.470
But in the meantime, if we
go back to that tribalism,

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:12.612
and how does our tribe
feel distinct from others,

00:50:12.612 --> 00:50:14.570
think about what it did
for me when I walked up

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.760
to Eric in my group
and I was saying,

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.770
oh, I really think
I made a mistake?

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:22.384
But when I'm walking down
the hall of the poker room,

00:50:22.384 --> 00:50:24.050
I'm hearing all these
people go, can you

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:25.050
believe how unlucky I got?

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.176
Yeah, I got so unlucky too.

00:50:26.176 --> 00:50:26.675
Yeah.

00:50:26.675 --> 00:50:27.690
Oh, that guy's an idiot.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:28.980
Da, da, da, da, da.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.620
And that's what
those tribes, how

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.120
they're talking to each other.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.850
So I got my distinctiveness
in the mix too.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:36.982
So it's like I got my cake
and I got to eat it too,

00:50:36.982 --> 00:50:37.940
which was kind of good.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.550
And then in the meantime, I'm
doing a mindfulness practice

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:42.540
and trying not to worry
about any of that.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.620
But until I can't-- you
know, until I get there,

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.760
I get to reinforce all of these
good changes in cognitive style

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.439
through what the
group is giving me.

00:50:51.439 --> 00:50:53.480
SPEAKER 1: So I want to
ask you one more question

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.840
before I go to the audience.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.465
It seems like what
you're talking about

00:50:57.465 --> 00:50:59.330
is not just applicable
to the poker world.

00:50:59.330 --> 00:50:59.955
ANNIE DUKE: No.

00:50:59.955 --> 00:51:00.977
It's for sure not.

00:51:00.977 --> 00:51:02.560
SPEAKER 1: I see the
investment world,

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.330
I see family, things like that.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.010
Where have you seen these skills
kind of spill over for you

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.180
in your life?

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.770
ANNIE DUKE: Oh my gosh.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:11.480
Everywhere.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.810
So I want to say two things.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.420
One is these skills
have definitely

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:18.830
spilled over in all areas of my
life, and I'm terrible at them.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:26.720
So the thing is, the way that we
process information is so built

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.934
in that your goal is really to
be a little bit better at it.

00:51:30.934 --> 00:51:32.600
And if you're a little
bit better at it,

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.770
it's going to
compound over time.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:34.970
It's going to really
make a difference

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.636
in your overall decision quality
and the quality of the outcomes

00:51:37.636 --> 00:51:38.930
that you eventually have.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:41.020
So I still mess up all
the time, trust me.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.020
Bad things happen to me.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.311
I go, oh, I can't believe that.

00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:44.160
I was so unlucky.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.950
It's just that I
catch myself hopefully

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:48.470
more often, and hopefully
a little bit faster

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:49.800
than I otherwise would.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.770
But I know I'm still
missing a lot of those.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.150
I mean, I'm still biased.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:55.040
So that's number one.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.240
But number two in terms of areas
of my life, like everywhere.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.170
So in the way that
I parent my children

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:02.660
and the way that I talk to my
partner and the way that I--

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.590
the process of writing this
book where you have to be--

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.480
like, you're working
with an editor,

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.690
and you have to not
sort of push off

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.250
what they're saying
because you feel

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.085
so much ownership
over the words,

00:52:15.085 --> 00:52:16.460
and you know better
than they do.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.209
It's like, trying to
have open-mindedness,

00:52:18.209 --> 00:52:20.420
and really use the
editor and your agent,

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.009
and so on and so forth as that
kind of truth-seeking group

00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:24.800
that you're trying to
come up with the best

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.150
representation of your ideas.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:28.880
And that's not
necessarily all the ideas

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.100
of how you think it
should be presented.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.610
You have to be
open-minded to that.

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.370
You know, like I say,
like in terms of the way

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.400
that I talk to my kids
and I guide my kids,

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.762
you know, every teenager
that I've raised

00:52:43.762 --> 00:52:44.720
comes back from school.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.670
I can't believe I did
so bad on the test.

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.044
It's because the
teacher was mean

00:52:48.044 --> 00:52:50.000
and they gave me things
that they didn't even

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.625
teach in class, and
it was really hard.

00:52:51.625 --> 00:52:52.860
And you can ask anybody.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.360
Right?

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.550
So how are you talking
to somebody about that?

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.867
And you know, well,
with kids, you

00:52:58.867 --> 00:53:00.950
don't want to be challenging
them in the same way.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:01.970
But you say, OK.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.200
I'm sorry about that.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.310
So what are you going
to do about that?

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:05.750
Like, in the future,
how do you think

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:07.080
you're going to solve for that?

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.660
So really trying to
get them to understand,

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.520
what are the things that are
under your control and what

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.019
aren't?

00:53:11.019 --> 00:53:14.000
So not in an Eric Seidel
way, but trying to say, OK.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.096
How can you do better?

00:53:15.096 --> 00:53:16.970
Like, how can you make
it so that-- maybe you

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.325
should go talk to the
teacher before the next test

00:53:19.325 --> 00:53:21.200
if you know they might
put things on the test

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.550
that they didn't teach.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.920
So you know, not so much
disagreeing with them,

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.006
because they're not adults.

00:53:28.006 --> 00:53:30.380
But trying to get them to
focus more on those things that

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.521
are in their control.

00:53:31.521 --> 00:53:33.770
But also just in terms of
when I was writing the book,

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.210
I was thinking, like, OK.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:36.918
It's going to be a
certain amount of time

00:53:36.918 --> 00:53:39.040
that I'm going to
have to invest.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.619
You know, what am I
going to get in return?

00:53:41.619 --> 00:53:42.910
What does the future look like?

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:45.467
Like, I thought about, the
book could be a total flop.

00:53:45.467 --> 00:53:47.050
I have to think about
that in advance.

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:48.490
And is that going
to feel OK for me?

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:50.739
Is it going to be worthwhile
to have written the book,

00:53:50.739 --> 00:53:52.520
even if nobody ever reads it?

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.480
So it's really
kind of everywhere.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.180
And then really recognizing--

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.450
the other thing is, I'm a big
believer in Ulysses contracts,

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.670
because I really understand
that as much as you--

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:04.600
SPEAKER 1: Sorry, what
are Ulysses contracts?

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.308
ANNIE DUKE: Yeah.

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.009
Sorry.

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:06.550
You're right.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.240
I'm assuming.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.820
So a Ulysses
contract is thinking

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.195
in advance about
places where you

00:54:11.195 --> 00:54:13.030
know you're going
to be really biased,

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:15.610
and it's going to be hard
to overcome this in order

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.480
to kind of prevent yourself
from acting irrationally.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.000
So we don't always have a
group of other people around us

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:22.501
to help us.

00:54:22.501 --> 00:54:24.916
But you can actually form a
different kind of group, which

00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:26.560
is a group of the
past versions of you

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.350
and the future versions of you
to all kind of come together

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:31.280
and help the present
version of you.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.120
So the classic example
is from Greek literature.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.790
Odysseus was sailing
along, and he

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.730
knew he was going to come
to the island of the sirens.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:41.620
And the sirens were
these beautiful nymphs

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.750
that sang on the
shore, and the song

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.900
was so irresistible
to the ears of any man

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:49.960
that they would steer their
ship toward the shore.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.960
The shore was a rocky shoal
that would break the ship apart.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.350
Sudden death.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:57.880
So Ulysses, which is the
Roman name for Odysseus,

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.150
knew this, and asked his
crew to tie his hands

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:02.710
to the mast of the ship.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:05.470
So this is a really good example
of forming a group that's

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:07.060
different versions of you.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.180
So Odysseus said, future
Odysseus is really

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:12.670
going to have a problem,
because future Odysseus is going

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.500
to steer toward the shore.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.520
So I'm going to tie
future Odysseus' hands

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.417
to stop him from doing that.

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.000
So I think there's
all sorts of places

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.812
where you can recognize that you
might need help in the future.

00:55:25.812 --> 00:55:28.270
Like, a simple example would
be take a ride sharing service

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.040
to a bar.

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.305
That's a way to tie your hands.

00:55:32.305 --> 00:55:36.006
For me with exercising, I
sign up for classes in advance

00:55:36.006 --> 00:55:37.630
so that I've got my
schedule worked out

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:41.080
and I feel, you know, that
I have a commitment to that.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.350
I only have certain kinds
of foods in the house.

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:47.140
You know, these are all
examples of Ulysses contracts.

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.626
And I'm a huge fan
of those, and I

00:55:48.626 --> 00:55:50.000
apply those across
my whole life,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.390
including actually in
writing the book, which

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:57.437
was instead of ever letting my
editor set the deadline for me,

00:55:57.437 --> 00:55:59.770
because that is more like
someone telling me what to do,

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.780
which doesn't feel
like a contract,

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.080
I set all my own deadlines.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.569
So I would tell her what day.

00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:08.110
I actually would usually give
her three days and a confidence

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.300
interval around each one.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:13.150
Because you know-- well,
obviously, because I

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:14.472
wrote this book.

00:56:14.472 --> 00:56:15.430
So it would be with it.

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:16.600
But there would be
a week that I would

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.040
know that I had to turn it in.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:21.880
And I would say, you
know, it's 60% on Monday

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:27.190
and 80% on Tuesday
and 98% on Friday.

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.730
So by setting that myself,
I was creating a contract.

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.920
And then I held to the
deadline and actually got

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.267
the book in early, because I
was applying Ulysses contracts.

00:56:36.267 --> 00:56:38.350
So I really do practice
what I preach in the book.

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:39.530
SPEAKER 1: I think it's
an excellent concept,

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:41.500
and I'm just realizing, oh
my god, I didn't see that.

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.300
Because I was writing
a letter someone,

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.758
and I was making a reference
to the sirens and their songs.

00:56:45.758 --> 00:56:47.560
So that's excellent.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.660
Do we have any
audience questions?

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.440
Sure.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.330
ANNIE DUKE: Let's
start here, because you

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.532
were my poker opponent.

00:56:54.532 --> 00:56:55.990
And then I'll move
across the line.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.615
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:56.615 --> 00:56:58.160
Annie, it's great
to have you here.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.517
My wife is a big fan.

00:56:59.517 --> 00:57:00.600
ANNIE DUKE: Oh, thank you.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.180
AUDIENCE: So I come from China.

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.070
Just [INAUDIBLE]
your career pathway's

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.580
very kind of interesting
from academia, then poker,

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.740
now reaching other causes.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.230
So what kind of--

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:14.085
you talk about these
[INAUDIBLE],, right?

00:57:14.085 --> 00:57:16.970
Just for your life, based
on your life experience,

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:20.490
what kind of [INAUDIBLE]
those kind of--

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:24.420
what you [INAUDIBLE],,
you know, what do did,

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.950
you know, did you naturally
come to that decision,

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:29.890
or some time you
really think about

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:32.570
it [INAUDIBLE] block some time?

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:33.070
Oh, OK.

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:34.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:35.854
Yeah, that's basically--

00:57:35.854 --> 00:57:36.520
ANNIE DUKE: Huh.

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.650
So that's an
interesting question.

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.860
So yeah.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:42.110
I mean, I have taken
a lot of turns.

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.240
And I actually
think that my life

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.800
is a good example of
really understanding

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:52.050
kind of, you know, this luck
versus decision quality.

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:58.820
So I would say that the two
big careers that I've had

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.630
have come out of,
something happens

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:05.390
that either on the face of
it looks lucky or unlucky,

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:07.241
but it's definitely an
intervention of luck.

00:58:07.241 --> 00:58:08.240
And then I just say, OK.

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.470
Here I am.

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:13.380
Now let me think about where
I'm going to go from here.

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.960
So it's not sort of
sitting and wallowing

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.650
in the sort of luck element
of it, but just thinking, OK.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:20.330
I'm here now, so now, all right.

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:20.900
That's done.

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.520
I've got to figure out
where to go from here.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.880
So the first one would be
this illness that landed me

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.930
in the hospital for two weeks.

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:29.720
I still sometimes
struggle with it,

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:33.004
but you know, it was very out
of control at that time, and now

00:58:33.004 --> 00:58:34.670
I've got it under
control, so it doesn't

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:36.622
intervene in my life in
the same way anymore.

00:58:36.622 --> 00:58:39.080
But this was when I was really
struggling with this stomach

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:39.830
issue.

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.900
I land in the hospital
for two weeks.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.730
This seems like an
incredibly unlucky thing

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.050
that's happened to me.

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:46.490
And I say, OK.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:47.210
I need money.

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.480
What am I going to do?

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.940
I don't have my
fellowship anymore.

00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.100
It turns out that when
you leave graduate school

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.250
and take time off, the
National Science Foundation

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:57.000
doesn't still give you money.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.837
So all right.

00:58:57.837 --> 00:58:59.670
I've got to figure out
what I'm going to do,

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:01.394
and that's when I
started playing poker.

00:59:01.394 --> 00:59:03.560
And then when I was playing
poker, I discovered, OK.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.643
Like, I'm pretty good at
it and I really enjoy it,

00:59:05.643 --> 00:59:08.960
and it seemed like this
really cool collision

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:13.600
of what I was
studying in academics

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.120
and sort of real life, right?

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.550
And at that point
I said, OK, I'm

00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:20.247
just going to delay graduate
school, and this is what I did.

00:59:20.247 --> 00:59:22.330
Once I started playing
poker, I didn't necessarily

00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:24.760
think there was something
else I was going to do.

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.674
Then I got asked to
give this talk in 2002.

00:59:27.674 --> 00:59:29.340
It was great, and I
still didn't think--

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.798
and that was a matter of luck,
because Eric Seidel actually

00:59:31.798 --> 00:59:33.190
got asked to give the talk.

00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:34.090
Not me.

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:36.380
And he hates public
speaking, so he referred me.

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.671
This had nothing to do with me.

00:59:37.671 --> 00:59:39.070
I wasn't seeking it out, right?

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:41.140
This was not a decision I made.

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.100
I get offered the talk.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.260
I say yes.

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.100
I give it, and I'm
still thinking, oh,

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.674
that was fun, except that the
people that I gave the talk to

00:59:47.674 --> 00:59:49.840
started referring me out,
at which point I said, OK.

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.840
Now I've got a choice.

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.040
Maybe I could do this as well.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.206
Which I did.

00:59:55.206 --> 00:59:56.830
And there's been all
sorts of-- there's

00:59:56.830 --> 00:59:57.910
other points in my life.

00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:00.400
I almost became an options
trader a little while

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.332
after that, but then
poker got on TV,

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:04.040
and I thought that's
kind of interesting.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.270
Maybe I'll try that.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.450
And I think that because I think
probabilistically, I end up--

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.010
I'm just less likely to
stick with the status quo.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:14.350
I'm more likely to say, OK.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.350
It's a new decision.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:18.106
Do I want to switch
grocery lines?

01:00:18.106 --> 01:00:19.480
And so I think
that's sort of how

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:24.130
I end up looking kind
of here or here or here.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:24.754
It's just, OK.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.170
Luck brings you
to certain places,

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.472
and I'm perfectly fine
saying, here's the status quo

01:00:29.472 --> 01:00:31.180
and here is this new
thing that I can do.

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:31.660
What can I do?

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.535
Or maybe I can do them
both at the same time.

01:00:33.535 --> 01:00:35.590
I think I tend to be
more open-minded maybe

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.270
to that, because
that's the thing

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.130
that poker really teaches you.

01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:40.720
It's like the best
laid plans, right?

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.280
You still lose the hand.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.070
And so it forces you to
think probabilistically.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:48.440
You have to be thinking this
way or you will not succeed.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.610
And I think naturally,
it spreads out.

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.254
Here is the actual
funniest example

01:00:52.254 --> 01:00:54.670
that I can give you of how
poker players just really think

01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:56.570
this way.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:01:02.110
So when I went to
go on my first date

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:04.750
with the absolute
love of my life,

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.220
my brother and
brother-in-law, who

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.620
both knew the person I was
going on the first date with,

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.680
immediately set a market.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.490
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:13.490
So they started bidding.

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:14.573
We'd never been on a date.

01:01:14.573 --> 01:01:16.150
We had been friends
for a long time,

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:17.740
but we'd never been on a date.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.710
So they start bidding,
and my brother-in-law

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.780
ended up buying 23.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.120
So somebody said to
me, aren't you offended

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.100
that they started
making a market?

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.470
And I was like, no.

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.600
I just can't believe my
brother-in-law bought 23.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.470
Like, we'd never been on a date.

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:35.410
So I think that
that shows you, it's

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:37.600
just this way of thinking
about the world, just sort

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.170
of attaching numbers to it.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.249
And that's why I think
that I've sort of--

01:01:43.249 --> 01:01:44.665
I hope that answers
your question.

01:01:44.665 --> 01:01:44.960
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.395
So our next question is online.

01:01:46.395 --> 01:01:47.020
ANNIE DUKE: OK.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.640
SPEAKER 1: You've
talked about feeling

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.350
like an imposter or outsider
at some poker tables.

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:53.530
What are some of the ways
the ideas in your book

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.350
can help address the
imposter syndrome sensation

01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.432
or counteract overconfidence?

01:01:59.432 --> 01:02:00.140
ANNIE DUKE: Yeah.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.430
That's actually really good.

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:04.509
So I think the overconfidence
piece is a little bit easier

01:02:04.509 --> 01:02:06.800
to deal with, because I think
that if you have a really

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.216
good decision
group, they're going

01:02:08.216 --> 01:02:10.710
to check your overconfidence.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:12.800
So that's going to be
part of the conversation

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.380
all the time is, are you
feeling overconfident?

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:19.550
Imposter syndrome, you
know, it's a hard one.

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:21.530
I mean, I feel it all the time.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:22.760
I feel it about this book.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.680
I feel it when I get
up and give talks.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.620
It's like, ugh.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:29.470
You know, why am I
even opening my mouth?

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:33.650
And I think that, again,
it's like, get other people

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:36.440
to talk to you, because
what they can do

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.900
is they can often see
things more clearly.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:42.200
So I've actually had
conversations where I've said,

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.079
you know, oh, I just
feel like this--

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:44.870
I can't believe it.

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:45.710
I'm such an imposter.

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:47.709
I don't know what I'm
talking about, da, da, da.

01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:49.160
And people will
say, like, people

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.419
keep hiring you for speeches.

01:02:50.419 --> 01:02:51.710
They'll actually go through it.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:53.660
Like, you know,
they refer you out.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.840
People are buying your book.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.048
They're obviously-- you know.

01:02:56.048 --> 01:02:58.910
And having other people to
kind of look at you in a more

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.460
objective way to get you
out of your own head,

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.830
I really feel like
that's the way to do it.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:05.480
And then what happens
is it's like--

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.970
I highly recommend everybody
read "The Power of Habit,"

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:10.220
because it really shows you
how to change your habits.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.800
But not just the habits
of, like, going to the gym.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.484
Like, your habits of mind
and the way you think.

01:03:15.484 --> 01:03:17.150
And what ends up is--
you know, remember

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:20.000
I said when I had that
conversation with Eric Seidel,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.790
now when I went to the table,
I was thinking about what

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.780
Eric Seidel might say later.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.500
And so when you have a really
good decision group that's

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.050
checking your bias, whether
it's overconfidence or

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:32.089
underconfidence or
imposter syndrome,

01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:34.130
the group gets in your
head in a really good way.

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:36.620
So that then when I'm sort
of on my own and I'm like--

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.810
trust me, when I leave this
room and I'm in the car,

01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:42.110
I'm going to think about
what a bad talk I gave.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.099
So maybe I did.

01:03:43.099 --> 01:03:43.640
I don't know.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.608
[LAUGH]

01:03:44.608 --> 01:03:46.060
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.211
ANNIE DUKE: So now
I'm in my head.

01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:48.710
OK.

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:49.210
So anyway--

01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:50.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.780
--when I do that, hopefully
I have a group of people

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.787
that I can sort of
offload that to,

01:03:55.787 --> 01:03:57.620
and they can offload
things like that to me.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.180
And hopefully,
they're talking to me.

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.480
I mean, not physically.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.501
But I'm sort of running
that conversation, you know?

01:04:03.501 --> 01:04:05.750
Because that's really what
happened at the poker table

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.970
was if I was
processing the world

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:10.490
in a way that was
irrational, I would

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.767
run the conversation with Eric
or my brother or John Hennigan,

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.100
or whoever it might be later
where they were telling me,

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.840
like, oh, come on.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.940
And that would help me when
I was kind of on my own.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.230
So I think it's about, what
are the rewards you're getting?

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:28.520
And how are people around
you helping to sort of shape

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.446
those habits of mind?

01:04:29.446 --> 01:04:31.070
And I think that's
really the best way,

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.194
because I think it's just--

01:04:32.194 --> 01:04:34.660
the thing is, I think it's
so hard to do on your own.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.980
I think we all really need
help with this, you know?

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.781
And I think another
mistake we make

01:04:38.781 --> 01:04:41.030
is we think, well, if I know
about it, like, if I know

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:43.580
about imposter syndrome or
I know about overconfidence

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.950
and I'm really smart,
problem solved.

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:47.084
[LAUGH]

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:48.500
SPEAKER 1: In the
book, didn't you

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.330
mention that the people who
have the highest IQ scores

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.122
are the ones you're
most susceptible to--

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:52.830
ANNIE DUKE: Yeah.

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:59.040
So high IQ correlates positively
with motivated reasoning.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:04:59.710
So--

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:00.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:01.419
--right.

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:02.960
And you can think
why that is, right?

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.240
It's like, how do you
slice and dice the info?

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.802
Like, if you're
cognitively agile,

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:08.510
you're going to be
able to slice and dice

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:12.230
a story that sounds a lot
more convincing to yourself

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:15.590
and to others about why
everything you believe is true,

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:19.184
and why every prediction
you ever have is 100%.

01:05:19.184 --> 01:05:20.100
So yeah.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:25.040
So I'm smart and I know about
this now is not necessarily

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:25.540
a solution.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.460
And like I say, I'm
telling you, I'm

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.540
going to walk away
from this and I'm

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.470
going to think about
what a bad job I did.

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:34.610
I don't want you guys to think
that you practice these things

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:36.950
and somehow it's ever solved.

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:37.640
It's not.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.940
It's just, do I catch
myself doing it more often?

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.710
Do I do it less?

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:46.445
And those-- just doing it less
and catching it more often,

01:05:46.445 --> 01:05:48.590
it's huge.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:51.320
So instead of berating
yourself for all the times

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.480
that you screw up, it's
like you get to celebrate

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.830
that I did it one fewer times.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:55.430
You know?

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:58.722
Like it's such a more
self-compassionate way to live.

01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:00.680
And I'm really-- like,
I'm trying to get there.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.011
But you know, yeah.

01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:03.260
So I think you had a question.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.630
Yeah?

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:06.130
Oh, sorry.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:06.900
Were we supposed to end?

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.400
I'm sorry.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.397
I didn't want to--

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:09.480
SPEAKER 1: No, we're good.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:09.810
Keep going.

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:10.290
Yeah.

01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:10.500
ANNIE DUKE: We're OK?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:10.800
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.230
ANNIE DUKE: OK.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.910
AUDIENCE: Short question.

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:14.130
What's your strategy
for rock paper scissors?

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:16.530
ANNIE DUKE: Oh.

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:18.000
Short answer is throw scissors.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:18.810
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.250
So just kind of understand-- so
most people throw rock first,

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.840
and then most people kind
of know you throw rock.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.320
So what happens is--
well, it depends.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.940
If you're against somebody
who is a total newbie,

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.760
so you know they're
going to throw rock,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.517
then you should
just throw paper.

01:06:38.517 --> 01:06:40.350
But if you're against
somebody who you think

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:41.700
is a little bit smarter
than that, they're

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.033
going to throw paper on you,
so you do a pretty good job

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:44.950
throwing scissors.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:45.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:47.495
ANNIE DUKE: And if
they're really good,

01:06:47.495 --> 01:06:50.110
they throw scissors and you
tie, so it's not a big deal.

01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:50.990
AUDIENCE: One of
the things that you

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:52.906
said at the beginning
of the talk really stuck

01:06:52.906 --> 01:06:57.630
with me about talking about
your opinions in terms of bets

01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:58.840
and challenging that.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.840
How do you do that when
something isn't quite as

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.030
quantifiable as the
number of representatives

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:04.230
in the house in November?

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:05.160
ANNIE DUKE: Sure.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.290
So everything can be quantified.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:09.110
The chances that you--

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:10.690
because everything
is probabilistic.

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:13.420
Like, the chances that you meet
the love of your life tomorrow

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.545
or that the person that
you stay with, you'll still

01:07:15.545 --> 01:07:17.190
be with in 10 years,
or whether you're

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:19.440
going to like the dish that
you order at a restaurant,

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.190
or literally, everything
is quantifiable.

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:28.440
Now do we have enough data
to get to flipping heads

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.387
or tails where we
know 50% of the time

01:07:32.387 --> 01:07:33.720
that you're going to flip heads?

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.760
No.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.020
Is there some objective
probability for anything?

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:38.520
Sure.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.540
Do we have access to it?

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.440
Absolutely not.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.590
But we can come up with a range.

01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:45.342
So what people will
say to me is often,

01:07:45.342 --> 01:07:46.800
well, it's not
really quantifiable.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.760
Well, of course it is.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.760
It's just that there's
more unknown information.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.050
It's harder to get to.

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:54.040
We don't have as much data.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.560
So what I tell them is, look.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.160
Let's say that I were to ask you
some question about, well, what

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.700
do you think the chances are
that this belief that you have

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.860
is true, and the
best you could do

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.670
is somewhere
between 20% and 80%.

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.401
That's a really wide market.

01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:10.150
But you know what?

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:12.210
It's not as wide as 0% to 100%.

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:14.160
Like, at least you're trying.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:14.980
That's the thing.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.740
So even if you
say, I don't know,

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.680
I can narrow it down
to between 20% and 80%,

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.800
that's not a failure.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.100
That's a success,
because you're trying.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:27.540
And then what that does is
because you say, well, OK,

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.279
it's 20% to 80%,
man, I'd really like

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:33.689
to try to refine that, you'll
now start to go ask people.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:36.240
Like, you're going to go
start asking for information.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.560
Whereas if you just
sort of leave it as,

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.976
like, whatever,
you don't actually

01:08:38.976 --> 01:08:40.540
ever try to get better at it.

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.319
So now maybe you go and
you start researching.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:43.920
You know what?

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.335
I make a joke in literally
every single talk that I give.

01:08:46.335 --> 01:08:48.960
I say, what this does for you is
it makes you take out and look

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.804
at Google.

01:08:49.804 --> 01:08:50.970
You guys will be very happy.

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:53.580
But literally, it's a joke
in every talk that I give.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.109
It makes you want
to Google things.

01:08:56.109 --> 01:08:57.850
But it makes you want
to Google things.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:00.824
So now you start Googling,
and maybe you say, oh, OK.

01:09:00.824 --> 01:09:01.740
Now I'm narrowed down.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.970
It's between 72% and--

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:04.470
right.

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:07.290
So like, that's what
happens, you know?

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:09.880
Now it's 72-28.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.430
And now you're a little
bit narrower than 80-20.

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.770
And that's all
we're trying to do.

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:16.979
But if we don't think about
things probabilistically,

01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:19.229
if we don't
recognize that what's

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:22.080
going to happen in the
future is probabilistic,

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.930
that we can't guarantee it,
we are not playing chess.

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:27.990
If I play better than you,
it does not mean I win.

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.770
Not in life.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:30.060
Only in chess.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:30.769
Right?

01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:32.310
If we don't do that,
then we're going

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:34.439
to be really surprised
when a bad outcome happens.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:36.550
We're going to overreact to it.

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:39.210
We're going to start changing
strategy when we shouldn't.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:42.029
We're going to reinforce
strategies that we shouldn't.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:43.830
We're going to always
be reacting instead

01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:47.370
of planning ahead, instead
of being proactive,

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:50.130
because we're not understanding
that, well, other things could

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:53.490
happen than the thing
that we think, you know?

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:55.920
So I think just try.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.120
Because literally,
everything's quantifiable.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.290
SPEAKER 1: Where were you
at Black Friday in 2011?

01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:07.715
And what are your thoughts
on regulating online poker?

01:10:07.715 --> 01:10:08.340
ANNIE DUKE: Oh.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.798
OK, that's an
interesting question.

01:10:09.798 --> 01:10:11.370
So I remember this.

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:14.520
I was in my bedroom,
and I got a call.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.150
You should open up the
internet, and you should look.

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:20.460
So Black Friday is the
DOJ came down and shut

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.660
down all of online poker.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.160
It was a very bad day for poker.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.060
Everybody was really mad.

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:26.559
It was really hard.

01:10:26.559 --> 01:10:28.350
Like, in a lot of ways,
the poker community

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:30.220
hasn't recovered from it.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.110
So it was kind of interesting,
because I played in '90s,

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:39.000
and poker money was not
raining down from the sky.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.670
There was a very small group
of people who were playing,

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.500
and then you'd
sometimes have someone

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.420
who came in and would play.

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:48.030
And you know, it was
really like you were--

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:49.890
it was called grinding.

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:52.350
And then online poker happened
with the collision of poker

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:56.100
on TV, and the poker
economy just boomed.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.930
I mean, boomed.

01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:00.990
It was really just money
raining down from the sky.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.810
And then the DOJ
on Black Friday--

01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:05.480
now it all contracts.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.830
And that was really hard.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.320
I think it was less
hard for the people who

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.080
had been playing in the '90s,
because I think we sort of saw

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.590
the luck in what had happened
during the 2000s a little bit

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:16.910
more.

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:20.700
But it's like, whenever anything
goes through a big recession--

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.670
and I would call
it a depression--

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:24.230
it's painful.

01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:27.800
Like, it's super, super,
super, super painful.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.480
You know, in terms of whether
there should be regulation,

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.180
you know, I'm somewhat small
government, but I'm also--

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.580
I like people to
have protections.

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.220
So I did testify in
front of Congress

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.890
twice about
regulation, and I tend

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:48.830
to be more on the sort of free,
freer side of that discussion,

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:51.080
you know, that you should
let adults choose what they

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.044
want to do, and then
obviously make sure

01:11:53.044 --> 01:11:54.710
that there isn't fraud
occurring, right?

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:58.480
So you should always have
protections against fraud.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.370
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.745
AUDIENCE: What
resonated with me,

01:12:00.745 --> 01:12:03.240
you questioned the status quo.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.276
I think it's great, because it
gives you a lot of opportunity

01:12:06.276 --> 01:12:08.400
to see options in life all
the time instead of just

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.441
going with what you have.

01:12:09.441 --> 01:12:12.280
But also, I have the feeling
it's a risky business,

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:12.780
you know?

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:16.670
You can invest a lot of time in
always questioning your status

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:17.820
quo.

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.490
And instead of focusing on
what you're doing and trusting

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:22.410
your decisions you
made in the past.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:24.820
And how do you find
the balance, you know?

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.100
And you seem to have been
going good places with it.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.370
So do you set yourself,
you know, [INAUDIBLE]??

01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:32.530
Oh, I'm questioning where I'm
at in life next month from now?

01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:35.190
Or do you two minutes later
when you're on the wrong line?

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:37.440
I mean, you know, how much
time do you invest in that?

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.066
It's a bet too.

01:12:38.066 --> 01:12:39.898
ANNIE DUKE: I think
there's a couple things.

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:42.190
I think certainly from
a business standpoint,

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:43.080
we always go--

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.630
you know, there's always
strategic planning sessions.

01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:47.200
And I think that
when we do that,

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.230
it's always around,
what's the new decision?

01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:51.688
And what doesn't get included
in there is, well, what about

01:12:51.688 --> 01:12:52.990
sticking with what we're doing?

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:56.429
So I think that we tend to get
involved in strategic planning

01:12:56.429 --> 01:12:58.470
decisions generally when
there's something wrong,

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:01.545
and you should actually set
a calendar for, all right.

01:13:01.545 --> 01:13:04.604
Let's start thinking about, what
are our goals, regardless of

01:13:04.604 --> 01:13:07.020
whether we think something is
wrong, because maybe there's

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:07.936
a better way to do it.

01:13:10.461 --> 01:13:11.960
And actually, working
backwards is--

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.130
so something called
backcasting and pre-mortems is

01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:15.129
the best way to do that.

01:13:15.129 --> 01:13:16.890
So imagine what your goal is.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.020
Think about that you've
actually reached it.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.010
This is a backcast.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:22.680
And then think about
how you actually did it.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.920
So it's three years from
now and we accomplished X.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.810
How did we do that?

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:30.010
But then also a pre-mortem
is, it's three years from now

01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:30.900
and we failed.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.379
You know, how did that happen?

01:13:32.379 --> 01:13:34.920
And I think that allows you to
see the landscape a little bit

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.780
better.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.540
What I would say in terms
of, are you doing it too much

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.801
or are you doing it too
little, there's two things

01:13:44.801 --> 01:13:46.050
that I want to say about that.

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:47.610
One is that I
certainly don't think

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:50.970
that every decision
is supposed to be

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:52.377
done as a deliberative process.

01:13:52.377 --> 01:13:54.960
If you did that, I wouldn't be
able to get from here to there,

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:55.460
right?

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.425
So a lot of stuff
that's happening

01:13:57.425 --> 01:13:59.550
is certainly more gut, and
it's more in the moment.

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.620
And I think that
that's totally fine, as

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.260
long as you hold your intuition
accountable to a deliberative

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.830
process at some point.

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:08.340
So when somebody
says to you, well,

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.640
why did you do what you did,
your answer should never be,

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.832
because my gut told me to.

01:14:13.832 --> 01:14:15.540
And then when they
say, OK, that's great,

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:19.350
but why, it shouldn't be, I told
you, because my gut told me to.

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:22.240
If you can't teach it to another
person, there's a problem.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.904
So that being said,
I think intuition

01:14:23.904 --> 01:14:25.320
can be very good
as long as you're

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.080
checking it occasionally.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.320
But in terms of whether
you should have a schedule,

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.080
I think once you start
thinking about the world more

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.570
probabilistically,
you're naturally

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:38.220
examining those things.

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.590
And it's happening
relatively automatically,

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:43.359
and you do end up sticking
with the status quo a lot.

01:14:43.359 --> 01:14:45.900
It's just that you're sort of
seeing these opportunities over

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.142
on the side more.

01:14:47.142 --> 01:14:48.600
Now what's interesting
is that when

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.220
you do that, you
don't just overreact,

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.910
and just because things
aren't going well right now,

01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:56.969
you're actually less likely,
I think, to change course.

01:14:56.969 --> 01:14:59.010
Because I think that a
lot of our changing course

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:02.970
is a reaction to the way
that the status quo is now.

01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:05.920
It's a reaction to
having a bad outcome.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.920
And a lot of not changing
course is that we just

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.396
happen to have good outcomes.

01:15:09.396 --> 01:15:11.520
So I think that what happens
is that when you start

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.860
thinking in this way
more probabilistically,

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:16.170
even if you have good
outcomes, you're always

01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:18.144
sort of working with
your decision group of,

01:15:18.144 --> 01:15:19.560
like, well, is
there a better way?

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.226
That doesn't necessarily
mean you do it.

01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:24.000
It just means it's in
your head so that you're

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.920
more likely to see
the opportunity when

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.980
it comes your way.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.438
But what's more
important is you're

01:15:28.438 --> 01:15:31.680
less likely to overreact
to a bad outcome happening

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.636
where you actually
change course too much.

01:15:33.636 --> 01:15:35.760
And I would actually say
that interestingly enough,

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.330
that that second problem is
what the bigger problem is.

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.927
It's not so much that
if you think this way,

01:15:42.927 --> 01:15:45.260
you're going to be going left,
right, left, right, left,

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:46.050
right.

01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:48.660
It's that you're not
going to be just going

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.880
left because bad things
are happening all the time.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.463
You're going to be setting back
into a more deliberative place

01:15:53.463 --> 01:15:55.886
on those things that's
actually going to either cause

01:15:55.886 --> 01:15:57.510
you to make sort of
incremental changes

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:58.885
that are going to
be really good,

01:15:58.885 --> 01:16:01.290
it's going to cause you to be
able to anticipate or think

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.459
about paradigm shifts
yourself a little bit better.

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:05.250
And I think it's going
to actually give you

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:10.170
a smoother ride much more
so than a less smooth ride.

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:10.730
I don't know.

01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:13.020
See now you might go and
say, no, she should actually

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.140
get into that limo.

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:17.460
Does that answer your question?

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.815
AUDIENCE: No, I mean, it
was good to hear your view

01:16:19.815 --> 01:16:23.112
on the other side [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:24.530
So I'd like to hear that too.

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.600
ANNIE DUKE: Yeah, no,
I'm all for status quo.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.125
AUDIENCE: Once you start
doing it, you see the success,

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:30.000
and you are always
questioning your decisions

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.084
you made yesterday, right?

01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:32.041
ANNIE DUKE: Well, yeah.

01:16:32.041 --> 01:16:33.050
So I think it's like--

01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:34.220
again, it has to do-- right.

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.080
It has to do with
separating those--

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.090
don't pat yourself--
I sort of say,

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:40.360
don't get so down on yourself
for your bad outcomes,

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.110
and don't pat yourself
on the back so hard

01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:43.590
for your good ones.

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:45.650
So here's a really
great way, actually,

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:48.180
to implement within
your own life.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.860
It's like, once a week,
have your team get together.

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.835
Each person presents
the best success

01:16:53.835 --> 01:16:56.210
that they had that week, and
everybody talks about, like,

01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:57.770
they have to offer
up the five things

01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:01.290
that they did wrong along
the way to that success.

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:04.070
So it's not about
changing course, right?

01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:06.560
It's more about refining,
about always trying

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.239
to do a little bit better.

01:17:08.239 --> 01:17:10.280
And I think that when you
have that goal in mind,

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.446
I think you do a lot better.

01:17:11.446 --> 01:17:14.949
Because otherwise, what makes
us make these big left turns?

01:17:14.949 --> 01:17:16.490
I mean, I've got a
couple in my life.

01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:20.335
But you know, what makes us make
these big left turns, I think,

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.710
is when we're
reacting to the way

01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:24.080
that things are--
we're just reacting.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.260
So when you're trying to
separate those two things out

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:32.220
and always be trying to focus
on process, now what happens

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:35.880
is you're less likely to be
making these 90-degree changes,

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.459
I think.

01:17:37.459 --> 01:17:39.000
SPEAKER 1: I have
an online question.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.640
What is your approach to
the mental game of poker

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.610
when running bad, when our
emotions can potentially

01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:46.590
influence our thought process?

01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:48.180
Can you compare
that to the advice

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:52.320
offered by Jared Tendler and his
popular "Mental Game of Poker"

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.110
books?

01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:55.090
ANNIE DUKE: OK, so I
haven't read those books,

01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:56.980
so I can't make the comparison.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:00.410
But I can answer the first
part of the question.

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.910
OK.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:03.670
So there's something in
poker called tilt. Tilt is

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:07.780
when our emotions get lit up.

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:11.170
That shuts your
frontal cortex down,

01:18:11.170 --> 01:18:15.050
and we start making
really bad decisions.

01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:19.900
So I say, poker has this really
interesting quality of you're

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:23.800
exchanging chips
every single hand.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.640
And so it's letting
you see that there's

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.030
risk in every single decision.

01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:30.490
So that's the good thing.

01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:34.400
The bad thing is it's allowing
you to get caught in the path,

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:34.900
right?

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:37.094
So if you think about
it, I mean, obviously,

01:18:37.094 --> 01:18:39.010
what we'd really like
is to think of ourselves

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:41.380
as a Berkshire
Hathaway stock, right?

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.770
We want a general upward
trend to our happiness stock

01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:47.390
over our lifetime.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.840
And if you look at
Berkshire Hathaway

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.340
from the moment
of its inception,

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.720
it has that general
upward trend,

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.929
and it looks like a
pretty nice little ride.

01:18:54.929 --> 01:18:56.470
But if you look at
it on a given day,

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.310
it might have a sharp downturn.

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:00.784
And in poker, because
you've got this exchange

01:19:00.784 --> 01:19:02.200
happening all the
time, you end up

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.970
doing what's called
ticker watching,

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:05.860
and you can really
see those downswings,

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.730
and you can really
feel those upswings.

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:10.180
And so you start getting
yanked around in this kind

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:13.105
of path-dependent--

01:19:13.105 --> 01:19:14.980
you know, you're very
path-dependent in terms

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.020
of where your emotions are.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.240
And this is generally a
problem in life, right?

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.960
So as an example, let's say that
you're on the side of the road

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.930
and you have a flat
tire, and it's raining

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:28.180
and it's really cold, and
you don't have a jack,

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.780
and you called AAA, and
you know they take forever.

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.940
And so you're just
cursing your life, right?

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.180
You're just thinking, like,
I have the unhappiest life.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.830
I can't even imagine it.

01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:40.600
Why do these things
always happen to me?

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.237
Ugh.

01:19:41.237 --> 01:19:43.570
Do you think it matters if
yo got a promotion three days

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:44.170
before?

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.740
Are you like, now
hold on a second.

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:47.890
Let me actually take the
average of my happiness--

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:49.180
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:51.210
--over the last three days.

01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:52.144
No.

01:19:52.144 --> 01:19:53.560
It's like, literally
what happened

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.330
three days ago doesn't matter.

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.460
You're really deep
down in that moment.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.700
So this actually gives us a
clue to how we deal with this,

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.810
and it's part of how poker
players deal with it.

01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:04.480
So if I were to say
to you, OK, let's

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.166
say that you had that
flat tire a year ago,

01:20:07.166 --> 01:20:08.540
do you think that
that would have

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.330
affected your happiness
one bit over the course

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:12.380
of the last year?

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.779
That one incident?

01:20:14.779 --> 01:20:16.820
To tell you the truth, I
actually think it would.

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.890
I think it would uptick.

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:20.015
I think it would cause an
uptick in your happiness,

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:23.130
because it's a really
good cocktail party story.

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:26.430
Interesting articles that I've
seen, a lot of current events

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:31.599
and thinking about it in terms
of resulting or hindsight bias

01:20:31.599 --> 01:20:33.390
or self-serving bias
or motivated reasoning

01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:35.631
or whatever it might be
to really kind of look at,

01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:37.380
what are the things
that are happening out

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:39.000
in the world that can help
us to try to figure out how

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.830
to be better decision makers?

01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:45.180
So like this week, for
example, I talked a little bit

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:49.200
about the NFL draft and decision
making around the NFL draft.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.990
I also talked about a really
interesting study that

01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:55.590
was done on inducing
intellectual humility

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:59.760
in high school students, and
how that actually increases

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.060
their ability to
learn, to really get

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.665
into that sort of
mode of, I'm not sure.

01:21:05.665 --> 01:21:06.540
So that was in there.

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.120
I talked about something
from [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.906
on the peak-end rule, and how
you can hack that in order

01:21:11.906 --> 01:21:14.280
to make your memories better
and your experiences better,

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.400
or at least your memory of
your experiences better.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.270
And then I'll also talk
about things that--

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:23.100
not in this particular
one, but last week,

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.683
I think I talked
about current events,

01:21:24.683 --> 01:21:26.832
things that are
happening in politics,

01:21:26.832 --> 01:21:27.790
and that kind of thing.

01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:29.750
So hopefully, people will
subscribe to the newsletter.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:32.040
You can actually find
archives of the newsletter

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.220
on annieduke.com.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.730
So you don't have to buy
it until you actually

01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:36.480
test the product.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.409
So you can go see--

01:21:37.409 --> 01:21:39.492
SPEAKER 1: And when are
you starting your podcast?

01:21:39.492 --> 01:21:40.356
[LAUGH]

01:21:40.356 --> 01:21:42.780
Because I think you'd do
a great job doing that.

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:44.830
ANNIE DUKE: Well,
I appreciate that.

01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:47.580
So I'm not-- so I've
had that suggestion.

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.750
I'm thinking about it.

01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:50.790
Right now because of
the launch of the book,

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:54.000
I'm doing a lot of
podcasts, and so I'm

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.340
kind of enjoying
that at the moment.

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.880
I've done some really,
really fun ones.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.219
And actually, it's exposed
me to a bunch of podcasts

01:22:02.219 --> 01:22:04.260
that I didn't know about,
so that's been actually

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.230
super fun is that I'm getting
to find out about some podcasts

01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:09.210
that I wasn't
personally aware of.

01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:11.087
I love podcasts,
because I think--

01:22:11.087 --> 01:22:13.170
I mean, some of them are
obviously like, you know,

01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:14.540
your 15-minute deals.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.270
But the ones that are
more like this where

01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:19.420
you get to do a deep dive.

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:21.750
And then what I find that's
so amazing about them

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.750
is that I rarely come
away from a podcast where

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:26.610
I haven't learned something.

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:28.770
I mean, not just
one thing either.

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:33.870
Like, so much where you get to
sit and talk to somebody who's

01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:35.940
obviously really smart
and really engaged,

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:42.290
and see what their perspective
on your product is, is so cool.

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:47.770
And it's just like, such
gratitude for how it changed--

01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:50.420
like, you come in and
you're like, well,

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:51.530
this is my work product.

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:54.690
And then you come away
going, oh my gosh.

01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:57.310
Like, I didn't think of that,
and I was so challenged,

01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:59.680
and that makes me think
about it in a different way.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.490
And oh, this relates
to this in a way

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:03.077
that I hadn't thought before.

01:23:03.077 --> 01:23:04.910
So I'm just enjoying
that process right now,

01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:05.750
and then we'll see.

01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:06.300
I don't know.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.520
We'll see what the future holds
in terms of anything else.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:08.800
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.120
Well, if you haven't
already, grab her book.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.460
It's called "Thinking in
Bets: Making Smarter Decisions

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.290
When You Don't Have
All the Facts."

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.604
If we can give her, please,
a huge round of applause.

01:23:17.604 --> 01:23:18.520
ANNIE DUKE: Thank you.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:23.070
[APPLAUSE]
