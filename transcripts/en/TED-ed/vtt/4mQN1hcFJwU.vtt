00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Every day we are bombarded on all platforms of media

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
with personal stories that span the continuum

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
from the embarrassing and the trivial

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to the dire and the critical.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The foodie posting photos of every plate of lasagna he orders,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the Iranian blogger describing the shooting death

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of Nedā Āghā-Soltān.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Authentic narrative is the glue that connects people,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
providing a compelling reason to keep reading.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It makes the personal universal,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
transcends the individual,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and makes a story timeless and humanistic.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
How, as a journalist, do you ask the questions

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that yield this type of narrative?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You have to know what to ask of whom.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
First you need to understand that every piece of journalism

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
requires a trifecta of sourcing.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If you picture the reporting process as depicted by a triangle,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
one side will be official sources,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
another side will be overview sources,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and a third side will be unofficial sources.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
All three components are necessary in every well-reported piece.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The first side has official sources.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Those are the people with titles and expertise,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
who own the company; are spokespeople for the movement.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
They tell you the numbers, and the answers

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to how much, how many, where, when, and who.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
A second side of the triangle includes overview sources:

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
academics, consultants, authors,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
who are not directly connected as stakeholders,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but have knowledge of the big picture.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Yet it is the third side of the trifecta - unofficial sources -

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
who hold the power of the individual's insight.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is where you can find the why,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Giving consequence on the event, trend, phase, or idea

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and what it means on a soul level to someone affected by it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So how do you mine for the gems,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
identifying what is compelling from what is chatter?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You ask surprising questions.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
To achieve the complicated, fragile human connection,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you regard the stories of every subject as sacred.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Realize that an anecdote is oxygen

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that breathes life into a grey story of exposition,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
facts and data.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What the surgeon did at home the morning he operated on a woman's brain tumor.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
How it feels to dream and train for the Olympics for a lifetime.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
There are times when it is important to convey information quickly,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to present bulleted facts and updates.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
When a situation is urgent, when action is required now,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
when you need to know where the tornado will hit,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
how fast the fire is spreading, and if it will reach your home today.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But the narrative personal stories

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that contribute to the buffet of journalism

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
are pieces that have the luxury of a slow dance of information.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It is this artful solicitation of story

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that will make the journalism memorable

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.986
and will deliver the narrative bond that will connect us to each other.
