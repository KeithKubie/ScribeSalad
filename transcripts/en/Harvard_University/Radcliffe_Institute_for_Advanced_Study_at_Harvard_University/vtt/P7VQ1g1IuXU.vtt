[FILM REEL WHIRRING]

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.770
- So this was the first
folder that I pulled,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.030
and this is a folder
that is a bill of sale.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.590
And it's a bill of sale for a
woman whose name was Thankfull.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.390
And her name only shows up
on this bill of sale once,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.000
and it's Thankfull, Negro wench.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.260
And what was most powerful
and upsetting about this

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.620
was that here, I was
holding a document that

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.730
held the legal bonds
of another person.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.600
And this document was
creased, and folded,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.170
and I thought to myself, how
precious this document would

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.430
have been if Thankfull
could have gotten it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.770
and destroyed it.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.060
And how this document
had to be held in a place

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.840
where she couldn't get it.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.689
And when I look at
all these folds,

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.730
what did they do after
they signed this contract?

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.563
Did he fold it up and
put in his back pocket

00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:25.650
and take Thankfull with him?

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.290
And then what
happened to Thankfull?

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.850
And that is something
that I don't know.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.080
And unless this
document survives,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.800
nobody recognizes the
individual experience

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.360
of those that have
been enslaved.
