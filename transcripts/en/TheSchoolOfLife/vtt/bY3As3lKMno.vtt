00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.440
One of the key desires of love

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.820
is the wish to help another person

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.460
but an intention doesn't always or automatically translate

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.840
into a ready capacity for true assistance

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.460
Picture a five-year-old

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.260
who's stumbled into his parents bedroom

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.260
and surprised his mother crying

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.020
She's normally so strong and ready with help for him

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.380
Now he longs to do something to staunch the tears but he's at sea

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.240
The sobs might be about the mortgage,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.840
a turbulent time at work, or

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.520
an argument with her partner

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.800
But all these aren't for a child to grasp

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.980
He sweetly suggest a glass of water

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.800
and pipes up that he might run downstairs to get Knitted Rabbit

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.000
The impulse to help floats logically free

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540
of any actual ability to do so

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.440
Two people can long to be supportive and generous towards one another

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.040
and yet lack all the skills to deliver on their good intentions

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.680
and therefore end up feeling isolated, resentful, and unloved

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.060
We cause ourselves trouble because we're too slow to recognize an odd, largely unmentioned phenomenon:

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.980
how varied and particular our notions of help can be

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.880
We take our own preferred style of being soothed as the natural starting point for how to soothe others

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.620
but when we're wrong and our partner’s original distress is compounded by their sense of having been ignored or insulted,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.320
we take them to be ungrateful and cruel and vow never to attempt to be kind again

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:39.900
An urgent task is therefore to try to understand the particular way in which we, and our partner, need love to be delivered in order to feel that it is real

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.100
We might be types who, when we're sad or in difficulties, need first and foremost to speak

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.700
What we say may not be entirely sequential

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.900
We might go back over things a few times and omit to cap our stories with neat endings

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.380
But that might not matter because what we want above all from a partner when we're suffering

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.620
is that they sit with us, at length, and listen

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.940
We want them to signal their engagement with their eyes but not with their mouths,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.240
to register our anger, to observe our disappointment,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.740
and at most, at opportune moments to prompt us with a ‘Go on…’ or a small supportive sound

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.740
Yet what we absolutely don’t want: answers, solutions or analyses,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.860
for them to open their wallets, to give us a plan, or to rush to fill in our silences

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.940
We want them to sit listening because the real problem we need assistance with

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.760
isn’t so much the specific issue we are mentioning

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.120
(the parking ticket, the in-laws, the delayed delivery)

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.300
It’s the overarching sense that most people we encounter

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.060
can’t really be bothered to take the time to imagine themselves correctly into our lives

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.080
Perhaps there was a history to this:

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.840
our parents might have been practically minded, busy and successful

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.380
but somehow rather callous and distracted

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.500
in the way they sought always and immediately to push our difficulties out of the way with logic

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.540
Now we feel how an immediate ‘solution’ can be an excuse for not listening to the problem

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.040
That’s why just being heard feels like the quintessence of love

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.840
We might almost deliberately take our time,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.580
go back over points our partner [...]

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.640
go back over points our partner had thought were finished

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.360
and re-explore a jagged bit of our story, not to mislead,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.200
but because such rehearsals create the backdrop

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.360
for the only style of help we crave and trust:

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.240
receptive, quiet attention

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.120
Then again, at another end of the spectrum,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.700
love might not feel real

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.200
unless it's accompanied by precise and concrete solutions

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.280
Vague sympathy is worthless

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.480
We might want to hear a flow of ideas as to what we should do next,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.640
what sort of strategy we should deploy,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.480
whom we might call, and how we can get answers

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.720
It’s all very well for someone to say they feel our pain;

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.420
we would prefer a plan

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.860
Love is a sheet of paper with a list of bullet points in your partner’s handwriting

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.900
In addition,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.100
we might not be averse to evidence that our partner has spent some money on our problems,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.420
time isn’t a currency we respect

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.380
We might want them to pay for an accountant or a lawyer

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.660
or offer an evening in an expensive restaurant

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.700
After an economically fragile childhood, to feel really helped, we might long for evidence of financial outlay;

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.040
we can’t be reassured just by what someone says

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.740
We've built up a residual suspicion and distrust around lone verbal offerings

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.200
We remember how nice it was

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.420
when an elderly relative unexpectedly gave us

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.520
a very well-chosen present when we were nine and in hospital after a bad fall

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.360
They never said very much to us

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.040
(perhaps they were rather shy)

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.440
but this gesture truly touched us

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.720
We felt sure of their kindness – as if for the first time

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.400
when we learnt just how much the present had cost

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.660
Differently again, when we divulge our agonies,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.860
our priority may just be to hear that everything will eventually be okay

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.440
We don’t mind a little bit of exaggeration

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.600
Despair strikes us as cheap, reasons to give up are always obvious

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.520
For us, love is a species of hope

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.340
Or, alternatively, it’s hope that may be enraging

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.800
What calms us down is a quiet walk around the prospect of catastrophe

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.960
We don’t want to be alone in our fears

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.640
We long for someone to explore the grimmest possibilities with bleak sangfroid:

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.840
to mention prison, insolvency, front page headlines and the grave….

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.200
Only when our partner is ready to match our most forbidding analyses

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.700
can we be reassured we’re not in the hands of a callous sentimentalist,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.400
rather someone honest enough to see the dangers and to worry about them as much as we do

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.360
and perhaps stick with us while we serve out the prison sentence

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.500
A cuddle can sound to some like a petty response to bad news,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.540
but for us it can be the most reliable evidence of heartfelt love

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.680
To help our minds, we need someone first to reassure our bodies,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.240
to hold us tightly and quietly while we close our eyes in pain and surrender to their firm embrace

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.660
Help in adulthood may for others be associated with the gift of insight,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.320
but for us, it is touch that soothes

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.120
We're picking up on memories of early childhood

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.840
Wise parents know that a distressed child doesn't need a lesson or a lecture;

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.180
they should be laid down on the bed, held, and their head stroked by a giant, soft adult hand

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.260
The misfortune lies in how easily we can irritate with the wrong offer of love

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.100
and in turn, how quickly we can be offended when our efforts at loving go unappreciated

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:41.100
Recognizing that there are different styles of help, at least alerts us to the severe risks of misunderstanding

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.640
Instead of getting annoyed at our lover’s inept and sometimes wildly misdirected efforts,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.380
we can grasp  – perhaps for the first time

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.760
– the basic truth that these blundering companions are in fact attempting to be nice

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.960
In turn, the clearest clue of the kind of help our partner wants is the help they offer us

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.120
It seems love can’t remain at the level of intentions alone:

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.420
it must involve constant strenuous efforts to translate our wishes

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:17.480
into interventions truly aligned with the psychology and history of another human being
