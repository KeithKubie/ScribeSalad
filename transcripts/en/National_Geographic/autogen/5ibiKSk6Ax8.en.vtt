roughly six weeks and they're weaned at
 

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.140
roughly six weeks and they're weaned at
roughly six months obviously there's a

roughly six months obviously there's a
 

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.030
roughly six months obviously there's a
lot of variation especially with the

lot of variation especially with the
 

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.910

last two figures for weaning and for
 

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.520
last two figures for weaning and for
being introduced to the pride but you'll

being introduced to the pride but you'll
 

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.220
being introduced to the pride but you'll
find that they

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.230
find that they
 

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.070
find that they

yet they will in all likelihood have
 

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.470
yet they will in all likelihood have
been using them for around about two

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480
been using them for around about two
 

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.380

many of you wondering are they at risk
 

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.320
many of you wondering are they at risk
and the answer is absolutely they're at

and the answer is absolutely they're at
 

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.570
and the answer is absolutely they're at
risk they are one of the most vulnerable

around far from us but because of the

00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:23.539
around far from us but because of the
 

00:21:23.539 --> 00:21:25.180
around far from us but because of the
the sort of proximity of the brush

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:25.190
the sort of proximity of the brush
 

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.979
the sort of proximity of the brush
packing to the water they're actually

00:21:26.979 --> 00:21:26.989
packing to the water they're actually
 

00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.629
packing to the water they're actually
sitting really close and so we can get

00:21:28.629 --> 00:21:28.639
sitting really close and so we can get
 

00:21:28.639 --> 00:21:30.310
sitting really close and so we can get
these really nice views and you can see

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320
these really nice views and you can see
 

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.229
these really nice views and you can see
how they struggling with the wind this

00:21:32.229 --> 00:21:32.239
how they struggling with the wind this
 

00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:34.539
how they struggling with the wind this
afternoon it is hauling gale that is

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:34.549
afternoon it is hauling gale that is
 

00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:36.580
afternoon it is hauling gale that is
blowing at the moment which is making it

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:36.590
blowing at the moment which is making it
 

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.499
blowing at the moment which is making it
very difficult if you're a bird trying

00:21:38.499 --> 00:21:38.509
very difficult if you're a bird trying
 

00:21:38.509 --> 00:21:41.109
very difficult if you're a bird trying
to balance on a branch like that so

00:21:41.109 --> 00:21:41.119
to balance on a branch like that so
 

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:43.180
to balance on a branch like that so
their feathers are designed to kind of

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.190
their feathers are designed to kind of
 

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.279
their feathers are designed to kind of
catch wind and so these guys are being

00:21:45.279 --> 00:21:45.289
catch wind and so these guys are being
 

00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:48.190
catch wind and so these guys are being
blown about all over the place at the

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200
blown about all over the place at the
 

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.289
blown about all over the place at the
moment which is nice when they are

00:21:50.289 --> 00:21:50.299
moment which is nice when they are
 

00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:57.450
moment which is nice when they are
flying but when they push not so nice

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:57.460
 
 

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.799
 
now Lily's eight years old wants to know

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:02.809
now Lily's eight years old wants to know
 

00:22:02.809 --> 00:22:06.339
now Lily's eight years old wants to know
what gives the bird its shiny feathers I

00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:06.349
what gives the bird its shiny feathers I
 

00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:08.200
what gives the bird its shiny feathers I
think that's what I got from all of that

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.210
think that's what I got from all of that
 

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.999
think that's what I got from all of that
all the gloss on this particular bird

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:10.009
all the gloss on this particular bird
 

00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:12.129
all the gloss on this particular bird
and you probably find that there's a

00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:12.139
and you probably find that there's a
 

00:22:12.139 --> 00:22:14.320
and you probably find that there's a
couple of things there so one is

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:14.330
couple of things there so one is
 

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.560
couple of things there so one is
feathers themselves contain certain

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:17.570
feathers themselves contain certain
 

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.229
feathers themselves contain certain
pigments within them so types of cells

00:22:20.229 --> 00:22:20.239
pigments within them so types of cells
 

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:23.560
pigments within them so types of cells
that are able to reflect light a little

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:23.570
that are able to reflect light a little
 

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.389
that are able to reflect light a little
bit the other thing is is that they all

00:22:25.389 --> 00:22:25.399
bit the other thing is is that they all
 

00:22:25.399 --> 00:22:28.329
bit the other thing is is that they all
have preening oils that will come out of

00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:28.339
have preening oils that will come out of
 

00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:29.619
have preening oils that will come out of
their skin that will often be brushed

00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:29.629
their skin that will often be brushed
 

00:22:29.629 --> 00:22:31.269
their skin that will often be brushed
through that feathery

00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279
through that feathery
 

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:32.619
through that feathery
area and that gives them a little bit

00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:32.629
area and that gives them a little bit
 

00:22:32.629 --> 00:22:33.940
area and that gives them a little bit
more of a glisten but most of it is to

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:33.950
more of a glisten but most of it is to
 

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.829
more of a glisten but most of it is to
do with pigments and so the way that the

00:22:35.829 --> 00:22:35.839
do with pigments and so the way that the
 

00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:37.299
do with pigments and so the way that the
light is hitting those cells and coming

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:37.309
light is hitting those cells and coming
 

00:22:37.309 --> 00:22:39.219
light is hitting those cells and coming
back at our eye is cool using that

00:22:39.219 --> 00:22:39.229
back at our eye is cool using that
 

00:22:39.229 --> 00:22:41.680
back at our eye is cool using that
iridescent kind of gloss to come back at

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:41.690
iridescent kind of gloss to come back at
 

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.849
iridescent kind of gloss to come back at
us it's the same as things like

00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:42.859
us it's the same as things like
 

00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:43.570
us it's the same as things like
starlings

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:43.580
starlings
 

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.639
starlings
that kind of shiny appearance that

00:22:45.639 --> 00:22:45.649
that kind of shiny appearance that
 

00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:48.989
that kind of shiny appearance that
they've got is often due to that reason

00:22:48.989 --> 00:22:48.999
they've got is often due to that reason
 

00:22:48.999 --> 00:22:51.310
they've got is often due to that reason
very cute little birds but now just now

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320
very cute little birds but now just now
 

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.899
very cute little birds but now just now
telling you about our sad story and so

00:22:52.899 --> 00:22:52.909
telling you about our sad story and so
 

00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:54.219
telling you about our sad story and so
I'm gonna use this opportunity given

00:22:54.219 --> 00:22:54.229
I'm gonna use this opportunity given
 

00:22:54.229 --> 00:22:55.930
I'm gonna use this opportunity given
that we've got signal which is going to

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:55.940
that we've got signal which is going to
 

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.139
that we've got signal which is going to
be a rarity at this rate so we went to

00:22:59.139 --> 00:22:59.149
be a rarity at this rate so we went to
 

00:22:59.149 --> 00:23:01.079
be a rarity at this rate so we went to
check for damage Andre and I and we were

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:01.089
check for damage Andre and I and we were
 

00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:03.399
check for damage Andre and I and we were
sulking at our signal issues and we

00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:03.409
sulking at our signal issues and we
 

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:04.749
sulking at our signal issues and we
hadn't found our lipid that we were

00:23:04.749 --> 00:23:04.759
hadn't found our lipid that we were
 

00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:06.219
hadn't found our lipid that we were
looking for and we were generally having

00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:06.229
looking for and we were generally having
 

00:23:06.229 --> 00:23:09.729
looking for and we were generally having
a rather sort of morbid day and it's

00:23:09.729 --> 00:23:09.739
a rather sort of morbid day and it's
 

00:23:09.739 --> 00:23:11.440
a rather sort of morbid day and it's
quite worse because basically what

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:11.450
quite worse because basically what
 

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.269
quite worse because basically what
happened is you ain't - - damn

00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279
happened is you ain't - - damn
 

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:16.359
happened is you ain't - - damn
and Jean ray pointed out quite excitedly

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:16.369
and Jean ray pointed out quite excitedly
 

00:23:16.369 --> 00:23:17.859
and Jean ray pointed out quite excitedly
look there's a little baby hippo that's

00:23:17.859 --> 00:23:17.869
look there's a little baby hippo that's
 

00:23:17.869 --> 00:23:19.960
look there's a little baby hippo that's
sleeping on the bank and so we thought

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:19.970
sleeping on the bank and so we thought
 

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.520
sleeping on the bank and so we thought
so that's very cute and we kind of

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:21.530
so that's very cute and we kind of
 

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.200
so that's very cute and we kind of
looked at it for a bit and then drove on

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.210
looked at it for a bit and then drove on
 

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.610
looked at it for a bit and then drove on
and and really pay too much attention

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:24.620
and and really pay too much attention
 

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.810
and and really pay too much attention
because we're trying to see if we could

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:25.820
because we're trying to see if we could
 

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.580
because we're trying to see if we could
find signal and we got to the little

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:27.590
find signal and we got to the little
 

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.260
find signal and we got to the little
baby hipper and then kind of some part

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:29.270
baby hipper and then kind of some part
 

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.700
baby hipper and then kind of some part
of me I don't know why just didn't

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:30.710
of me I don't know why just didn't
 

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.220
of me I don't know why just didn't
thinking something was right there and

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:33.230
thinking something was right there and
 

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.420
thinking something was right there and
so we drove along and then we stopped

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:34.430
so we drove along and then we stopped
 

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.950
so we drove along and then we stopped
and I said to John right now I need to

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960
and I said to John right now I need to
 

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.180
and I said to John right now I need to
have one more look and so we went and

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.190
have one more look and so we went and
 

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.790
have one more look and so we went and
looked with bynars and we kind of saw

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:39.800
looked with bynars and we kind of saw
 

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.080
looked with bynars and we kind of saw
this little hippo was sitting there and

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.090
this little hippo was sitting there and
 

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.550
this little hippo was sitting there and
there was others that were nudging it

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:42.560
there was others that were nudging it
 

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.590
there was others that were nudging it
and this poor hippo was not moving in a

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600
and this poor hippo was not moving in a
 

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.880
and this poor hippo was not moving in a
city Chandra something's taste pretty

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:45.890
city Chandra something's taste pretty
 

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.860
city Chandra something's taste pretty
wrong here so he went back and means to

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:47.870
wrong here so he went back and means to
 

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.330
wrong here so he went back and means to
go and have a look at what happened and

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:49.340
go and have a look at what happened and
 

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.940
go and have a look at what happened and
it was what's been transpired was

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:51.950
it was what's been transpired was
 

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.190
it was what's been transpired was
probably one of the most roughest and

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200
probably one of the most roughest and
 

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.600
probably one of the most roughest and
hardest things that I've watched in a

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:55.610
hardest things that I've watched in a
 

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.370
hardest things that I've watched in a
long time essentially this poor little

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:57.380
long time essentially this poor little
 

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.800
long time essentially this poor little
baby hippo got violently attacked by

00:23:59.800 --> 00:23:59.810
baby hippo got violently attacked by
 

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.470
baby hippo got violently attacked by
another hippo and it was picked up and

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480
another hippo and it was picked up and
 

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.900
another hippo and it was picked up and
thrown around all over the place and the

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:04.910
thrown around all over the place and the
 

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.250
thrown around all over the place and the
mother tried to defend it they were

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:06.260
mother tried to defend it they were
 

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.990
mother tried to defend it they were
crocodiles that came in and it was

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000
crocodiles that came in and it was
 

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
crocodiles that came in and it was
really quite something to kind of watch

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.010
really quite something to kind of watch
 

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.470
really quite something to kind of watch
this whole process take place and the

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480
this whole process take place and the
 

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.160
this whole process take place and the
poor little baby

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.170
poor little baby
 

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.950
poor little baby
got kind of really badly injured and its

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960
got kind of really badly injured and its
 

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.630
got kind of really badly injured and its
legs got broken and it was a really

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640
legs got broken and it was a really
 

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.160
legs got broken and it was a really
horrible thing to see so I was quite

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.170
horrible thing to see so I was quite
 

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.480
horrible thing to see so I was quite
glad that we didn't have it live and if

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:19.490
glad that we didn't have it live and if
 

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.950
glad that we didn't have it live and if
we had signal issues at that time so I'd

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960
we had signal issues at that time so I'd
 

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.360
we had signal issues at that time so I'd
put a really big dampener on our

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:22.370
put a really big dampener on our
 

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.370
put a really big dampener on our
afternoon yesterday eventually the

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:24.380
afternoon yesterday eventually the
 

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.930
afternoon yesterday eventually the
little baby did succumb to its injuries

female into itsuka she knew he was about
the same size as her and I think she'd

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:48.529
the same size as her and I think she'd
 

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:50.049
the same size as her and I think she'd

unfortunately I once again using signals
 

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.830
unfortunately I once again using signals
so I can't really move from the spots

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840
so I can't really move from the spots
 

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.879
so I can't really move from the spots
which is not very ideal at all and the

00:28:12.879 --> 00:28:12.889
which is not very ideal at all and the
 

00:28:12.889 --> 00:28:15.909
which is not very ideal at all and the
problem with that is that when one can't

00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919
problem with that is that when one can't
 

00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:17.980
problem with that is that when one can't
move its makes life a little bit tricky

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:17.990

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.060

now the big trick here is going to be to
 

00:31:06.879 --> 00:31:09.239
now the big trick here is going to be to
decide whether or not we stay with these

00:31:09.239 --> 00:31:09.249

don't know what to do we'll make that

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:20.529
don't know what to do we'll make that
 

00:31:20.529 --> 00:31:21.810
don't know what to do we'll make that
assessment once we've seen how many

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:21.820
assessment once we've seen how many
 

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.200
assessment once we've seen how many
there are here and what they are doing

colony back in 1898 I think it was 1898
anyway what that did was result in a

00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:03.849
anyway what that did was result in a
 

00:46:03.849 --> 00:46:07.589
anyway what that did was result in a
total exit of the people from this area

00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599
total exit of the people from this area
 

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:09.660
total exit of the people from this area
the Masai lost all their cattle so they

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:09.670
the Masai lost all their cattle so they
 

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:10.410
the Masai lost all their cattle so they
disappeared

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:10.420
disappeared
 

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.809
disappeared
out of the place the loss of the cattle

00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:12.819
out of the place the loss of the cattle
 

00:46:12.819 --> 00:46:15.270
out of the place the loss of the cattle
and the the thickening of the bush

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280
and the the thickening of the bush
 

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.180
and the the thickening of the bush
brought back the tet see fly got very

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:18.190
brought back the tet see fly got very
 

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.069
brought back the tet see fly got very
thick in this area with jetty fly which

00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079
thick in this area with jetty fly which
 

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:21.359
thick in this area with jetty fly which
meant that the cattle and the people

00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:21.369
meant that the cattle and the people
 

00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:23.130
meant that the cattle and the people
didn't come back once the rinderpest had

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:23.140
didn't come back once the rinderpest had
 

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.800
didn't come back once the rinderpest had
gone and there were very low game

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:25.810
gone and there were very low game
 

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.200
gone and there were very low game
numbers at the time and then what

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.210
numbers at the time and then what
 

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:31.829
numbers at the time and then what
happened was probably around about the

00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839
happened was probably around about the
 

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:34.620
happened was probably around about the
1930s also the elephant started to come

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:34.630
1930s also the elephant started to come
 

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:37.140
1930s also the elephant started to come
and come back and they started to clear

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:37.150
and come back and they started to clear
 

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.809
and come back and they started to clear
out the bush a little bit and there was

00:46:39.809 --> 00:46:39.819
out the bush a little bit and there was
 

00:46:39.819 --> 00:46:43.950
out the bush a little bit and there was
also there was a band somewhere around

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960
also there was a band somewhere around
 

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.760
also there was a band somewhere around
the mid 20th century on hunting in the

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:47.770
the mid 20th century on hunting in the
 

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:49.530
the mid 20th century on hunting in the
area and so the elephants were left

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:49.540
area and so the elephants were left
 

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.800
area and so the elephants were left
alone to deal with the kind of to deal

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:52.810
alone to deal with the kind of to deal
 

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.660
alone to deal with the kind of to deal
with the space and that's what they did

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:54.670
with the space and that's what they did
 

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:56.550
with the space and that's what they did
and the elephant started to clear away

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560
and the elephant started to clear away
 

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.650
and the elephant started to clear away
the thickening bush that said see fly

00:46:58.650 --> 00:46:58.660
the thickening bush that said see fly
 

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.720
the thickening bush that said see fly
disappeared from in air from areas like

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:00.730
disappeared from in air from areas like
 

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:02.400

this dust will occur in the woodland

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:02.410
this dust will occur in the woodland

about 1970 or so they reckon that the

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440
about 1970 or so they reckon that the

ville de beast and zebra numbers reached
 

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.730
ville de beast and zebra numbers reached
their current number so they haven't

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:35.740
their current number so they haven't
 

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.820
their current number so they haven't
changed a huge amount since the 70s so

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:38.830
changed a huge amount since the 70s so
 

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.670
changed a huge amount since the 70s so
the whole point of that story is that

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680
the whole point of that story is that
 

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.980
the whole point of that story is that
this is yes it's a wilderness but it is

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:43.990
this is yes it's a wilderness but it is
 

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:46.920
this is yes it's a wilderness but it is
very heavily influenced by man and also

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:46.930
very heavily influenced by man and also
 

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.310
very heavily influenced by man and also
by that other supreme ecosystem

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:49.320
by that other supreme ecosystem
 

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.470
by that other supreme ecosystem
architect the elephant and also the

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480
architect the elephant and also the
 

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.970
architect the elephant and also the
interesting thing about that story is

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:53.980
interesting thing about that story is
 

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.250
interesting thing about that story is
that people tend to think of this great

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:56.260
that people tend to think of this great
 

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.880
that people tend to think of this great

current one isn't it's only about 50
years old 40 or 50 years old which is

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:04.930
years old 40 or 50 years old which is
 

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.020
years old 40 or 50 years old which is
quite interesting in its current form

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:07.030
quite interesting in its current form
 

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.230
quite interesting in its current form
that animals migrated these Plains in

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240
that animals migrated these Plains in
 

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.630
that animals migrated these Plains in
the dim mists of prehistory is almost

the dim mists of prehistory is almost
 

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.120
the dim mists of prehistory is almost
certain but the current migrations

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.130
certain but the current migrations
 

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.160

years old they're quite interesting I

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:18.850
years old they're quite interesting I
 

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:24.240

think so there are the Lions they're

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:24.250
think so there are the Lions they're
 

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:30.910
think so there are the Lions they're
still there

eye grass to hide in amongst yes it is

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:03.170
eye grass to hide in amongst yes it is
 

01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:10.450
eye grass to hide in amongst yes it is
but it doesn't mean that they can't push

you'll find is that yes certainly it's

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:18.410
you'll find is that yes certainly it's
 

01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:20.830
you'll find is that yes certainly it's
easier to hide in thick grass but it's

01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840
easier to hide in thick grass but it's
 

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:24.190
easier to hide in thick grass but it's

also very difficult for to see over
 

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.620
also very difficult for to see over
thick grass so if you think of the life

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:26.630
