00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:10.076
This might seem hard to believe,
but right now,

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:14.703
300 million women across the planet 
are experiencing the same thing:

00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:16.287
a period.

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:18.797
The monthly menstrual cycle
that leads to the period

00:00:18.797 --> 00:00:22.884
is a reality most women on Earth
will go through in their lives.

00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:25.458
But why is this cycle so universal?

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.210
And what makes it a cycle
in the first place?

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.102
Periods last anywhere
between two and seven days,

00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:35.659
arising once within in a 28-day rotation.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.784
That whole system occurs on repeat,

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:42.665
happening approximately 450 times
during a woman's life.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:45.442
Behind the scenes are a series
of hormonal controls

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:48.174
that fine tune 
the body's internal workings

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:53.050
to make menstruation start or stop
during those 28 days.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.368
This inner machinery includes two ovaries

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:58.354
stocked with thousands of tiny sacks
called follicles

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:02.564
that each contain one oocyte,
an unfertilized egg cell.

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:06.483
At puberty, ovaries hold 
over 400 thousand egg cells,

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.926
but release only one each month,

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.459
which results in pregnancy
or a period.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.124
Here's how this cycle unfolds.

00:01:15.124 --> 00:01:16.960
Each month beginning around puberty,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.624
the hormone-producing 
pituitary gland in the brain

00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:22.545
starts releasing two substances 
into the blood:

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:26.115
follicle stimulating hormone
and luteinizing hormone.

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:27.677
When they reach the ovaries,

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:31.341
they encourage the internal egg cells
to grow and mature.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.329
The follicles respond 
by pumping out estrogen.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.668
The egg cells grow 
and estrogen levels peak,

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:40.077
inhibiting the production of FSH,

00:01:40.077 --> 00:01:43.799
and telling the pituitary 
to pump out more LH.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.301
That causes only the most mature egg cell
from one of the ovaries

00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:50.874
to burst out of the follicle
and through the ovary wall.

00:01:50.874 --> 00:01:52.242
This is called ovulation,

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:56.511
and it usually happens ten to sixteen days
before the start of a period.

00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:59.566
The tiny oocyte moves 
along the fallopian tube.

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:04.100
A pregnancy can only occur if the egg
is fertilized by a sperm cell

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.542
within the next 24 hours.

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:08.565
Otherwise, the egg's escapade ends,

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:12.059
and the window for pregnancy 
closes for that month.

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:16.011
Meanwhile, the now empty follicle
begins to release progesterone,

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.264
another hormone that 
tells the womb's lining

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:20.771
to plump up with blood and nutrients

00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:25.195
in preparation for a fertilized egg
that may embed there and grow.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:26.576
If it doesn't embed,

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:30.660
a few days later, the body's progesterone
and estrogen levels plummet,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.827
meaning the womb stops padding out
and starts to degenerate,

00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:37.269
eventually falling away.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.280
Blood and tissue leave the body,
forming the period.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.841
The womb can take up to a week
to clear out its unused contents,

00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.280
after which, the cycle begins anew.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.590
Soon afterwards, the ovaries begin
to secrete estrogen again,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.287
and the womb lining thickens,

00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:55.987
getting ready to accommodate 
a fertilized egg

00:02:55.987 --> 00:02:58.211
or be shed.

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.545
Hormones continually 
control these activities

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:05.467
by circulating in ideal amounts
delivered at just the right time.

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:06.810
The cycle keeps on turning,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.084
transforming each day and each week
into a milestone along its course

00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:13.418
towards pregnancy or a period.

00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:15.834
Although this cycle appears to move
by clockwork,

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:18.139
there's room for variation.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.485
Women and their bodies are unique, 
after all.

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:23.894
Menstrual cycles occur at diffferent times
in the month,

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:26.878
ovulation comes at various points
in the cycle,

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:30.369
and some periods last longer than others.

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.491
Menstruation even begins and ends
at different times in life

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.707
for different women, too.

00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:39.396
In other words,
variations between periods are normal.

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:42.804
Appreciating these differences
and learning about this monthly process

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:44.569
can empower women,

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.585
giving them the tools to understand
and take charge of their own bodies.

00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:51.770
That way, they're able to factor
this small cycle

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.495
into a much larger cycle of life.
