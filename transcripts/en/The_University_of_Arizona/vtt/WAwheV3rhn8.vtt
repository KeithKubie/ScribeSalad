00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.835
This is our specific
pathogen-free facility.

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:07.040
This is where we keep
all of our clean stocks

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.107
that we use in our research
and that we used as controls

00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:11.190
for any challenge studies.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.730
So these animals are
completely free of disease.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.150
We get live animals
from all over the world.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.240
We get them from Asia.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390
We come from South America.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.290
We've gotten them
from Saudi Arabia.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.730
There's very few countries
we haven't got them from that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.370
are actively raising shrimp.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.610
It's a unique location,
really, because when

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.290
you're working on diseases
of aquatic animals,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.800
one of the things
that you don't want

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.520
is to spread the disease
in natural environment.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.440
And fortunately, we are
located in a unique position,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.220
because there is no
natural water bodies

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.900
hundreds of miles from here.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.170
One of our key missions
is to provide disease

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.350
diagnostic service to
shrimp industry globally.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.630
So farmers, shrimp
farmers, worldwide, they

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.680
send shrimp samples to
our lab for the disease

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.920
diagnostic purpose.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.600
And we carry out all
kinds of disease detection

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.850
work in our lab and provide
them with the results.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.670
So we need to make sure
that these animals are

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.740
free of diseases,
because we don't

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.100
want to spread the disease
inadvertently or even

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.110
knowingly.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.960
Shrimp industry is
very big in countries

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.600
with large coastal
boundaries, particularly

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.230
in the North and South
America, as well as in Asia.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.980
So it provides jobs for millions
of people around the world.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.570
And in many countries,
shrimp is one

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.160
of the major sources of earning
revenues for the nation.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.880
We also provide services
to shrimp industry globally

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.570
in terms of carrying
out some basic research,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.580
like, say, a company
wants to develop

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.830
an antiviral or
antimicrobial therapy.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.020
And we preform all
those experiments.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.180
So it's a wonderful
opportunity for us

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.050
to interact with researchers
globally and also train them

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.460
so that we collectively
can serve the industry

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.250
and make shrimp
farming sustainable.
