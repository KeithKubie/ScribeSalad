00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first thing that we need to deal in this problem is the issue of the mosquito nets.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well we know that at first there are no mosquito nets in place at all,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so we're going to create this variable called net factor and initialize it to 1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We know that after 100 days, net factor is reduced by bite reduction by net,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
this constant that we created up here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We add in this if statement right here saying that after 100 days,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
net factor is reduced by 0.9 which is bite reduction by net.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Remember that this is basically the probability that a person is going to be bitten.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It makes sense that if you add in the mosquito net, the probability of you being bitten will go down.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now for implementing the forward Euler method with the infected population,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
both human and mosquito.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For the number of infected humans at the next time step,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we of course, need to start with the number of infected humans at the previous step.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
To this, we're going to add on the number of people

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that are being added to the infected population.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We are going to subtract the number of people that are moving out

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of the infected into the susceptible population.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's first think about the term that's being added to the number of infected humans.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We take the probability of a person being bitten which is in that factor

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
times the number of bites per day and per mosquito that a person gets

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
also multiply that by the number of infected mosquitoes

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and then we multiply this by the fraction of the total human population that is still susceptible

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
also multiply this by the probability of a mosquito transmitting malaria to a human.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
On the other side of the coin, we have factors that move people away

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
from the infected population and back into a susceptible population.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is a very simple term.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We simply take the number of people that were infected at the previous time step

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and divide this by the time that it takes a person to recover.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Remember that all of that was multiplied by age

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and added to the number of people infected at the previous time step.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now, let's take a look at how the infected mosquito population was changing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Since we're using the forward Euler method, we started with the number of infected mosquitoes

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
at the previous step and then add to this age times a bunch of other things.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now to find out how many mosquitoes are moving into the infected group,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we start with the probability of a mosquito biting a person,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
which of course might give the mosquito malaria as well,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
multiply this again by the bites per day of mosquito,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
multiply this by the number of susceptible mosquitoes and the number of infected humans.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We then divide this by the total number of humans

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and multiply the transmission probability from human to mosquito.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If you remember the drawing that I showed earlier on in the video introducing this problem,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I told you that the only way the mosquitoes can no longer be infected is to die.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
They don't move back to being susceptible.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This means that the only thing that is going to decrease

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the number of infected mosquitoes is death of mosquitoes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So, we subtract from this entire expression if 1 over the mosquito lifetime

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
times another infected mosquitoes at the previous step.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I know that that was a lot of constants and variables to keep track of,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but great job if you're able to fill all this up.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now, let's take a peek at what our final graph for Unit 3 looks like.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now in this graph, the blue curve shows the fraction of humans that were infected

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and the green curve shows the fraction of the number of mosquitoes that are infected.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
At first glance, it might look like there are many many more humans infected the mosquitoes.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But remember that because this is fraction, this doesn't actually show us plain numbers.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In fact, we started with 10¹⁰ mosquitoes, but only 10⁸ humans.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So even if a much smaller percent of the mosquito population was infected from the human population,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the mosquitoes are able to infect such a great portion of humans

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
because there are so many more mosquitoes than there are humans to it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You can see that the number of both humans and mosquitoes infected,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
at first, increases sharply and then levels off and stays at a very high number.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
However, as soon as 100 days hits, and we introduce the mosquito nets.,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the number of infected in each population starts to decrease certainly.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We can see that a mosquito net idea was definitely very effective

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
for helping slow the spread of malaria in the human population as well as the mosquito population.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Great job on all three problems in Unit 3.

00:04:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I hope you found this discussion of the SIR model and its variations interesting.
