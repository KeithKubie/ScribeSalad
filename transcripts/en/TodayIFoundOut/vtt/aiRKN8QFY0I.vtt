00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:12.269
Have you ever seen the toenails of your grandfather
and thought he might be a troll?

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.449
Those yellow, misshapen and brittle nails
tend to make small children cringe, and in

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.449
response, he wears knee high black socks with
sandals.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.199
Known as Onychomycosis, this unshapely blemish
effects about 10% of the total population.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.610
20% of people over 60, and 50% of people over
70 become victims.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.440
So what’s happening here?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.390
There can be several causes of your imperfect
nails.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.530
The most common is a class of fungi known
as Dermatophytes.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.600
Certain types of yeasts and nondermatophytic
molds are also a frequent cause.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.940
Don’t think your nails are the only body
part that can be affected by dermatophytes.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.800
When infecting the skin, they cause “ringworm”
or “tinea”.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.001
They can also take up residence in your hair
and follicles and cause what is known as tinea

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.001
capitis.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.001
Dermatophytes, and the disease processes they
cause, are quite unique in the world of living

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.001
organisms and parasites.

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.001
First, no living tissue is invaded by the
fungi.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.001
Instead they colonize the dead layers of tissue
that have large amounts of a protein called

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.001
keratin.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.001
Hair, skin, and nails all have large amounts
of keratin within them.

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.001
Secondly, even though no living tissue is
invaded, they can still illicit an allergic

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:08.001
and/or inflammatory response.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.001
Thirdly, these types of fungi have evolved
to the point that they’re completely dependent

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.001
on human or animal infection for the survival
and propagation of their species.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.001
To better understand how they cause our nails
to become so deformed, let’s first look

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.001
at how our nails grow and what they’re made
of.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.001
toesOur nails consist of many different parts.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.001
The part we can see is known as the nail plate.

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.830
Below the plate is the nail bed.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.960
The white, half-moon shaped part, at the base
of the nail, is called the lunula (also known

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.380
as the distal matrix).

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.210
The tissue over the top of the matrix is called
the cuticle.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.330
The nail itself is grown primarily from the
matrix (around 90%).

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.500
The matrix consists of epithelial cells that
grow and divide.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.330
Epithelial cells are the most common type
of cells within the body, and are what make

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.100
up your skin and hair.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.950
They primarily contain keratin.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.470
Once they begin to reach the end of their
respective life cycles, the cells go through

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.680
a process called keratinization, also known
as cornification.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.100
When the cell dies, it loses its nucleus and
other intracellular organelles.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.290
What is left over is hardened keratin.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.450
An enzyme known as Transglutaminase begins
to enclose the keratin in an insoluble mixture

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.390
of different proteins and fats.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.490
The end result is the hard nails we use to
pick noses and give back scratches.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.910
Keratin is the main food source, of sorts,
for dermatophytes.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.860
Once the keratin rich cells are infected by
these fungi, they begin releasing sulfite.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.150
Studies have shown that growth and proliferation
of dermatophytes is reliant on sulfite.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.510
Keratins have a sulfur-containing amino acid
known as cysteine.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.000
Cysteine bonds are what stabilizes keratin
and gives it a rigid structure.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.280
These fungi use cysteine to produce sulfite.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.819
Once the sulfite is produced, it clings to
cysteine bonds and thus the process is repeated.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.810
The result is keratin that no longer has cysteine
and it becomes brittle, misshapen and generally

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.120
unsightly.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.660
There are several things that can increase
your risk of having your nails infected by

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.790
these little demons of destruction, such as
diminished blood circulation, like in the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.959
case of peripheral artery disease; slow growing
nails; injury to the nail; a weakened immune

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.930
system; a family history of fungal infections;
diabetes; and AIDS.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.200
Age and gender are also contributing factors-
men tend to be more susceptible than women.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.770
Environmental conditions like walking barefoot
in damp public places, humid or moist work

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.730
environments, and wearing socks and shoes
that prevent ventilation can also increase

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.730
your risk.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.380
If you become one of the unlucky ones and
your nails propagate these petite parasites,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.010
your treatment options depend on several factors.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.380
As mentioned before, dermatophytes are the
most common cause, but there are other conditions

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.810
and fungi (like the yeast candida) that can
result in the same nail deformities.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.770
Your doctor will most likely need to determine
the exact nature of your nail’s problem

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.350
before determining the treatment.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.210
Once determined, if your infection is more
localized, then topical anti-fungal agents

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.190
like benzoic acid, Batrafin, or Nystatin can
be tried.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.110
If your problem is more widespread, then oral
medications that target specific types of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.630
fungi are usually prescribed.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.569
In the end, if your nails begin to yellow
and you find yourself buying socks that match

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.040
your sandals, hopefully the knowledge that
half of people over 70 have the same problem

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.170
will ease your mind.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.690
If it doesn’t, then go see your doctor and
have your nails tested for the exact type

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.410
of parasite invading them so you can potentially
eradicate them and the unsightly nails they

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.990
cause
