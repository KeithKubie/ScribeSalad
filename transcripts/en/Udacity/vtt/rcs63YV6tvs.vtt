00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.690
Now, you can't do much about needing the screen on

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.670
all the time, but you can control your applications' network

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.500
usage pattern. It's important to understand that, in terms of

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.200
power consumption, the pattern of network usage, is at least

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.420
as important as the total amount of data transferred. There're

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.120
definite anti patterns to network usage. It turns out that

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.710
the cellular radio is designed to switch to a low

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.670
power idle mode, when not in use to conserve battery life.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.650
Let's take a look at the different states the radio

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.500
can be in. The cellular radio, has something called the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.050
radio resource controller, or RRC. I'ts kind of like a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.110
traffic controller for the radio. We start out in the idle

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.650
state, and, when we make an initial request, it takes

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.170
around 100 milliseconds (no period) for us to get connected, and

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.030
into the active state. Once we're there of course, we

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.940
can make as many requests as we want, and stay active.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.580
Once we're in the active state, though, if we don't

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.030
make a request for about a tenth of a second,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.940
we drop into a short sleep mode, which uses less

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.730
power, but, it'll take us up to 50 milliseconds in

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.580
order to get back into active if we make a

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.810
request. Then, if we don't make any requests for another

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.360
100 milliseconds, we drop into a long sleep mode. Again,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.280
we can get back to active in under 50 milliseconds.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.960
But, if we don't make any requests for about

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260
ten seconds, we drop all the way back down to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.010
idle. Which will of course take us longer to get

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.610
back into active from. The critical part about this of

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.220
course, is that each one of these states, has a

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.040
different power consumption for a file. Idle of course takes

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.060
the least power. Active takes the most. Short sleep and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.560
long sleep, both take inbetween. But, certainly more than idle.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.940
So, it's important for us to leave

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.510
the connection idle, as often as possible, and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.100
try not to spend too much time, cycling back and forth between sleep and active.
