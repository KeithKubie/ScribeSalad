00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.150
- We've talked a lot about ATP

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.120
being the energy currency of cells,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.450
but I want to dig a little bit
deeper into that in this video.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.450
And as we'll see when
we go from ATP to ADP,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.690
ADP + a Phosphate group, we
have a release of free energy.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.220
If we look at just the system,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.450
ATP's free energy is over
here, but once hydrolysis

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.650
has taken place and now it's
ADP + a Phosphate group,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.650
the free energy has dropped
by roughly 30.5 KJ/mol

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.450
our Delta G is -30.5 Kilojoules per mole

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.550
and if you watch the
videos on Gibbs Free Energy

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.310
this tells us that this
is a spontaneous reaction.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.020
Delta, Delta G is less than zero,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.750
which tells us that this
is going to be spontaneous.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.120
Now when I first learned this I was like,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.020
well if it's going to be
spontaneous why wouldn't all of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.550
the ATP just spontaneously
and all of the water

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.620
turn into ADP and just release it's energy

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.920
as heat or whatever else?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.560
And the key is, it has
to get over this hump.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.790
You have this activation energy,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.650
it has to go uphill a little bit

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.650
if there's no enzyme to catalyze it.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.320
And the reason why we have
this uphill hump is the way

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.950
that ATP gets broken
up is that you have to,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520
if we're talking about a water
molecule doing the hydrolysis

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.750
which is typically what
people think about hydrolysis,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.240
although it can sometimes be
done by a different molecule,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.590
if you think about the water molecule

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.990
what needs to happen is, you need

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.420
this lone pair of electrons on this oxygen

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.690
to be able to do what we
call a nucleophilic attack

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.550
on this Phosphorous in
this phosphate group

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.020
and if that happens, it forms this bond

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.020
and then these electrons can
be taken back by this oxygen

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.750
which gives its negative
charge right over there.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.350
Now you might say, "Okay,
this makes a lot of sense",

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.450
but you have to rememeber
this, electrons are negative

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.120
and they're surrounded by
these negative charges.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.920
So they have to overcome
getting close to these things

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550
so as they're approaching
these negative charges,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.910
they want to repel each other,
so you have to overcome that.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.590
And the way that it's
overcome is a class of enzymes

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.590
called ATPases, ATPase.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.850
And what they do is,
remember these enzymes

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.820
are these big protein
complexes and the ATP molecule

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.820
combined in the right place.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.690
And they essentially try and
surround the ATP molecule

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.550
with some positive ions.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.750
So let's say there's a positive ion here.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.550
So it can keep these electrons
busy while the water,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.620
or whatever is doing
the nucleophilic attack,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.920
can not have to worry about
these electrons over here.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.850
So it might have a positive ion here.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.020
And remember, if we think
in three dimensions,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.190
this thing is all wrapped
around in different ways

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.190
around the ATP molecule,
so this is the ATPase.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.920
And so by having the enzyme over here,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.650
you're lowering the activation energy.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.399
And so it might end up looking
something more like this.

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.790
And so the reaction can actually occur.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.290
So the reason why you don't
just see this happening

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.820
all the time without an enzyme is why you

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.050
have to overcome this hump.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.590
But once you have the enzymes
they can actually allow

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.890
the reaction to occur.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.720
So this attacks this, forms this
bond, and then you say well,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.450
"You have another
hydrogen right over here,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.850
you have another hydrogen
right over here."

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.720
But this could get nabbed
up by another water molecule

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.450
becoming a hydronium ion, which is

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.350
actually what's going to happen.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.420
And then, this character takes
away this pair of electrons,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.090
becomes a negative charge,
and we're left with

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.790
that Phosphate group has
been broken off and then

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.950
we have our ADP and we
have our release of energy.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.150
Now, typically you don't
want this to release energy

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.419
for no good reason.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.050
Most ATPases are going
to leverage that energy

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.950
that release this reaction
to phosphorylate a molecule.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.720
And in this case you can
kind of think that this

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.390
hydroxide has been phosphorylated,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.620
but it might phosphorylate something else.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.910
Or it might change the
confirmation of this ATPase

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.590
so it can do some other type of work,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.120
transfer molecules against
their concentration gradient

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.160
or chemoelectric gradient,
whatever it might be.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.820
You don't want to just release the energy.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.250
Sometimes it might happen
if you just want to

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.920
generate some heat, but
usually you're going to do

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.820
some useful work for the actual cells.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.050
Hopefully this gives you a little more

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.190
appreciation for ATP and
the reaction by which

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.640
the hydrolysis can occur.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.650
This is called hydrolysis
because, at least in this example

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.820
we're using a water
molecule to break it up

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.300
or to take off a phosphate group.
