personally I think that there are easier

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890
personally I think that there are easier
 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.320
personally I think that there are easier
ways of telepathy

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330
ways of telepathy
 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.680
ways of telepathy
then using quantum entanglement already

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690
then using quantum entanglement already
 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.620
then using quantum entanglement already
we can take MRI scans EEG scans of the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630

brain decipher them using computers

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880

shoot that information to another person

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
shoot that information to another person
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.800

this is called radio enhanced telepathy

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810
this is called radio enhanced telepathy
 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.240
this is called radio enhanced telepathy
using quantum entanglement to do that

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
using quantum entanglement to do that
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640
using quantum entanglement to do that
it's quite complicated because of the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
it's quite complicated because of the
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.519
it's quite complicated because of the
problem of decoherence objects that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
problem of decoherence objects that
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859
problem of decoherence objects that
vibrate in phase when you separate them

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
vibrate in phase when you separate them
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.040
vibrate in phase when you separate them
are also coherent there's an umbilical

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
are also coherent there's an umbilical
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.470
are also coherent there's an umbilical
cord that emerges between two objects

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
cord that emerges between two objects
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360
cord that emerges between two objects
that's called quantum entanglement

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
that's called quantum entanglement
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400
that's called quantum entanglement
however we consist of trillions upon

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
however we consist of trillions upon
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.119
however we consist of trillions upon
trillions of atoms so to get to minds to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
trillions of atoms so to get to minds to
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490
trillions of atoms so to get to minds to
vibrate in unison like that would be

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
vibrate in unison like that would be
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.670
vibrate in unison like that would be
impossible the world's record for making

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
impossible the world's record for making
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.069
impossible the world's record for making
objects entangle there's only just a few

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
objects entangle there's only just a few
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.590
objects entangle there's only just a few
atoms imagine trying to entangle two

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
atoms imagine trying to entangle two
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.080

Minds together so it sounds like a neat

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
Minds together so it sounds like a neat
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.330
Minds together so it sounds like a neat
idea putting quantum entanglement with

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
idea putting quantum entanglement with
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.849

telepathy but hey let's be real there's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
telepathy but hey let's be real there's
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099
telepathy but hey let's be real there's
an easier way to do it that's using

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
an easier way to do it that's using
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.430
an easier way to do it that's using
computers and radio
