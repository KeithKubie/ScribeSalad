1
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.211
Okay.

2
00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:06.890
So we're ready for a new phase here to talk about spectroscopy,

3
00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:11.660
the interaction of light with matter and what it can tell us about molecules.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.140
Uh,
we'll talk today about electronic and infrared spectroscopy.

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.280
Uh,

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.280
then we'll end in particular with infrared spectroscopy about normal modes and

7
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:28.160
the mixing and independence of vibrations.

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.420
So the purpose where the purposes,

9
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:37.370
we use spectroscopy for our to determine structure and to study dynamics.

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.210
So we use electronic spectroscopy that's visible in UV where the,

11
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.593
uh,

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.220
it's where it's motion of electrons that's being excited by the light or

13
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:52.130
vibrational where it's motion of the nuclei,

14
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:57.131
the Adams being excited by the light or Nmr where it's a magnetic interaction

15
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:00.950
with life that's involved.

16
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.570
A spectroscopy comes from the word Specter in 16,

17
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:08.031
five.

18
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:13.031
It was used according to the Oxford English dictionary to be strange sights,

19
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:17.270
visions,
apparitions.
So that's like the specters of ghosts,
right?

20
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.520
Or Newton used it in the sixties and seventies to be sunbeams passing through

21
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:27.521
glass prism exhibited there a spectrum of diverse colors of this kind of ghosts.

22
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.840
So that's where the word comes from.

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.790
Now Adam and a box which we use last semester and has shown over on this screen

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.100
can be used to show a number of things.

25
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.740
It can show spectral transitions for the h atom.
Let's uh,

26
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.350
get this here and if you click a spectrum here,

27
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.930
you get a,

28
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.343
<v 1>where is it now?</v>

29
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.640
<v 0>I think it's off the screen.
I enlarge things here.
But anyhow,</v>

30
00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:01.840
it gives you what the,
uh,
what the,
uh,
spectral transitions are.

31
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.180
What energies are involved in going from one,
oh,

32
00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:06.760
I think it's because I didn't get simplify the work here.

33
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.940
<v 1>Simplifying,
uh,</v>

34
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.400
<v 0>my guess is because I blew this up to be on the screen is not showing any how</v>

35
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.340
we've done that before and seeing you can see the energy levels of different

36
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:30.930
things,
different atomic levels and a wavelength.
It's involved.

37
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.060
But we can see the static shift in electron density for mixing two s with two p

38
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:39.810
orbitals.
Maybe I'm going to have to bring this back down

39
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.640
<v 1>again
and
see if it works.</v>

40
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:45.474
Now.

41
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.060
<v 0>I don't know why it's not working
well.</v>

42
00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:01.061
Fortunately the most important stuff I'm going to have is a displaying their and

43
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:05.440
be also on the PowerPoint.
So you can do this on your own time.
Okay.

44
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.910
You can see the shift as we saw last semester for mixing two s with two p.

45
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:14.530
Remember that'll shift the the electrons from one side to the other nucleus.

46
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.150
Depending on the hybridization,

47
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.280
we can see the oscillation of electron density that comes from mixing orbitals

48
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.120
with different energy and that's what's involved here.

49
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.150
You'll notice over here we've got a mixture of the one s with a two p orbital.

50
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.980
What we showed before was fixed in time and it would shift it up or down.

51
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.530
But if you look at the at at it,
as time goes on,
you'll see that the,

52
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.100
it actually goes back and forth between being down and being up,

53
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.500
being down and being up.
So the electrons,

54
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:55.420
when you mix one s and two p oscillate up and down in time,

55
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.910
right?
And that's because of a change in relative phase with time.

56
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.230
You add s with p and then subtract this with P and it goes one way.

57
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.064
And then the other,

58
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.320
and I'm going to illustrate that this is a feature of time dependent quantum

59
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.430
mechanics where the phase of the wave function changes that are rate

60
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.780
proportional to its energy.

61
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.540
And I'll go through this just a little bit on the next slide.

62
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.480
We're not going to spend too much time on it because it's not really the

63
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:23.590
business of this class,

64
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:27.520
but it's so neat that I thought you'd like to know about it.
But anyhow,

65
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:32.500
when you have the electron shifting up and down like that,
it's like an antenna.

66
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.540
It gives off light.
In fact,
it can absorb light.

67
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.210
Two antennas can either transmit or receive.

68
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.960
So that's what allows electrons in Adams to interact with light as an

69
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.700
oscillating dipole.
Okay.

70
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.390
You can also do breathing by mixing one s with two s but that doesn't interact

71
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:57.790
with light because it doesn't generate a dipole.

72
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.100
And I'm going to illustrate that,
right?

73
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.350
So here's a one s mixing,
one s and two p.
So,

74
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.360
uh,
as we see here,
if two P is both up and down,
but with opposite phases,

75
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.690
one s as a single phase as a single sign,

76
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.760
if you add the two at reinforces above,
okay.
And we've seen that before.

77
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.480
But if you make it time dependence as was being shown over there,

78
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.450
then what happens in time is that it goes up and down,
right?

79
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.260
And the oscillation frequency,
how rapidly it goes up and down.

80
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:36.940
That is what color of light would interact with at what frequency of light has

81
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.650
to do with the energy difference between one s and two p.
Right?

82
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.910
So here,
this is just a footnote.
You're not deeply responsible for this,

83
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.510
but I wanted you to see it.
So I'll just read it to you.

84
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.300
A time dependent wave function looks like,

85
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:56.470
just like the size we've been talking about functions of position,
right?

86
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:59.120
Except that it's also got something to do with time.

87
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:04.121
Obviously it's multiplied by e to the I Omega t and you know,

88
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.460
he to the,

89
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.620
to the IMX is coasts x plus I sign x of you.
If you've done that,

90
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.870
I think you may have seen that.
Okay,

91
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.470
so you have a co sign and a sign of Omega t one is real and one is imaginary.

92
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.890
It's a complex number that you're multiplying the wave function by.

93
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.430
So I as the square root of minus one Omega is the energy infrequency units.

94
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.360
That's how rapidly things are changing in time,
right?

95
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.710
Because it's co-signed Omega t so as time increases,

96
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.580
the co sign goes up between plus and minus one.
Right.

97
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.250
And how fast it goes up and down.

98
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.830
It depends on how big omega is because Omega t is what you're taking the co sign

99
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:56.540
of.
So the,
the higher frequency Omega is,

100
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.130
the faster it'll go up and down.

101
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.160
The Higher Energy Omega is a now that's an interesting question because it

102
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:11.000
depends on what the magnitude of the energy for any given system depends on

103
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:15.580
whatZ ,
where are you defined zero to be,
right?

104
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.370
If you define zero to be separated particles,
that's one energy.

105
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.550
If you define it to be the ground state,
that's a different energy.

106
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.080
And this would suggest that the rate of oscillation depends on what you call

107
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:29.690
zero.
That seems nuts,
right?

108
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.080
You can't depend on you what the rate of oscillation is.

109
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.760
And the reason is you don't care what the rate of oscillation is.

110
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.180
And I'll show you why because when you square the wave function to get the

111
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:46.070
probability density at any given time,

112
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.580
you multiply e to the a side times either the Iomega tee times side to the e to

113
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:54.170
the minus Iomega t.

114
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.250
That's how you do squaring with complex numbers multiplied by the complex

115
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:03.050
conjugate.
And that gives size square and all the stuff about time cancels out.

116
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.180
So you don't really care.
So why do you have it in there in the first place?

117
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.200
If you're mixing two different states that have different energy,

118
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.070
then they oscillate at different frequencies.
Okay?

119
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.200
So really you don't care how fast either one is oscillating alone.

120
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.430
You only care what the difference in frequencies is.

121
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.200
So now it doesn't depend on what you call zero because the one state year you're

122
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.410
taking and the other state you're taking have the same difference.

123
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.770
Whatever's zero is,
that's where you make a difference.

124
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:43.040
So it says when a problem involves actually mixing,

125
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:44.780
two states have different energy.

126
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.260
One considers a wave function to the form e to the I Omega one t t plus a

127
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:55.650
different side the other way function times e to the I Omega t.

128
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.580
Now if Omega and one an Omega to are different,

129
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.180
this means that the two spatial functions cycle in and out of phase with one

130
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.181
another.

131
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:11.181
If at a certain time they add at a time a half divided by the difference in

132
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.170
frequency,
later they subtract.

133
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.270
So one s plus two PZ will become one s minus two PZ.
So if two P,

134
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.520
if,
if this is the energy here,
the oscillation frequency of of two peasy,

135
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.470
then one s will have a lower oscillation frequency by that energy difference

136
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:31.920
between them,
right?
And it'll look like that,
right?

137
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.300
So here they're in phase with one another,
the coast side part,
they're adding,

138
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.140
but in the middle there,
they're out of phase and it's subtracting.

139
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.800
And then it comes back into phase again at the far right.

140
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.420
So as time goes along,
it comes s plus P as minus,

141
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.560
p as plus P s minus B,
and the electrons go up and down,

142
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.530
right?
So you may,
if you mix these two orbitals so what?

143
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.680
So so elect the electric field that's oscillating up and then down and then up

144
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:09.660
and then down favors this at the first time,
then the neck,
then plus,

145
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.580
then minus and plus then minus.

146
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.780
So the light interacts with the electrons and pushes them up and down,

147
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.180
mixing one s with two p.

148
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.920
Now if you do that for awhile and then turn the light off,

149
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.640
it may end up being in the s plus p rather than when it started in the s minus P

150
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:30.570
or vice versa.

151
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:34.770
So you can get it at an absorption or indeed an emission of light.

152
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.640
The interaction with light and the things because of this time dependence.

153
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.290
But again,
this is not really our business and we'll uh,
you'll see that later.

154
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:47.400
So this is the source of the oscillation we observe when super imposing

155
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:51.690
functions of different in using Adam and a box,
different energies.

156
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:56.370
So that thing going up and down over there.
Okay.

157
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.340
And note just as a foot,
the footnote to a footnote,

158
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.460
this is different from what we were doing when we made hybrids.

159
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:07.320
We Mixed One s with pee before.
Usually we're mixing two s with two P,

160
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.330
which have very similar energies,
right?
But,
but in those cases,

161
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:17.460
we weren't trying to mix two real estates.
That's why I said actually up there,

162
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.820
right?

163
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.820
But there we were just trying to get an a reasonable form for a wave function of

164
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:28.620
some particular energy,
right?
But when light is involved,

165
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:32.970
you actually mix states have different energies.
It's a different situation,

166
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.000
okay?
So,
so we get this oscillation up and down,
which interacts with light.

167
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.190
It can generate light,
it can absorb light.
Uh,

168
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.580
now the one s,
the two p transition is said to be allowed because it,

169
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.420
it happens with light,
right?

170
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.480
But there are other mixtures that don't generate light.
For example,

171
00:11:55.481 --> 00:12:00.430
if you mix one s with two ls,
if you add the to it reinforces where they're blue.

172
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.930
And some tracks when they're red,
that makes a big circle.
Big Sphere,

173
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.210
right?
But if you subtract them,

174
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:10.600
make the one on the left red and add it to the other one,

175
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.010
then they'll reinforce in the middle and cancel on the outside and it'll be

176
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:19.600
inside.
So if you,
if you,
if you mix those two,
you get this dependence with time,

177
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:23.680
I think it's going to do it.
Uh,
whoops.

178
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.710
I didn't wait long enough.
But what happens?
And you can do it yourself.
He goes,

179
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.260
it's breathing.
Right?

180
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.910
But that's not separating the average position to the nucleus and the electron.

181
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.930
It's not going up and down to make a vector a light,
right?

182
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.930
It's just expanding and contracting.
Okay,

183
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.590
so that symmetrical breathing electron density,

184
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:51.460
defamation has no oscillator strength.
It doesn't interact with lights,

185
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:55.780
magnetic field.
So that transition has said to for be forbidden.

186
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:57.730
You can't cause it to occur with light.

187
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.100
Now what does this have to do with organic molecules and the things we were just

188
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:03.851
talking about,

189
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:07.930
which were polyenes you remember a bunch of a bunch of double bonds in a row?

190
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.110
Well,
suppose you have a CX double bond,
an extra,

191
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.430
some Hetero atom like oxygen or nitrogen,
right?

192
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.970
Then something that has an unshared pair of electrons.
Okay?

193
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:23.950
So it has an electrons,
but it also has a Pi Pi star orbital,

194
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:27.700
a vacant orbital right?
Now,
can you mix those two?

195
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:32.590
What would happen if you mix those two orbitals you could add them together and

196
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:37.540
they'd reinforce in the top right and cancel on the bottom right.
Okay.

197
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.460
And you'd get the electrons to move up,
right?
And if you change the side,

198
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.470
they'd moved down.
If you subtract that one from the other,
right.

199
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.980
So here's a way that light gets a handle on the electrons that are an unshared

200
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:58.891
pair and can make them go into pies star by mixing the sigma unshared,

201
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:02.770
pair electrons with Pi Star,
okay?

202
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.530
Now that's neat because,
uh,
as it goes up and down,

203
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.840
you'll absorb light,
right?

204
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.290
And the large energy gap between the unshared pair and Pi Star means that this

205
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:20.260
transition occurs at very high frequency.
Because remember,

206
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:25.120
the frequency of cycling in and out of phase is the difference in the energies

207
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:27.370
of the two things.
So if they're fairly far apart,

208
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.870
it'll be a very high frequency of light,
not in the visible,
so you can,

209
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.750
it's in the ultraviolet.
How could you make it?

210
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.260
How could you make those two orbitals closer in energy?

211
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.730
The unshared pair you couldn't do much about except maybe changing what Adam's

212
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.580
involved,
oxygen,
nitrogen,
sulfur,
things like that.

213
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.720
How could you change the energy of the Lumo in the Pi System?

214
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.140
Anybody got an idea?
So you have,

215
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.410
if you put more double bonds conjugated with it,

216
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.710
remember the Lumo comes down,
the homo comes up,

217
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.450
so you can bring it closer to the energy of the unshared pair,
right?

218
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.180
If we put more and more double bonds in there,

219
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.160
then the Lumo is going to look like this.

220
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.490
It approaches the energy of an isolated p orbital,

221
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.270
so the light will get redder and redder.
That interacts,

222
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.890
and this makes a lot of difference as the Pi Star approaches the energy of the

223
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:25.010
two p orbital.
So for example,
this molecule,

224
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:27.410
which has an unshared pair on nitrogen here,

225
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.690
which could mix with Pi star of this really long conjugated system,
right?

226
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.410
That's Retina Alba.
That's the mean of Retina Aldehyde.

227
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.130
That's what's in Rhodopsin.
That's the light sensitive stuff in your eye.

228
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.470
So when light comes in at x sites,

229
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.330
excites this transition and it triggers that into your brain and so on because

230
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:51.650
of the CIS isomer changes to the Trans isomer at this double bond.

231
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.900
Right.
And that's how,
that's how you see,
right.

232
00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:02.330
Incidentally,
that compound,
I just put this in as a,
as another footnote.

233
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.490
Uh,
let's not spend time on it,

234
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:08.120
but this is the actual report of Lind Lars Catalyst.

235
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:12.050
Remember the poison catalyst that'll,
that'll reduce triple bonds,

236
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:14.330
the double bonds,
but won't reduce double bonds.

237
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.680
And he said it was in the context of vitamin A's synthesis during work on the

238
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:20.180
synthesis of vitamin a.

239
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.350
A palladium lead catalyst was developed with which one could hydrogenate a

240
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:28.130
triple bond without attacking double bonds already present.
Right?

241
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.020
But the things he was working on were things like this really long conjugated

242
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:37.070
things like Beta carotene ion,
which he made,

243
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:39.290
which had a triple bond in the middle as you see.

244
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.640
And then he can react it with who's special catalyst and get the,
the uh,

245
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.690
sis addition to have two hydrogens to give the Beta carotene and he says the uh,

246
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:56.420
uh,
the hydrogens are added insists arrangement to one another,

247
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.123
right?

248
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.670
But then he goes on to say that he could buy ad with heat and light.

249
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.100
He was able to quantitatively to convert the CIS isomer into the Trans Isomer,

250
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:14.150
which is what he wanted to have for Beta carotene.
Okay.

251
00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:17.090
Now notice this was see 48,
56,

252
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.800
this big long thing and you know why it's that kind of number because it's made

253
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:25.790
up of these ice supreme units that we talked about in the last quarter,
right?

254
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.080
Polymerization of,
of ice supreme to give these natural products.

255
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.530
Okay,
that's just a footnote to last semester.

256
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:36.540
It's made from Iso Penn Tino pyro phosphate.

257
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:42.470
Now retinal is the stuff that that's involved in this vision in making this

258
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:47.240
visual pigment right.
And Beta carotene is that.

259
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:50.880
And obviously it's called Beta carotene because that's what makes carrots that

260
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:53.880
way.
And that's why you eat carrots to make your eyes good,
right?

261
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.960
Bugs bunny has is a good vision because of that.
Okay.

262
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.580
Now is this related compound is called ISO z a Xantham,

263
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.610
right?
And it turns out to be the stuff that's in the,

264
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.290
the feathers of the scarlet tanager.
Now,

265
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.820
what's weird about this?

266
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.940
It's what makes a scarlet tanager yellow green,
right?

267
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.120
What's wrong with that?
It's supposed to be a scarlet Tanager,
right?

268
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.520
But this is actually late in the fall.

269
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.640
If you looked a little bit earlier in the fall,

270
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.680
the scarlet tanager looks like this,
so it's got a little bit of red in it,

271
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.630
right?
But notice that this o h out on the right,

272
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.250
which has an unshared pair that could go into the Pi System,

273
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.060
is not that oxygen's,
not part of the Pi System.

274
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.390
You can't generate any overlap by that,

275
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:58.950
because the oxygen is not where the Pi system is.
It's not conjugated.

276
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.800
The [inaudible] unshared payer is isolated.

277
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:05.580
So you can't do this thing of change taking an unshared paired,
putting it into,

278
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.780
into the,
uh,
Lumo the Pie Lumo okay?

279
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.980
But if you oxidize it to bake that,

280
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.330
then you get it conjugated and that's the scarlet tanager in the summer,

281
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.310
right?

282
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.020
So it's exactly this changing of unshared pairs into the Pi star orbital with a

283
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:30.021
really long conjugated chain that gives this most vivid of our birds colors.

284
00:19:30.391 --> 00:19:33.990
And these come into east drop park about a month or month and a half from now.

285
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:36.930
So you can go see them their selves,
they knock your eyes out.

286
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.920
Okay,
so we're talking about spectroscopy.

287
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:44.160
A spectrum is usually presented as a graph,
right?

288
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.170
And when you see a graph,
you wonder what the axes are.
That's the first thing.

289
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.370
And depending on what point of view you're taking about spectroscopy,

290
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.510
how you're understanding it,
there are different ways of labeling the graph.

291
00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:58.921
For example,

292
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:03.060
the horizontal and the vertical coordinates here in this particular graph are

293
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:05.190
called wave number in transmittance.

294
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.670
But the meaning of the axes in with respect to an experiment is color,

295
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.400
which light you're talking about along the horizontal axis and vertically,

296
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.370
what the light intensity is.
For example,

297
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.630
if you put how much light of a certain color gets absorbed by your sample,

298
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.160
or on the other hand,

299
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.780
how much light doesn't get absorbed and gets through the sample.
And in fact,

300
00:20:30.781 --> 00:20:35.130
that's what's plotted here is transmittance how much light gets through rather

301
00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:39.710
than how much gets absorbed.
Okay,
so that's one way of looking at it.

302
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.890
It just experimentally.

303
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.060
But another way is to look at it in terms of quantum mechanics,
right?

304
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.380
The horizontal is the Molecular Energy Gap,
right?

305
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:53.470
What are the,
Oh,
the orbitals that are involved,
right?

306
00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:55.240
How far apart are they an energy?

307
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.940
What does that have to do with the frequency of light?

308
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.720
You remember the rate of this oscillation back and forth has to do with the

309
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:04.660
energy difference between the two states you're talking about.

310
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.450
And if you're talking about quantum mechanics,

311
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.650
the vertical axis is how much overlap you generate.

312
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.920
So when that oxygen had the PI system on it right in the scarlet Tanager,

313
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.790
then you generated a lot of overlap by mixing the in with the Pie.

314
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.240
But if they were far apart and didn't and the light didn't,
couldn't,

315
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:29.200
didn't do this overlap,
then you didn't get the fancy color.
You've got just the,

316
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.700
the uh,
yellow,

317
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:35.140
green color or you can look at it in terms of classical mechanics,

318
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.980
which is the way we usually talk about infrared spectroscopy,

319
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:44.170
where the horizontal axis is some actual vibration frequency of the atoms in a

320
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:45.490
molecule,
right?

321
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.850
And the vertical axis is how much handle the light has on that particular

322
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:55.240
vibration.
For example,
if you're vibrating h two,

323
00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.010
you don't change any electronics by doing that,
you don't generate a dipole.

324
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:03.580
It doesn't interact with light.
But if you vibrate Hcl,

325
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.190
then you get a big separation of positive and negative charges.

326
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.660
You do that and it does interact with light.
Light has a good handle on it.

327
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.240
Okay.
So those are,

328
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.840
that's so it's molecular vibration frequency though.

329
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.230
Of course a molecule of h two or of hcl is just to Adams.

330
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.710
But normally the Adams who's bond you're interested in vibrating as part of a

331
00:22:26.711 --> 00:22:30.940
whole molecule.
And then things get more complicated as we will see.

332
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:37.470
So infrared spectroscopy uses light for a number of purposes.

333
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:41.410
One is to fingerprint molecules and I think you've done this in lab,
right,

334
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:46.290
to see whether your spectrum corresponds with a known spectrum or even if
you're,

335
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.580
even if you don't have an authentic sample,

336
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:53.770
you may have a table of where functional groups,
even in different molecules,

337
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:57.610
if it's the same functional group,
there may be some line that's characteristic.

338
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.840
Okay,

339
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.740
so you can identify functional groups in molecules that are otherwise unknown

340
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.880
and you can also use it to use the molecular dynamics that's involved to study

341
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:13.900
bonding to see how strong bonds are,

342
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.230
whether atoms are linked by springs for example,

343
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.920
and that's what I'm going to concentrate on in the lecture to use it to

344
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:25.150
understand molecules.
You've used it in lab to identify molecules,

345
00:23:25.151 --> 00:23:26.830
do identify functional groups,

346
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.920
but we're going to use this last thing to see what it tells us about how

347
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:31.300
molecules hold together.

348
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.930
Now just a quick excursion into physics or math to see what makes vibration

349
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:40.660
sinusoidal.
When,
when things vibrate,

350
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:45.290
we often think of them following a sine wave.
But when,
but what the,

351
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.340
what is the condition

352
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.140
<v 2>under which they do actually vibrate according to a sine wave in time?</v>

353
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.450
Okay.
Suppose that,
so if it's vibrating according into a sine wave,

354
00:23:56.451 --> 00:24:00.230
then the displacement is some height,
right?

355
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.880
Times the sine of Omega t.
That's how fast it's going up and down.

356
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.760
That describes its the displacement.
Okay.

357
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.990
So that's the frequency of t is the time and h is the half amplitude.

358
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:16.840
It can go from plus one to minus one is the sign goes back and forth.
Okay.

359
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.380
And that says the velocity,

360
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.360
the change in position with with time is the derivative of that.

361
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:27.470
So the coast side,
right.
And the uh,

362
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.340
the acceleration is the second derivative.
So it's that.

363
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.340
So,
and from that then if,

364
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.280
if the motion is sinusoidal as we said at the beginning,

365
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.640
then the acceleration divided by the displacement is minus the frequency

366
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:43.514
squared.

367
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

368
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.240
<v 2>Now Newton said that acceleration is force over mass and if things are obeying</v>

369
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.670
Hooke's law,
then the force is proportional to the displacement.

370
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:04.450
And that means we can substitute in Newton with the fours venous Fx,

371
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.133
right?

372
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:11.350
And we get that a over x is minus f over m and a over x.

373
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:15.350
We already knew as minus Omega squared.

374
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.960
And that means that the frequency squared is how strong the spring is.

375
00:25:20.961 --> 00:25:24.020
If it's Hooke's law divided by the mass,

376
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.213
<v 1>right?</v>

377
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.610
<v 2>Or if we take the square root,</v>

378
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:33.170
the frequency is the square root of the force constant divided by the mass.

379
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.420
So this,
the frequency then is interesting.

380
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.860
It's constant.
It doesn't depend on how,

381
00:25:41.861 --> 00:25:44.240
how one the amplitude of the vibration,

382
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.320
if you have a system that obeying Hooke's law,
right?

383
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.340
It'll have the same frequency no matter what the amplitude.

384
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.340
And that turned out to be very important.
Incidentally,

385
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:59.690
one of the texts were involved in does it says the opposite,
but it's not true.

386
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.440
Okay,
so why is that so important?

387
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:09.130
Hooke's law hooked book of Spring in 1678 says vibrations.

388
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.540
If you're obeying Hooke's law,

389
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:15.740
this is where he set out Hooke's law shall be of equal duration,

390
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.170
whether they be greater or less.

391
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.510
Why did he care that the frequency be always the same?

392
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.350
No matter how big the displacement is.

393
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.580
Can you see why that would make a difference?
Practically l

394
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.760
for clocks?
Okay.

395
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.370
Or more particularly for watches because you know,

396
00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:43.740
all about 90 years or 80 years later,
uh,

397
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.650
John Harrison made this marine chronometer,

398
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.250
which allowed to solve the problem of longitude,
right?

399
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:54.570
So ships could tell how far they were from Greenwich by having accurate time.

400
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.710
And if you look inside this watch,
it looks like that,
right?

401
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:02.160
There's a spring vibrating like that,
and it's really,
really clever.

402
00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:05.100
I'll show you one other thing about it.
Notice here,

403
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.240
there's a little rod that goes out here under the spring.

404
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:14.270
It's right here and it goes out until it makes a little fork there around the

405
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:20.160
spring.
Now that little leaf is by metal,

406
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.460
so it'll bend with temperature,
right?

407
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.850
So it changes the length of the spring as temperature changes to correct for the

408
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:34.680
temperature changing,
the stiffness of the spring.
Isn't that clever?

409
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.130
Okay.
That's obviously beside the point,

410
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:42.990
but it's really a neat feature of Harrison's h four chronometer.
Uh,

411
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.960
so anyhow,
when Hooke's law applies,

412
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.490
the frequency is proportional to the square root of the forced constant divided

413
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:51.420
by the bass.

414
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.680
So m is the mass and this means you could use this thing to measure the

415
00:27:58.351 --> 00:28:01.440
frequency.
You could measure a mass that way.

416
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.220
And that's what a quartz crystal micro balance does.

417
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.770
You can have a quartz crystal that will vibrate.

418
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:11.850
I mean the courts in my Timex watch does that,
right?
It vibrates at a given.

419
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.590
Keeps very good time.
Okay.
So the quartz crystal micro balance,

420
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:21.850
uh,
you can put,
you can,
if you change its mass by putting,

421
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.960
absorbing something on top of the,
of the quartz crystal,

422
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:28.260
it'll change its frequency and you could measure it.
In fact,

423
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:33.261
it's so sensitive that if you coat it with platinum and then let ethylene in to

424
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:37.620
absorb on the platinum,
right,

425
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.340
it'll get heavier and the frequency will slow down.
Right?

426
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.680
But if you then admit hydrogen,

427
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.360
the platinum catalyzes the reaction in that and the ethylene goes off and you

428
00:28:48.361 --> 00:28:49.740
can measure that,

429
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.770
that change of one mono layer of ethylene on platinum by using a quartz crystal

430
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:58.350
micro balance.
That's

431
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.820
just a neat feature.
Okay.
Uh,

432
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.710
so if we're talking not about what's going on on the surface of a quartz
crystal,

433
00:29:07.711 --> 00:29:11.160
but about molecules vibrating,
then for Adam's,

434
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:15.860
the forest constant should be how stiff the bond is.
A single bond,
uh,

435
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.890
should be easier to stretch than a double bond than a triple bond.

436
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.260
But are they really,
that is the forced constant really want proportional to one,

437
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.180
two,
three is a double bond,

438
00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:30.990
twice as strong as a single bond for this purpose of how fractally things

439
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.780
vibrate or a triple bond three times as strong.

440
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.100
So this is something we can check by using infrared spectroscopy.

441
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.740
Now with,
with respect to the mass,

442
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.560
things get more complicated because it's not just one atom that's moving.

443
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.180
Usually it would be at least two atoms that are moving.
Okay.

444
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.140
And then what do you use for the mass?
Right.

445
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.300
It turns out that in a Diatomic,
what you use is called the reduced mass.

446
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.500
It's the product of the two masses divided by their sub.

447
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.890
And we don't need to go into why that is.
Okay.

448
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.700
But what that means is that that effective mass use the Greek of you,

449
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.350
the Greek m view for instead of m,

450
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.460
that's dominated by the smaller mass,
right?

451
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.680
Because suppose m m suppose m two is really small,
right?

452
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.160
Then the denominator for practical purposes is m one m two has nothing to do

453
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:30.994
with it,

454
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:35.230
but the m one in the denominator then cancels out the on one in the numerator

455
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.980
and all you have is m two so it's the smaller thing that counts.

456
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.580
You'd usually think it would be the larger thing.
Okay,

457
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:44.470
so let's look at what that would,
for example,

458
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:46.960
for hydrogen and carbon that we're vibrating,

459
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.270
it would be one times 12 over one plus 12 almost one,
right?

460
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:56.350
The twelves almost cancel.
Okay.
If it's carbon carbon,

461
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:01.120
then it's going to be half of carbon six,
right?
It's carbon oxygen.

462
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:04.540
It's going to be 6.9 if it's carbon chlorine,

463
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:08.470
it's 8.9 so even when it gets much heavier,
it doesn't make much difference,

464
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.880
right?
It's mostly pretty much like other carbon bonds.
So,
uh,

465
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.160
what that means is that bonds involving hydrogen have really,

466
00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:22.930
really different frequencies from those involving not hydrogen,

467
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.730
right?
Because it's so much lighter,
right?

468
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.700
One to six here or more.
So it stands apart the,

469
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.640
the mass of hydrogen.
Now how about the,

470
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.880
the bonds then?

471
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:41.881
So ch then is proportional to the square root of a single bond over 0.9 that

472
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.920
reduced mass,
right?

473
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.750
And that turns out to be around 3000 wave numbers of 10 to the 14th hurts.

474
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.440
So that's how fast ch bonds vibrate,
right?

475
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.130
A Coo bond has a heavier mass,
right?

476
00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.460
6.9 versus oh 0.9 if it's a single bond,

477
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.830
that's going to be about 1100 wave numbers or three times 10 to the 13th hurts.

478
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.200
Right?
And that remember,

479
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.620
is that what you put in front in Irene to get a rate?

480
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.880
It's 10 to the 13th times that equilibrium constant to the transition state.

481
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:20.590
That's because of this.
That's how fast Adam's like carbon and oxygen vibrate.

482
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:25.400
Right?
Okay.
So a c double Bondo.
If,

483
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.610
if a double bond is twice as hard,

484
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:32.750
Pi as a single bond should be to the square root of two over 6.9 and that's

485
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:36.040
about 1500.
Right?
And that's,
that's about right.

486
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:41.670
And a triple bond is higher still with a three a for the Bot,

487
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.160
for the force constant,
right about 1900.
So you can see that,

488
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.870
that if you have a,
a spectrum where 3000 is on the left,
right?

489
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.410
And uh,
and a thousand is toward the right,
right?

490
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.870
Then you're going to have hydrogens up here,

491
00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:01.250
hydrogen stretching about 3000 and then you're going to get triple bonds,

492
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.940
double bonds,
single bonds involving other atoms,
not,

493
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.320
not a hydrogen.
Okay.
So,

494
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:14.350
but it's not that simple because a single atom is connected not to just one

495
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:19.430
other Adam,
but to others and they get in and they couple with each other's out.

496
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.320
Uh,
so this,
this,

497
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.160
our study of coupled oscillators is going to illustrate several things.

498
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.260
That complexity of what's really involved in vibration and why physical chemists

499
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:33.650
thought at the beginning that was going to be impossible to interpret anything

500
00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.050
in,
in IRR spectroscopy.

501
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.560
And then the idea of normal mode analysis of what a normal mode is and phase of

502
00:33:42.861 --> 00:33:47.840
mixing and the possibility of things being independent.

503
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.040
So you can think about a functional group having a particular thing,

504
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:55.850
not being all mixed up with others.
So for this purpose,

505
00:33:55.851 --> 00:33:59.750
we're going to look at some oscillators at this particular thing here.

506
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.930
Let's see if I get this,
get the lights I need here.
Okay,

507
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:10.340
so here,
here's a,
here's some things that will oscillate,

508
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.370
right?
So if I take this,
I can make it.
It vibrates at a certain frequency.

509
00:34:16.371 --> 00:34:19.040
It's a spring that's being bent back and forth.

510
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:23.210
So it's Hooke's law and uh,
that's what I've shown here,

511
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.920
right?
It's a simple oscillator.
I bend it,

512
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.310
I let it go at flops back and forth at a given rate,

513
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.260
and we know what that rate's going to be in.

514
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.820
The square of the frequency is going to be whatever the forest constant,

515
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:42.800
how stiff the spring is divided by the mass of that thing up on top and have the

516
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.560
spring itself of course.
Okay,
that's fine.
Uh,

517
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:50.360
now suppose we put a spring in there as well.

518
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.790
All right,

519
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:58.520
but let me hold this one fixed or hold this one fixed.
Right.

520
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.090
And I'm going to do this then.
All right.

521
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.480
Now can you tell me whether that vibration should be faster or slower than it

522
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:10.040
was when I didn't have the spring there?

523
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.560
What's the difference?

524
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.350
The difference is that now we have a stronger spring.
Everybody see that?

525
00:35:21.351 --> 00:35:24.530
Cause we've added this spring to however hard it is to bend that.

526
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.890
So it'll be going to be a higher frequency.
Right?

527
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:31.250
And we could time it and figure it out.
We don't have time to do that,
but it's,

528
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:34.100
it's faster.
Okay.
So if we have,

529
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:38.370
if it's coupled to a frozen partner like that,
I'm holding the partner,

530
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.450
then I let it go and it's,
and it,
and it stretches back and forth

531
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.320
and it has a stronger spring.
It's the,
the,

532
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:51.840
the main spring plus this little one plus s,
right.
We a couple of that in.

533
00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:55.080
So that's,
that's easy enough.
Okay.

534
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.740
Now we're going to look at it when I'm not holding up,

535
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.750
it's going to be in phase coupling,

536
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.000
so they're going to be moving the same direction.

537
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.080
So I move them both out here and I let him go and they go back and forth.

538
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.430
Now what's did that frequency B,
is this spring being stretched?

539
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.500
No.
So it's just,
it's just as it was originally.
Right?

540
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.550
So if we do this and and uh,

541
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.600
and do that and let go,
then it goes back and forth,

542
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:25.950
not stretching the spring.

543
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.610
So it's going to be this we're act or if you look at the thing as a whole,

544
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.330
there are two weights and two springs being bent.

545
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.550
So it's two af over two m but it's the same as we started with.
Okay,

546
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:43.140
that's fine.
Now the interesting one is to do out of phase coupling,

547
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.880
right?
Where they don't go in parallel but anti parallel to one another.

548
00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.093
<v 1>Right?</v>

549
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.680
<v 2>Now what about the situation here now</v>

550
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.420
is that string beans spring being stretched,
right?
In fact,

551
00:36:59.421 --> 00:37:00.440
it's being stretched,

552
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.680
stretched twice as much as it was before because the middle is staying in place,

553
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.940
right?
And both things are stretching it,
right?
So if we do that,

554
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:15.650
if we do this one out of phase coupling,
right?

555
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:21.040
And notice that the centers they is fixed right now as it does that we have a

556
00:37:21.741 --> 00:37:25.070
much stronger spring.
It's,
it's too acid in the middle now.

557
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.900
I'm sorry you can't see this very well,

558
00:37:26.901 --> 00:37:31.070
but you been looked at and when we review,
okay,
so it's two s in the middle.

559
00:37:31.071 --> 00:37:35.260
So now frequency is higher.
Okay.
Uh,

560
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.950
now,
so when,
when the two were isolated from one another,

561
00:37:39.951 --> 00:37:43.580
that is when we held one fixed and just looked at one vibrate and all we had was

562
00:37:43.581 --> 00:37:45.110
that little extra spring in the middle.

563
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:49.520
Then they would both vibrate at the same frequency.
Isolated.

564
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:51.890
Can you see it there?
I think you can.
Okay.

565
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.610
Actually let me just put it on the other screen and then you'll be able to see

566
00:37:55.611 --> 00:37:56.040
it.

567
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.060
<v 1>Uh,
yeah.
Okay,
good.</v>

568
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.323
Okay.

569
00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:08.140
<v 2>But once we,
once we let them both move and they couple their motion.
Right.</v>

570
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:12.310
Then there's an outer phase and an in phase one is higher frequency.

571
00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.920
The other is one doesn't stretch the spring one,

572
00:38:14.921 --> 00:38:17.470
the other stretches at twice as much.
Right.

573
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.870
Does this remind you of anything you've seen before

574
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.490
<v 1>that diagram?</v>

575
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.340
<v 2>It's the same thing as orbitals mixing,
right?</v>

576
00:38:27.341 --> 00:38:31.330
To give an in phase and out of phase,
the math is just the same,
right?

577
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.480
So this is called the,
this either of these,

578
00:38:34.481 --> 00:38:38.080
the end phase or the outer phase is called a normal mode.

579
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.370
The meaning of it is that in that pattern of vibration,

580
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:46.570
all the atoms are oscillating at the same frequency.
In a normal mode,

581
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.530
right?
It's a,
it's a lower frequency here

582
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.390
and a higher frequency here,
right?

583
00:38:55.391 --> 00:38:58.070
But both atoms are moving in phase with one,
you know,

584
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.750
at the same oscillation frequency.
Okay,

585
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:07.240
now we're going to do another one
in which,

586
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.550
uh,
so they moved back and forth at the same amplitude,
the same frequency,

587
00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:16.510
or when they started the same,
okay?
So that's out of phase.

588
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:18.760
And this one was in phase.
Okay.

589
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.610
Now notice that,

590
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.840
that if I added those two together,

591
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.040
those two displacements,
those two vibration patterns,

592
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.480
I would get something where one moved and the other didn't.
All right?

593
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.630
So I could do that.
Okay.

594
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.910
And what I'm saying is that that is the sum of the interphase motion

595
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.370
and the out of phase motion.
Right?
So if I send them,

596
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.790
I get this one to move and these cancel.
Okay?

597
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:58.230
So when I let go now I'm actually exciting to normal modes.

598
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.700
The in phase and the out of phase.

599
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.720
Everybody see what I'm doing because what I've done here is the sum of the two

600
00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:07.810
of them.
So now when I let go,
something neat happens.

601
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.960
So what's happening?

602
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.950
It's going back and forth between one vibrating and the other vibrating,

603
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:31.570
right?
Why?

604
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.680
Because those two modes have different frequencies and they get in step and then

605
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:42.070
out of step with one another and when they're in step with one another,

606
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.520
this one is moving.
That's how we started that and not this one.

607
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.550
And when they're out,
when it's one minus the other,

608
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:52.720
it's this and that because they have different frequencies.

609
00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:55.150
They're cycling in and out of phase with one another.

610
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:03.400
I think that's just a wonderful,
okay,

611
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.540
so that's exactly what we were looking at at the beginning,
right?

612
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:10.000
Where things went in and out of phase with one another.

613
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:14.710
That where it was one s going to two p.
Okay,

614
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:16.930
so this what we started when we moved.

615
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:20.860
Just one of them and held the other one fixed was a superposition of two normal

616
00:41:20.861 --> 00:41:22.570
modes of different frequency.

617
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:27.190
And then the vibration beats in and out of phase.
Okay,

618
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.990
so now what happens if one of them's heavy and the other ones?

619
00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:36.810
So then you can't talk about just one of them vibrating right when they're

620
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:41.090
coupled this way.
But suppose I made one of them heavier than the other.

621
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.140
So it vibrates it normally at a very different frequency.

622
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.880
Let me get this on there,
right?

623
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:55.220
And now let me move this one and let me move this one and not this one.
Right?

624
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.570
And what should happen,

625
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.770
what we saw before was the vibration goes from there to there to there,
to there,

626
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.850
right?
But now look what happens.
This one,

627
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.810
I actually moved that one a little bit at the beginning.

628
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.390
This one's not moving nearly as much as that one is.
This one keeps moving.

629
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:14.960
Remember the other one went dead still and then the other one and then the
other.

630
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.670
Now it's staying localized mostly,
right?
And if I did this one,

631
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.480
it stays mostly here.
Very little comes over there.

632
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.250
So if the two things have very different frequencies,

633
00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.870
then they don't couple very much.
Okay.

634
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.070
They stay mostly independent if they start,
if they have different independent,

635
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:41.320
different individual frequencies.
And that's exactly like,

636
00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.910
like the wave functions mixing,
right?

637
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:49.040
If we have one that's low energy and one that's high frequency and we couple

638
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:53.360
them,
right,
you'll get one that's in phase and one that's out of phase.

639
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.660
But they won't be,
they won't be very different from one another.

640
00:42:56.661 --> 00:43:01.130
It's exact analog of what gets of the energy match and overlap thing,

641
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:05.510
where the energy matches now how different the frequencies are or the energy

642
00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:08.480
mismatch.
And the overlap is how,

643
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.570
how strong this spring is between them.
Right?

644
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.450
So if I make the string really strong,

645
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:18.100
then even though they have different frequencies now,

646
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.980
there'll be more mixed with one another.
Now this is weird,

647
00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:26.600
but this one is moving more,
right?
But if I make it very weak coupling like that,

648
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:30.560
then they really stay independent of one another.
Right?

649
00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:35.120
So it's a really neat physical demonstration of what we saw last semester.

650
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.760
Okay.
That's enough of that for now.
Yes.
Okay.

651
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:47.750
So you can come and play with that afterwards if you're up to.
Okay.

652
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:49.490
Now,
uh,

653
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:54.491
so the vibration remains localized when the coupling is a weak compared to the

654
00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:00.020
energy mismatch.
Okay.
These illustrate that.

655
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.300
Okay.
So if you have a general molecule that has an atoms in it,

656
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.560
there are three in independent geometric parameters,
x,

657
00:44:09.561 --> 00:44:13.910
Y and Z for all the [inaudible] Adams.
Uh,
okay,

658
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.000
so,
but,

659
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:21.290
but it takes three numbers to say where the center of the molecule is,
right?

660
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.550
And it takes another three numbers to tell how much you rotate it around this

661
00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:27.830
access,
how much you rotated around this axis,

662
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.400
how much you rotated around this axis.
So that's,
that's three numbers.

663
00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.660
Fix the orientation.

664
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:39.110
So you have three n minus six coordinates that involve internal vibration,

665
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.290
but it's not just two atoms that are vibrating.

666
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:47.400
It's the whole set of atoms that are vibrating and in a normal mode,

667
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.680
they all vibrate at the same frequency,

668
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:53.580
but they're going to be three n minus six normal modes.

669
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:58.350
And this is where a physical chemist threw up their hands and said,

670
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:02.430
it's just so complicated how all these springs are interacting with each other,

671
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.510
that we're never going to understand it.
Right?
So forget trying to interpret,

672
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.320
okay.
For a fingerprint,
but forget trying to interpret it.

673
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:15.870
Okay.
So it sounds hopelessly complex though.
It's good for a fingerprint.

674
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.480
But remember to get mixing,

675
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:23.220
you have to have frequency match and some coupling mechanism.

676
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:28.890
So if you have some of these bonds that vibrate without similar frequencies to

677
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:32.970
anything in the neighborhood or not coupled to things in the neighborhood,

678
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.590
then they'll appear independently and you can hope to identify a particular

679
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:42.510
functional group.
So if there,
uh,
if they're isolated,
they're independent,

680
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.500
but if they're coupled,
then you see complications.
So it's again,

681
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:48.450
this question of energy or Hutcheon overlap.

682
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.070
Now let's look at butane c four h 10.
Okay.

683
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.760
It's got a 42 degrees of freedom,
42,
uh,

684
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.530
of these minus the three translations and the three rotations.

685
00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:05.640
So they're 36 vibrations,
36 normal modes that are involved.

686
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.490
Uh,
if you just had the four carbons,

687
00:46:08.491 --> 00:46:11.910
there'd be three stretches to Benz and a twist.
The top,

688
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:16.940
the torsion around the middle with 10 NCH as you have 10 stretches a and 20 bins

689
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:20.130
or twists,
right?

690
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:24.300
But it's not that simple because they get mixed up according to frequency match

691
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:28.200
and,
and coupling into 36 complicated normal modes.

692
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.240
Let's see if we can understand anything about these normal mode.

693
00:46:31.241 --> 00:46:35.040
So here's the spectrum of a hydrocarbon is Cah 18.

694
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.290
You've seen the spectrum like this at bed in lab.

695
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.460
Let's see if we get an understand what any of the peaks are.
First,

696
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:45.600
notice that there are peaks at the far left around 3000 and the others are all

697
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:49.260
1500 or below.
What do you think's up at the top high frequencies?

698
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.970
Cah is right because the HSO light.
Okay,

699
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.690
so there are 72 normal modes here,
but not all of them are.

700
00:46:57.691 --> 00:47:00.720
I are active with this c eight,
age 18.

701
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.740
So let's look at that particular peak there.
They're actually several there.

702
00:47:04.741 --> 00:47:08.010
But anyhow,
one of them is this.
So there we have a,

703
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.190
there we have the molecule,
and here we distort it.

704
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.820
Now tell me what's happening in the distortion.

705
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.550
What's mostly changing?

706
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.650
What's mostly changing?
Yeah,
this,

707
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.660
it's ch bonds are stretching and shrinking,
right?

708
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:34.860
And notice the way they're doing it in the focus on the two central ch Twos,

709
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.580
the hydrogens are moving up and down,
up and down.

710
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.440
So the charge is moving up and down,
up and down,
right?

711
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.410
So that's going to interact.
Then with light,

712
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.830
that's pointed with an electric field of life.
It's pointing in that way.

713
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:56.070
So light can help push those four central H's up and down the the molecule,

714
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.270
enter that particular vibration.

715
00:47:58.271 --> 00:48:02.350
That particular normal mode interacts with light and you get absorption of light

716
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:05.650
at that position.
Okay?
When it's up,
it pushes it one way.

717
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:08.960
When the field is down and pushes it the other way and we interact with light.

718
00:48:08.961 --> 00:48:10.420
So that's a Cah stretch.

719
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.680
Now how about this one here we have or one of the peaks under there,

720
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:18.730
at least here it's this and then that.
What's happening now,

721
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:26.430
what bonds are changing,
but kind of bonds.
Is that CC or ch?

722
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.760
It's Cah.
And notice how they're doing.

723
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.750
They're all going in or out together,
right?

724
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.570
So that's going to do it.
What direction of the lights?

725
00:48:37.571 --> 00:48:39.550
Electric Vector will excite this.

726
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.070
It's going to be perpendicular to the screen,
right?
To push them all in,
all out.

727
00:48:45.071 --> 00:48:48.700
So it's a different polarization of the light that's going to do this one.

728
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:52.390
It's going to be the light that goes that way or it goes that way.
Okay.

729
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:56.290
Now there are a lot of others that we won't go into.
One of them is this,

730
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.460
look at this.
Now,
what's happening now?
Again,

731
00:49:00.461 --> 00:49:02.260
we're stretching ch bonds.

732
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.560
How strongly is this going to interact with light?

733
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.330
Notice for every age that goes one way.

734
00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.660
There's another age that goes exactly the opposite way.

735
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:21.130
So those cancel out and there's no interaction with light.

736
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:25.210
So that sort of breathing where they're all going out and then at the same time,

737
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.470
right,
doesn't interact.
You don't see that in the Ivr.
So,
in fact,

738
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.860
half of the half of the,
of this,

739
00:49:32.861 --> 00:49:36.850
the 10 Cah stretching,
normal modes have no handle on them.

740
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.860
They don't change the dipole moment,
so they don't absorb light.
Okay.

741
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:45.400
Uh,
and that's where we're going to have to stop now and go onto the other peaks

742
00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:45.880
next time.
