00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
Hey it's me Destin. When my granddad was young he lost an eye

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
playing cowboys and indians, so tonight I'm gonna show you why you should always wear safety glasses

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.130
or goggles when you're doing an experiment. This isn't very popular

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.170
because I've been hiding something pretty weird inside my refrigerator for

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.210
about 5 months.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:39.980
   

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.380
By now you've figured out that I have a wife who tolerates me and I love her very much.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.400
One thing that she's been tolerating for the past five months is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.530
a set of cow eyeballs that I've been keeping in the refrigerator. I'm now

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.570
probably the world renowned expert in eyeball juggling.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.590
These cow eyeballs are to make a humorous video, and by

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.610
humorous I don't mean funny. Vitreous humor is a liquid that is inside

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.620
of your eye and when you were younger you looked up at the sky and you had that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.740
nice monochromatic background and a real small pupil cause it was bright, and you saw these things

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.750
floating around in your eye. Those are what I call floaties. This is your eyeball.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.780
Now you'll notice there's fluid on the inside. When you rotate your eyeball

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.800
the fluid tends to stay in the same position due to it's inertia.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.830
So even though the floater's on the inside, in this case fish,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.860
he doesn't move because the fluid isn't moving. That's why when you see

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.890
a floater when you're looking at the sun it's so hard to track because it moves at some erratic

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.930
pattern based on the fluid velocity, not necessarily the eyeball velocity.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.000
We have goggles and there's no stopping us now.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.010
So I've got a Phantom v10 high speed camera. It's setup using a technique

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.050
called the long flash technique. So here's a flash, and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.060
I've aligned on a cow eyeball using a laser

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.170
that is put in the muzzle of the rifle. We're using this

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.200
piezzo electric transducer to trigger

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.240
a quantum composer pulse generator to trigger it at the proper time

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.250
to illuminate and give us some really cool footage.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.260
That looks weird, but I like it.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.300
Bullet vs cow eye... [bang]

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.360
Alright here's the bullet. You can see a little smoke trail behind it.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.400
Urgh. That's pretty nasty. Oh that's cool.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.980
It kind of blew up but the musculature on the outside held it together.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.510
So what happens here, it actually hasn't exited yet, so the bullet

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.580
is inside the eyeball.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.580
Oh man, total destruction. And so that's what happens in less than a millisecond.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.630
This time the lens came out and you can see around the edges of it where the ciliary

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.270
body connects.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.710
I might just pop the end off there... yeah.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.730
I forgot to trigger the camera.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.810
But, I did make a cool spiral galaxy out of vitreous humor.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.940
Oh you gotta see this, the lens popped out.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.010
If I was Bear Grylls I'd eat this. It all stayed together.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.210
Oh look at that. Alright this thing is called the ciliary body. It's just behind the lens.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.230
Oh man. If this doesn't burn vitreous

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.980
humor into your mind, I don't know what will. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.280
Take away. Always wear eye protection. People will make fun of you, but be smarter than them.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.330
So I hope you found my video humorous. Ahh see what I did there?

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.360
If you did please subscribe, and also consider

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.380
this other channel they're called the Slomoguys. They're in the UK, they do cool stuff too.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.380
They have Phantoms and they do really neat experiments. They just talk a little funny.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.430
But anyways I hope you're getting Smarter Every Day, and tell your friends.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.440
We'll see you next week.
