00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.950
Thank you for coming for
the second installment here

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.180
of the College of
Science lecture series.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.720
It's a much more pleasant,
quiet, and comfortable place

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.440
than McKale.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.550
I can guarantee you that.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.129
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.420
I will do better, no, I
don't know about that.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.990
So I want to thank our
underwriters first--

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
the Arizona Daily Star,
Carondelet, Galileo Circle,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.030
Godat Design, Holualoa
Companies, Miraval Resort

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.270
and Spa, Raytheon, Research
Corporation for Science

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.640
Advancement, Tucson
Electric Power,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.450
and Ventana Medical Systems,
for making it possible for all

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.702
of us to see this for free.

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:42.966
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.210
Today we're in for a treat
at exactly the right time.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.180
Michael Worobey studies viruses.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.750
Half of us seem to be
having a virus lately.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.509
So it's a perfect time to
listen about pandemics.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.300
Let me tell you a little
bit about Michael.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.280
He is an extraordinary
individual.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.040
And we're very lucky that
he is in this town with us.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.880
He's an evolutionary
biologist, Michael Worobey.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.470
He grew up in British Columbia.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.420
In 1997 he left Canada for
Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.510
earning his doctorate there, and
staying on as a research fellow

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.340
at St. John's College.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.240
He came here in 2003, and
is now Professor of Ecology

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.950
and Evolutionary Biology.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.530
He's a Packard Fellow,
and a National Academy

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.780
of Sciences Kavli Fellow.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.520
Dr. Worobey's
research integrates

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.350
molecular and
computational methods

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.680
with historical, archival,
and epidemiological approaches

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.370
to investigate when, where,
how, and why pathogens,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.870
like HIV and influenza viruses,
emerge from animal reservoirs

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.790
and cause pandemics.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.810
As you'll see from
this lecture, Mike

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.870
is something of a
fanatical sleuth.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.610
He could be actually on TV.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.140
His research
involves field work,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.610
such as collecting samples from
wild chimpanzees in Africa,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.800
molecular biology, and
developing and applying

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.110
new techniques for
recovering viral RNA

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.260
and DNA from ancient
or degraded specimens,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.650
and molecular evolutionary
analysis of gene sequences.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.040
He's made several
seminal discoveries,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.210
establishing how and when
HIV jumped from chimpanzees,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.670
spread for decades in
Africa, and then emerged

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.770
in North America and elsewhere.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.560
Mike was also one of the
leaders of an international team

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.310
of researchers that pinpointed
the origin of the 2009

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.870
swine flu epidemic within
weeks of its discovery.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.460
When its 110, Mike takes off
from Tucson, so he's smart.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.670
And he takes off to the
west coast of Vancouver,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.580
where he's trying to
transform a pile of cedar logs

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.050
into a cabin with the
help of his chainsaw.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.916
Mike.

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:59.524
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:00.190
Thanks, Joaquin.

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:07.610
My clicker?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.160
So you can tell
from Joaquin's voice

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.210
that he's the most
dedicated Dean of Science.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.820
He actually got
influenza in preparation

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.080
for my talk tonight.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.550
Just to set the stage.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.930
I want to start tonight
with some numbers.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.480
So influenza doesn't just cause
pandemics, worldwide epidemics.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.730
It's also a seasonal virus.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.320
It gets established in
the human population.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.210
There are two lineages,
H1N1 and H3N2,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.197
that circulate every year.

00:03:43.197 --> 00:03:44.280
And here are some numbers.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.520
So every year 5% to 30% of
the population gets Infected.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.860
Most of us were probably
infected by the time

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.960
we were five years old.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.960
And that first infection
kind of sets the stage

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.090
for the rest of your life.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.624
Your immune system
remembers that first virus,

00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:05.790
and for the rest of your
life kind of responds to it

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.630
every time you're reinfected.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.240
You get it for about a week
and then you clear the virus.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.430
And it's gone until the
next time you encounter it.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.010
So just regular old flu every
year accounts for, on average,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.220
31 million outpatient
visits in the US.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.840
200,000 people end
up in the hospital,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.820
for a total of 3.1
million hospitalized days.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.410
Total economic burden $87
billion-- that's medical cost,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.710
work lost, work time
lost, and so forth.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.040
And the bottom line
is it kills something

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.980
like 30,000 people
in an average year.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.230
So this is a serious disease,
more than half a million

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.240
worldwide usually each year.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.450
And if you tally those
up, every year in the US,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.320
people's lives are
cut short by a total

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.590
of more than 600,000 years.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.160
Let's go back to 1918 now.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:14.425
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:16.550
So we're missing the audio
here but we're getting--

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.430
It was the worst
epidemic this country--

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.013
- There it is.

00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:18.891
- Has ever known.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.050
It killed more Americans
than all the wars

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.767
this century combined.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.904
It was a phantom, and we
didn't know where it was.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.040
In a gradual remorseless way, it
kept moving closer and closer.

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:45.020
But you never knew
from day to day

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.170
who was going to be
next on the death list.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.230
There were so many people
dying that you ran out

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.067
of things that you'd never
considered running out

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:55.775
before-- caskets.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.100
Before it was over, it
almost broke America apart.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.870
I remember my mother
putting a white sheet,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.870
a white piece of
cloth over his face,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.995
and they closed the casket.

00:06:22.403 --> 00:06:23.880
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.760
So 1918 was different.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.190
There's never been
an epidemic as

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.940
lethal as what happened
with flu in 1918.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.650
You can see it here on this
graph of mortality rates

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.230
by year, from about
1900 up to the 1990s.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.340
It's not too hard to see 1918.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.700
Absolutely unprecedented,
not just for flu,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.000
but for any other pathogen
to kill so many people

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.810
in such a short time.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.320
In the US, at a time
when the population was

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.130
maybe a third of what it
is now, 675,000 people

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.650
died, most of them within
about three months--

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.530
October, November, December.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.760
In that year, the culling
by the Spanish flu

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.400
actually dropped the average
lifespan in the US by 12 years.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.240
Around the world, something
like 50 million people died.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.260
Estimates range even
as high as 100 million,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.070
and possibly for instance, 20
million just in India alone.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.270
So this was just
unlike anything we've

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.450
ever seen before or since.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.130
And still about 100
years after it happened,

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.298
we don't really know why.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.430
So what I do is
evolutionary genomics.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.250
So I take the genomes sequenced
from things like influenza

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.280
virus, and when possible I line
them up against other genomes

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.710
from the same
germs, and then try

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.130
to read the history of
those germs from the DNA,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.000
essentially.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.210
This is a figure from the
paper that Joaquin alluded to.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.060
In 2009 when the swine
flu jumped into humans,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.180
we tried to figure out
where it came from,

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.490
what species that jumped from,
and when it made the move.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.370
And I'll come back to that.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.150
But basically at
this stage, I just

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.260
want to communicate how
rich the information is, now

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.440
that we have full genomes.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.690
And for flu we have
tens of thousands

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.020
of complete genomes
that are available.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.159
I used to read National
Geographic when I was young.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.690
And I can remember
looking at stories

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.420
where you have an
archaeological dig,

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.240
and little hints about things
that happened in the deep past.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.810
And thinking, you know,
that's really great,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.330
but this kind of wistful
feeling of, there

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.960
must be so much that
we'll never know about.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.700
And genomics, and evolutionary
genomics in particular,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.020
is taking us back in time to
places where 15, 20 years ago,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.660
we thought we couldn't go.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.100
But when you have a
collection of genomes,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.670
that collected information can
tell really important stories.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.190
Every one of these
virus particles presents

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.630
two main things to the
outside world, i.e.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.460
our immune system--
an H and an N.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.600
The H you can think
of like a key.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.360
That's the key for the
virus to get into the cell.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.540
And the N you can think
of like a little scalpel.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.720
When those new virions,
those new virus particles,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.490
are made in the cell,
after the genome,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.660
those eight segments takes over
the machinery inside the cell,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.400
and turns it into a factory
for making new flu viruses.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.470
The N protein on the
outside of the virus

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.410
cuts a little hole, essentially,
for those near virus

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.470
particles to escape.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.320
Those antibodies
that you saw, this

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.270
is promotional material
from a drug company.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.050
They make antibodies
essentially as drugs.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.690
Our own body makes antibodies.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.850
And every time we're exposed
to a new germ like flu,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.860
it's like a little R&amp;D project.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.640
Our immune system comes up
with essentially a drug,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:29.710
a molecule that binds
either to HA, the H,

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.369
or to N, the scalpel.

00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:32.660
And it's just physical binding.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.220
It just gets in the way
of those viral proteins

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.440
from doing what they
need to do for the virus

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.700
to complete its life cycle.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.080
It's as simple as that.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.030
And those eight genome segments
contain the information

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.400
not just for the H and the N,
but for all the other dozen

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.990
or so proteins that allow
the flu to do its thing.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.480
And so here is a flu genome.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.910
This is the one
and only complete

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.940
genome that you're likely to
see during this series of talks,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.120
because RNA viruses are
very sensible and thrifty.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.450
And they can do the whole thing
in about 10,000 nucleotides,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:07.950
OK?

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.130
So that's one segment.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.240
And you can read the
A's, C's, G's and T's.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.730
That's the segment that
codes for the key, H.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.730
And that's the scalpel,
N. And that's it.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:25.050
That's all that the
flu needs to take over

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.670
our giant bloated genome
and start turning the knobs

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.870
and making it do what it
wants our genome to do,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.500
which is to create more
copies of the virus.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.530
And so you can think of the
battle between flu virus

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.650
and the immune system
as a boxing match.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.170
And in one corner
you have the virus

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.390
that brings to the table this
H protein, the key to get in,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.470
and the N protein, the
scalpel to cut out.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.020
But we come to the table
with something as well.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.230
After that initial exposure
when we're children,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.940
we make antibodies, sorry,
to both of those proteins.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.490
So that the next time we see
an influenza virus in our body,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.800
we bind those antibodies
to it, and if not kill it,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.880
slow it down.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.870
And that can make the difference
between pneumonia and death

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:24.678
after you get flu, or a kind
of cough and a mild fever.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.620
So this kind of dynamic, where
you have the immune system

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.960
kind of putting up this
barrier, and the flu attempting

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.890
to get around it, sets up
what evolutionary biologists

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.840
call Red Queen dynamics.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.340
And it's named
after the Red Queen

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.840
from Through the
Looking Glass, who

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.330
said "it takes all
the running you can

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.166
do to keep in the same place."

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:51.540
And you see this
a lot in nature.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.220
It's kind of an arms race.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.400
Our antibodies bind to the flu,
so once you get this year's flu

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.140
strain, next year's
flu strain had better

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.360
be a little bit
different in the H

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.860
and the N, otherwise
it's not going

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.380
to be able to pierce
your defenses.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.010
And that Red Queen arms
race kind of dynamic

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.270
is why you need to get a
new flu vaccine every year.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.580
Unlike things like
measles, the flu

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.690
evolves, so that your initial
immunity doesn't necessarily

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.202
do the trick next time
you encounter the virus.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.500
So there's another small
element of the story

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.900
that I want to
introduce you to here.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.400
It was discovered by this
guy, Tom Francis Jr.,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.730
who actually trained Jonas Salk,
and developed the first flu

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.430
vaccine that was used during
World War II, Pretty much

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.760
the same technology that
we use today, actually.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.260
And he noticed something
really weird in the late 1940s.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.930
So in the late 1940s there was
a complete vaccine failure.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.580
The flu that was out
there had changed

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.920
so much that the
previous vaccine just

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.570
didn't do any good whatsoever.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.000
And so he was doing
experiments, and noticed

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.320
that when he gave a vaccine
based on the new flu

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.660
variant that had replaced
the old one to teenagers,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.820
instead of making antibodies
to the new variant

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.370
as you would hope your
immune system would do,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.680
it actually boosted
up the old antibodies

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.130
that it remembered
from-- that each person's

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.480
immune system remembered from
their childhood infection.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.570
And he named that process
the original antigenic sin.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.110
So it's kind of like
the other original sin,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.500
that it kind of taints
you for life, potentially.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.870
And it's part of the story.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.560
We'll come back to it.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.840
But what that's
important for is the year

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.454
to year dynamics of the
things like H1N1 and H3N2

00:14:53.454 --> 00:14:54.870
that are the
seasonal strains now.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.640
It's less important
for this process which

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.890
is the other big way
that influenza comes up

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.170
with evolutionary novelty.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.640
Instead of just making minor
tweaks to the H or the N,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.580
every once in a
while, a new flu virus

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.180
is created that mixes
and matches segments

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.350
from two different viruses.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.590
So if you have a person
infected with H1N1,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.240
and as happens
from time to time,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.310
that person is
simultaneously infected

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.520
with a bird virus that
normally doesn't infect humans,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.260
the virus that comes out that
person can be an H1N7, if you

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.070
have one segment or more from
that bird virus jumping in.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.080
We call that re-assortment.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.510
And that's, as you might
imagine, a kind of game

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.740
changer.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.250
Whatever immunity you had to N1
from your childhood infection

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.840
or lifetime exposure,
it's useless.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.070
N7 is so different
antigenically,

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.270
that your antibodies
to the previous version

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.730
don't really help you.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.450
And that process,
this jumping in

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.430
of complete genome
segments from nature,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.340
from non-human
reservoirs, is what

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.900
ushers in what we
call pandemics, which

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:21.260
are these worldwide big
epidemics that are occasioned

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.740
by completely new
genetic diversity

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.850
from the pool of various
subtypes of virus

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:33.040
that exist in these animal
hosts, jumping into humans

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.320
and starting to spread.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.520
And so when that happens,
let's say in 1957,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.820
after H1N1 circulated,
an H2N2 virus

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.670
jumped into humans in 1957.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:50.230
At that point on an individual
level and a population level

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.800
there was almost no
protection from age H2N2.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.270
And so you have a big year, a
couple million people dying,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.010
instead of half a million.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.270
In 1918 you had
the same process.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:06.040
You had some new stuff coming
in, but 50 million people died.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:12.280
So this is the kind of layered
history of the virus from now,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.390
when we have H1N1 and H3N2
circulating, back in time.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.760
If you were born before '57,
your childhood infection,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.160
your first exposure was to H1N1.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.890
That set the stage for
the rest of your life.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.642
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:37.400
No one was safe.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.480
In Washington, Victor
Vaughn was working late

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.820
trying to make sense
of the hellish chaos.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.250
He uncovered an unnerving fact.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.020
Usually influenza
kills only the weak,

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.380
the very young, and very old.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.280
But this time it had
a different target.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.530
People in the very prime
of life from 21 to 29

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.310
were the most vulnerable of all.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.660
This infection, like war, kills
the young, vigorous, robust

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.290
adults.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.700
The husky male either made
a speedy and rather abrupt

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:24.060
recovery, or was likely to die.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.030
The situation was upside
down and backwards.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.290
A disease that's supposed
to be a mild disease

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.220
is killing people.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.000
The people it's killing
are the strongest members,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.657
the most robust
members of our society.

00:18:37.657 --> 00:18:38.240
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.050
OK so the plot thickens.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:45.250
Not only was 1918 unusual in the
large number of people dying,

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.370
but the wrong people were dying.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:54.060
Flu's supposed to kill very old
people and very young infants.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:59.010
But in 1918, you had this
extra peak in mortality

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.650
in 20 to 40 year olds,
and really focused in

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:09.000
on people about 25 to 29,
who normally almost never die

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.713
from flu compared to the
rest of the age groups.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.800
And so there are several
kind of mysteries,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.120
but there are also
clues that we need

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.090
to address here if
we want to figure out

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.830
what happened in 1918.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.200
So first is that young people,
young adults, were dying.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.660
And that's unusual.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.570
The second is while
young adults were dying,

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.040
the very age that normally
does most of the dying in a flu

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:48.330
epidemic, the most elderly, they
actually died in fewer numbers

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.790
than they did
during seasonal flu.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.370
So if you just compare
the mortality among, say,

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.790
85 year olds in 1918, in
the midst of the worst

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:00.360
pandemic, the worst epidemic of
disease that humanity has ever

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.640
faced, the most
vulnerable people actually

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.030
died at lower levels than
they had in the five years

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.160
before from whatever
flu strain existed then.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.820
Very strange.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.190
Another key thing, when
you watch documentaries

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.910
about the flu, the 1918
flu, or hear about it,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.120
you often hear scary
stories of people

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.300
turning blue, feeling fine, and
dropping dead a couple of hours

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.280
later.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.760
Those cases happened
occasionally.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.390
But the vast majority of people
who died from flu, including

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.290
those young people
in 1918, died of

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.660
secondary bacterial pneumonia.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.120
Which is the way flu
has always killed,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.070
and it's the way it kills now.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.000
So I have a picture up
here of a garbage can.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.770
And it is a garbage
can, not a trash can,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.686
because it's Canadian.

00:20:50.686 --> 00:20:52.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.740
And this garbage can
is one like the one

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.590
that killed my 93-year-old
grandfather a few years ago.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.740
So a few years ago he
fell in his kitchen.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.980
He busted a rib on
the garbage can.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.190
And several weeks later,
after contracting pneumonia

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.610
and getting congestive
heart failure, he died.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:17.290
And you can think of flu,
in 1918 and otherwise,

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.980
like that garbage can, or
like a shot to the ribs.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.310
It lands you on your
back for a few weeks.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.610
It creates inflammation,
fluid buildup in your lungs

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:33.340
where you need them clear
for oxygen, for gas exchange.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:38.500
And pneumonia is
really, really deadly.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.160
It always has been,
and it still is.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.220
And that's what
killed people in 1918.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.920
The other clue is that
it was an H1N1 virus.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.810
And so how do we know that?

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:54.130
We know that because people like
Jeff Taubenberger and his team

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.610
have actually gone back to
tissue samples from 1918.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:03.190
So here we have wax-embedded
autopsy tissue samples

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.250
taken from a victim
of the Spanish flu.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.950
And Jeff Taubenberger
and his team

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.970
take slices of that
material, and they amplify up

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.850
that genome that we saw before.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:24.230
So we know exactly, genetically,
what this thing looked like.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.900
In fact, the one complete
genome that we have from 1918

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.370
comes from here.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.660
So this is a place called
Brevig Mission, which

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.310
is a little village in Alaska.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.580
And in 1918, the
Spanish flu pretty much

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.320
wiped out the whole village.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.590
And a lot of people
ended up in mass graves.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:50.560
And this guy here, [? Johan ?]
[? Holten, ?] is a virologist,

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.780
who for years had been saying we
might be able to get virus out

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.810
of those graves.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.790
If they were buried
in permafrost,

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.850
you might have good
preservation of material.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:09.280
He tried in the '50s, at a time
before genomics and amplifying

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.570
gene sequences.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.160
What he needed to
do then was actually

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.890
get a live virus-- couldn't
do it, not possible.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.660
Everything's kind of
dead and fragmented.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.980
So he went back in the
'90s on a solitary trip.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.420
I thought this was funny.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.690
So he carried just one tool,
a pair of garden clippers

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.880
borrowed from his wife,
without permission.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.140
And let me just go back.

00:23:34.532 --> 00:23:35.156
There they are.

00:23:35.156 --> 00:23:36.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.960
OK?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.150
So from this mass grave, via
Mrs. [? Holten's ?] garden

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.140
clippers, to the big screen.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.110
That's not just a flu genome.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:55.540
That is the Spanish flu
genome from that victim

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.330
from that mass grave in Alaska.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.470
Those A's, C's, G's
and T's are the virus

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.630
that killed that person
and so many others in 1918.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.700
And I can remember when the
first full gene came out

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.050
in 1998.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.820
And it was very exciting
because finally we

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.830
had insight into why this
thing killed so many people,

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.830
and killed young people.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:26.170
We had the full gene of the H
protein, this most important

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.000
gene of all.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.080
And it was published.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.680
And it was kind of like
hmm, there's nothing here.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.170
There's no smoking gun.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.380
There's nothing you can
see in the actual genome

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.080
sequence that really
tells us anything

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.720
about why it was so nasty.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.600
And it turns out you need
more than just one genome.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.480
You need to put it into
context of other ones.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.690
So those are the clues.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.380
But we're left with
really big questions.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.080
Did this virus jump
in from a bird?

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.550
Did it come from swine influenza
and human influenza swapping

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.360
genes?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.080
Some people interpret
the data in that way.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.010
When did it happen?

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.450
We don't really know when
this virus came together.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.630
And we don't know where.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:18.265
We don't even know which
hemisphere this occurred in.

00:25:18.265 --> 00:25:20.140
There's good agreement
on a couple of points.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.750
One, we have no idea
why young people

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.460
died in such high numbers.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.427
And two, the Spanish
flu wasn't from Spain.

00:25:27.427 --> 00:25:29.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.510
So Spain was one of the only
countries in Western Europe

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.405
that didn't have press
censorship during World War I.

00:25:34.405 --> 00:25:37.930
So in the summer when things
started heating up with the flu

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.450
pandemic, they were
publishing stories.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.820
And so everyone
associated it with Spain.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.470
OK so back to what I do.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:52.770
So I look at genome sequences
of this sort and compare them.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:57.000
And I'll just take you
through this 2009 example

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.320
to warm you up for 1918.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.030
OK so the main tool here is
called a phylogenetic tree,

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.830
or an evolutionary tree.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.150
This is the first
phylogenetic tree ever,

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.720
in Darwin's notebook from 1937.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.910
And what a
phylogenetic tree does

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.590
is describes a process of
common ancestors splitting

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.660
into independent lineages.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.450
And whether this
is a species that

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.490
gets separated
into geographically

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.840
isolated populations, and enough
time passes, and enough DNA

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.430
mutations occur independently,
or whether you're

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:40.230
looking at descendants
of a single female,

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.740
my wife is in the audience
and we have two daughters.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.180
So 10,000 years
from now, you might

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.700
find some people
trace back to Hazel,

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.260
and some people
trace back to Iris.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.530
Whatever happened in
terms of DNA mutations

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.050
along each of those
lineages was independent.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.970
And that forms the
branches on the tree.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.300
So it's a fundamental
tool in biology.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.490
So fundamental, you
might want to get

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.760
it tattooed on your body.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.520
It's a very fresh
looking tattoo.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.810
When you do an images
search of this,

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.110
you get about a dozen
different tattoos

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.070
of people who
independently thought,

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.070
I'm going to be the only
person in the world who

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.968
has this tattoo.

00:27:17.968 --> 00:27:21.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.360
OK so here's a tree.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:28.350
Here's a real schematic
phylogenetic tree,

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.710
where if you looked at a
bunch of human DNA sequences,

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.630
they would trace back
to a common ancestor

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.910
about 100,000 years ago.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.330
If you compared them
to chimpanzee DNA,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.880
there's many more
changes in each lineage

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.040
before you get back to
the common ancestor,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.740
say five million years ago.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.790
So now let's switch
to 2009 swine flu.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:56.700
So the new flu that jumped
into humans in 2009, we found

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.700
traced back to an ancestor
not too many months,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.260
maybe four months, before
the first case was noticed.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.070
But if you compare the human
virus to the closest pig

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.830
viruses, and every one
of the eight segments

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.940
was a pig segment, so this
thing jumped directly from pigs.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.900
You have to go back
to about 10 years ago.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.120
And what that means is that
the actual constellation

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.500
of genome segments that
formed that 2009 virus,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.560
formed many years before
it jumped into humans,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.200
and spread cryptically in pigs.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.110
And our surveillance of
pigs is obviously so bad

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.020
that no one knew about it
until it jumped into humans.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.530
OK so how do you
get those dates?

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.490
This is kind of one of the main
things I do in my research.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.180
And with viruses they evolve so
quickly, that you can actually

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.330
see evolution
happen in real time.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:59.310
And you can liken
it to a saguaro.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.100
And there are, I know, quite
a few Canadians in the crowd.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.110
So just imagine a Douglas
fir tree and you'll be OK.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.570
If you just go out
into your front yard

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.090
and look at your
cactus, it's really hard

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.480
to guess how old it is if you
don't have anything to go on.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:20.280
But if you had say, a picture
from 1999, and then another one

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:27.900
from 2009, now just with 10
years window of observation,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.040
you can start to get an idea
of how fast the thing grows.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.140
And maybe you would
extrapolate back and say,

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.180
it's about 100 years old.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.130
So what we do with
viruses is the same.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.980
We sample them at different
time points, calibrate

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.810
what we call a molecular
clock, and then you

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.810
use that to-- this is
Salvador Dali's painting

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.550
called Bayesian phylogenetics
and relaxed molecular clocks.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:03.880
So if you do that
with influenza,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.120
what I noticed about a year
and a-- so this project

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.700
really kind of got rolling
a year and a half ago.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.580
One night I had a whole bunch
of these evolutionary trees

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.260
out on my kitchen table.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.380
And I was actually using
my daughter's plastic ruler

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.720
to just measure the
kind of-- the distance

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.180
from the base of the
cactus to the tip,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.270
and compare that to the date.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.360
The same thing with the cactus,
except with these actual trees.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.990
And what really came out
was that the virus evolves,

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.230
the clock ticks at a
very different rate,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:38.520
in viruses infecting say,
pigs, on the one hand,

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.030
or humans on the other,
or horses, or birds.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.130
And you can't just
average across them.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.730
If you average across
them, things go wrong.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:52.592
So I started collaborating
with a couple of other people,

00:30:52.592 --> 00:30:54.800
[? Gwangju ?] [? Hahn, ?]
who is my graduate student.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.950
[? Gwangju, ?] are you
in the audience here?

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.440
There he is,
excellent PhD student.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.320
And so [? Gwangju ?] and I
started gathering together

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.670
all of the genome sequences
of flu, more than 100,000

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.990
of these genome segments.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.120
And then teamed up with this
guy here, Andrew Rambaut,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.450
who I worked with in Oxford.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.590
He's one of the best
all around biologists,

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.390
and an incredible
computer program.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.820
And we came up with a method
that just kind of makes

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.280
that simple correction
of allowing the clock

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.160
to tick at different rates.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.520
And he's a very good biologist,
especially considering

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.701
he's only 18 inches tall.

00:31:32.701 --> 00:31:33.200
He's just-

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:33.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.140
- Absolutely amazing.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.120
The truth is I,
of course, didn't

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.110
email him asking for a picture.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.170
I just did a Google
Images search.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.300
When you Google
images, Andrew Rambaut,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.090
you get phylogenetic trees, and
two very low quality photos,

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:49.965
including this one.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.440
So those are my
main collaborators.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.690
I also want to thank Tom
Watts, who's my lab manager,

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.570
and has a hand in
everything I do.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.400
And also my wife.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.770
So while I've been
doing this project,

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.380
I've been kind of
immersed, living

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.080
between about 1872 and 1918.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.450
And thinking about 50
million dead people,

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.000
and particularly for
the last six months.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.160
My main goal normally in life
is to make my wife laugh.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.380
And I haven't been
doing that too much

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.770
over the course of this project.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.320
But with this tool in
hand, what we found,

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.600
was basically
everything that had

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.690
been done in the
last 10 or 15 years

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.390
on evolutionary trees
of flu, including stuff

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:38.870
that we had done, was wrong.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.800
And this is just a kind of
figurative representation.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.390
But everything that you
do without correcting

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.110
for the different
clock rates is kind

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.120
of like looking through
a fun house mirror.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.834
When you make the correction,
everything snaps into place.

00:32:53.834 --> 00:32:55.500
And I know what you're
thinking, that it

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.660
doesn't look any better now than
it did in the previous slide.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.194
But I'll take you through it.

00:33:01.194 --> 00:33:02.360
It's not as bad as it looks.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.290
OK, so here's this
Brevig Mission.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.760
This is the flu sequence
from one genome segment

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.910
from that 1918 patient.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.790
And you see, that's 1918 there.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.280
And it's nested in a
little part of the family

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.810
tree along with human
viruses and pig viruses.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.470
And just a few
years before 1918,

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:29.630
it jumped from a bird,
boom, right there.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.130
And it jumped from
a bird that lived

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.930
in the Western hemisphere.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.870
So this whole big
family tree kind of

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.270
splits into two main lineages.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.720
One-- all these black lineages
are from bird viruses.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.330
One from the Western
hemisphere, another

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.180
from the eastern
hemisphere, and they

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.870
trace back to a virus
at this point here,

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:58.580
that existed a few
years after 1872, OK?

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.040
So we're getting somewhere
now, at least for this segment.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.060
This thing seems to have jumped
from a bird not too many years

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.949
before 1918, and probably
from the Western hemisphere.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:13.635
Also check out that horse
lineage while I get a drink.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.300
So this was a big surprise.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.280
This horse lineage, known from
just a handful of sequences,

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.860
first isolated by a
woman in Prague in 1956.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.469
And it probably went
extinct in the '70s.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.429
So no one cares about.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:37.389
No one even includes it
in analyses normally.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:39.800
But we were doing a
comprehensive analysis,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.030
and we included it.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.219
And it turned out to be a
kind of key to the story.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.159
We'll get back to
it in a second.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:50.969
Now let me take you from that
one genome sequence to six.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:53.550
So now we've got six of the
genome sequences, everything

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:58.850
except that key G and
N. And all six of them

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.830
have this, basically the same
story-- the human virus jumping

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.530
from birds shortly before 1918.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.380
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.600
Western hemisphere,
Western hemisphere.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.930
So what this looks
like is a single event.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:20.510
A single virus brought all
of these avian influenza

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.430
genome segments into
the Spanish flu genome

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:30.410
a few years before 1918.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:34.380
Let's now zoom in
on one of them.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.760
So here's our 1918 sequence.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.240
There's the related human ones
that circulated up to 1957.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.240
Most of you in the
crowd tonight would

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.160
have been exposed to that.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.310
But that 1918 virus jumped
from a bird really close

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:58.010
to 1918, and probably
from Canada or the US.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.950
All of the closely related
viruses are from North America.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.990
So now we're
getting even closer.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.180
Six of those genome
segments seem

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.970
to have jumped in
from North America.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.310
And if you look at
the species here,

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:17.780
the conventional wisdom is that
flu jumps from wild waterfowl.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.380
That's the basic
conventional wisdom

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.590
about the reservoir of flu.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.430
That's the natural
home of flu viruses.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.660
And every once in a while an
accident, an unnatural event

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.930
happens, and one of those
genes jumps into humans.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.850
Well it could have
been a turkey,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.099
could have been a chicken.

00:36:36.099 --> 00:36:38.390
And starts to look a little
bit more like the situation

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:44.270
now, with H5N1, which is this
virus that infects poultry

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.550
worldwide.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.830
And about which there's a
tremendous amount of concern

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.950
that it might make the jump.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:56.060
OK let's now go back
to the horses, OK?

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.140
Same pattern, horse
horse horse horse horse.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.040
So at node one here,
what you're looking at

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.110
is the ancestor of that big bird
lineage that gave rise to most

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.030
of the Spanish flu genome.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.670
And a horse lineage,
and at node 1

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.500
there's just two possibilities.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.260
Either that was a virus that was
in a bird and jumped to a horse

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.670
at that point.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:26.086
Or it was in a horse,
and jumped into a bird.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:33.050
So now the story is going
to get even more strange.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.420
And believe me, when I
was doing this research,

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.640
and started making inferences
about what happened

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.880
and when it happened,
I actually didn't

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.630
know about the great
epizootic of 1872.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.430
And if actually, if
you wouldn't mind,

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.930
can you raise your
hand if you've

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:53.360
heard about the great
epizootic of 1872?

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.920
Larry Venable's showing off, OK.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.180
So he's heard me give this
talk before, I'm pretty sure.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.500
OK, I didn't know
about it either.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.020
An epizootic is just an
epidemic in an animal.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.740
It's a different name, OK.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.840
But in 1872, starting
in Toronto in the fall,

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.080
you had essentially
Spanish flu for horses.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.100
You had a devastating
outbreak of influenza

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:26.000
in horses that swept from
Toronto in all directions.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.880
By 1873 in March,
it was out this way.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.990
And so the US cavalry
and the Apaches

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.930
were actually
fighting each other

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.340
on foot for several weeks.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:41.660
Because all their horses and
mules were either sick or dead.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.290
And this was actually a
historically extremely

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.580
important event.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.060
This is at a time
when horsepower

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.630
came from horses and mules.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:55.040
And each one of these cities,
like Boston, for instance,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.700
for several weeks, all
the horses and mules

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.720
were sick or dead.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.594
And it's kind of like
a science fiction movie

00:39:01.594 --> 00:39:05.630
where all of the cars, trains,
and the electrical grid

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.310
get knocked out for three weeks.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.330
It was pandemonium.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.730
It was-- half of Boston, the
oldest part of Boston burnt

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:15.570
down, because they were
trying to drag the fire

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.197
engines with teams of young
men instead of horses.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.920
And it wasn't just a
historical curiosity, OK?

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:31.940
This horse flu outbreak is
connected to the bird flu

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.990
outbreak that we see in that
evolutionary tree historically.

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:41.270
So just about a year
ago, the same guy

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:47.390
that generated the 1918
genome of the virus

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.070
was doing some
historical research

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.370
with David Morens,
who's a historian.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.010
And they found this weird thing.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:40:01.340
In 1872 simultaneously with this
horse flu outbreak, in city,

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.886
after city, after
city, there's reports

00:40:03.886 --> 00:40:05.760
of what, for all the
world, looks like highly

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.580
pathogenic avian influenza.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.850
Except it's five, six
years before that disease

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:14.600
was scientifically
recognized in Europe.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.600
So this is a real
headline from the New York

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.140
Herald in November of 1872.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.630
"Swelled Heads on the
Thanksgiving Gobblers

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.650
&amp; Henfluenza Devastating
the Chicken Coops."

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:28.580
Very strange.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:33.440
OK this match between the
evolutionary tree telling

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.680
the story of a potential horse
to bird jump of these virus

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.580
segments, and the history.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:45.050
And it's really hard to
dismiss the coincidence.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.720
And what it looks
like is instead

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.570
of the conventional
view of birds being

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.990
at the center of the genetic
diversity of the virus,

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.560
that before the birds
had it, horses had it.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.020
And they gave it to the birds.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:06.230
And so the majority of the
genome of that 1918 virus

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:10.190
started in horses, jumped
probably, and almost certainly

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.830
into domesticated
birds, possibly

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.860
then into wild birds in the
Western hemisphere, North

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.680
America, and then
finally into us.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.880
And again, this is not abstract.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:29.372
So after I saw Joaquin this
evening and shook his hand,

00:41:29.372 --> 00:41:30.830
and he told me he
was feeling sick,

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.590
after rushing to the
bathroom and washing my hand,

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.100
I thought well
maybe he's got flu.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.200
Chances are, some of us in the
audience tonight have H3N2.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.760
That's the seasonal flu
that's going around.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.080
Well five of its
eight genome segments

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.600
trace back to the 1918 virus.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.380
And six of its eight
genome segments

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.201
trace back to that
horse in Toronto.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.350
OK, the next part has absolutely
nothing to do with influenza.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:11.050
But while I was digging around
about the history surrounding

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:15.130
the 1918 virus, and I was really
interested in troop movements

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.470
and horse movements
from North America

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:22.120
to the Western Front in
1918, I stumbled across this.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.150
And figured I got to
share this with you guys.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:29.080
So apparently, there
were lots of plans

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.840
that never came to fruition
for Germany to invade Canada.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.950
So Canada was fighting as
part of the British empire

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:43.490
in World War I for several years
before the US entered the war.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.490
The US was still neutral.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:50.510
And one genius imagined
through rose tinted glasses

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.470
that there were
probably 100,000 secret

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.560
German military reservists
living in the US.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.760
And that if he
planned an invasion,

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.900
they would probably be joined
by maybe a quarter million

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.010
German Americans.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.313
And just throw in
300,000 Irish Americans--

00:43:05.313 --> 00:43:06.054
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:06.054 --> 00:43:07.720
- They've got to hate
the British enough

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.584
to invade Canada.

00:43:08.584 --> 00:43:12.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.000
And this is the relatively
sane part of the story.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.380
So the plan was this--
to maintain secrecy,

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.342
the army of 650,000
would dress as cowboys.

00:43:23.342 --> 00:43:26.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.210
So this also served as
excellent comedy relief

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.680
while I was doing this project.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:32.420
It kind of cleared my head.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.130
And this is not just some
crazy thing off the internet.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.260
I found out two days ago
when I was writing this talk

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.700
that the paper was written by
a guy I took a course from,

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.720
Simon Fraser University,
on World War Ii history.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.780
So this is real.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.300
I know that guy.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.990
And it was taken
seriously enough

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:54.550
that the foreign office actually
had the lawyers look at it.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.860
And they said, you
know, this is OK.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.030
You need some way
for them to know

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:03.970
who's part of the secret plot.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.700
And dressing as cowboys
seemed the obvious thing.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:11.380
No one's going to
suspect 650,000 cowboys

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.343
with German accents.

00:44:12.343 --> 00:44:16.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:21.950
And so this was not,
this never happened,

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.800
but not because it was insane.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.090
But because the
German foreign office

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:32.410
was worried that the invasion
might bother the United

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.630
States, who was still neutral.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.800
OK.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.830
So this was basically
just to clear our palate

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:42.470
before the final part
of the talk here.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.200
So back to flu.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:50.450
We've got a virus, most
of its segments in 1918

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:54.240
have jumped in from a bird flu.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.000
The end of these two
important proteins

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.220
on the surface of
the virus, the end

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.410
looks a lot like
those other six,

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:04.740
looks like a bird
virus that jumped in.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.190
But the H is a different story.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:11.080
So this H protein,
its genetic diversity,

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.360
if you compare it to
all the other ones,

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.900
is way older than all
the other segments.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.030
And it's a very
simple interpretation.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:22.880
It's the same thing that
happened in 1957 and 1968.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.760
That an already
existing virus in humans

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:32.560
with an H1 that probably jumped
in in about 1900, combined

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:37.150
with an avian virus a
few years before 1918.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:41.350
And that formed the genome.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.200
OK so that's the story,
that's the basic.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.740
Those are the facts.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:51.130
And now how do we link those
to what happened in 1918?

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.890
Well it turns out that
evolutionary trees are not

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.600
the only way that
you can look back

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.280
in time at what was
happening with influenza.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.760
And before there
was 1918, there was

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.400
1889, and before that
1847, and before that 1830,

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:15.160
periodic pandemics, when we
think new influenza H and N

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.110
genome segments
entered the population

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.760
and became new human viruses.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:25.990
If you look at people
born just after 1900,

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:28.600
there's a big spike
in the anti-bodies

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.350
of those people to H1.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:35.640
And that's not what you would
expect if H1 came in 1918.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.580
If it came in in
1918, you would think

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.560
that babies born in 1916, -17,
-18 would have that spike.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.670
So now we've got some
triangulation going on.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.620
The gene sequences
are telling us

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.010
H1 probably jumped in in 1900.

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.580
The antibodies in people's
blood is telling us

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.330
people born during this
time probably had H1.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.200
And you can go back further.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.390
So this pink line here
is HeN8 antibodies

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:09.180
in people born during
the 1889 pandemic.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.950
Very, very clear signal that
the virus in 1889 was H3N8.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.200
That's not my discovery.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.990
That was already known
and quite widely accepted.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:26.330
But check this out-- N8
didn't disappear in 1900

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.410
when I think H1 jumped in.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:29.580
It stuck around.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:34.210
And this was actually the best
part of this whole project.

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:38.740
I had worked out the
kind of main parts of it.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.740
But I couldn't, I still
couldn't figure out

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:46.712
why, in 1918, you would have
this switch where 20 to 40 year

00:47:46.712 --> 00:47:50.790
olds would suddenly be doing
much worse with this new virus.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:55.830
And 88 year olds were suddenly
doing much better with H1N1.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:59.470
It affected them less
than the previous virus.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.350
And so I thought to
myself, you know,

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.890
the 1889 virus
was probably H3N8.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:11.310
And so I wonder if the N8 was
actually passed like a baton,

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:16.140
as often happens with flu,
from 1889 to 1900 virus,

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.492
and then to the
1900 to 1918 virus.

00:48:19.492 --> 00:48:21.700
And I thought OK, I'm going
to have to write a grant.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.490
And I'm going to have to learn
how to do all this stuff that I

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.830
don't normally do.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.430
And then I thought,
oh wait a minute.

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.430
This is not how we
work as scientists.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.830
And thought I'll look through
the scientific literature.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.140
And within about five
minutes, I found a paper

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:40.560
from March of 1973, a
month before I was born.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.520
And in the abstract
of the paper it

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:49.800
said that it really seems
like the N8 portion, the N8

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:56.520
antigens, persisted in a virus
after 1900 until about 1915

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.050
or 1916.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.740
And that was like, OK, this
is actually coming together.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.220
And if you-- I'm just going to
skip through that-- if you put

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.870
it all together,
now you can start

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:11.350
to fill in the
layered immunity that

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:15.990
would have existed in the
population alive in 1918.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.580
Other people had
already speculated

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.740
that those old people did
well because their childhood

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.220
infection was H1N1.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.780
If that was the case,
once they were re-infected

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.760
80 years later
with another H1N1,

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.950
their body retained that
memory and was pumping out

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.300
good H1N1 antibodies.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:45.160
1900 may have been an H1N8
which would mean the cohort born

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.930
between 1900 and 1918 would
have had some protection.

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.950
They would have had prior
exposure to H1 so the 1918

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.830
virus wasn't completely new.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:59.640
It's this little wedge
here, these people

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.970
who were primed as
infants and children

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:06.410
by the 1889 virus,
which was probably H3N8.

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.510
They were probably the worst
off in terms of their childhood

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:10.740
immunity.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:15.570
They probably had very little
protection to the 1918 virus,

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.280
probably kind of
similar to a baby

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.970
who'd never had any
influenza before,

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.990
have no antibodies at all.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:28.350
Their H3N8 were useless
against H1 and N1.

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:29.950
And that's what
it looks like when

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:32.100
you're in a boxing
match against a virus,

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.020
and you have no antibodies.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:39.510
It's like having two arms tied
behind your back, and boom.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.350
I also notice that
Sonny Liston's foot

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:45.142
looks very long in this photo.

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.600
That's like the
German cowboys, has

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.060
nothing to do with anything.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.770
OK so if you just
take this model,

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:56.140
and you say what's the
sort of average cohort

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.950
protection of people of
different age groups?

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:02.610
Well 88 year olds, we
think maybe they had H1N1,

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:08.530
and so they had good protection
in 1918 against H1N1.

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:11.220
These guys here sort
of had intermediate.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:15.990
They had some protection
from H1, not from N8.

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.510
And various reasons I'm
not going to go into,

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.990
these ones also may have
had sort of half protection.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:24.660
But it's this one
, this cohort here,

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:30.240
the babies of the 1889 pandemic,
that were the worst off

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.390
according to this model.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:34.200
And if you just
compare that to who

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:42.240
died more than seasonal flu, and
less than seasonal flu in 1918,

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.560
it looks pretty similar.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:53.480
Thank you, Ken [? Gaudet. ?]
Old people, good protection,

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.850
low mortality.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:52:01.110
25 to 29 year olds,
kind of naked,

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:04.070
no help from their
antibodies, two arms

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.640
tied behind their
back, high death rates.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:13.610
And it seems unlikely that it's
a coincidence that World War

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:21.290
I packed 20 to 30 year
olds into high densities

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:26.210
in army camps, troopships,
trains, the front lines.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.900
If this model is
correct, what that was

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.950
was essentially taking
kind of dry tinder

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:39.930
and packing it into very
compact physical locations.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:44.120
And if that's the case, then
probably the emergence of H1N1

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.820
was both a cause
and a consequence.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:51.050
World War I may have been
an ecological disaster

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.500
in terms of allowing an
H1N1 virus to emerge.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.190
And once it did, it was
most likely to infect

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.160
people who had no protection.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.900
OK so what does this mean?

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.820
First thing is this,
which I tell my daughters

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.130
on a daily basis.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:14.900
If that is what happened in
1918 it's kind of reassuring.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.570
It means we can
actually have a handle

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:22.910
on the likelihood of a 1918-like
pandemic happening again.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:26.180
And it's not very likely.

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:32.520
The next slide here shows
a big difference from 1918.

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:37.190
That's about half
a percent mortality

00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:42.300
per year due to infectious
disease in 1918,

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:46.550
now, negligible.

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:50.720
So there's just not
as much pneumonia

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:55.310
secondary bacterial infections
and all of the other things

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:58.040
that actually deliver
the coup de grace when

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.980
you're infected with flu
as there was back then.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.130
And we have things that
we can do about it.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.290
We have vaccines against a whole
bunch of bacterial pathogens,

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:10.160
vaccines against
flu, and antibiotics,

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.000
modern medical interventions.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.700
If everything else was equal to
1918, and you put that virus,

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.430
and you had that layered
immunity, everything else

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:25.520
except modern medicine,
it's very unlikely

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.530
that things would
unfold in anything

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:32.990
like what they did in 1918.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:35.160
At the same time, it
makes you kind of--

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.550
and this is something
that was raised by Joaquin

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.470
during my practice
talk-- kind of makes

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:44.390
you think about the
benefit that we have

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:47.460
in this current age,
when we have antibiotics

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:52.490
to streptococcus pneumoniae
which kills so many people,

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.240
and so forth.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.720
And so I've got
juxtaposed do not

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.000
panic with antibiotic
resistant diseases

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.910
pose apocalyptic threat.

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:04.280
But actually this is
a resource that you

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:09.290
don't want to squander on things
that you don't need antibiotics

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.890
for.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:12.140
You want your
antibiotics to work

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.980
to prevent you from dying
from things like this

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.080
if they ever happen.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.270
OK so this perspective
also gives us

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:24.470
a handle on where things are
going to go from this time

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:26.570
forward in terms
of new pandemics.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:29.300
Will H5N1 jump into humans?

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.430
We don't know.

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:35.960
But if it does, it would seem
that the people born in 1968,

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:41.660
who their childhood infection
was an H3N2, different,

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:46.580
those individuals who are
now about 40 years old,

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.350
might be a kind of
beachhead cohort

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:51.604
like the 25 to 29 year
olds were in 1918.

00:55:51.604 --> 00:55:53.270
So looking ahead you
might want to think

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:56.680
about targeting
vaccines to those people

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.660
if a H5N1 pandemic took hold.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:04.220
And you might be able to slow it
down, or maybe even prevent it.

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:09.800
H5N1 has been in the news
quite a bit lately, this highly

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.630
pathogenic avian virus.

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:15.020
It's not clear whether it can
ever be transmitted from human

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.010
to human.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:20.060
And there are scientists who
are working with ferrets, which

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.050
are the best mammalian
model, that whatever

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:26.780
happens in ferrets seems
to happen in humans.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:30.110
And you'll be happy to know
that they have developed

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:31.717
mammal transmissible H5N1.

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:41.980
Seasonal flu, OK so
there's H3N2 and H1N1.

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.950
H3N2 is the severe virus.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.200
It's the one that's
circulating this year.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:56.080
It kills about 25,000
people in an average year

00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:02.380
over the age of 65,
H1N1 maybe 1,000.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:09.370
So it's-- H1N1 is extremely
mild in the elderly.

00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:10.030
Why is that?

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.590
No one knows.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:15.880
Well if you were
born before, got

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.480
to be careful here who I
include in the elderly cohort.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:25.540
If you're 65 or older,
if you wouldn't mind

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.670
raise both your hands.

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:29.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.100
Very brave.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.010
OK so that's-- keep them
up if you don't mind,

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.630
and then look around.

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:36.850
I'm not 65 or older.

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:41.140
That's our herd immunity to
H1N1 if indeed this childhood

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.420
infection is really important.

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:49.350
And if you were born-- if you
are that age, look around now.

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:54.666
Because that's the
childhood immunity to H3N2.

00:57:54.666 --> 00:57:56.540
So this might be,
actually, really important,

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:01.390
not just for pandemics, but
for seasonal flu as well.

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.210
And I should also
just very briefly say

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:06.760
that looking ahead
several decades,

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.680
eventually today's 40
year olds will be 65.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.080
And at that point,
there will be a lot

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.620
of H3N2 childhood antibodies.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.870
And the prediction
would be that H3N2

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:21.490
would stop being so severe.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:25.520
And H1N1, if it's still
around, would be more severe.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.810
OK wind things up here.

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:34.300
The timing of those genomic
analyses of maybe 1915.

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.240
A few years before
1918, maybe this virus

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:42.130
actually already existed and
was cryptically circulating.

00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:47.140
This is interesting because
other people had rediscovered

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.080
a couple of old papers
from the Lancet that

00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:56.710
were published before the
1918 pandemic occurred.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.590
Both of them talking
about purulent bronchitis.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:03.400
So both of them were from
army camps, one in ETOP

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.580
in France, which was
the main receiving

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:10.390
hospital from the
Western front, and one

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:11.440
in Aldershot in England.

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.490
And both of these
in 1916 and '17

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:19.810
witnessed what, in retrospect,
looked a lot like Spanish flu.

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:22.840
Really high mortality
in young people,

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.790
a lot of the
heliotrope cyanosis,

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:29.470
this ashen blue pallor.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:32.740
And at least this group
here speculated a year

00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.920
later that that indeed
was an early Herald

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.640
wave of the 1918 virus.

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.400
Adolph Abrahams was
the doctor on this one.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.430
He was the brother of Harold
Abrahams, the sprinter

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:48.250
that you might remember
from Chariots of Fire.

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:54.550
This one here was the
first of these two papers

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.020
to be published.

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.320
And there's a guy named
John Oxford in England

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.320
who's been speculating for
years that maybe these were

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.709
early Herald waves.

01:00:03.709 --> 01:00:05.500
And in a lot of his
papers he kind of said,

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.560
you know, we don't have
sample-- we don't have access

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.200
to these samples because a few
weeks after World War I ended,

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.930
those hospitals in ETOP were
demobilized, like, immediately.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:23.390
And so one night, again
in the midst of this,

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.710
some time after the
650,000 cowboys,

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:31.000
I thought well, I wonder
if there might be samples.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.550
And so I thought OK, I'm going
to go through the author list.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.730
And I'm going to
target the pathologist.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:39.340
Because he'll be the one
that would have kept samples,

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.170
if there are any.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:45.100
And so I started just
using the magic of Google.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.350
And I started searching
to see if I could

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:49.030
find what happened to this guy.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.010
He survived the war.

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:54.590
He went on to live
for quite a long time.

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:57.010
I found that he had
two sons, one of whom

01:00:57.010 --> 01:01:00.554
survived to adulthood, and
his name was Charles Hammond.

01:01:00.554 --> 01:01:02.470
At about this point,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:06.255
And my wife came out and
said go to bed, you wacko.

01:01:06.255 --> 01:01:07.630
It's 2:00 o'clock
in the morning,

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:10.090
and why are you doing this?

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:16.040
But I pressed on, and found
an obituary of this guy's son.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.200
And that obituary was
written by the husband

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.270
of his granddaughter.

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:26.410
And through a bit more
internet sleuth work that

01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:27.645
bordered on cyber stalking--

01:01:27.645 --> 01:01:28.270
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:32.290
- I found what I thought
was his e-mail address.

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:36.290
And so 2:30 or 3:00
in the morning now,

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:38.040
I send him an email.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.980
And say, you know
first off, forgive me

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.850
if you're not the person
who I thought you were.

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:45.560
And this is going
to sound crazy.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.160
But I'd really like
to find these samples.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.270
They'd be, amazingly,
they'd be kind

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:55.220
of like the holy
grail for influenza,

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.680
1918 influenza research.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.310
Are you the right guy?

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:02.450
Do you have any information?

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:04.430
And the next morning
I got up and sat down

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.200
and read my e-mail.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.410
And there was an e-mail
saying I am that guy.

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:11.370
What a pleasure
to hear from you.

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:15.390
And I think I have the samples
that you're looking for.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:22.020
So two boxes of slides were
preserved from this guy.

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.330
They were his
teaching collection.

01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:26.220
And in those two
boxes of slides,

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.200
there are at least a
handful of samples.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.700
March 18th, 19177, this
is from that study.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.520
The family sent me
a picture of him.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.170
So now we're stepping
back to 1917.

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:46.080
This is the guy that
made that sample.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.746
And the bottom line, I went
to London a while back.

01:02:48.746 --> 01:02:49.870
They took me out to dinner.

01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:54.560
They're absolutely delightful,
very generous people.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.520
And they said, you know, he
would want you to look at this.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.691
And so even though these are
kind of family treasures,

01:03:01.691 --> 01:03:02.940
that's what we're going to do.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.410
And so we're trying
to figure out

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:08.220
ways of sampling these slides
without destroying them.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.290
And the beat goes on.

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:13.700
We'll see what we get out-- we
don't have any information yet.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.150
But I think with that, I will
thank you for your attention.

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:19.790
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.058
Oh, one more.

01:03:41.415 --> 01:03:43.420
Well you know that
the lecture next week

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:49.000
is going to be another Michael,
and boy are you in trouble.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.670
So there's a few questions
that maybe Michael Worobey

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:52.170
can answer?

01:03:59.676 --> 01:04:00.460
Michael.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.100
Yeah, Rich.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:05.585
So on that one slide showing
the strains circulating

01:04:05.585 --> 01:04:09.590
through humans, through time,
at the end you had the H3N2

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:11.250
and you had that H1N1.

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:13.440
And it said H1N1 lab escape?

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.300
Yeah, so I thought someone
might ask about that.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:22.030
So in 1957, the
Spanish flu like H1N1

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:26.050
went extinct when H2N2 emerged.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:31.170
In 1968, H3N2 kicked out H2N2.

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:36.270
But in 1977, there was
a kind of mini pandemic,

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:39.550
and H1N1 reemerged.

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:44.340
And bottom line is if you
look at the molecular clocks,

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:48.790
it was frozen in time,
not even since 1957,

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:54.000
but it was 1950 H1N1 strain.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.790
And it's virtually certain that
it was an accidental escape,

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:05.190
probably from an experimental
strain from China or Russia.

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.940
And so yes.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.070
The worst pathogen
in human history

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:13.750
was accidentally re-released
and not too many people

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.302
know about it until you guys.

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:17.710
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:20.150
Yeah?

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.330
Hi, I had a quick
question about,

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.880
as far as immunization today.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.800
So vaccinations, I hear, I
could be completely wrong,

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.880
but they only protect us from
about five different strands

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.480
of flu virus.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.090
So I was wondering exactly
how the scientists determine

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:39.754
which strands to protect us
from, and how really effective

01:05:39.754 --> 01:05:40.420
they are for us.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.211
And is it really worth
us taking the shots?

01:05:42.211 --> 01:05:46.000
Yeah, so first answer is
yeah, it is worth taking them.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.340
Second is that there are
two different variants, H3N2

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.430
and H1N1.

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.480
And there's also another
variant called influenza B.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.690
So the normal vaccine has all
three of those components.

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:02.800
And it's kind of glass
half empty or half full.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.790
It protects maybe
somewhere around 50%.

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:10.020
And that's bad compared
to other vaccines.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:15.480
It's good if it prevents you
or someone you love from dying.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.770
There is one issue though.

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:22.300
It does seem to have the worst
efficacy in the elderly, which

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.710
is the age that you would want
it to have the best efficacy.

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.960
And I'm hoping that
part of the story

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:34.110
is that childhood infection with
what we call heterosubtypic,

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:39.190
so the wrong subtype, might
actually be interfering

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:41.360
with the efficacy.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.168
And we might be able to ramp
it up in those older people.

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:49.583
There's one somewhere, yeah.

01:06:49.583 --> 01:06:55.710
Hi, so you mentioned earlier how
with the bird flu researchers,

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:59.480
they're using ferrets
as a model organism.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.440
Why is, like, what's so
special about ferrets?

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.940
Just because I would
never think of that.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:11.710
Yeah they just happen to have
lungs that act a lot like ours.

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:13.330
Mice are also used.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:16.170
Pigs are also used.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:21.310
But ferrets, they
can be infected

01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:25.710
either through the nose
or through the blood.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.900
And whatever happens
in them seems

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.380
to be the clearest analog
to what happens in humans.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.696
And so that's why they're used.

01:07:33.696 --> 01:07:36.310
Okay, the last one.

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:40.310
Can the virus completely destroy
the host cells they're in?

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:44.350
Or does the H and the
N just open the cell

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:46.170
for the virus to pass in?

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:52.480
It actually can leave the
host cell intact for a time,

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.590
keep it alive.

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:57.480
But once it is taken over,
it's no good as a host

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.690
cell any more.

01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:02.130
If it does stay alive, it's
only staying alive to pump out

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:04.735
new virus particles.

01:08:04.735 --> 01:08:06.610
Michael, thank you for
an extraordinary talk.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.760
My pleasure.
