00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.910
So admittedly, we don’t have a lot of concrete
information about black holes.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.030
We have a lot of ideas, but we’ve mostly
been quite literally shooting in the dark

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.760
when it comes to figuring out what would happen
if you went in one.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.720
Now, some theoretical revelations open up
a new line of thinking, and all I can say

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.019
is whooo boy here we go--black holes and string
theory, time to rock’n’roll!

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.470
Let’s review the pieces: black holes are
objects in space that are seemingly infinitely

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.909
dense and swallow everything, including all
kinds of radiation, including visible light.

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.640
Past their event horizon, or the point past
which you can’t escape their pull, they’re

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.579
so dense they seem to warp gravity.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.460
And theoretically, they have a point inside
them called their gravitational singularity:

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.949
the point where that density coalesces into
its infinite-ness and space and time as we

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.820
know them no longer exist.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.100
Ok, casual.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.590
Then we have string theory, which unifies
our conflicting understandings of the quantum

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.249
world and gravity.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.870
In the string theory, the particles we think
make up the standard model of physics are

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.939
actually all just the same kind of string,
vibrating at different resonances to give

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.280
each ‘particle-like entity’ its unique
characteristics.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.939
Black holes are also gravitational puzzles,
so string theory seems like a natural fit

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.070
for helping us understand how they work.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.520
Because that’s the thing about black hole
singularities, too.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.860
The point at which time and space cease to
exist has obviously never been physically

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.740
observed, it’s just the point at which our
math breaks down.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.180
Which is also the point where we start to
identify paradoxes presented by black holes,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.729
and the many theories that set out to resolve
those paradoxes...start to get a little wild.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.649
We’re still constrained by the math we DO
have.

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.750
The way we primarily try to describe the physics
of the world is through the laws of conservation,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.520
things that can neither be created nor destroyed
under the conventional laws of the observable

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.509
universe...like information.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.560
In this context, information means quantum
information--the characteristics of a particle

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.210
that make it what it is.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.320
Its fingerprint, if you will.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.789
And black holes, those tricky guys, present
problems because they seem to subvert at least

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.460
one of these--the law of conservation of information.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.149
Resulting in the information paradox, first
put forward by Stephen Hawking.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.160
See, black holes are supposed to swallow everything
that gets too close because they’re so dense,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.440
but Hawking showed that they’re also radiating
energy.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.440
This thermal radiation, which we now call
Hawking radiation, means black holes could

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.190
eventually waste away to nothing, radiating
out all the energy and matter that went into

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.980
them....but none of this matter would contain
its original information, meaning all that

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.280
information is just gone forever, violating
that law of conservation.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.850
And this leads to many fun lines of inquiry.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.560
Since black holes were discovered in 1916,
physicists have been trying to figure out

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.910
what would happen if you went in one, like
with your human body.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.620
Y’know, ‘cause they’re quirky like that.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.230
Theorists a few years back put forward a new
idea that actually resulted in the identification

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.230
of another related paradox.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.010
The prevailing idea has been the ‘no drama’
theory, where if you’re an astronaut who

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.700
crosses the event horizon of a black hole,
you wouldn’t notice.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.060
Until you reach the singularity, that is,
and you are quite suddenly ‘spaghettified’

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.980
by the impossibly intense gravitational pull.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.480
Which sounds very pleasant indeed.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.750
But then where did you go?

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.700
To try and rectify the information paradox,
physicists have put forward a newer, more

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.870
dramatic theory about what happens to you--the
firewall.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.580
They argue that you, the astronaut, must be
incinerated as you pass the event horizon

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.850
and that’s how your information is conserved.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.560
Cue the fuzzball.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.720
By replacing the particles in a black hole
with strings, you get a theoretical black

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.090
hole model called...a fuzzball.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.090
Very scientific.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.010
Instead of the membrane of an event horizon,
past which you’d get pulled into a point

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.890
of infinite density, the fuzzball model has
no event horizon, and no singularity.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.480
It’s...a fuzzy ball.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.400
A tangled ball of strings that looks a little
more like a planet than our current typical

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.840
imaginings of a black hole.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.060
And those strings, vibrating with the possibilities
of multiple dimensions, make up a hot, vibrating

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.000
extremely dense mass that would incinerate
you on impact.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.640
This is where the string theory fuzzball model
of black holes and the relatively new firewall

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.710
paradox meet and may have common ground--some
theorists think the firewall is the hot fuzzball.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.970
And are very put out that it took the rest
of the physics community so long to catch

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.970
up.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.970
But here’s the thing.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.639
All of this is conjecture.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.639
Big conversations are still happening in the
physics community about how to think about

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.680
black holes and the many problems they pose.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.680
String theory is still just a theory.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.060
And the applications of string theory in this
particular case are very general--in any of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.580
these models, we still don’t have any clear
way that the information of that astronaut

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.750
entering a black hole is conserved and then
recycled...but string theory is a fun--and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.080
useful--voice in the loud symphony that is
theoretical astrophysics.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.570
While we’re speaking, scientists are hard
at work taking the first photo of a black

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.389
hole that would totally change the way we
think about all of this.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.990
So where’s the photo, you ask?

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.800
We’ve got a video all about that here.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.550
