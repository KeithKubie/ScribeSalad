00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.340
Great job on finishing lesson two.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.880
At this rate,
you'll be a professional in no time.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.600
In this lesson, you created a web
server in Python, learned what GET and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.720
POST requests are and
how to create code to handle them, and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.260
implemented all CRUD operations
via web pages and forms.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.500
So, now you've learned the basic
underlying concepts of

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.460
creating a data-driven web
app using just Python.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.410
In lesson three, you'll be developing
a new web server, but this time,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.370
using a framework to help
you code more efficiently.
