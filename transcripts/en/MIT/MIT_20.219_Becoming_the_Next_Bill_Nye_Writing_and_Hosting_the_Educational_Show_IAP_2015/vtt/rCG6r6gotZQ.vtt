00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.156
ELIZABETH CHOE: Hey guys.

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:47.108
So, these are our special
guest lecturers for today.

00:00:47.108 --> 00:00:52.068
These are sixth graders
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:55.540
Do you guys want to go ahead
and find a table to sit at?

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:24.804
[INAUDIBLE] And everyone
will rotate. [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.890
Music matters.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.070
It really does.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.188
Are you a musician?

00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:40.979
GUEST SPEAKER: Yep.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:41.462
AUDIENCE: What do you play?

00:01:41.462 --> 00:01:42.750
GUEST SPEAKER: I play
the snare drum, the bass

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.720
drum, the tambourine,
pretty much all

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.258
the percussion instruments.

00:01:47.258 --> 00:01:48.224
AUDIENCE: The triangle.

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:50.170
GUEST SPEAKER: Triangle.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.610
AUDIENCE: That's really cool.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.865
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right,
guys so, before we get started,

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:58.045
the way this is going
to work is we'll

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:03.314
give you five minutes at each
station with your consultants.

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:06.130
And during this
five minutes-- this

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.009
is for the MIT students-- go
ahead and introduce yourselves.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.125
Tell them what you study,
maybe what year you

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.150
are, what you're interested in.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.763
And then, if you feel
comfortable showing them

00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:18.084
the video pitch that
you made last night--

00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:18.709
[LOUD RUMBLING]

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.182
PROFESSOR: We have this
to deal with, so just

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.655
know that's out of our control.

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:23.792
And we're really sorry.

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:25.583
They're doing some
construction over there,

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:27.082
and it's going to
be a little noisy.

00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:28.534
Sorry.

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:30.700
ELIZABETH CHOE: So go ahead
and show them your pitch

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.025
if you're comfortable with it.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.450
If not, you can just
tell them your idea.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.410
And then workshop some
of the backup ideas

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.880
that you thought
about last night.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.570
And the Cummings
Middle School students

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.110
know exactly what criteria
you're looking for, right?

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.300
So you can use the
rubrics that we gave you.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.950
And at the end of
the five minutes,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.650
we're going to have the
MIT students rotate.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.470
So Nathan, you'll
go to the back.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.990
Paul, you'll scoot here.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.820
Everyone will just
shift that way.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.194
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:02:57.194 --> 00:03:00.236
We'll try it out
for the first time.

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:01.736
And if anyone has
any questions, you

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:03.694
can always come talk to
one of the instructors.

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:04.548
OK?

00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:06.256
PROFESSOR: Does anyone
have any questions

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:09.550
about how this is going to
work before we get started,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.703
or what your job is?

00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:15.025
Does anyone have a question
about that, either?

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:16.525
Your job, it's a
very important job.

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:18.124
You're critics, right?

00:03:18.124 --> 00:03:23.980
All right, then it looks like
everyone knows what to do.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.908
ELIZABETH CHOE: So, I will
go ahead and start the timer

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:28.372
for the first five minutes.

00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:31.642
And if at any point you have
a question about what you're

00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:33.142
doing or just a
clarification thing,

00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:34.308
you can come find one of us.

00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:38.330
Have fun.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.590
AUDIENCE: So, introduction,
I study computer science.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.140
Anyone know what that is?

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.830
It's kind of like
programming kind of stuff.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.176
And so, the kind of stuff I
like to do is I make games.

00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:53.400
So this is kind of
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.563
It's kind of like Fruit Ninja.

00:03:55.563 --> 00:03:58.340
Have you ever heard
of Fruit Ninja?

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.340
Except, because snowing today,
you'd slash the snowflakes.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.935
It's kind of the same, but this
time you get a lot of combos.

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:07.770
And if you slash the red one,
you lose time and lose points.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.110
And you eventually
lose the game.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.920
That's the kinds of things I do.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.710
GUEST SPEAKER:
Did you make that?

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.335
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:14.070
I made that.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.820
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.530
I didn't--

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.529
GUEST SPEAKER: I've got
Fruit Ninja on my phone.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.829
AUDIENCE: It's kind
of like Fruit Ninja

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.630
except don't slash
the red snowflakes.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.355
And it's OK if the
snowflakes fall off.

00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:24.680
Oh, and the blue ones give
you these mega explosions.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.430
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.060
That's so cool.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.840
So I have this idea.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.754
It's just, without
programming, how

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:32.920
can you make computer games?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.750
That's what I was
thinking of off my head.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.132
What do you think of that?

00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:40.298
GUEST SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.097
AUDIENCE: Do you play
games a lot on your phone?

00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:46.930
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.880
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh yeah.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.171
AUDIENCE: What's your favorite?

00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:53.486
GUEST SPEAKER: I
like a lot of them.

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:54.970
Plus social media.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.672
AUDIENCE: Ah, social media.

00:04:56.672 --> 00:04:57.620
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
that kind of thing.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.430
GUEST SPEAKER: I don't
really have a favorite.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.263
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:03.101
GUEST SPEAKER: I play Madden
Mobile and Clash of Clans.

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:04.345
AUDIENCE: Ah, Clash of Clans.

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:04.970
Yes.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.920
Totally addictive.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.640
Yeah, so it'll
probably be about,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.142
like, how can you come
up ideas to make games?

00:05:11.142 --> 00:05:13.600
Because, honestly, the people
who are trying to make games,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.137
I'm probably not as
smart as any one of them.

00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:16.970
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.830
AUDIENCE: Because
you play the games.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.310
You know what
people like to play.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.775
And it's not me, it's you.

00:05:21.775 --> 00:05:23.095
You know what you like to play.

00:05:23.095 --> 00:05:27.780
So if you could make the
games that people of all ages

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.046
could play, that would
be great, great right?

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:30.800
Yeah.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.180
OK, well, just another
curious-cat question.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.414
Do you know what a hacker is?

00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:38.290
GUEST SPEAKER: What?

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.840
AUDIENCE: No?

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.507
Hacker?

00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:40.590
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, hacker?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hacker.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.470
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.750
Someone who has to invade
the firewall thingy.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.730
Or get through
the security bars.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:50.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.170
Would you want to know
about what is a hacker

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.282
and what they do?

00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:56.146
GUEST SPEAKER: No,
I don't want to.

00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:56.580
AUDIENCE: No.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.080
OK.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.720
Then let's just scrap that.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.270
How about a curious question.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.726
Everyone knows Google, right?

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:02.559
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.152
AUDIENCE: But what do they do?

00:06:04.152 --> 00:06:06.120
GUEST SPEAKER: Search engine?

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.640
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.780
And then, what does
that make them?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.562
How are they so
important in our lives?

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:18.032
GUEST SPEAKER: Well, because,
when we do our homework,

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:19.490
we kind of look up
on Google a lot.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.913
Like to [INAUDIBLE] stuff.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:21.454
Like history.

00:06:21.454 --> 00:06:21.995
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:22.927
Cool, cool.

00:06:22.927 --> 00:06:23.885
GUEST SPEAKER: Helpful.

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:24.410
Very helpful

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.498
You can also ask Siri on
your phone or something,

00:06:29.498 --> 00:06:33.490
like your little button.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.340
I'm actually not
from the US, I'm

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.347
actually from a little country
in Asia called Singapore.

00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:40.180
So I'm just curious.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.904
Do you all study
programming at your age?

00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:43.800
Like any kinds?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.652
GUEST SPEAKER: No.

00:06:44.652 --> 00:06:45.360
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.150
Me, neither.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.710
I have never studied programming
until I came to university.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.250
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.830
PROFESSOR: So what do
you think programmers do?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.170
GUEST SPEAKER:
They create things?

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.761
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, they help
build games and code and stuff.

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.010
AUDIENCE: If you were to be
curious about a programmer

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.094
or what can he do, what
would interest you, games?

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.082
What else?

00:07:11.082 --> 00:07:13.074
Anything else?

00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:16.062
I pretty much just play games.

00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:20.582
I can't call on mine,
because it's an iPod.

00:07:20.582 --> 00:07:21.540
I don't have an iPhone.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.409
I only have an iPod.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.034
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:23.034 --> 00:07:24.528
ELIZABETH CHOE:
All right, you have

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:26.111
two more minutes
with your consultants

00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:27.550
before we move tables.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.640
AUDIENCE: So out of the
random ideas I threw at you,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.430
which one would
you be interested

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.642
in in a possible video?

00:07:36.642 --> 00:07:38.868
GUEST SPEAKER: Football
games, pretty much.

00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:39.909
AUDIENCE: Football games.

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:40.514
OK.

00:07:40.514 --> 00:07:41.722
GUEST SPEAKER: I'd say, yeah.

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:45.838
GUEST SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:50.160
I think something
that has to do with.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.320
What's the nearest
thing you have

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.390
in your mind that always nags
you about computers, I guess?

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.765
GUEST SPEAKER: It
slow sometimes.

00:07:57.765 --> 00:07:58.260
GUEST SPEAKER: It
takes too long.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.670
AUDIENCE: It's too slow.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.950
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, too slow.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.480
GUEST SPEAKER: Like, even
when you have Wi-Fi in range

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.430
and you're near the router,
it's always really slow.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.510
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.960
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh
yeah, and Wi-Fi.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.000
When I'm in my car, I can't
play on the antenna and stuff.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.947
I can play games that
don't need antenna.

00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:21.388
I don't like Wi-Fi.

00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:23.304
They should have built-in
Wi-Fi on everything.

00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:25.880
So that would be cool.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.840
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.752
You know Pixar.

00:08:30.752 --> 00:08:31.585
You like the movies?

00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:32.580
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.871
AUDIENCE: I love The Incredibles
But that's really old,

00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:37.700
but I still love it.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.419
And have you ever
wondered how they do it?

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.537
It kind of looks different
from the normal--

00:08:42.537 --> 00:08:43.370
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so they actually
use some computer software

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.350
to do it.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.902
It's called 3D animation,
like three-dimensional.

00:08:50.902 --> 00:08:52.280
Is that interesting?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.734
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, I
would be interested in that.

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:57.192
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like how do
you draw, but on the computers?

00:08:57.192 --> 00:08:58.566
GUEST SPEAKER:
Yeah, like do they

00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:00.980
have to draw all the little
pictures of every movement?

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.188
AUDIENCE: Ah, that's the key.

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:03.397
No, actually the answer's no.

00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:04.980
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh,
I thought they did.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.630
AUDIENCE: It's
pretty cool, right?

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.470
What they do is they make a
teddy bear in the computer,

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.107
or some kind of 3D image of it.

00:09:12.107 --> 00:09:12.940
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.380
AUDIENCE: And they put bones in.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.250
Just like how you put bones in
humans that he was programming,

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.140
you put logical bones.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.520
And then you can
shift the bones,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.810
and they're like
puppets, you know?

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.210
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.043
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:24.043 --> 00:09:26.468
This is kind of like what
they do all the time.

00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:29.093
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right, guys,
let's go ahead and shift over.

00:09:29.093 --> 00:09:31.352
AUDIENCE: OK, so which
one of the ideas--

00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:32.810
GUEST SPEAKER: I
like the last one.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.530
AUDIENCE: The last one.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.993
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:34.456
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:34.920
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.253
AUDIENCE: The last one the most?

00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:37.210
All right.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.505
Thank you, guys,
you're so amazing.

00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:40.005
OK.

00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:43.997
NATHAN: What are your names?

00:09:43.997 --> 00:09:45.494
RONALD: I'm Ronald.

00:09:45.494 --> 00:09:46.991
RONALD: And I'm Michael.

00:09:46.991 --> 00:09:49.486
SARI: I'm going to sit
in with you guys, too.

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:50.484
My name's Sari.

00:09:50.484 --> 00:09:51.481
RONALD: Hi.

00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:51.981
SARI: Hi.

00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:54.650
NATHAN: I'm Nathan.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.710
I study something that's a
mix of chemical engineering

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.668
and geology.

00:10:00.668 --> 00:10:01.334
RONALD: Geology?

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:01.834
NATHAN: Mhm.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.320
I'm a second year.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.200
I have two ideas.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.160
It looks like my main idea has
been scrapped at this point,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.790
but I'll still mention it
to you in case one of you

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.967
is fervently interested in it.

00:10:18.967 --> 00:10:20.800
I was interested in
possibly doing something

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.970
on how and why fruit decomposes.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.070
But I guess my backup idea
is a bit more interesting

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.842
to most people, which
is how you can tell

00:10:32.842 --> 00:10:36.810
if there is magma
lava under a surface

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.090
and how you can
detect and map it.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.590
And then you might
be able to say oh

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.530
is this place in this scope
having some sort of eruption

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.990
at some point or not.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.210
So I have to work on the hook.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.804
But I don't know.

00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:53.970
I wanna hear from listeners.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.305
SARI: Which one
of those ideas do

00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:56.352
you think is more interesting?

00:10:56.352 --> 00:10:59.240
MICHAEL: What was the first one?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.532
NATHAN: How and why food
rots and decomposes.

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:06.252
MICHAEL: I would probably
do the lava stuff.

00:11:06.252 --> 00:11:07.196
NATHAN: Yeah.

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:08.919
MICHAEL: It's more cool.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:09.460
NATHAN: Yeah.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.120
RONALD: You could save lives.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.960
NATHAN: Yeah.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.482
So I don't know exactly
what to say about that.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.385
SARI: What would
you be expecting?

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:25.170
If you wanted to watch
a video about lava,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.523
what would you want to be?

00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:31.397
RONALD: A diagram of
the Earth, probably.

00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:32.355
NATHAN: OK.

00:11:32.355 --> 00:11:35.708
MICHAEL: And have the
lithosphere and asthenosphere

00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:37.230
and the layers.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.750
And then having
probably, like you

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.262
said how you can detect if
there's lava under a surface,

00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:47.970
probably having a
place that already does

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.500
have lava under the surface.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.919
And like showing the magma
chamber, and then stuff.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.348
SARI: It sounds like
you guys have already

00:12:00.348 --> 00:12:02.980
done a unit on volcanoes
pretty recently.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.040
Is there any questions
that you still

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.078
have after that that you
might want to have answered?

00:12:09.078 --> 00:12:12.982
Like, really cool facts about
volcanoes, or things like that?

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:16.886
I know it's kind of a
hard question to answer.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.467
Or the coolest part of the
it unit that you remember?

00:12:23.467 --> 00:12:24.342
RONALD: How it looks.

00:12:24.342 --> 00:12:28.044
I've seen videos of
volcanoes erupting at night,

00:12:28.044 --> 00:12:29.012
and that was pretty.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.330
MICHAEL: The question I have--
there's some volcanoes that

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.190
are big but they
have small eruptions,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.680
and then they do a big one.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.443
And then there's other volcanoes
that just have huge eruptions

00:12:45.443 --> 00:12:47.910
every time they go.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.630
Why would some volcanoes
have big eruptions and some

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.430
have small, small and
then a big eruption?

00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:01.289
NATHAN: All right, so,
here's what I would say.

00:13:01.289 --> 00:13:03.330
Of the volcanoes that can
have smaller eruptions,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.660
it's actually
based a lot on what

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:11.570
the makeup of the lava
from the volcano is.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:16.624
I don't know if you covered the
difference between andesitic

00:13:16.624 --> 00:13:20.430
and [INAUDIBLE] volcanoes.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.360
Basically, glass is
made of something

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.480
called silicon, silicate.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.580
It's an element,
and volcanoes that

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:39.540
have a lot more silica in it
tend to be a little less dense.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.220
And ones that have lower content
are a lot heavier, the magma.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.470
And so, as you might
expect, the ones

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.839
that are heavier,
when they erupt,

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:50.380
it doesn't just
shoot out everywhere.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.420
It just kind of bubbles over
the side and it's more viscous

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.340
and it flows slowly.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.700
And so those ones
often will be the ones,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.386
like the big mountains that kind
of spread out this way a lot.

00:14:02.386 --> 00:14:04.010
MICHAEL: Sort of like
a shield volcano?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:04.745
NATHAN: Yeah.

00:14:04.745 --> 00:14:06.565
Those are the shield volcanoes.

00:14:06.565 --> 00:14:08.890
And so the lava type
causes it to have

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.150
a lot more smaller eruptions,
because it takes a lot

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.700
and build up of fresh
air if you want to have

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.782
a big eruption from that.

00:14:15.782 --> 00:14:18.240
Whereas, when you have a higher
silica content, which means

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.182
it weighs less, it's
going to explode more.

00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:26.490
And it's going to have
more violent eruptions.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:31.800
And there's other factors
as well, like water content.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.956
And at what depth the magma
chamber underneath the volcano

00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:35.455
is.

00:14:39.726 --> 00:14:41.694
RONALD: Yeah.

00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:42.678
Another question.

00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:44.154
Let me see.

00:14:44.154 --> 00:14:46.122
MICHAEL: If you don't
have one, I have one.

00:14:46.122 --> 00:14:46.614
RONALD: All right.

00:14:46.614 --> 00:14:49.114
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right, guys,
let's rotate one more time.

00:14:49.114 --> 00:14:56.085
MICHAEL: The amount of-- which
one was dormant for a long time

00:14:56.085 --> 00:14:57.930
and then blew it's
top and it was crazy?

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:58.422
NATHAN: Mount Saint Helens?

00:14:58.422 --> 00:14:58.668
MICHAEL: Yes.

00:14:58.668 --> 00:14:59.209
RONALD: Yeah.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.740
MICHAEL: If volcanoes
are dormant for a longer

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.700
period, when they
erupt, will they

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.740
have a violenter eruption than
ones that are dormant shorter?

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.210
I can't actually
answer that question.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:25.354
I know what causes volcanoes
to go more dormant, what

00:15:25.354 --> 00:15:26.520
might make them not dormant.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.645
But I can't really say
if that would effect it.

00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:31.770
AUDIENCE: One thing about
math that you have really

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.370
enjoyed or really hated.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.362
Or two things.

00:15:36.362 --> 00:15:37.811
So we'll start.

00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:39.740
Go left to right.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.240
BRIAN: Wait, what
did you say again?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.796
AUDIENCE: So name, favorite
subject, and things about math

00:15:44.796 --> 00:15:47.675
that you you have really
loved or really hated.

00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:48.175
BRIAN: OK.

00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:50.155
My name is Brian.

00:15:50.155 --> 00:15:55.105
My favorite subject is gym.

00:15:55.105 --> 00:16:02.035
And I hate math,
because it's boring.

00:16:02.035 --> 00:16:04.040
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.730
Actually, I guess it's
a kind of new direction,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.970
but a lot of people are actually
studying the math of sports.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.010
So they go out and do really
weird things with sports,

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.830
like throwing
basketballs at, like,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.480
places where you shoot an
arrow, and they do math with it.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.940
So that's kind of a
connection, gym and math

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.940
getting closer together.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.068
MATT: My name's Matt.

00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:36.940
I like math.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.960
You hear that, Brian?

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.900
And what was the third
thing that I have to say?

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.980
AUDIENCE: Some things that you
really enjoyed it about it.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.550
MATT: I enjoy solving
variables and equations

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.548
and graphing things.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:57.522
That's good.

00:16:57.522 --> 00:16:59.457
AUDIENCE: You're
ready for high school.

00:16:59.457 --> 00:16:59.957
MATT: Burn.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.845
JOHN: My name is John, and
my favorite subject is--

00:17:07.845 --> 00:17:09.339
MATT: History.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.833
JOHN: History.

00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:16.410
And I personally
do not like math.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.498
MATT: Hi, guys.

00:17:18.498 --> 00:17:21.432
JOHN: What?

00:17:21.432 --> 00:17:24.855
If I had to say what
I like about it,

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:29.760
I'm really into
fractions, kind of.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.569
I just like the idea.

00:17:32.569 --> 00:17:33.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.380
Do you know what about the idea?

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.850
I've never heard anybody say
I like the idea of fractions,

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.106
so that's really
interesting to me.

00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:45.489
JOHN: Like, things like
this table being broken up

00:17:45.489 --> 00:17:48.870
into thousands of pieces.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.330
I don't know.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.310
AUDIENCE: Now,
really wacky things

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.900
that mathematicians
do later on is

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.840
that they don't just break the
table into a thousand pieces.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.730
That's too easy.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.810
They break it into an
infinite number of pieces.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.940
And then they see what
they can do with that.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.680
And, kind of related
to that, mathematicians

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.190
have proved that
you can take a ball.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.490
You know, just volume one.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.920
One-gallon ball.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.700
And you can cut it in
such a way that you

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.035
can make two one-gallon balls.

00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:26.244
So you can make two
out of one using math.

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:26.994
JOHN: That's cool.

00:18:26.994 --> 00:18:29.595
AUDIENCE: So that's
some other idea.

00:18:29.595 --> 00:18:31.095
MATT: You like math now, boys?

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.420
AUDIENCE: I mean, if
you think about it,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.480
math people do
really cool things.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.730
There was a study once where
they analyzed the language

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.212
of King George and Kanye West.

00:18:45.212 --> 00:18:46.170
And they compared them.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.214
And this was an actual study,
like they put time into it.

00:18:49.214 --> 00:18:50.630
So I thought that
was pretty cool.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:55.790
But anyway, that's not
what my pitch is about.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.170
And I'll just say it real quick.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.740
Not going to show the video,
because the sound is terrible.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.340
What I want to talk about
in this video is just

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.960
the question of is
math real and true?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.140
Because what mathematicians
learned in the 20th century,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.710
there was a young man named
Kurt Godel who proved that--

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.293
ELIZABETH CHOE: One
more minute, guys,

00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:15.605
before we need to switch again.

00:19:15.605 --> 00:19:18.390
AUDIENCE: --you can never
prove if math is true or not.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.960
So the arithmetic we
learned in school,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.930
we think it's true, because
it's worked, but it may not be.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.460
There's no way to say for sure.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.490
MATT: Wait, is Kurt
Colonel the guy

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.970
who made Kentucky Fried Chicken?

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.550
No, it's Kurt Godel.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.144
MATT: Oh.

00:19:37.144 --> 00:19:38.560
AUDIENCE: I mean,
I think it would

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.167
be really cool if he did math
and Kentucky Fried Chicken.

00:19:41.167 --> 00:19:42.125
That would be the best.

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:46.240
MATT: On Family Guy, he went
to Kentucky to get chicken.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.940
And he's like, is whatever
his name is that sounded

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.140
like what you said.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.070
And he's like no, he's dead.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.370
And he's like the something.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.014
It was so funny.

00:19:57.014 --> 00:19:58.680
AUDIENCE: I'll have
to look and see now.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.724
Did any mathematicians
open fast food chains?

00:20:01.724 --> 00:20:03.390
That's probably an
interesting question.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.480
I don't think anyone's
asked it before.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.770
But, that said, any
thoughts on the idea?

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:13.312
I'll get a thumbs up, thumbs
down, or thumbs middle.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:14.270
ELIZABETH CHOE: Rotate.

00:20:17.924 --> 00:20:19.380
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.050
Thanks, guys.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:26.290
It was nice meeting you and
enjoy playing or not playing.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.547
AUDIENCE: I want an
aha moment, a eureka.

00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:30.880
PROFESSOR: I think you want
to get away from instruction

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.780
and more of concept.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.710
Right?

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.970
So see if you can think
of a little narrower focus

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.100
than in these big,
big, big concepts.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.170
And that might help you
with your next group.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.810
GUEST SPEAKER: So some of
them are pretty similar,

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.284
like the robots?

00:20:45.284 --> 00:20:45.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.780
So we're teaching them.

00:20:50.436 --> 00:20:52.810
They're scientists, and we're
teaching them how to make--

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.310
have you ever looked
on cool videos?

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.300
Have you seen Charlie the
Unicorn, or you've seen--

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.180
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, I've
seen Charlie the Unicorn.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.471
PROFESSOR: Charlie the Unicorn.

00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:03.556
Or maybe you've seen-- I used
to work with kids your age,

00:21:03.556 --> 00:21:05.835
and they loved that one.

00:21:05.835 --> 00:21:08.210
It was about this little
snail, Marcel the Shell.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.410
Have you seen that one?

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:09.580
No?

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.285
Well, you see these
little YouTube videos,

00:21:11.285 --> 00:21:12.826
and everyone's like,
oh, that's cool.

00:21:12.826 --> 00:21:14.090
You've got to watch that too.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.380
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh,
like the 21 kid?

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:15.530
PROFESSOR: Which one?

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.520
GUEST SPEAKER: The
21 kid that says 21.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.235
Everybody in
America says 21 now.

00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:21.110
PROFESSOR: Oh really?

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.340
Is that the it one
you have to watch?

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.451
21?

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.940
GUEST SPEAKER: It's a Vine.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.023
GUEST SPEAKER: And then
they make it into a video.

00:21:30.023 --> 00:21:33.920
Or there's a series of shows
on YouTube called ASDF.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.406
It's about this
little stick figure.

00:21:36.406 --> 00:21:38.030
PROFESSOR: Right, so
you guys see them,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.190
and then you're like hey friend,
you've got to see this too.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.130
And then you get
everyone watch it, right?

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.900
We're trying to make those
really cool, short videos

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.230
about science topics.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.730
Right?

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.271
And so we're going
to make them free,

00:21:48.271 --> 00:21:51.125
so that it also teaches people
something while it's also

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:52.109
cool and fun.

00:21:52.109 --> 00:21:53.650
And so what he's
trying to figure out

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.820
is what in his world
of computer science

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.642
would be cool enough that
you'd be, like hey friend,

00:21:59.642 --> 00:22:00.850
you've got to check this out.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.684
It's really awesome.

00:22:01.684 --> 00:22:03.475
GUEST SPEAKER: I think
the hacker one would

00:22:03.475 --> 00:22:04.850
be good for people out age.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.450
PROFESSOR: To understand how
someone hacked your account?

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.825
GUEST SPEAKER:
Yeah, but then you

00:22:08.825 --> 00:22:10.300
don't want kids to hack people.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.220
PROFESSOR: Well,
that's the fear, right?

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.410
You don't want to end up
giving kids instructions

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.820
on how to hack, because I don't
think the government or anyone

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.090
else would probably like that.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.132
But that's a fear, right?

00:22:18.132 --> 00:22:20.006
It's just making sure
that we're not actually

00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:22.690
giving instructional videos on
how to destroy other people's

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:23.716
credit cards.

00:22:23.716 --> 00:22:26.143
GUEST SPEAKER:
Google might be good.

00:22:26.143 --> 00:22:28.476
GUEST SPEAKER: Because then
you could just hack this ATM

00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:31.460
and get all the money.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.350
PROFESSOR: How to
protect yourself,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.300
like make sure your money's safe
would be interesting to you?

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.524
GUEST SPEAKER: Like how to
protect yourself from hackers,

00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:38.370
how to protect yourself.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.510
PROFESSOR: How to
protect yourself,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.405
instead of destroying
someone else's something?

00:22:41.405 --> 00:22:41.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.055
MATT: Yeah.

00:22:42.055 --> 00:22:42.750
PROFESSOR: That's a nice
way of turning it around.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.125
GUEST SPEAKER: I
have a question.

00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:45.850
So say if someone
lost their wallet,

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.990
and they had their
credit card in there,

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.550
and it can access to the bank.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.270
If someone found it, and
the person to access,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.950
do they end up giving
them the money?

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.450
PROFESSOR: Sometimes, and that's
why credit cards are really

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.300
good at-- do you know anything
about this in your work, or no?

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.847
AUDIENCE: Credit cards?

00:23:02.847 --> 00:23:05.180
PROFESSOR: Protecting credit
card identity and all that?

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.860
GUEST SPEAKER: But don't they
have your picture or something,

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.170
so they know it's you?

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.040
AUDIENCE: But online,
it's really easy

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.885
to use another
person's credit card

00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:15.127
if you know all the information.

00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:17.210
PROFESSOR: I get called
often from my bank saying,

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.380
did you make this purchase,
or did someone else?

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.560
But that's an interesting
thing for people who

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.269
do a lot of shopping online.

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:25.435
How do you protect yourself?

00:23:25.435 --> 00:23:27.435
GUEST SPEAKER: If somebody
else took your money,

00:23:27.435 --> 00:23:29.037
would you get that back or no?

00:23:29.037 --> 00:23:30.620
PROFESSOR: That's
why, if you catch it

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.020
quickly with your
bank, sometimes

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.000
they can quickly stop
it before it ends up

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.280
getting charged. to you.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.890
But that's an interesting idea.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.100
How, if you're buying
stuff on the internet,

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.330
what's actually happening
to protect yourself?

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:51.690
What if someone did
catch the person,

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.720
and the person already
used all the money,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.650
and you can't return
it after that,

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.940
did the bank end up giving
their money to the person?

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.560
PROFESSOR: Do you
ever wonder what

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.690
happens when you type in
the credit card number,

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.404
and how the money actually
gets where it needs to go?

00:24:03.404 --> 00:24:05.070
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh,
they track them down?

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.444
PROFESSOR: Have
you ever wondered

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:07.730
about how that happens?

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.520
No, not really?

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.226
You just care about getting
your package in the mail?

00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:14.706
GUEST SPEAKER: Does the
ATM make its own money,

00:24:14.706 --> 00:24:17.690
or do they put it in?

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.620
PROFESSOR: Do they just
put the money in there?

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.440
Every country's different,
but at least here, there

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.971
is a central office
that makes money.

00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:28.833
And then they just distribute
it into different places.

00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:30.270
The ATM doesn't make the money.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.670
That's a good question.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.086
But, an interesting thing for
you to think you think about

00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:36.290
is what within these
topics more specifically?

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.580
Because the hacking is a
cool topic, but you're right

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.890
It's a dangerous one.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.480
And we'd want to make sure
we had the right angle, so

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.050
that we're not
accidentally giving

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.120
sixth graders the tools
to be able to hack

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.250
into whatever account, right?

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.641
That would be scary.

00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:54.450
GUEST SPEAKER: Google
might be a good one.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:55.199
PROFESSOR: Google?

00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:56.460
Could be, right?

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.710
How does Google actually work?

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.140
How does it find your result?

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.265
Like, if you want to learn
how zebras have stripes,

00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:03.082
how does it actually
give you an answer?

00:25:03.082 --> 00:25:06.690
GUEST SPEAKER: Or how does
something spread, like a virus?

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.320
That's a cool idea, too.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.380
Something to think about.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:09.963
Keep thinking.

00:25:09.963 --> 00:25:10.600
You're on it.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.860
Good, good, good.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.800
AUDIENCE: Virus.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.041
ANDREA: And you are?

00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:17.035
ANAMA: Anama.

00:25:17.035 --> 00:25:20.017
ANDREA: Those are some
really cool names.

00:25:20.017 --> 00:25:21.020
GIANNA: Thank you.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.740
ANDREA: And?

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.460
GIANNA: Gianna.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.279
ANDREA: Gianna.

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:24.695
PROFESSOR: So,
we're going to have

00:25:24.695 --> 00:25:25.430
to move a little quickly,
because we've got

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.865
two teams to talk about, so--

00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:27.990
AUDIENCE: You can go first.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.020
AUDIENCE: All right,
introduction first.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.470
I'm a first year here at MIT.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.405
I like to study math,
physics, and education.

00:25:35.405 --> 00:25:37.500
I've said it too much.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.370
And I'm going to just
pitch the idea right away.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.530
Normally, I would ask
you guys what you like.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.020
But the question that I would
like to discuss in the video

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:52.038
is whether math is
actually real and true.

00:25:52.038 --> 00:25:55.370
And the thing is that
mathematicians have proved

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.180
that they can never prove that.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.060
So we can never know for
sure if math is true.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.450
Even arithmetic, you know,
it's worked for us so well.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.212
Two plus two is
always four, it seems.

00:26:06.212 --> 00:26:10.050
But that may not be true.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.400
I guess that's kind of the
question I wanted to address.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.940
And out of that it
also comes, you know,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.700
can machines be
smarter than humans?

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.790
And can robots
overtake the world?

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.916
Just things like
that, so any thoughts?

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.790
PROFESSOR: So those were
three topics, right?

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.560
AUDIENCE: So that was one topic.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.617
All those questions kind
of come out of that.

00:26:31.617 --> 00:26:33.075
PROFESSOR: Those
are big questions.

00:26:33.075 --> 00:26:35.550
GIANNA: Are we supposed
to say something?

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.050
PROFESSOR: What do
you guys respond?

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.790
Do you think any of those
ideas that she mentioned

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.520
are things that you would
be like, hey friend,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.060
this is really cool.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.470
You've got to check
out this video.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.920
ANAMA: Mhm.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.370
GIANNA: Yeah.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.245
PROFESSOR: Which one?

00:26:44.245 --> 00:26:45.682
ANAMA: The robot thing.

00:26:45.682 --> 00:26:47.934
PROFESSOR: Would robots
take over the world?

00:26:47.934 --> 00:26:49.600
AUDIENCE: They're all
related, you know?

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.170
GIANNA: I like the one
that's like, is it true?

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.686
Like, four plus four is eight.

00:26:55.686 --> 00:26:56.709
Is that true?

00:26:56.709 --> 00:26:58.250
AUDIENCE: So, I'll
tell you a secret.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.170
Even though we cannot tell
that math is true, that's sad,

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.810
that also means that robots
cannot overtake the world.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.404
In case you were wondering.

00:27:05.404 --> 00:27:06.570
GIANNA: It's still possible.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:06.830
AUDIENCE: It's not possible.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.955
ANAMA: I changed my answer.

00:27:07.955 --> 00:27:09.590
I'm changing it to math.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.710
PROFESSOR: The math one?

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.160
But you'll get to the math
one through the robots one.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.450
GIANNA: You know the answer?

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:13.745
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:13.745 --> 00:27:14.453
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:27:14.453 --> 00:27:17.770
So do you have any other ideas,
or was this the big ideas?

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.130
AUDIENCE: That was the big one.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:20.990
PROFESSOR: So you
think if she talks

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.330
about the idea of
could robots overtake

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.040
the world, and through
that she answers

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.490
some of the questions about
math being true or not true,

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.830
that would be really cool?

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.410
GIANNA: Yeah.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.015
ANAMA: I don't think robots
could take over the world.

00:27:32.015 --> 00:27:33.500
PROFESSOR: You don't think so?

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.500
AUDIENCE: They couldn't.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.678
GIANNA: Wait, what about that
weird robot with the face

00:27:37.678 --> 00:27:38.824
that's creepy?

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:41.240
ANAMA: I mean, you can smash
them and they can break down.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.060
GIANNA: But what if
they try to smash you?

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.810
AUDIENCE: So, eventually
we'll be smarter.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.390
Because that's kind of what
a mathematician proved,

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.170
is that a machine can never be
as smart or do as many things

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.584
that we can do.

00:27:54.584 --> 00:27:56.000
PROFESSOR: I like
the could robots

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.501
take over the world idea with
all this other stuff connected

00:27:58.501 --> 00:27:59.000
to it.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.680
I think that's a cool idea.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.005
ANAMA: Do you know
the show Lab Rats?

00:28:03.005 --> 00:28:05.210
AUDIENCE: No, I don't.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.930
Well, there's these three humans
who are also a robot thing.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:13.120
And they have all
kinds of powers,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.630
because there was this guy
that wanted to make them evil

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.353
and take over the world.

00:28:16.353 --> 00:28:17.978
GIANNA: They don't
want Disney Channel.

00:28:17.978 --> 00:28:21.315
ANAMA: It's not Disney
Channel, it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:21.315 --> 00:28:24.280
And then this person stole them
to make them become heroes.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.510
But what if someone
that invents a robot

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.840
gives them all kinds of--

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.130
PROFESSOR: Powers?

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:29.540
ANAMA: Yeah, like a laser.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.623
PROFESSOR: That's what she
was saying, that robots

00:28:31.623 --> 00:28:33.220
can be really, really smart.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.595
AUDIENCE: But not
as smart as us.

00:28:34.595 --> 00:28:37.036
So I guess, eventually,
we'll win if robots

00:28:37.036 --> 00:28:38.892
did decide to break down on us.

00:28:38.892 --> 00:28:41.100
PROFESSOR: I want to make
sure Andrea gets some time,

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.440
so let's hear your ideas.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.360
GIANNA: Do you guys
have any tissues?

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.960
PROFESSOR: I'll go get you some.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.200
You keep going.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.280
OK?

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:47.760
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry about that.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.468
ANAMA: That's OK.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.366
ANDREA: So, I already
know the answer for you.

00:28:53.366 --> 00:28:55.240
Are you going to have
to have braces someday?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.830
Do you know?

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.519
ANAMA: No.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:58.060
They're cool.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.640
They look cool.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.020
ANDREA: You want them?

00:28:59.020 --> 00:28:59.745
GIANNA: No.

00:28:59.745 --> 00:29:00.370
ANAMA: Kind of.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.245
GIANNA: No you don't.

00:29:01.245 --> 00:29:02.910
No you don't.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.345
ANDREA: So how long have
you had your braces?

00:29:05.345 --> 00:29:08.180
GIANNA: Beginning
of fifth grade.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.980
ANDREA: So you've
had them a while?

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.170
GIANNA: Yeah.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:11.500
ANAMA: I don't even
know if I want braces.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:11.810
Because you can't eat gum
or anything like that.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.100
GIANNA: Let me see your teeth.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.060
You need braces.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.380
ANAMA: No, I don't.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.930
GIANNA: Yes, you do.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.820
ANDREA: So are you curious about
what they do to your teeth?

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.240
GIANNA: Just make them
straight, I guess.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.020
ANDREA: Do you know
how they do that?

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.550
ANAMA: Yeah, they
put them together.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.982
GIANNA: But I have
two teeth up here.

00:29:31.982 --> 00:29:34.150
ANDREA: And they pulled
them down, right?

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:34.820
GIANNA: Yeah.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.330
ANAMA: You had two teeth
that were flipped up?

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.871
GIANNA: I had a
palate expander, too.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.290
PROFESSOR: Tissue.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.330
GIANNA: And it made
me talk like that,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.750
and I couldn't talk for a while.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.160
And it widened my jaw.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.600
I had to key it every night.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.540
It kind of hurt.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.510
You don't want braces.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.260
PROFESSOR: What was it?

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.218
I'm sorry, I missed it.

00:29:56.218 --> 00:29:57.850
What was your idea?

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.140
ANDREA: To talk about
braces, basically what

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.425
they're doing to your teeth.

00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.550
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's cool.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.810
ANAMA: Are they bad
for your teeth also?

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.010
ANDREA: Are they
bad for your teeth?

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:05.920
That's a good question.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.836
PROFESSOR: And why don't
more teeth move back?

00:30:07.836 --> 00:30:09.810
ANDREA: Why do my
teeth move, and what

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.920
happens when stuff gets in.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.720
I just got my braces
off in October.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.080
PROFESSOR: Good for you.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.170
ANDREA: Yeah.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.002
GIANNA: My dad has
instructed me to get

00:30:19.002 --> 00:30:22.210
them changed every month, but
it's been like three months.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.620
PROFESSOR: So what's actually
going on with your braces?

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.030
That's a cool, very
age-relevant relevant topic.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.571
ANAMA: But instead
of getting braces,

00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:31.055
can't you get that
plastic thing?

00:30:31.055 --> 00:30:32.180
ANDREA: Yeah, the aligners.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.741
GIANNA: Do you have
to wear a retainer?

00:30:34.741 --> 00:30:35.240
I

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.829
ANDREA: Have to wear a retainer.

00:30:37.829 --> 00:30:40.120
PROFESSOR: I know one of my
friends who had them, still

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.394
wears this retainer.

00:30:41.394 --> 00:30:43.060
ANAMA: Do you have
to wear it every day?

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:43.980
GIANNA: If you don't wear it,
they can get crooked again.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.134
ANAMA: Every day for
the rest of your life?

00:30:46.134 --> 00:30:47.800
PROFESSOR: I am proof
of that, actually.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.425
ANAMA: For the
rest of your life?

00:30:48.425 --> 00:30:49.930
PROFESSOR: That if you
don't wear your retainer,

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:50.872
your teeth do go back.

00:30:50.872 --> 00:30:52.580
GIANNA: Do you have
to wear it in school?

00:30:55.274 --> 00:30:57.050
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
had braces twice.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.940
PROFESSOR: See?

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.940
ELIZABETH CHOE: I still
wear retainers at night.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.870
PROFESSOR: And they give
kids braces so young, now.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.620
You can be in third
grade and have braces,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.536
whereas, when I was a
kid, you didn't get them

00:31:06.536 --> 00:31:07.644
until high school.

00:31:07.644 --> 00:31:09.066
Third grade?

00:31:09.066 --> 00:31:11.241
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:11.241 --> 00:31:12.990
I've seen lots of
little kids with braces.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.115
And you're like, your teeth
are so little and you--

00:31:15.614 --> 00:31:17.660
ANAMA: You have
to wear retainers

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.752
for the rest of your life.

00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:19.710
PROFESSOR: For a while.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.415
GIANNA: What about
that thing that goes--

00:31:21.415 --> 00:31:21.790
PROFESSOR: The headgear?

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.930
ANDREA: The headgear.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.680
ANAMA: Oh, did you
have to wear like that?

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.710
That's so gross.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:27.704
ANDREA: Willy Wonka?

00:31:27.704 --> 00:31:28.620
ANAMA: It looks weird.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.880
ANDREA: Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory,

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.640
where he wears [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.520
ANAMA: It makes you
talk weird, too.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.436
PROFESSOR: We're actually
really good on time.

00:31:39.834 --> 00:31:41.500
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK,
everybody, it's time

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.955
to stop what you're doing.

00:31:45.865 --> 00:31:47.920
PROFESSOR: I heard some
amazing conversations.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.020
And you sixth-graders
asked fantastic questions.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.430
We're just wrapping up.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.513
I'd love to hear from a
couple groups of students,

00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:57.020
the sixth-graders.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.840
What were some of the
best ideas that you

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.730
heard all day,
that you're like, I

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.360
can't wait for the
video to come out.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.755
I really want to watch it.

00:32:04.755 --> 00:32:07.830
And maybe hear any ideas that
you're really exited about.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:08.330
Yeah?

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.300
AUDIENCE: The navy one.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:09.770
PROFESSOR: The navy one?

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:10.353
What about it?

00:32:10.353 --> 00:32:11.100
What did he--

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.310
AUDIENCE: With the torpedoes.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.027
PROFESSOR: Torpedo.

00:32:14.027 --> 00:32:14.526
Interesting.

00:32:14.526 --> 00:32:15.402
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:15.402 --> 00:32:17.317
PROFESSOR: The idea of
watching things blow up

00:32:17.317 --> 00:32:18.412
is exciting to you?

00:32:18.412 --> 00:32:19.710
Yes.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:20.692
What else?

00:32:20.692 --> 00:32:24.445
AUDIENCE: I liked the idea with
the robot and [INAUDIBLE] talk

00:32:24.445 --> 00:32:27.580
and Wi-Fi and stuff and
you can play with it

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.900
and run around with it.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.150
I'd like to have seen it move.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.941
PROFESSOR: So you're
excited about learning

00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:33.600
more about robotics
and how they work?

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.567
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:34.567 --> 00:32:35.900
PROFESSOR: Anyone else have one?

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.858
ELIZABETH CHOE: Gianna?

00:32:36.858 --> 00:32:37.704
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:37.704 --> 00:32:38.186
GIANNA: I have three.

00:32:38.186 --> 00:32:39.150
PROFESSOR: Pick one.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.202
Pick your best.

00:32:42.202 --> 00:32:43.547
GIANNA: I like the braces.

00:32:43.547 --> 00:32:45.380
PROFESSOR: So you have
braces, understanding

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.220
what braces do to your
teeth and how they work.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.710
That's cool, if
you've got braces,

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.020
so that would be interesting.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.440
AUDIENCE: Someone said
something about volcanoes.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.220
PROFESSOR: The
volcanoes, understanding

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.250
if there's a volcano
underneath your house.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.520
That was a cool idea.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.160
Is there lava under
my house, right?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.400
Yikes.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.120
Sixth grade, any advice
to our MIT students

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.200
before they take
your good feedback

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.620
and turn them into videos?

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.286
Anything you want to
make sure that they

00:33:12.286 --> 00:33:15.005
know to do or not to do as
they take your good ideas

00:33:15.005 --> 00:33:19.540
and over the next month develop
them into actual movies?

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.400
AUDIENCE: Use
picture ideas instead

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.264
of talking to them, like
show examples so they

00:33:26.264 --> 00:33:26.992
can memorize it.

00:33:26.992 --> 00:33:29.492
PROFESSOR: So we talked about
that, MIT students, yesterday,

00:33:29.492 --> 00:33:30.930
the idea of showing,
don't telling,

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.114
which I'm sure you guys talk
about in your writing a lot,

00:33:33.114 --> 00:33:33.270
right?

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.228
Showing, don't telling.

00:33:34.228 --> 00:33:35.225
Cool.

00:33:35.225 --> 00:33:37.165
AUDIENCE: Don't ask
too many questions,

00:33:37.165 --> 00:33:40.560
like when we watch one video
and it asks a ton of questions.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.500
And we didn't really
understand it.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.410
PROFESSOR: You mean asking
the audience question?

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.471
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like
saying, what does this do?

00:33:47.471 --> 00:33:48.320
What does this do?

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.760
If they're just saying one
thing and then show it.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.289
PROFESSOR: So
asking your audience

00:33:52.289 --> 00:33:53.580
too many questions is annoying.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.955
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:55.955 --> 00:33:57.610
PROFESSOR: You
first, and then you.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.830
AUDIENCE: Be original.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.582
PROFESSOR: Be original, so
try and have a new idea.

00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:02.568
And what else?

00:34:02.568 --> 00:34:06.512
AUDIENCE: While you explain
how things work, try and make

00:34:06.512 --> 00:34:10.124
some jokes while you do it,
so your audience laughs at it

00:34:10.124 --> 00:34:13.339
and they understand what
you're talking about.

00:34:13.339 --> 00:34:14.130
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.860
Last one.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.019
AUDIENCE: Don't use
a monotonous pitch.

00:34:18.019 --> 00:34:18.810
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.800
Change your voice around and
make it more interesting.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.210
MIT students, I'm curious
from you what was valuable

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.900
that you got from
the sixth-graders

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.826
today, to give them some
feedback about this experience.

00:34:29.826 --> 00:34:31.929
Did anyone get
really good feedback?

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.922
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
well, I found that--

00:34:33.922 --> 00:34:35.296
and I should have
realized this--

00:34:35.296 --> 00:34:38.976
is that having robots stomping
around and destroying a city

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:41.605
is way more fun than showing
old people doing math.

00:34:41.605 --> 00:34:43.854
PROFESSOR: Robots are more
than old people doing math.

00:34:43.854 --> 00:34:45.873
Huh.

00:34:45.873 --> 00:34:48.164
AUDIENCE: I, too, learned
that my tastes are different,

00:34:48.164 --> 00:34:52.696
that lava and volcanoes are a
lot more interesting than food

00:34:52.696 --> 00:34:54.612
decomposing.

00:34:54.612 --> 00:34:56.528
PROFESSOR: He wanted
to show food rotting,

00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:58.124
and everyone
thought that was not

00:34:58.124 --> 00:35:00.839
as fun as volcanoes exploding.

00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:03.150
Any other thing from
the MIT students

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.958
that you found helpful?

00:35:04.958 --> 00:35:05.458
Yeah.

00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:09.168
AUDIENCE: I was
kind of-- it helped

00:35:09.168 --> 00:35:13.174
me to know how much people in
sixth grade know about some

00:35:13.174 --> 00:35:15.808
of the really complicated
subjects that we're using,

00:35:15.808 --> 00:35:16.985
learning here.

00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:17.776
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:35:17.776 --> 00:35:20.025
We had to do a conversation
about sinking and floating

00:35:20.025 --> 00:35:21.683
and how do boats even work.

00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:23.800
It was awesome.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.697
Well, we can't thank
you sixth-graders

00:35:25.697 --> 00:35:26.905
enough for coming here today.

00:35:26.905 --> 00:35:27.879
So helpful.

00:35:27.879 --> 00:35:28.853
Thank you.

00:35:28.853 --> 00:35:31.288
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:31.288 --> 00:35:33.730
And then, we'll be in
touch with you guys

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:35.786
to let you know how we
get our ideas developed.

00:35:35.786 --> 00:35:38.266
ELIZABETH CHOE: And the videos
that you guys made with me

00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:39.754
last month are almost finished.

00:35:39.754 --> 00:35:42.234
Carrie is almost
finished with them today.

00:35:42.234 --> 00:35:44.218
So I will send those
over to your teachers

00:35:44.218 --> 00:35:46.676
and you can watch them
some time this week.

00:35:46.676 --> 00:35:48.300
PROFESSOR: Any
directions from teachers

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.950
before they leave the room?

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.210
And coming up next?

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.235
AUDIENCE: Nope, just
make one long single line

00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:56.110
so I can count before
you leave the building.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.560
And then I'll count
you on the bus again.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.003
PROFESSOR: Check for jackets
and all of those things.

00:35:59.003 --> 00:36:00.764
But have a safe trip back home.

00:36:00.764 --> 00:36:02.097
AUDIENCE: Did you say thank you?

00:36:02.097 --> 00:36:02.951
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:02.951 --> 00:36:05.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.
