MALE SPEAKER: I'm
really happy to welcome

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.050
our two guests and my
friends here today,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.255
Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal.

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:13.180
As you know, wellness,
optimum living

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.450
have been big topics
at Google for a while.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.110
And they are complex issues.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.380
I know my colleagues wrestle
with these issues a lot,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.480
trying to figure out solutions.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.460
And today, what they
will be presenting

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.870
and what we'll learn
more about, flow,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.220
I think is a big part
of this complex puzzle.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.720
And so I want to give you
a little bit of background

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.270
with both of these folks
before we get started.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.980
So Steven is a "New York
Times" best-selling author.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.800
He's an award-winning
journalist and co-founder

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.550
of the Flow Genome Project.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970
And he has many books,
including "Abundance."

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.150
And his new book,
"The Rise of Superman"

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.352
will be the focus on today.

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:56.810
His books have been translated
in many different languages.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.631
Articles have appeared in
more than 70 publications,

00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:02.130
including "New Times Magazine,"
"Atlantic Monthly," "Wired,"

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.120
and "Forbes."

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.040
Jamie Wheal is the
executive director

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.410
of the Flow Genome Project.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.070
And he's a leading
expert in neurosemantics

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.300
of ultimate human performance.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.350
And he works with Fortune 100
companies, leading business

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.470
schools, Young
Presidents' Organization,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.160
an also Red Bull, with
their world-class athletes.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.942
So with that, I'm going
to turn it over to Steven.

00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:32.276
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:33.150
STEVEN KOTLER: Hello.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.399
Thank you guys for coming out.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.910
I very much appreciate
you being here.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.550
I want to kind of
just orientate you

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.445
a little bit to what
we're going to do.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:42.320
I'm going to kind of
give you an introduction

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.740
to flow and start breaking down
some of the neurobiology, how

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.060
it works under the
hood and giving you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.620
kind of the broad
spectrum of importance.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.340
And then Jamie's is
going to take over

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.550
and he's going to talk
about practical applications

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.356
about how you can get
more flow into your lives.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:01:59.730
As a way to kind
of begin, I want

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.390
to tell you kind of where
I began with this, which

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.740
was when I was 30 years
old, I got Lyme disease.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.330
And I spent the better
portion of three years in bed.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.750
If you don't know what
Lyme disease is like,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.910
imagine the worst
flea you've ever had,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.470
crossed with paranoid
schizophrenia.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.150
So by the end of it, the doctors
had pulled me off medicines.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.450
My stomach lining
was bleeding out.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.949
There was nothing else anybody
else anybody could do for me.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.530
And I was functional,
5% to 10% of the time.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.109
My mind was totally shut down.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.150
My body was in so much
pain, I could barely walk.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.240
I was hallucinating.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.610
My short-term memory was gone.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.790
My long-term memory was gone.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.684
It was all gone.

00:02:33.684 --> 00:02:35.725
And at this point, I was
going to kill myself out

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:37.170
of practicality.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.640
The only thing I was going
to be from here on forward

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.530
was a burden to my
friends and my family.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.280
And it was really a question of
when and not if at that point.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.950
And in the middle of all this
kind of negative thinking,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.600
a friend of mine
showed up at my house

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.450
and demanded we go surfing.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.980
And it was a ridiculous request.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.730
First of all, it had
been about five years

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.950
since I had surfed
at that point.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.410
And the last time
I had surfed, I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.280
had nearly drowned in a big
way of accident in Indonesia

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.380
and wanted nothing
to do with surfing.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.980
And as I said, I could
barely walk across the room.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.440
And she was a pain in my ass.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.550
She wouldn't leave
and wouldn't leave.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.400
And kept badgering me
and kept badgering me.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.460
And after finally about
three hours of this,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.490
I was like, what the
hell, let's go surfing.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.497
What is the worst
that can happen?

00:03:14.497 --> 00:03:16.330
And they she kind of
walked me to their car.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.913
And they put me in their car and
they drove me to Sunset Beach

00:03:18.913 --> 00:03:19.660
in Los Angeles.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.910
And if you know anything
about surfing in Los Angeles,

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.420
you know that
Sunset Beach is just

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.460
about the wimpiest beginner
wave in the entire world.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.210
And it was summer.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.170
And the water was warm
and the tide was low.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.370
And the waves were crap,
like maybe two feet high.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.860
And no one was out.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.960
And they walked me out to the
break, literally by my elbows

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.910
and kind of helped me out there.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.780
They gave me a board
the size of Cadillac.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.904
And the bigger the board,
the easier it is to surf.

00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:44.260
This was enormous.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.169
And I was out there about
30 seconds when a wave came.

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.710
And I'm not quite
sure what happened,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.647
muscle memory took
over, whatever.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.230
The wave came.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.370
I spun the board around.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.370
I paddled a couple
times and I popped up.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.990
And I popped up into a
completely different dimension.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.850
My senses were incredibly
incredibly, incredibly acute,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.010
I was clear headed for
the first time in years.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.920
I felt like I had
panoramic vision.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.040
And time had dilated.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.060
It had slowed down.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.851
So that freeze-frame
effect, if you've ever

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:13.070
been in a car crash,
that was my experience.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.630
And the most incredible
thing was I felt great.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.960
I mean I felt alive, that
thrum of possibility.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.890
And it was the first
time in about three years

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.500
that I had felt it.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.530
And that wave felt so good,
I caught four more in a row.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.750
And after that fifth
wave, I was disassembled.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.600
I was gone.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.160
They had to carry me to the car.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.820
They put me in the car.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.640
They drove me home.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.050
They had to put me into bed.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.100
And people actually had
to come and bring me food

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.430
because for 14 days,
I couldn't walk again.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.850
So I couldn't make it 50
feet away to my kitchen

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.150
to make a meal.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.140
And on the 15th day,
which was the day

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.330
that I could walk again,
I got back in my car

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.700
and I went back to the
ocean and I did it again.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.320
And again, I had this kind
of crazy, quasi-mystical

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.370
experience.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.450
And again, it felt great.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.130
And the cycle kept
repeating itself.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.660
And over about six
months' time, when

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.050
the only thing I was doing
different was surfing,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.060
I went from about 10%
functionality to about 80%

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.030
functionality.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.130
So my first question was
what the hell is going on?

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.630
Because surfing is
not a cure for chronic

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.820
autoimmune conditions,
first of all.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.600
Second of all, I'm a
science writer by training.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.020
I'm a rational materialist.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.812
And I don't have
mystical experiences.

00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:21.270
And I certainly don't have them
in the waves while surfing.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.000
The whole thing
seemed ludicrous.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.880
Lyme is only fatal if
it enters your brain.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.939
And I was pretty
certain that the reason

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.980
I was having these
quasi-mystical experiences out

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.670
in the waves was
because I was dying.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.820
So where all this started
for me was a giant quest

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.750
to figure out what the
hell was going on with me.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.200
What I discovered was this
altered state of consciousness

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.280
I was experiencing had
a name, flow states.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.130
Now, you may know this by
other names, being in the zone,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.300
runner's high.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.620
If you happen to be a
beatnik jazz musician,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.900
then you're in the pocket.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.410
If you're a stand-up comic,
it's called the forever box.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.560
The lingo goes on,
and on, and on.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.885
The term researchers
prefer is flow.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:04.510
And they prefer this
term for a reason.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.390
It's actually a technical term.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.230
And we'll come back
to why in a second.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.640
But in flow, what
happens is attention

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.840
becomes so focused
on the task at hand

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.180
that everything else disappears.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.170
Your sense of action or
awareness merge together.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.070
So the doer and the
beer become one.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.930
A sense of self, our sense
of self-consciousness

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.390
disappear completely.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.240
Time dilates.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.116
So that means it slows
down like I mentioned.

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:30.364
You can that freeze-frame
effect, like in a car crash.

00:06:30.364 --> 00:06:31.400
Sometimes it speeds up.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.870
And five hours will go
by in like five minutes.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.980
And throughout all
aspects of performance,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.267
mental and physical
go through the roof.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:41.850
I'm not going to
dwell too much on it.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.385
I'm just going to
kind of explain it.

00:06:43.385 --> 00:06:45.220
And we're going to go
on to a lot of things.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.190
But I want to talk about
why flow actually healed me

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.110
from Lyme disease, just
so you guys understand

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.120
what was going on.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.690
We're going to talk later about
the neurochemicals involved

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.610
in flow.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.060
All of them significantly
jack up the immune system.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.179
More importantly, they reset
the nervous system back

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:01.720
towards zero.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.250
So they calm you down.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.150
An autoimmune condition
is essentially

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.710
a haywire nervous system.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.640
So the fact that periodic flow
states were calming my system

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.080
back down is allowing me
to form new neural nets.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.140
Neural nets that didn't lead
immediately back to illness.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.936
And this is what kind of gave
me a toehold and possibility

00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:21.580
to get better.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.450
What I also
discovered when I was

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.820
researching flow and
learning all this stuff

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.110
is that the exact
same state that

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.406
helped me get from seriously
subpar back to normal

00:07:32.406 --> 00:07:33.780
was helping a lot
of other people

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.540
go from normal up to superman.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.340
Another thing that I
learned very quickly on

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.660
is that I really was
not the first person

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.410
to come to this conclusion.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:50.150
Flow science dates back about
150 years, to the early 1870s.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.460
By the turn of the century,
Harvard psychologist

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.440
and philosopher William James
was looking at the state.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.390
And he was the first
person to figure out

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.550
that the brain can radically
alter consciousness

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.510
to improve performance.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.170
More importantly was the work
of one of James' students,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.740
Walter Bradford for Cannon,
who was a great physiologist.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.690
Bradford Cannon discovered
the fight or flight response.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.560
And in doing so, he kind
of give us our first window

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.390
into where this
accelerated performance

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.880
might be coming from.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.620
This was a very, very big deal.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.010
Before that moment in time,
performance enhancement

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.950
was essentially a
gift from the gods.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.360
You want a better time in
100-yard dash, Hermes can help.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.240
You want to write a better
poem, talk to the muses.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.750
But Walter Bradford Cannon
turned a gift from the gods

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.270
into standard biology.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:44.274
He give us our very first
toehold into the mystery.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:48.660
In 1940s, psychologist
Abraham Maslow

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.160
picked up on this thread.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.890
He discovered that
flow was a commonality

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.140
among all successful people.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.040
And then in the 1960s and '70s,
the real revolution began,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.132
a guy named Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi,

00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:03.340
who is then the chairman of
the University of Chicago

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.200
psychology department.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.920
Csikszentmihalyi sort of-- well,
Maslow discovered the state

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.260
in successful people.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.799
Csikszentmihalyi got curious
about kind of everybody else

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:13.340
in the world.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.260
So he made what
is now considered

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.830
one of the largest global
psychological studies ever.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.360
He went around the
world, asking people

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.040
about the times in their
life when I felt their best

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.470
and they performed their best.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.734
And it was a huge group.

00:09:25.734 --> 00:09:27.150
He started out
talking to experts.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.530
He talked to expert
rock climbers,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.805
ballet dancers,
artists, surgeons.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:32.909
It didn't matter.

00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:33.950
They all said same thing.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.824
They felt their best.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.320
And they performed their best
in the state he termed flow.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.604
Then he blew it out
to everybody else.

00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:41.770
And by everybody else, I
really mean everybody else.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.790
He talked to Navajo
sheepherders.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.970
He talked to Italian
grape farmers.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.720
He talked to elderly
Korean women.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.250
He talked to Japanese teenage
motorcycle gang members.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.840
He talked to Detroit
assembly line workers.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.380
Everybody he talked to
told him the same thing.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.550
They felt their best,
they performed their best

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.970
when they were in
the state of flow.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.347
Csikszentmihalyi also came
up with the term "flow."

00:10:03.347 --> 00:10:05.930
One of the reasons was when he
was talking to all these people

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.180
and they describing this
state, they always said,

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.910
well, I'm using my
skills to the utmost.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.840
I'm pushing myself as
far as I possibly can.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.370
But it feels effortless.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.640
When I'm in this
state, every decision,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.800
every action leads seamlessly,
fluidly to the next.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.700
In other words, flow felt flowy.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.850
The other major finding
that came out of this,

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.080
as I hinted at a second
ago, flow is ubiquitous.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.700
It shows up everywhere,
in anyone, anywhere,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.000
provided certain initial
conditions are met.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.620
What this means is that
everybody from jazz musicians

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.450
in Algeria, to software
designers in Mumbai,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.310
to coders here in Silicon
Valley are using flow

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.500
to massively
accelerate performance.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.360
And it is a considerable
bit of acceleration.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.680
Flow amplifies all of
our physical skills.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.335
So in this state, we are better.

00:10:55.335 --> 00:10:56.310
We are faster.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.000
We are stronger.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.916
We are more dexterous.

00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.070
And we are more agile.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.070
So our brains.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.130
Flow jacks up
information processing.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.220
So when we're in the
state, our senses

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.370
are actually taking in more
information per second.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.790
We're processing it more deeply.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.205
So that is using more
parts of our brain at once.

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.080
And while there's a lot
of debate about this,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.890
it does appear that we are
processing it more quickly.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.210
And it's not just
information processing

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.690
that is getting jacked up.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.750
Pattern recognition, future
prediction, basically all

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.730
the fundamental neuronal
processes in the brain

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.200
are amplified by flow.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.780
As a result of
this, scientists now

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.140
believe flow sits at the heart
of every athletic championship.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.150
So almost every gold medal
that has ever been won.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.720
But it also accounts for
significant, significant

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.460
progress in the arts and major
scientific breakthroughs.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.860
In business, McKinsey
did a 10-year study.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.980
They found that top executives
report being five times more

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.430
productive in flow
than out of flow.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.450
So you got to stop
and think about that.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.390
Normally, I have to
explain to most audiences

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.710
that five times is
actually a 500% increase.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.640
I'm guessing you guys got it.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.280
But what that means is you
can go to work on Monday,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.640
spend Monday in flow, take
Tuesday through Friday off,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.290
and get as much done as
your steady-state peers.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.600
So it is a huge, huge,
huge amplification.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.966
And that 500% increase
may sound ridiculous

00:12:20.966 --> 00:12:22.840
until you consider
action-and-adventure sport

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.570
athletes.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.480
So one of things
McKinsey discovered

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.520
is that average people, average
workers, spend less than 5%

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.270
of their work life in flow.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.860
One place where this
is definitely not true

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.650
is in action-and
adventure sports.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.160
Action-and-adventure
sport athletes,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.460
for reasons that Jamie is
going to get into later,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.285
have essentially become the
best flow hackers on Earth.

00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:45.411
And this has happened over
about the past 25 years.

00:12:45.411 --> 00:12:46.618
And there are reasons for it.

00:12:46.618 --> 00:12:48.029
And we'll talk about them later.

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:49.945
But I want to tell you
what this has produced.

00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:52.980
It has produced near
exponential growth

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.310
in what's termed ultimate
human performance, which

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.110
is performance when life
or limb is on the line.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.310
Nothing like this has
ever happened before.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.080
Sports progression, it's slow.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.030
It's steady.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.820
It's governed by the
laws of evolution.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.840
At no point in history does
it quintuple in a decade.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.861
Yet this is exactly what's been
happening in surfing, skiing,

00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:13.360
snowboarding, rock climbing,
mountain biking, et cetera, all

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.693
the action and adventure sports.

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.410
I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.980
Surfing is a great one.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.150
This is a
thousand-year-old sport.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:25.075
From 400 AD to 1996, the biggest
wave anybody has ever surfed

00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:26.400
is 25 feet.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.130
Above that, it's
believed impossible.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.860
Scientists don't
think it's possible.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.650
Surfers don't think
it's possible.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.340
Today, we're pushing
into 100-foot waves.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.530
In snowboarding, in 1992,
the biggest gap jump

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.600
that anybody had ever
cleared is 40 feet.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.970
Now, 40 feet is a big jump
to clear on a snowboard.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.110
Today, as you can
tell from this image,

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.520
snowboarders are pushing
into 230, 240 foot jumps.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.900
So near exponential growth in
ultimate human performance.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.940
The better news, at the same
time all this is going on,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.580
they solved a
couple of problems.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.380
For a long time, one of the
big problems in flow research

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.120
was the subject of state.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.224
How the hell do know if your
research subjects are in flow?

00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:10.390
The good news about action
adventure sport athletes,

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.010
sort of, is that the
level of progression

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.470
has advanced so
much in recent years

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.190
that if people are not in
flow on their performing,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.050
they're ending up in
the hospital or dead.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.660
So this gives you a hard
research set to work with.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.769
It's a hard data set.

00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:25.310
If they lived through
the experience,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.900
we know they're in flow.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.630
Simultaneously, combined with
this-- flow science, as I said,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.180
goes back to 150 years.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.570
Most people are really aware
of the first 130 years, which

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.860
is when we figured out the
psychology of the state.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.690
And we got really good at
the psychology of the state.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.745
What's happened since 1990ish
is that our neurobiology

00:14:45.745 --> 00:14:46.620
has gotten very good.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.130
Our brain imaging technology
has gotten very good.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.880
EEG has gotten a lot better.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.700
And for the very
first time in history,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.360
we can look under
the hood and we

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.560
can figure out what's
going on in flow.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.280
One of the first things that we
discovered is there's-- the old

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.460
idea about ultimate human
performance was based

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.142
on what's called
the 10% brain myth.

00:15:05.142 --> 00:15:06.600
It was actually a
misinterpretation

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.220
of William James.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.803
But it's the idea-- and I'm sure
you're all familiar with it--

00:15:09.803 --> 00:15:11.650
that most of us only
use 10% of our brain.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.580
For ultimate
performance, a/k/a flow,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.910
it has to be all of our brain
firing on all of our cylinders.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.760
That was the idea.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.650
It turns out that's
exactly backwards.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.280
What's happening in
flow is the brain

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.590
isn't becoming hyperactive.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.930
It's actually starting
to deactivate.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.820
So this is happening
for a number of reasons.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.350
The simple reason is it's
an inefficiency exchange.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.220
The brain is a giant energy hog.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.460
It's 2% of our mass.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.300
It uses 20% of our energy.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.180
So one of the fundamental
rules of the brain

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.500
is how do I can conserve energy?

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.730
So conscious
processing is very slow

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.900
and it's extremely
energy expensive.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.700
Subconscious processing, on the
other hand, is very, very quick

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.526
and it's very, very
energy efficient.

00:15:53.526 --> 00:15:54.900
So what's happening
in flow is we

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.790
are trading conscious processing
for subconscious processing.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.700
As this is happening,
huge swatches of the brain

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.840
are being shut off.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.940
The technical term for this is
"transient," meaning temporary,

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.035
"hypofrontality," hypo, H-Y-P-O,
it's the opposite of hyper.

00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:13.950
It means to deactivate,
to slow down, to shut off.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.104
Frontality refers to
the prefrontal cortex,

00:16:16.104 --> 00:16:17.770
the part of your brain
that's back here,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.580
that houses all of your
higher cognitive functions.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.770
So why does time
dilate in a flow state?

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.210
Why does it speed
up or slow down?

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.080
Because time, as Baylor
neuroscientist David Eagleman

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.100
figured out, is calculated all
over the brain, especially all

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.230
over the prefrontal cortex.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.460
As parts of it
start to wink out,

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.450
we can no longer separate past,
from present, from future.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.290
So we're plunged
into what researchers

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.210
call the "deep now."

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.562
To give you another example
of what goes on in flow,

00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:46.520
another portion of the
brain that goes off-- we

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.060
talked earlier about how
self and self-consciousness

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.880
disappears.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.910
Why does self-consciousness
disappear in flow?

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.350
Because a portion of the brain
known as the dorsal lateral

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.230
prefrontal cortex,
which sort of is

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.500
responsible for self
monitoring and impulse control,

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.610
shuts down.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.329
So self-monitoring, that's your
inner critic, your inner Woody

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.829
Allen.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.280
That's that nagging,
defeatist voice

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.150
that's always on in your head.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.230
In flow, it's turned off.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.960
When it turns off, we
experience this as liberation.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.339
We are literally
free from ourselves.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.180
Creativity goes up.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.250
Risk taking goes up.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.099
Performance goes up.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.719
We are much more
open to experience.

00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:29.260
So what we've just
been talking about

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.460
is neuroanatomy,
where in the brain

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.079
something is taking place.

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:35.620
If you really want to kind of
map an experience in the brain,

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.120
you have to talk
about neuroanatomy,

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.030
where in the brain it's
taking place, neurochemistry,

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.670
and neuroelectricity,
which are the two

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.590
ways the brain sends signals.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.590
I'm going to talk a little
about neurochemistry.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.225
Then Jamie's going to pick
it up and talk a little bit

00:17:48.225 --> 00:17:49.740
about neuroelectricity.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:55.240
In flow, we get five of the
most potent neurochemicals

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.600
the brain can possibly produce.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.620
So all of these are performance
enhancing neurochemicals.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.820
Norepinephrine and
dopamine enhance focus.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.760
They tighten focus.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.440
They drive us more into the now.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.475
It also speeds up
muscle reaction time.

00:18:09.475 --> 00:18:12.390
They lower signal to
noise ratios in the brain

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.950
also so we have more
pattern recognition.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.600
Anandamide is a pain reliever.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.580
But it also speeds up or
increases lateral thinking,

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.080
thinking outside the box.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.790
So pattern
recognition is defined

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.500
as the linking of
similar ideas together.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.460
Lateral thinking is the linking
of disparate ideas together.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.310
That goes up in flow.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.800
Endorphins, very, very
potent painkillers

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.830
and very, very powerful
social bonding chemicals.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.340
And serotonin keeps
us calm throughout.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.310
That's the chemical at the
heart of the Prozac revolution.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.672
So the thing you need
to know about all

00:18:46.672 --> 00:18:48.380
of these neurochemicals,
besides the fact

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.250
that they up performance, is
how they impact motivation.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.420
So for those of you who don't
know much about neurochemistry

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.630
and drugs, all of
these chemicals

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.120
are incredibly potent
reward chemicals.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.290
Let's talk about
dopamine for a second.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.400
Cocaine is widely considered
the most addictive substance

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:09.900
on Earth.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.810
When someone snorts cocaine,
all that actually happens

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.612
is dopamine floods
into their brain

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.320
and then the brains
blocks its re-uptake.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.570
So the substance is in
your brain for longer.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.650
Norepinephrine-- let me go
back-- norepinephrine is

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.900
speed or Ritalin.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.910
Anandamide is the
same psychoactive

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.220
that's inside of marijuana, THC.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.700
Endorphins are opiates.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.315
And just to give you
an example, there

00:19:32.315 --> 00:19:33.760
are about 20
different endorphins

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.910
in the brain and the body.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.500
The most common one is
100 times more potent

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.040
than medical morphine.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.420
And serotonin is
essentially MDMA.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.694
The point here is that when
all five of these chemicals

00:19:46.694 --> 00:19:48.110
flood into your
brain, it produces

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.810
an extremely, extremely,
extremely addictive experience.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.682
Flow is arguably the most
addictive experience on Earth

00:19:54.682 --> 00:19:56.890
because it's probably the
only time, or the only time

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.931
that we know of, when all
five of these chemicals

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.300
get flooded into
your brain at once.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.350
Researchers don't like
the word "addictive."

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.220
It has very negative
connotations.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.600
So they prefer "autotelic,"
which means an end in itself.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.270
What this basically means is
that once an experience starts

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.670
producing flow, we will
go extraordinarily far

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.220
out of our way to
get more of it.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.280
Which is why researchers
talk about flow

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.950
as the source code of
intrinsic motivation.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.850
So why does this
apply in daily living?

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.670
One reason is, as a recent
Gallup survey pointed out,

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.880
71% of American
workers are disengaged

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.450
or actively
disengaged on the job.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.550
The other 29% have
jobs that produce flow.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.859
So we really know what the
solution is to this problem.

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:42.400
The other thing I
want to talk about,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.570
flow doesn't just
amp up motivation.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:49.410
It also massively
jacks up creativity.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.840
It's hard to put
numbers on this.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.380
We did a kind of a loose study
at the Flow Genome Project.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.650
And I say loosen
loose and preliminary.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.832
And people reported a 7x
improvement in creativity.

00:20:58.832 --> 00:21:01.030
To give you another
example of this,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.760
an Australian study--
it's a neat study--

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.790
they took 40 people.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.980
They give everybody a really
tricky brain teaser to solve.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.330
Nobody could solve it.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.690
They induced flow artificially
using transcranial stimulation.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.690
They literally took
an electric pulse

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.340
and knocked out the
prefrontal cortex

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.870
and basically induced
transient hypofrontality.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.090
23 people solved the
problem in record time.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.430
So creativity goes
massively through there.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.410
Again, this comes down
to neurochemistry.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.050
So creativity as a
skill is usually,

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.280
not always, but
usually recombinatory.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.580
It's the product of a novel
idea bumping into an old thought

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.160
to create something
startling new.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.310
So if you want to
increase creativity,

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.110
you have to increase
all of those things.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.520
Well, norepinephrine and
dopamine, they tighten focus.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.940
The brain is taking in more
information for a second.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.700
So it's heightening
our access to novelty,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.140
which is on the front end
of the creativity equation.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.270
Because they lower signal to
noise ratios in the brain,

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.290
they are also upping
pattern recognition,

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.420
so our ability to
link ideas together.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.690
And then anandamide is
increasing lateral thinking

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.990
or our ability to link
disparate ideas together.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.346
So literally the state of
flow surrounds creativity.

00:22:09.346 --> 00:22:12.280
And what's really interesting
here is creativity,

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.620
as most of you I'm
sure are aware,

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.240
is a quality that's
really, really desirable.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.650
IBM did a global survey.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.870
I think it was 1,500 CEOs.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.000
Of the quality most
necessary in a CEO

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.570
today, creativity was
the number one answer.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.450
Yet how to teach creativity?

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.620
How do we teach people to be
more creative, a big problem.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.150
Teresa Amabile at
Harvard did a study

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.430
where she discovered
that not only are people

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.416
more creative in
the state of flow,

00:22:37.416 --> 00:22:39.040
but that heightened
creativity actually

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.200
outlasts the state
by a couple of days.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.637
Which suggests-- and more
work needs to be done--

00:22:43.637 --> 00:22:45.220
but it suggests that
the state of flow

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.950
actually trains the brain
to be more creative.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.800
The other things these
neurochemicals do

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.070
is they exist to kind
of tag experiences.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.320
So a quick shorthand for
learning and memory, the more

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.260
neurochemicals that show up
during experience, the greater

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.940
chance that experience moves
from short-term holding

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.410
into long-term storage.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.840
Neurochemicals are essentially
a big tag on experience.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.250
It says, important,
save for later.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.110
So flow is a gigantic dump
of potent neurochemicals.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.400
So this has a radical
impact on learning.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.400
In studies run by
the US military

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.790
by DARPA in advanced
brain monitoring, which

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.290
is a team in
Carlsbad, California,

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.980
they again induced
flow artificially,

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.550
two different ways.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.258
They used transcranial
direct stimulation

00:23:28.258 --> 00:23:29.850
and they also used
neural feedback.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.220
And they found that
snipers in flow

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.260
learned an average of
230% faster than normal.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.780
They then repeated
this same study

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.360
with novices,
nonmilitary personnel.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.200
And they found that
the time it took

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.520
to get from novice to expert
by artificially inducing flow

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.120
could be cut in half.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.240
So what this tells us is
that Malcolm Gladwell's

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.320
famous 10,000 hours to mastery,
flow cuts them in half.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.610
So this is where I'm going
to stop with learning,

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:04.600
and creativity, and
motivation because I think

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.430
those are three big categories
that apply in everybody's life.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.050
As a way of kind of
transitioning into Jamie, what

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:15.520
I want to say is what has also
come out of all this research

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.696
is not just what's
going on in flow.

00:24:17.696 --> 00:24:19.820
And because we've had these
athletes as a data set,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.890
we can figure out
what they are doing

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.900
to get into flow so successfully
and we can work backwards.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.110
And we can apply this
knowledge across all domains

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.240
in societies.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.980
So what we've discovered is
that flow states have triggers.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.719
These are preconditions
that lead to more flow.

00:24:33.719 --> 00:24:36.010
I'm going to turn it over
and let Jamie talk about this

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.910
and why they're so important.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.320
JAMIE WHEAL: Thank you.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.090
So about 2,000 years ago, there
was this epic, "Old Testament"

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.485
rap battle between Rabbi
Hillel and the pharisees.

00:24:52.485 --> 00:24:53.860
And the pharisees
challenged him.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.890
They said, OK, Rabbi Hillel,
you think you're a hot shot.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.700
Can you stand on one leg
and recite all of scripture?

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.687
And he said yes, I can.

00:25:01.687 --> 00:25:02.270
And he did it.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.920
And he stood on one leg.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.950
And he said do
unto others as you

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.110
would have them do unto you.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:15.040
The rest of scripture
is mere commentary.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.180
And here at Google,
it's your guys' world

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.830
to be organizing the
world's information.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.400
And while that is
ambitious and noble,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.220
you guys know, too,
that it's the insights

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.200
we gain, it's not simply
the data we gather,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.140
that makes a difference.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.580
And where we are today
is truly drowning

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.660
in information and
just as we always

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.390
have been, starving
for motivation.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.810
We know better.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.010
We know we're supposed to eat
real foods, mostly plants,

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.190
not too much.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.180
We know we're supposed
to do work that matters.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.330
We know we're supposed
to practice gratitude.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.410
We know that meditation
is supposed to be amazing

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.470
if we ever get around to it
and can sit still long enough.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.610
We know all this stuff.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.270
But if you just-- a quick
glance at the stats behind me.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.370
Look at the toll.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.080
We are less healthy.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.040
We are more obese.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.950
There's higher
workplace injuries.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.710
There's dollar values
attached to this stuff.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.530
Lifetime fitness,
arguably the kind

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.750
of access to
embodiment and wellness

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:21.000
for like the suburban
masses, 75% attrition rate.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.920
And that's an
internal statistic.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.470
75% of the people
that say yes, I

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.920
want you to take my $150 a
month, I want the outcome,

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.890
never show up again.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:38.880
And most chillingly, a
study at Harvard conducted--

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.760
that, hey, when you are faced
with a chronic lifestyle

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.290
disease, diabetes,
heart disease, smoking

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.940
chronic stress, and your
doctor says, hey, look, here's

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.440
the deal.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.370
You really have to
change your ways

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.080
and if you don't,
it might kill you.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.100
This is what we're left with.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.130
Seven out of eight of us
would rather die than change.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.930
Mind boggling.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.779
So back to these guys.

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:12.320
[INAUDIBLE] is not just kind of
noodling around on the sides.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.840
They actually have a
full-bore research project.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.930
It is global.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.940
It is interdisciplinary.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.440
It's called the
Quantified Warriors.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.740
So forget you're kind of
Quantified Self meet-ups

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.720
here in the Valley.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.205
These guys are building
these supersoldiers of 2030.

00:27:25.205 --> 00:27:27.080
And what they're doing
is sort of alternately

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.780
fascinating and
horrifying, depending

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.404
on your point of view.

00:27:30.404 --> 00:27:32.070
But there's something
really interesting

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.944
that's been going on.

00:27:32.944 --> 00:27:34.810
And Steven talked a
little bit about there's

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.000
a 150 years of research.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.490
The last 10 to 20 years has
been getting super-interesting.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.420
And if I was in your
seats, I'd be saying, OK,

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.362
this sounds OK, cool.

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:44.820
But how come I
don't know about it?

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.090
If it was really all that,
we'd know about it right now.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.440
And there's actually a problem.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.316
There's a reason
why we don't have

00:27:52.316 --> 00:27:53.690
this as shared
working knowledge.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.750
Which is really how do we take
information and translate it

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.460
into motivation?

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.860
Because as Steven said,
flow is autotelic.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.970
Flow has this massive
neurochemical dump.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.250
It encodes and rewards
us to do more of it.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:12.380
And if we could unlock that,
intrinsic human motivation,

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.460
what's possible next?

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.840
Because these guys, the
Special Operations forces,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.590
Yale is working with Delta
Force and the Rangers,

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:24.020
and Red Bull is working with
the Coronado SEAL Team Six,

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.030
these guys are getting
way into the fine details.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.550
But they are
explicitly disincented

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.250
to share this knowledge.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.810
One of them wants to stay a
step ahead of the bad guys.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.420
And the other guys want
to step up on the podium.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.800
So what they've been learning
has not been shared yet.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.790
And certainly part
of our mission

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.780
is to actually take this
extreme, the folks who

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.620
risk their lives for
a living, and bring it

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.100
more into the mainstream.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.780
Bring it to impact
entrepreneurs.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.880
Bring it to communities
of innovation

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.392
where we can harness
the same rocket fuel.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.080
So to go back and
just kind of shake out

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.530
three of the more practical
takeaways of what--

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.590
if you remember nothing
else from today,

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.270
please think through these ones.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.110
Number one is what we
were just talking about.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:21.670
Flow is the source code of
intrinsic motivation reinforced

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.610
with the most potent
neurochemical set

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.470
we have access to.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.660
Next, it shortens learning.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.280
Which means either I get
to spend a lot more time

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.250
on the couch or I can
actually go further

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.450
in my domains of inquiry.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.230
I can learn more.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.550
What happens to
human progression

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.810
when we can double its efficacy?

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.300
And lastly, again
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.400
the godfather of flow, did
a 10-year global study.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.300
And one of the
additional benefits

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.030
was that the people who have
the most flow in their lives

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.030
are in fact the happiest.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.760
So as far as the bottom
line in optimal psychology,

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.230
that is the "so what"
at the end of it.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.310
So to go back to these action
sports athletes as a case study

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.879
because they've been kind
of a fringe population.

00:30:09.879 --> 00:30:11.545
People don't pay much
attention to them.

00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:16.100
The notion ski bum and surf
bum aren't exactly warm

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.630
embraces of people
who have dedicated

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.720
their lives in these domains.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.840
But they really have
come up with three

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.830
very good and transferable
ways for all of us

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.140
to get more flow in our life.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.180
And the three re
deep embodiment.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.840
When they are doing
things, they are

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.310
feeling the forces of gravity.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.300
So their proprioceptive
sense, like where

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.600
are my limbs in space,
my vestibular sense,

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.810
where is my inner ear in
relationship to my hips,

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.740
compression, weightlessness,
rotation, all of these things

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.520
are giving very strong
sensory motor inputs

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.860
into our body and brain.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.920
And as Steven was mentioning,
cells that fire together,

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.320
wire together and we create
richer and more robust

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.120
neural networks.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.780
So we've some
fascinating studies.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.300
They did a sort of human
life-sized Frogger experiment

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.110
with college
athletes versus just

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.480
frat boys and sorority girls.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.500
And they said, OK,
who's going to do better

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.170
at this life-size Frogger
game and who would you

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.560
put your money on?

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.400
Well, the athletes
and the athletes won.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.420
But not for the
reasons we would think.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.220
They didn't win because they
had faster reaction time.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.440
They didn't win because they
could-- explosive box jumps.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.120
They won because they could
process complex multivariable

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.670
equations faster and then
act on that information.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.175
So the notion of the dumb jock
was also absolutely wrong.

00:31:40.175 --> 00:31:43.020
And in comparison--
so this goes back

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.530
to the sort of ancient
Shaolin temple-- mastery

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:50.590
and control of body yielding
mastery and control of mind.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.700
So you go from
basically going on

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:57.060
a dial-up modem-- I'm just a
brain on a stick, disembodied,

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.990
disconnected, only perceiving
and receiving information

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:05.040
through one data feed-- into
broadband or even satellite.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.410
I am now picking up all
channels available to me

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.330
as a sensing cognition machine.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:16.220
And those neuron nets are
now fired and wired together.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.980
Next, rich environments.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.970
Think about the
difference in a surfer

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.140
or a skier, big mountain
skier, any of these things,

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.950
between just playing ping-pong.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.312
And every day that ping-pong
table is exactly the same.

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:28.020
And my paddle is.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.436
And the ball bounces
the same way.

00:32:29.436 --> 00:32:30.140
It all works.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.120
And I can kind of check out.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.930
But in a situation
where the environment

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:37.740
is so rich it's overwhelming
and stimulating,

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.690
it actually sort of can knock
out my waking sense of self

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.510
and forces me to pay
explicit, acute attention

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.980
because if I don't,
I get knocked down.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.680
And lastly, high
consequences, which

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.500
I just kind of foreshadowed.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.410
In fact, Oscar Wilde
I think famously said,

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.150
there's nothing
like the prospect

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.870
of being hung in the
morning to clear one's mind.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.395
So immediate high consequences
have this wonderful effect,

00:33:06.395 --> 00:33:08.020
which is very hard
in this day and age.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.540
We're always elsewhere
and elsewhen.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.770
I'm thinking about tomorrow.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:12.510
I'm on my phones.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.260
I'm pitching this.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.940
I'm posting that.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.800
Like high consequences bring me
back into the incontrovertible

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.520
now.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.390
It is the only place
that flow can happen.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.400
And if I get out of it,
if I drift, I get spanked.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.970
And it hurts and I learn.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.420
Now, think about how much of
our learning and experiences

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.400
these days are disconnected from
those kind of tight feedback

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.864
loops.

00:33:35.864 --> 00:33:37.655
So let's translate this
to your guys' world

00:33:37.655 --> 00:33:39.280
a little bit because
that's the beauty.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.060
And this would just
be kind of a curiosity

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.720
if it didn't matter
to us as well.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.930
So think about
rich environments.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.360
You guys are obviously in one.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.420
The cross pollination--
a lot of the sort

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.430
of cutting edge organizational
design of workplaces,

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.029
whether it's at
Pixar with the atrium

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:56.320
and the serendipitous meetings.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.716
Whether it's your guys'
cafeterias and restaurants,

00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:00.090
with the lines
and the management

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.330
and all of your commons
areas explicitly

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.090
designed to create
novel, changing

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.420
environments, high consequences.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.920
I mean obviously, next door
Facebook's got the shit fast,

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.280
break stuff, lean and agile
design and development.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.889
The entrepreneurial
mentalities that you guys

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.429
have where failure is expected
because if you're not failing,

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:25.360
you're not learning as
rapidly as you might.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:31.980
And deep embodiment, I mean
it's no mistake I think that you

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.949
guys here at Google,
with founders who

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:39.560
were both Montessori children--
which in the flow research

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.150
is the most flow-prone
educational method

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.909
in the world, with sensorial,
manipulative children sweeping

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:51.219
and cutting and actually using
body and brain simultaneously,

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:55.420
as well as the founders'
passion for all things action

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.770
sports and adventure,
the DNA of this place

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.524
is pretty much set up to be
about an optimal an environment

00:35:02.524 --> 00:35:04.690
for cultivating this as
anywhere you could think of.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.310
So Steven described
the five neurochemicals

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.710
and described the
neuroanatomy a little bit.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.360
But let's put this in motion.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.140
Let's actually put this
in time, through time

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.310
as we might experience it.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:25.620
Because what this is, what
we're calling the flow genome

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.500
matrix, which is literally
what's the genome?

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.320
What are the core components?

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.520
How do they work.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.340
And if we have that knowledge,
what can we do with it?

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.010
And just so you
guys kind of track

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.710
the research, the lineage
behind this model,

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:42.030
this comes largely out
of Herbert Benson's work

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.540
at Harvard, as well as
Dr. Lesley Sherlinis, who

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.160
is the sort of mad
scientist, EEG guy

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.100
behind a lot of the
SEAL team and Red Bull

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.340
work that we just
mentioned earlier.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.850
But let's just take a
look at this process

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:58.780
because the first thing to
dispel is that flow is a state.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.410
So it comes and it goes.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.270
It's not an ever
on kind of thing.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.070
But it's not like
a light switch.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.915
It's not just, it's on
and I'm in it, or it's off

00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:07.910
and I'm someplace else.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:08.680
It's a cycle.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.150
And it has at least
four distinct stages.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.200
So if we take a look
at how those progress,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.700
the first-- whether you're
a more of a fan of M. Scott

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.120
Peck and "The Road Less
Traveled" or Buddha

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.300
and his Noble Truths,
either way, life's a bitch.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.040
Life is struggle.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.160
And that's how it starts.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.680
And we start by being
in over our heads.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.380
We start by finding ourselves
in a situation or a condition--

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.276
and this could be late
night code delivery.

00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:36.150
This could be some new,
big business problem.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.980
It could be relational,
whatever it is.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.190
And we start out of our depth.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.050
And we end up with a
bit of a sort of angel

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.700
and a devil dialogue
on our shoulder.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.800
So our prefrontal cortex that
houses our executive function,

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.870
what we normally think
as me and the thing we've

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.090
been rewarded in school
and rewarded in work

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.840
for being smart and
controlled and precise

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.050
and delivering things on
time, we try and solve it

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.740
full frontal assault.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.240
But the problem is
bigger than that.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.510
It's bigger than
our capabilities.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.420
So we start toggling
back to kind

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.884
of our primitive sense
of self, our amygdala,

00:37:08.884 --> 00:37:10.550
and is this a fight
or flight situation?

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.680
Do I need to pull the rip cord?

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.340
And meanwhile, my brain waves
are in quite rapid beta.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.880
This is me trying to
solve binary problems

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.870
and this may not be one.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.850
And then I start
getting cortisol

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.390
and I start getting
adrenaline in my system.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.410
And I'm really
starting to get jacked.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.915
And it's either I'm going
to collapse at this point,

00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:31.790
right, it's going to be
a fetal position or--

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.934
or has anybody ever like put
on boxing gloves at the gym

00:37:34.934 --> 00:37:36.350
or tried to do
something like that

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:37.724
and then you get
like Mike Tyson?

00:37:37.724 --> 00:37:39.930
You say everybody's got a
plan until they get hit?

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.804
Have you guys ever experienced
an adrenalized response

00:37:42.804 --> 00:37:43.970
where your knees are wobbly?

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.856
Or even if it's just like cop
lights in the car behind you

00:37:46.856 --> 00:37:47.574
and it drives by.

00:37:47.574 --> 00:37:49.740
And it just pools in your
legs and you're like grrh.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.614
And you still feel like
you need to like puke

00:37:51.614 --> 00:37:52.700
on the side of the road.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.670
That's the adrenaline response.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.950
So that'll take most of us out.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:01.300
Unless, either through just
sheer fatigue, or dumb luck,

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.240
or knowing that there's
this actually loop on then,

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.530
I get into the next phase, which
is the relaxation response.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.875
And typically, and
sort of pro tip,

00:38:10.875 --> 00:38:13.000
when they did the research
with the darker snipers,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.172
as well as Olympic archers
and everybody else,

00:38:15.172 --> 00:38:16.630
the way they got
into this, the way

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.030
they made that shift
was focusing on breath.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.530
So tip of the hat to all your
guys' meditation practices.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.100
Focus on breath, lower
your respiratory rate.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.900
And you start
approaching equilibrium.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.750
Nitrous oxide enters
the bloodstream

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.860
and flushes away the
fight or flight chemicals,

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.720
flushes away the
cortisol, flushes away

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.000
the norepinephrine.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.200
And then brings in the
dopamine, the endorphins,

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.050
and the anandamide.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.380
At that point, my brain
waves go from faster beta

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:52.030
into a slower alpha wave.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:57.020
And I'm right there on the
doorstep of the flow state.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.730
I move into the flow state.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.200
And again, there
are four gradations.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.700
I mean you can have
what Steven had,

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.586
which was this sort of
spontaneous, healing,

00:39:04.586 --> 00:39:06.460
quasi-mystical experience,
like, ah, man, I'm

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.294
one with everything.

00:39:07.294 --> 00:39:09.668
Or you could just have it,
hey, all the lights were green

00:39:09.668 --> 00:39:11.520
and I got to work
five minutes early.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.880
How's it going?

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.660
So the point here is that if you
go into the deeper flow state,

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.840
you don't just hang out in that
alpha where I'm resourceful,

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.280
I've got insights.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.410
I actually move into an
even deeper, slower state

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:25.990
known as theta.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.070
And typically, that's
one that only shows up

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.280
in lifetime meditators.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.070
Any of the studies at Madison
on Tibetan meditators, that's

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.490
what you would see those
guys be able to get into way

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.230
more often than us.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.920
And the other time is kind of
in that threshold between waking

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.632
and sleeping.

00:39:42.632 --> 00:39:44.340
So if you've ever been
lying on the couch

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.360
and you're watching TV-- "West
Wing" used to do this to us all

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.150
the time, just soporific, grrh.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.460
But in that moment before
you're unconscious,

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.240
you're in a hypnogogic state.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.550
And it's so deeply relaxed,
most of us just miss it.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.410
We just go to sleep.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.450
We nod off.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.510
But if you've got
discipline and training,

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.320
you can actually stay there
and be alert and aware.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.770
And there and only there can
come these lightning bolts

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:10.330
of gamma.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:13.239
And that becomes these
gestalt integrations.

00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:15.530
That become sort of your
chocolate and my peanut butter

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.480
and yee-haw, we
got some Reese's.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:23.030
It becomes those moments of
massive lateral integration

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.500
that absolutely change the game.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.370
And finally-- and this is a
critical stage that most of us

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.180
forget about.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.200
We just don't-- oops,
I just did that.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.320
There we go.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.860
Most of us forget about
the recovery phase.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.220
But I'm sure you guys have
come across all this stuff

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.810
within the learning
theory, which

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.470
is that when we
think we're learning,

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:43.553
we're not really learning.

00:40:43.553 --> 00:40:46.610
When we're doing stuff, all
we're doing is collecting data.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.510
And that most of our
pattern consolidation

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.580
and actually annexing
of new skills

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.200
is happening as we
sleep, and specifically

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.840
when we sleep, in delta waves.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.510
So by no means are we just
have camping out for the week

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.320
after a flow state in delta.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.320
We wanted to highlight that a
lot of that integration, a lot

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.100
of my level up to
what's possible

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.630
for me now occurs in the delta
frequencies of deep sleep.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.040
So that in a nutshell
is the cycle.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.420
And think about what this means?

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:21.710
Because now that we know
this we can hack it.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:25.080
And what's so interesting
and exciting about that

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.010
is that think about the entire
there sort of human development

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.850
track, including mindfulness,
including optimal psychology,

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:34.210
including tons of the
wonderful stuff that's

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.020
both present inside
this organization

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.420
and kind of happening more and
more in the world, most of it

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.060
is trying to get our waking,
conscious selves, our egos,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.910
to go quiet, back
to Steven's slide

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.350
with our inner Woody Allen.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.000
But that's a real
tar baby experience.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.500
Because if I'm
reading a book on how

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.010
to get rid of the very part
of me that's reading the book,

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.490
it's kind of like hiding
your own Easter eggs.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.560
It's pernicious.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.220
It's sticky.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.870
And the more I struggle
with it, the stucker I get.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:08.150
That's why you see so many
uptight baby boomers at Esalen.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.650
I mean it's one of
those situations.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.470
I'm trying so hard that I
cannot actually decouple from

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.190
the thing I'm trying to release.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.230
So what this lets you
do is back into it.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.220
Don't worry about who you are
now and trying to change it.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:28.000
Just optimize your bio,
neuro self system and then

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.474
see what your subjective
inner experience is.

00:42:30.474 --> 00:42:32.640
And that's potentially game
changing and that's kind

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.300
of right where we are on
the verge of these days.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.680
So I want to leave
you guys with Steven,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.940
on just kind of a sense of
the direction of things,

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.210
where things are going next.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:46.587
And then we'd love to invite
your questions or queries

00:42:46.587 --> 00:42:48.670
and potentially just have
a conversation of what's

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:49.510
possible.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.106
Thank you very much guys.

00:42:51.106 --> 00:42:52.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.740
STEVEN KOTLER: So two things.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.370
Jamie gave you a look, high
consequence, deep embodiment,

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.460
rich environment.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.350
These are three flow triggers.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:11.300
There are, we believe,
17 total flow triggers.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.260
There are these three
environmental triggers.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.844
They're external triggers.

00:43:14.844 --> 00:43:16.260
There are three
internal triggers.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.830
These are
psychological triggers.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.504
There are 10 social triggers.

00:43:19.504 --> 00:43:21.420
There is a shared version
of a the flow state,

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.682
a collective version
known as group flow.

00:43:23.682 --> 00:43:25.390
There are 10 triggers
that bring that on.

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:28.110
And as far as we know, there
is one creative trigger.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.860
There is also the flow cycle,
which we just broke down.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.770
So the flow cycle
sort of functions

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.020
as a map for the experience.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.030
And the triggers
tell you what to do,

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.020
where you are in that map.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.720
The really important
thing and the thing

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.610
that I want to leave
you with is that we

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:47.050
are at the very, very front
edge of this research.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:49.065
We have a pretty
solid understanding

00:43:49.065 --> 00:43:51.300
of the psychology of flow.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.650
We understand the neurobiology.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:55.210
What we don't know is huge.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.800
We don't know, for example,
the order of the cascade.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.320
Neural chemicals proceed.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.590
Neuroanatomical changes proceed.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.130
Brain waves, we don't know.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:04.270
Nobody has a clue.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.020
And the physiological
questions, right?

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:06.854
We've got mind.

00:44:06.854 --> 00:44:07.520
We've got brain.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.550
But what's actually
going on in the body,

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.380
we're at the front, front
edge of that revolution.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.300
We're just starting to
answer those questions.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.469
And we're not going to really
get all this done until we have

00:44:17.469 --> 00:44:19.260
what we're calling a
heat map of flow which

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.460
maps the psychology
onto the neurobiology,

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.120
onto the physiology.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.760
And the reason I'm
telling you all this

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.140
is we know from
the McKinsey study

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.610
that top executives are five
times more productive in flow.

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.276
We know that
action-and-adventure sports

00:44:31.276 --> 00:44:33.840
athletes have produced
near exponential growth

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.180
in ultimate human performance.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.970
But we are just asked
getting started.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.400
If you talk to a lot
of people in this world

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.970
and ask them what percent
of our capabilities

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.700
do you think we've
actually used,

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.600
even with all this kind of flow
hacking stuff that we're doing,

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.650
the answer you get
is 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% 5%.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.220
I've never actually
heard anybody

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.090
give an answer above 5%.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.610
Which is to say
we are at the very

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.750
front end of this revolution.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.840
The near exponential growth
in ultimate human performance

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.820
showing up in
action-and-adventure sports

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.870
may not be the endpoint.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.862
It may be the starting
point for possibility.

00:45:06.862 --> 00:45:08.570
So that's where I want
to leave you guys.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.390
And then we'll open it up.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.110
We'll take questions.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.901
We'll have a discussion,
whatever you want.

00:45:11.901 --> 00:45:14.100
But thank you so
much for listening.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:22.650
AUDIENCE: So thanks
a lot for the talk.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.580
I'm a snow boarder, a kite
surfer, a motorcycler.

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:29.280
And now I realize why I
like those things so much.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.680
I guess it was pretty evident.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.244
But there was also
research that showed

00:45:33.244 --> 00:45:39.140
that people who ride motorcycles
regularly kind of live longer.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:42.997
Your research--

00:45:42.997 --> 00:45:45.080
STEVEN KOTLER: It definitely--
I mean it certainly

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.520
jives with what we know about
flow and the immune system.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.640
But I would just assume that
most who ride motorcycles

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.764
actually probably die younger.

00:45:52.764 --> 00:45:54.180
AUDIENCE: That's OK.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.540
Accidents aside, yes.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.000
But what I wanted
to ask is generally

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.200
like in the computer
world-- or we also

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.740
have several courses
at Google here

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.910
that claim that if you
overclock your processor,

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:08.620
the lifespan decreases.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.810
And what you claiming
with your research or some

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.060
of the research you mentioned
is that it actually improves

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:22.130
various aspects and creates
long-term positive effects.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.560
Is that true?

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.510
STEVEN KOTLER: Flow?

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:25.269
Yeah.

00:46:25.269 --> 00:46:26.770
Having more flow
in your life, which

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.840
means overclocking
your processor.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.870
And you mentioned
about the release state

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.730
and the importance of that.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.290
And I think we have
several courses.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.180
And [INAUDIBLE] and that talk
about that and how important

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.580
it is to take breaks and
stuff like that and so on.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.060
But what I'm
interested in is let's

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.610
say I find a way to induce
more flow in my life.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:49.490
Is it actually going to also
produce like long term--

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.290
or am I going to die
early, like Steve Jobs?

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:53.040
STEVEN KOTLER: OK.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:58.510
So there's two kind of
answers to this question.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:03.319
The first is that
the research shows

00:47:03.319 --> 00:47:05.360
that the people with the
most flow in their lives

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.900
are quote, unquote "the
happiest people on Earth."

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.430
That is something of a misnomer.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:15.810
So flow always, always,
always, always includes

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.160
kind of pushing
yourself to the utmost.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.760
You're rising to the challenge.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.460
One of the
psychological triggers

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.400
is known as the
challenge/skills ratio.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.476
So all of these flow
triggers that we

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:28.850
talk about, high consequence,
deep embodiment, et cetera,

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.925
flow follows focus.

00:47:29.925 --> 00:47:32.160
So all of these
flow triggers are

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.680
ways of driving
attention to the now.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.530
So one of the ways we know we
pay the most attention when

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:42.130
the skills we bring to
the task are slightly less

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.290
than the challenge at hand.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.270
It's known as the
challenge/skills ratio.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:49.340
Flow exists when we are
stretching, but not snapping.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:53.130
You are constantly rising
to meet your challenge.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.250
The studies show that
flow correlates directly

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:56.580
to life satisfaction.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.790
You get more meaning.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.950
You get more purpose.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.430
Happiness is fleeting.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:01.370
It's in the moment.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.122
It's I feel really
good right now.

00:48:03.122 --> 00:48:04.830
That may not always
be the case with flow

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.159
because rising to
challenges are difficult.

00:48:07.159 --> 00:48:07.950
It's uncomfortable.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.540
I always say that people who
get really good at flow hacking,

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.080
get really, really good
at being uncomfortable.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.610
The other thing I wanted to
say to kind of go back this

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:20.102
is-- and I want to talk about
why this is not self-help.

00:48:20.102 --> 00:48:22.060
And it's not self-help
for a couple of reasons.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.450
On the positive
side, self-help is

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:26.890
about 5% increase, 10% increase.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.960
It's about three things
I can tell you today

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.335
that you can start
doing tomorrow

00:48:30.335 --> 00:48:32.150
and your life is
going to get better.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.340
Flow is not like that at all.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.294
It is not 5%.

00:48:35.294 --> 00:48:35.835
It's not 10%.

00:48:35.835 --> 00:48:38.070
It is a step
function-worth of change.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.480
It is a big shift forward.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.640
But it comes at a price.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.080
Flow is dangerous.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.420
These neurochemicals
are very addictive.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.370
So you're playing
with fundamentally

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:49.830
addictive neurochemistry.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.520
Flow always requires
what we call

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.940
an escalating ladder of risk.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.460
You're going to keep taking
greater and greater chances,

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.720
pushing yourself farther,
and farther, and farther.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.765
That can get dangerous as well.

00:49:00.765 --> 00:49:03.550
And you're also playing
with very fundamental

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:06.320
human motivations, autonomy,
mastery, and purpose, which

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.597
is sort of what passion
looks like under the hood.

00:49:08.597 --> 00:49:09.930
These are all big flow triggers.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.090
These all show up in flow.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.630
They all produce more flow.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.220
You don't get to play with
addictive neurochemistry

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.660
and these kind of
fundamental human motivations

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.470
without danger.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.585
People find themselves--
they join a startup.

00:49:21.585 --> 00:49:22.710
They get into lots of flow.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.549
Startups are great
at producing flow

00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:25.840
for a lot of different reasons.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.964
A lot of the flow triggers
are kind of concentrated

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:29.120
in startups.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.770
And then the startup phase
ends and they're sort of

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.330
locked out of flow.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:35.590
There is a depression
that can come from this.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.270
If you get a lot of
flow in your life

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:39.770
and some day are locked out,
you can get very, very, very

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:40.479
deeply depressed.

00:49:40.479 --> 00:49:42.103
JAMIE WHEAL: Just to
speak specifically

00:49:42.103 --> 00:49:44.320
to your overclocking the
processor piece as well,

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:47.510
which is that the action sports
athletes, when the swell is

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:49.675
breaking for
[INAUDIBLE] in Maui,

00:49:49.675 --> 00:49:51.050
like they all sit
and do nothing.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:52.610
It's kind of almost a
hunter/gather style.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.500
We sit around, we tell
stories, we talk shit,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.990
and then something
big and crazy happens.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.670
We go and do it.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:58.270
And then the swell has come.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:59.860
The big storm has gone.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.970
And I have a natural downtime.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.900
And so that's my life
as an action sports

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.450
athlete cultivating flow.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:08.670
But what's my life in your
guys' world as knowledge workers

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.420
cultivating flow?

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.220
I do it.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.270
I crush the project.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.680
I come up with a novel solution.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.160
What happens to me then?

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.820
I get promoted.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.110
And so the pressure in our
controlled environments

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.030
to continue to do it and to
continue to tap and to go back.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.322
And now, I'm just revving
at a higher level.

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:27.530
And I've got all kinds of
obligations and commitments

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.362
to do this on command,
I think is real.

00:50:30.362 --> 00:50:32.320
And that-- which we don't
have up now, but back

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.380
to that recovery phase-- becomes
vital to ensure that I'm fully

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.780
replenishing that very expensive
state I've just produced.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.530
That I'm annexing the
information and that

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:45.640
I'm stably integrating it
into my both psychology

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.950
and physiology.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:50.730
AUDIENCE: And the
question is, for example,

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:56.180
all these sport or energy
drinks can boost your adrenalin

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:56.850
and stuff.

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:59.140
It looks like it doesn't
go really well with flow.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.700
Like you can't release
because your body

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.150
is like filled with chemicals
that actually boost you up.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.600
And so, for example, Red Bull
and all these pro athletes,

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.327
how does it go together?

00:51:10.327 --> 00:51:11.910
STEVEN KOTLER: It's
a tricky question.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.370
And part of the answer
is we don't know.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.700
But one of the things
that it does appear

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.680
is that at the front
end of the flow state,

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.250
you've got cortisol rising,
that norepinephrine rising.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.590
If there's too much of
that stuff-- and a lot

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:28.640
of these energy
drinks flood the body

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.100
with more of these
chemicals-- it

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.950
does appear that that can
block the relaxation response.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:36.720
So essentially
what's happening when

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.430
you go from kind of
the heightened focus

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.260
and the struggle phase
into the relaxation

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.350
sometimes, that's
when the switch

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:47.900
from conscious to subconscious
processing is taking place.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.350
Norepinephrine sort of, when
you have too much of it,

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:52.920
it functions sort of like OCD.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.987
You can't let go.

00:51:53.987 --> 00:51:56.320
You're holding on to the
problem and you're thinking it,

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.160
you're thinking it,
and you're thinking it.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.980
And that could absolutely
block the release state.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.160
It could block the
rest of the flow state.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.957
That said, there's caffeine.

00:52:04.957 --> 00:52:07.040
There's a whole bunch of
other things in Red Bull.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.720
You can say that Red Bull is a
flow precursor in some cases.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.070
It can be a flow blocker.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:13.670
It's very individual.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:17.790
And neurochemistry
appears to be individual.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.150
All of our receptors,
our receptors

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:22.810
for these neurochemicals are
essentially coded genetically,

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:24.940
how receptive they are.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.880
So it really could differ
at an individual level.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.200
And we just don't now.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.070
JAMIE WHEAL: And on
the healthy side,

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.111
if you really are looking
for something like what

00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:34.870
might I take or do, the most
interesting stuff-- and I

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:37.590
just down at Red Bull on Friday
and was talking with a Ph.D.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:40.330
candidate specializing into
this, which is-- nitric oxide,

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:42.330
we talked about, right,
was the neurotransmitter

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:45.660
that prompts you go from
struggle to release.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.470
The best exogenous form of it
is high concentrate beet juice.

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.800
It's high nitrate.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.360
Most pro-endurance athletes
in the world are using it.

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.890
It sort of debuted in between
Beijing and maybe even

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.682
London as far as
the Olympic stuff.

00:52:57.682 --> 00:52:59.140
And there's a
company, James Smith,

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:00.370
which we have no
affiliation with.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:01.494
But they're out of England.

00:53:01.494 --> 00:53:03.380
They're royal insignia stuff.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.480
And they do the both
high nitrate, measured

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.290
in joule shots, as
well as placebo ones.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.080
So all the academic
community globally uses them.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.530
So two or three hours after
ingestion of high nitrate beet

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:18.680
juice, it can transform
into nitric oxide.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.590
And that's potentially,
as far as healthy.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.800
And actually has some
mechanical impact on this.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.154
It's probably one of the
best things to look at.

00:53:26.154 --> 00:53:26.820
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.070
I don't want to talk too much.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:30.790
And omega-3 might have
some positive influence

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.420
on like getting into flow.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:36.170
Is it like research
some behind it?

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:37.170
JAMIE WHEAL: What might?

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:38.559
AUDIENCE: Omega-3.

00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:40.100
JAMIE WHEAL: That's
a mixed bag, man.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.310
I mean in the last
six months, there's

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:45.990
been a fair amount of sort
of not so positive stuff

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.220
on omega-3's, and just questions
on prostate cancer in men,

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.760
and various other sort
of ancillary things.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:57.460
That said, the chief physician
for the Coronado SEAL teams

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:00.620
gave a presentation specifically
on the role of fish oils

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.730
and high-grade fish
oils, on depression,

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:05.650
on physiological
recovery, on sort

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:07.800
of stability of mental
states, all kinds of things.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.560
And their evidence,
at least with the data

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.330
sets they were working with,
was overwhelmingly positive.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:16.130
So I don't know right now.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:20.060
And I kind of wish I did
because I like that certainty.

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:22.640
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned the researcher

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.041
who had done a lot of work
on the brain waves and then

00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:26.790
with your diagram.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.290
Can you tell us
a little bit more

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:31.980
about him or her
and how they came up

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.370
with their research, et cetera?

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.520
STEVEN KOTLER: Yeah,
Dr. Leslie Sherlin.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.910
He is probably the
world's leading researcher

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.767
on kind of the brain
waves, neuroelectricity

00:54:41.767 --> 00:54:42.600
of high performance.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.755
He-- five years
ago, six years, I

00:54:44.755 --> 00:54:46.880
don't know when they actually
started the project--

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.074
he teamed up with Red Bull.

00:54:48.074 --> 00:54:49.740
So there was at guy
Red Bull, whose name

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.690
is Andy Walshe,
a friend of ours,

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.190
who's the head of
high performance.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:55.240
His job is to take the
best athletes in the world

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.580
and make them better.

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.040
He teamed up with
Leslie and they

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.500
built essentially a
neuroscience skunkworks.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:05.400
So the problem with
EEG has been noise.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.970
So I can put an EEG on your head
and I can look at brain waves.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:13.230
But if you yawn, if you
blink, all that stuff

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.990
is going to register
as static, as noise.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.040
It's going obscure the signal.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.190
So motion, which is
if you want to look

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.830
at action-and-adventure sport
athletes, it's a real problem.

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.460
And we've only recently
gotten to the point

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.700
that our algorithms can actually
filter out the noise of motion.

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.870
So Leslie has developed
what they call Brain Sport.

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:33.500
It's a wireless, portable EEG.

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:37.900
And I think they've
looked at 5,000 athletes.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.200
They've compared
the top 1% athletes,

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.514
the elite of the elite, with
the top 5%, with the top 20%.

00:55:44.514 --> 00:55:46.555
And just kind of looked
at them across the board.

00:55:46.555 --> 00:55:48.680
So that's where a lot of
this research came from.

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.160
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.700
And actually just
to finish on that,

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.384
the interesting thing they found
was there was not a default MO.

00:55:53.384 --> 00:55:54.800
There wasn't a
consistent pattern.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.125
It wasn't like the
action-and-sports athletes

00:55:56.125 --> 00:55:58.510
all performed like Tibetan
monks or something like that.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:59.510
But what they
realized was it was

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:01.700
almost like the shock
absorber on a motorcycle.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.600
It was resilience and
the ability to-- they

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.730
could come into the
flow state from a bunch

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.440
of different locations,
depending on sports-specific,

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.960
genealogy, training, whatever.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.850
But it was their resilience
and their adaptiveness

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.510
that distinguished the elite
from even the advanced right

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:18.316
below them.

00:56:18.316 --> 00:56:20.790
AUDIENCE: A quick
question on audio stimuli.

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:23.980
I know there are software
programs, CDs out there,

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.280
that can supposedly
bring your mind down

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.552
to these different
wave patterns.

00:56:30.552 --> 00:56:32.010
Have you done any
research on that?

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:33.780
If those things
actually work or if they

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.530
can help advance the flow?

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:37.280
STEVEN KOTLER: I'm
going to let Jaime talk

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:37.990
about this in a second.

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:39.540
But there's one
thing I really want

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.940
to say because it's a pet peeve.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.400
It makes me crazy.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.410
There are a lot of
companies out there

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:47.790
who are, hey, this
produces flow.

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.970
And its single
correlate research.

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:52.070
It's we can get your brain
waves to alpha-theta.

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:57.030
Or there's some data that says
cardiac coherence produces

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.920
flow, and blah, blah.

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.975
So there's a lot of
companies, a lot of widgets,

00:56:59.975 --> 00:57:04.420
and a lot of things that
trigger one of these things.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.840
Flow is a huge cascade.

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.310
It's a full body/brain reaction.

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:10.604
There is nothing out
there that produces--

00:57:10.604 --> 00:57:12.020
except some of the
work that we're

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:13.010
doing at the Flow
Genome Project.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:14.080
And we're not there yet.

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.130
But we're sure trying to map it.

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:18.800
But most everything's that's
out there is a single correlate

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.300
thing.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.080
So we've got music that
can drive your brain

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.020
waves towards alpha,
towards alpha-theta.

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:25.611
That's great.

00:57:25.611 --> 00:57:26.110
That's neat.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:29.300
It's going to produce
parts of this experience.

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.060
But it is a full-on,
deep flow experience

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.400
with a full neurochemical dump?

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.520
No.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.070
There's nothing that
says that it can happen.

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:40.000
And there's not
any evidence of it.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.697
So these single correlate
fixes, they're getting at it.

00:57:43.697 --> 00:57:45.280
They're moving in
the right direction.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.680
But the truth claims
make me pretty nervous.

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.430
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:51.050
And simply from
the research I've

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.970
seen, bineural beats, which is
what you'll see a lot of those.

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.934
And they stagger
themselves slightly

00:57:55.934 --> 00:57:57.600
and it's supposed to
entrain your brain.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.160
I haven't seen a lot of
corroborating research

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.690
to actually support all
of those truth claims.

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:05.930
The stuff that has had a little
bit stronger evidence based

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:08.854
on backing is isochronic
brain wave entrainment.

00:58:08.854 --> 00:58:10.270
And the nice thing
about it is you

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:11.460
don't have to have
headphones on.

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.080
You can actually
just listen to it.

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.290
But even beyond that--
I mean there's a reason

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.370
that the whole electronic
scene has blown up

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:19.520
so hugely in the last
five to 10 years.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.390
There's a reason,
Burning Man culture,

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:25.250
all of those bits and pieces, is
that very high fidelity, loud,

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.800
cleanly separated
sounds absolutely

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.120
have a psychodynamic effect.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.760
And you can take
that to West Africa.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.380
I mean there's ancient
traditions on that.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.970
So even without the fancy
technology under the hood

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:38.520
that someone may be
selling you, clearly music

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.370
has a powerful
psychosomatic effect.

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:45.140
AUDIENCE: How do the
sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.380
nervous systems come
into play in all this?

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.020
JAMIE WHEAL: Well,
can you go ahead

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.966
and just take another couple of
steps into that and give us a--

00:58:53.966 --> 00:58:54.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:59:00.820
So specifically in the struggle,
release, recovery-- or sorry,

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:08.350
struggle, release, flow recovery
phases you showed earlier,

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:10.000
the struggle phase
kind of reminded me

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.440
of what I had heard
very anecdotally and

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.267
unscientifically about the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:59:15.267 --> 00:59:17.100
And then the alpha waves
kind of reminded me

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.150
of the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.000
And I was wondering
if that's true?

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:22.750
JAMIE WHEAL: Yeah.

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:26.050
I mean the short
answer is don't know.

00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:27.480
And I think it's
the tracking-- I

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.100
mean being able to track
the neurotransmitters

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.180
in a live human, right,
tricky, as well as to be

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.950
able to have
multivariable sensing.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:38.730
So just to give you
guys an understanding,

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:39.780
like where is the marketplace?

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:40.821
Where's the cutting edge?

00:59:40.821 --> 00:59:43.370
So we mentioned that darker,
Quantified Warrior project.

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:46.760
They love the Red Bull guys
because the Red Bull guys

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.630
are just trying real
stuff with people.

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.020
They're actually out
there with their athletes

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.270
and trying to get them better.

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:53.750
Where government and military
projects are much more

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:56.860
kind of-- just the way they
move, and innovate, and think

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.584
is just distinct.

00:59:57.584 --> 00:59:59.000
And so they love
the Red Bull guys

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.208
because they're trying stuff.

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:02.120
We go to the Red
Bull guys and we're

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:02.860
talking with the scientists.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.640
And we're like, hey, have you
put this together with that?

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.400
Well, what about
these three things?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.470
And even those guys,
bless their hearts,

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:11.860
aren't actually doing an
integrated, multivariable

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.110
metrics and management.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.254
So the short answer
is we don't know yet.

01:00:15.254 --> 01:00:16.670
And I would picture
that those are

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.440
the kind of fascinating
questions that

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.876
hopefully in the next five
years or so we'll be starting

01:00:21.876 --> 01:00:23.875
to help facilitate those
conversations and those

01:00:23.875 --> 01:00:23.960
[INAUDIBLE].

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.710
AUDIENCE: Is the fight
or flight response,

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:29.025
would that be an example or
symptom of that struggle phase?

01:00:32.272 --> 01:00:33.980
STEVEN KOTLER: So the
fight or flight is.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.750
It's one example.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.650
It's one extreme example.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.910
But when you talk to the
action-and adventure sport

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:47.980
athletes about it,
what they will tell

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:53.380
you is that they ride the
heightened focus of the fight

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.060
or flight response in the flow.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.520
They sort of get into the
gap before actually the fear

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.400
becomes an emotion.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.250
They see it kind of
rising and they just

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:08.680
ride that focus into flow
and block that response.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.000
Flow is flowy because
its choice is wide open.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.060
One of the reasons you can make
almost picture-perfect decision

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.900
making is because you
have lots of options.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.775
You're taking in more
information, et cetera,

01:01:20.775 --> 01:01:21.330
et cetera.

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:23.230
In the fight or flight
response, your options

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:25.000
are fight, flight, or flee.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's totally the opposite.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.880
So you are right, it is
totally the opposite.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.382
But you can ride
one into the other.

01:01:31.382 --> 01:01:33.090
JAMIE WHEAL: So the
first thing is, yeah,

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.390
anyone in their right
mind should be afraid

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:39.330
when you're rolling the dice on
16 feet per second per second.

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:41.060
So natural and healthy.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.520
And then the question is,
is it back to Steven's point

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.500
about the challenge and skills?

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.190
Is it enough out of my comfort
zone that I am nowhere else?

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:53.550
In fact, I have a friend who
is the CEO of a big company.

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:57.060
He says I don't like road biking
because when I'm on the road,

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.220
I'm still in my day.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.590
I love that trail that we
ride because I am nowhere else

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:06.100
for the three minutes
it takes to get down it.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:09.260
And so the beauty is can I find
that place where I'm nowhere

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.680
else, but not in the hospital?

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.890
STEVEN KOTLER: Most people have
had tons of flow experiences.

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.920
You probably have them
almost on a daily basis

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.336
and you don't
actually realize it.

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:21.300
And here's why.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.050
Flow exists on a spectrum.

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:25.310
It like any emotion,
like anger, right?

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.840
You can be a little irate or you
can be homicidally murderous.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.299
So there's micro-flow when
action and awareness start

01:02:33.299 --> 01:02:34.840
to mere, maybe time
starts to dilate,

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.530
and you're paying attention
to the [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:39.301
Macro-flow, where you get all of
the various conditions of flow

01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:39.800
at once.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.660
If you've ever lost yourself
in a great conversation,

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.425
the whole afternoon disappears.

01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:46.900
If you've ever gotten so
sucked into a work project

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.108
that nothing else seems to
matter for a little while,

01:02:49.108 --> 01:02:51.455
those are all
micro-flow experiences.

01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:54.120
They're on the same
spectrum leading up

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.770
to these giant, deep
flow experiences.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:00.930
So, as I said, there
are 17 flow triggers.

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:03.472
The more flow triggers that
get packed into an event,

01:03:03.472 --> 01:03:04.930
the greater the
chance you're going

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:07.150
to move into a really
like truly deep flow

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.540
experience rather than
a micro-flow experience.

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.390
But we have these
micro-flow experiences.

01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:12.740
We recognize deep flow.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.230
We know it immediately,
time dilated or something.

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:17.760
Like you're like, oh, my
god, I'm in that state.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.110
But what we miss is that we're
in micro-flow all the time.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.290
And if you actually can
start watching for it,

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:25.600
you can start extending
it and deepening it.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.352
You can play with it and
really start to utilize it.

01:03:29.352 --> 01:03:31.560
STEVEN KOTLER: By the way,
when they do flow studies,

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.090
as a manager, one of
the most common flow

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:36.505
experiences among middle
managers in conversation

01:03:36.505 --> 01:03:37.620
at work.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.930
Why?

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:40.270
Work usually involves money.

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:41.347
So it's high consequence.

01:03:41.347 --> 01:03:42.930
It's a higher
consequence environment.

01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:45.263
And then you start looking
at the social triggers, group

01:03:45.263 --> 01:03:45.860
flow.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.765
Work conversations
tend to drive them.

01:03:47.765 --> 01:03:49.890
You don't have them in
casual conversations at home

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:50.900
when you're hanging
out with your friends.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.365
But work conversations tend
to produce this more often.

01:03:53.365 --> 01:03:53.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:56.250
Can you tell us a bit
more about the flow dojo?

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.289
And is there a physical
space that exists?

01:03:59.289 --> 01:04:00.330
What are you doing there?

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.280
When do you plan to
do with the dojo?

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.696
JAMIE WHEAL: What I'll do is
I'll just describe it to you.

01:04:04.696 --> 01:04:06.440
But yes, I mean
our answer really

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.265
is what would it be
like to sort of combine

01:04:09.265 --> 01:04:12.910
a Montessori-prepared
environment, but for grown-ups,

01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:16.040
and exploratory style,
interactive, sort of

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.530
exhibits in installations?

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:22.040
But instead of for science, have
it be for embodied cognition,

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:25.090
with a sprinkling of X-games.

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:29.370
So you have fun, safe ways to
give people the sensorimotor

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:32.080
inputs that these athletes
typically use themselves

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.770
and then put a layer of
quantified self on top of it.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:38.230
So giant geodesic dome
playground training centers,

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:40.890
whereby we can all
train our games.

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:44.270
We can all burn and fuse
additional neural pathways.

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:48.620
And we can put ourselves
into that nonseeking

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.080
state of hyperperformance.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.030
And ultimately back
to the drowning

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:55.900
in information,
starving for motivation.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:59.880
At least our assessment of most
developmental technologies--

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.700
there's so much great
stuff out there.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.270
Most of us fail in
long-term practice.

01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:06.980
So if we can go back
to that autotelic piece

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.740
and harness flow states
in service of whatever

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.360
my goals in life and work
are, but ultimately even

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.060
the following of well-worn
lineage paths in the wisdom

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.271
traditions or whatever else
is up, if we can do that,

01:05:18.271 --> 01:05:19.520
it's something pretty amazing.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.810
And certainly communities
with you guys,

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.110
places like this where
there's such sort

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:27.980
of high-value human
capital, the ability

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.577
to optimize that, both in the
moment and longitudinally,

01:05:32.577 --> 01:05:33.410
feels really useful.

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:36.550
It feels like a way
to help impact it.

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:38.770
STEVEN KOTLER: Let me add
two quick things to that.

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:42.920
One, the more flow you have,
the more flow you have.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.335
So this all about attention.

01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:48.420
You're training the
brain go into the flow.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.370
So you can train the brain on
the ski slope to go into flow.

01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:55.390
It's going to bleed into
your work at the office.

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:58.360
You're going to find yourself
getting to flow more easily.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.770
If you can learn how to do this
one area, it transfers over.

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:03.560
And I want to just
kind of give you

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.140
an ephemeral look
at the flow dojo.

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.390
I want to give you just kind
of like this is the gear,

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:09.652
this is what we're doing,
this is what it looks like.

01:06:09.652 --> 01:06:12.110
One of things we have-- and
there's lots and lots of toys--

01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:15.410
but one thing is we have is
a 20-foot looping surf swing.

01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:17.100
So you stand on a surfboard.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.430
Your feet are strapped in.

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.390
Your writs are strapped in.

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:24.650
And you can be upside down, 25
feet off the ground or pulling

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.860
3 and 1/2 gees at the
bottom of the loop.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.790
So you've got high consequence,
novelty, unpredictability,

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:32.700
and complexity, our
rich environment,

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.910
lots of those things as well.

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:37.610
All of those flow
triggers are there.

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:39.370
So we've got that.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:43.170
Simultaneously, you are wearing
Leslie Sherline and the Brain

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:45.430
Sport helmet, the EEG helmet.

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:48.150
So we know flow exists
near alpha-theta.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:53.390
So the entire giant surf
swing is lined in LED lights.

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:55.732
So it is real-time
neurofeedback.

01:06:55.732 --> 01:06:56.940
So you're wearing this thing.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.990
You're pulling all
these flow triggers.

01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:01.230
But you can also
drive your brain.

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:04.120
If you are in
alpha-theta, it glows red.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.770
If you are in beta, it's blue.

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:07.630
So you have real-time
neurofeedback.

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:10.600
And to solve the mystery--
because our real goal-- well,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.560
one of our real goals
is to really advance

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.670
flow science and culture--
you are wired head to toe

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.700
with all the quantified
self, data-gathering stuff.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.220
So not only are we using these
flow triggers and neurofeedback

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.590
to drive you into flow, we are
data capturing along the way.

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:27.600
And I hate the term "big data."

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.140
I don't think it means anything.

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.760
But hopefully, this allow us
to take a big data approach

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.032
to flow, which hasn't
been done before.

01:07:34.032 --> 01:07:35.990
Csikszentmihalyi did it
at psychological level.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:37.990
Nobody has done it at the
neurobiological level.

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:41.089
And that's what this is about.

01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:42.630
AUDIENCE: Have you
considered looking

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:46.012
into the personalization
aspect of flow?

01:07:46.012 --> 01:07:47.470
Because I'm not
sure that everybody

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.930
experiences flow
in the same way.

01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:50.820
I mean not for the
same activities.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:55.890
For example, some people this
you studied are like athletes.

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:57.870
But-- I don't know.

01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:59.900
I mean there are
scientists who think

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.330
that differently, et cetera.

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:05.600
There's all this research about
personality types, et cetera.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.240
The Gallup organization
itself, to solve their problem

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.220
of 71% of engagement,
developed their own system,

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.800
which is called StrengthsFinder.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.633
STEVEN KOTLER: Yeah.

01:08:14.633 --> 01:08:15.150
Sure.

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:17.899
AUDIENCE: And I think people
who use their talents according

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:20.740
to them are a kind of
like in the flow states

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.302
because they are
using their talents.

01:08:22.302 --> 01:08:23.010
JAMIE WHEAL: Yes.

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:23.510
Exactly.

01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:24.920
So what is my typology?

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.819
What kind of a
person am I and what

01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:29.450
is my unique signature
and entry points?

01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.950
Absolutely.

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:31.324
We've actually
been doing, again,

01:08:31.324 --> 01:08:34.229
a very preliminary, but
intriguing initial flow

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.890
profile.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:36.390
And we've had several
thousand folks

01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.359
take it just in the last
three or four weeks.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:41.600
And interestingly-- the
categories we had was

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.210
hard-charger, so the classic
action sports profile we just

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:47.403
described and most of what you
just described; a deep thinker,

01:08:47.403 --> 01:08:49.069
someone a little bit
more introspective,

01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:52.010
potentially doing
coding or creative work;

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:55.020
one more socially oriented; and
then potentially one more sort

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.910
of--- the quintessential kind
of [? Loewe Haas ?] personality

01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:01.229
types, sort of the yoga,
meditation, et cetera.

01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:06.050
And 50% of the respondents
were deep thinkers.

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:07.630
They actually found
themselves more

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:11.210
introverted, quiet,
reflective avenues into flow.

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:12.637
And again, to
Steven's point, what

01:09:12.637 --> 01:09:15.220
we anticipate-- I mean I would
be stunned if it didn't show up

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:18.170
this way-- is that there is no
such thing as a monolithic flow

01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:20.450
state, as we really get into it.

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:23.439
There will be kind of a
scatter plot on a heat map.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.890
And it will depend
on the person,

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:27.399
it will depend on
the environment,

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.439
and it will depend
on the tasks at hand,

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:33.160
how exactly they get in there,
which cascade they trigger

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.569
and to what extent.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:38.160
And we will see probably
areas of clustering.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.359
But probably a much broader,
complex equation than we

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:44.349
first talk about.

01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:45.810
STEVEN KOTLER: And the
one thing I want to add

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.809
is we talk about the
action-and-adventure sports

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.800
athletes as this great
example of flow hacking.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.290
But we're in Silicon Valley.

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:54.380
The three things that
built this Valley

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:57.740
are network design, circuit
design, and software design

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:58.980
pretty much.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.640
And you can't do any
of those things well,

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.580
really, really
well, without flow.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.004
Coding and flow
goes hand in hand.

01:10:05.004 --> 01:10:06.295
The research goes all the back.

01:10:06.295 --> 01:10:08.003
The same thing with
all those categories.

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:10.582
So if you're looking for a
nonathletic example of what

01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:12.790
happens when groups of people
start getting into flow

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:14.740
on a regular basis,
Silicon Valley

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.517
is not a bad place to start.

01:10:16.517 --> 01:10:18.350
MALE SPEAKER: Big hand
for Steven and Jamie.

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.876
Thank you.

01:10:18.876 --> 01:10:20.000
STEVEN KOTLER: Thanks guys.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.150
[APPLAUSE]
