00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:08.960
SPEAKER 1: We're back.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.876
We're going to do part
two of our conversation

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:11.565
with Sebastian.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:14.540
We're going to talk about his
excellent book called "Tribe:

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.730
On Homecoming and Belonging."

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.740
So I wanted to
jump into it first.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.370
What got you interested
in this topic?

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.640
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: So I had
this interesting experience.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.170
I spent a year off and on with
an American platoon in combat

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.330
in eastern Afghanistan,
very remote outpost,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.580
a lot of combat, a lot of
hardship, a lot of danger,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.414
a lot of deprivation.

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:45.330
Those guys couldn't wait
to get back to Italy,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.310
where they were based.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.520
They had planned a big old
party and imagined things

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.330
they had planned.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.660
And they got back in after
the party sort of subsided,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.860
I caught up with them in Italy.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.540
And I was really intrigued
by the fact that most of them

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.180
did not want to come back
to the United States.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.680
They said, if we
could, we'd go back

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.600
to Restrepo, this flea-ridden,
scorpion-ridden, hell hole.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.120
No women, there
was no television,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.980
there was no cooked food,
there was no running water,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.890
there was no way to bathe.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.830
I mean, circumstances were
brutal and they all missed it.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.130
And it made me
think of something.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.180
When I was young I had
a sort of uncle figure,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450
a sort of mentor in my
life named Ellis Settle.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.330
And he was half Lakota
Sioux, half Apache.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.910
He grew up during
the Depression,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.220
born during the Depression,
grew up out West,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.990
educated himself
incredibly well.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.200
He read everything that
he could get his hands on.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.010
Brilliant, beautiful person.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.420
And I remember him telling
me, this is how he phrased it.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.040
He said, throughout the
history of the United

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.650
States along the frontier, he
said, white people were always

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.949
running off to join the Indians
but the Indians never ran off

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:01.990
to join the white people.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.370
He said, given a
choice, free people

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.419
will go towards the tribal,
towards the communal,

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:10.570
and away from the modern.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.390
And that really
stuck in my mind,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.860
and I wondered if was true.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.510
And then I heard
the soldiers saying

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.220
basically the same
thing, we don't

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.810
want to go back to America.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.540
And what Ellis told me
was that even people who

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.820
had been kidnapped by the
native tribes along the frontier

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.550
and taken back and adopted
into these societies

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.730
into these tribal communities,
when given the chance

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.750
to be repatriated
to their family,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.920
to their native country,
they would often refuse,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.960
they'd go into hiding.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.540
The last thing they wanted to
do was come back to America.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.930
And I just thought,
what's going on?

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.780
Something is wrong.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.290
And then I started
to look into it.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.102
And what I found,
to my surprise--

00:02:58.102 --> 00:02:59.560
actually, it wasn't
to my surprise,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.000
now that I think of it--

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.920
that as wealth goes up in
society, as modernity goes up,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.050
the suicide rate goes up.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.680
As things get easier, people are
more likely to kill themselves.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.090
As things get easier, people
are more likely to be depressed.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.215
As things get easier,
people are more anxious.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:25.315
As things get easier, people are
way more likely to have PTSD.

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:27.990
The PTSD rate in modern
affluent societies

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.620
is way, way higher
than in poor societies.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.504
The Kurdish Peshmerga,
the Afghan fighters,

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.670
the Iraqi fighters, they
don't even know what it is.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.710
I mean, they really
are quite puzzled

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.520
by this phenomenon that
American soldiers talk about.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.530
PTSD rates in Israel
are 1%; in our military,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.420
it's about 15% to 20%.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.810
Which is odd because
only 20% of our military

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.520
is engaged in any
combat whatsoever.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.620
Something's going on.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.920
And I developed this theory
that maybe a certain amount

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.530
of what we call PTSD, maybe a
certain amount of all of this

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.150
is due to the fact
that it's actually

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.780
quite stressful to live an
independent individual life.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.020
We're a social species,
we're social primates.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.550
We evolved over hundreds
of thousands of years

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.890
to live in tight knit groups
of 40, 50, 100, 150 people.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.390
And the proximity
of others buffers us

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.580
from psychological stress.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.480
If you traumatize a rat and
put it in a cage by itself,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.270
a week later its trauma
symptoms will be unchanged.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.780
If you traumatize a rat and put
it in a cage with other rats,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.350
within a week its behavior
is indistinguishable

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.930
from the other rats.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.140
So what seems to be
happening is that soldiers,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.170
among others, are traumatized
in a group trauma-- usually,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.010
it happens to groups of
people or often happens

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.920
in groups of people.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.630
The shooting in Vegas,
that was a group of people

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.530
being traumatized.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.821
It happened to them in a group.

00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:09.820
The problem for those people
is that that group is not

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.500
a community.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.250
That group is not the Lakota,
that group is not Second

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.950
Platoon battle company.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.760
For that matter, that
group isn't even Google.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.150
It's just a bunch of people
that got traumatized as a group

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.720
and they will now disperse and
try to recover on their own.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.000
And on their own means in their
air conditioned apartment,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.050
in an apartment building,
or a single family

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.089
home on a cul-de-sac in a suburb
where people may or may not

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.630
know their neighbors,
they definitely

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.430
don't depend on their
neighbors, they may not

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.484
like their neighbors, but
mostly their neighbors

00:05:47.484 --> 00:05:49.150
don't matter one way
or another in terms

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.246
of how they're going to survive
another day, another year.

00:05:53.246 --> 00:05:55.870
Now, for most of human history,
when you wake up in the morning

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.953
and you look around, the
people you see around you

00:05:57.953 --> 00:06:00.400
are the people that you
depend on for survival.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.820
That's no longer true.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.760
That provides a great
liberation from the group,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:15.420
but it also deprives of us
of our most powerful weapon

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.630
against psychological troubles.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.316
And what I found was that when
you collapse modern society--

00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:26.940
I mean, ironically
when you collapse it

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.720
with 9/11 or the Blitz
in London or a hurricane

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.190
or what have you--

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.750
when you collapse
modern society,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.600
we very naturally
revert to that sort

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.460
of communal group commitment,
that communal group loyalty.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.790
It happens very,
very naturally, even

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.710
in a modern American city like
Houston after the hurricane.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.820
I live in New York City.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.890
After the attacks of
9/11, the suicide rate

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.230
went down in New York--
not up, it went down.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.120
Trauma is supposed
to lead to suicide.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.140
What's going on?

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.840
It's a totally traumatized city.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.810
It was traumatized city, but
because we were traumatized,

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.820
everyone knew that
they were needed,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.730
that their people needed them.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.774
And when you give
people a task, like you

00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:12.940
know what, you can kill
yourself later but right now

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.400
we actually need
you, when you do

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.350
that, people are so grateful.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.450
It makes them feel
so good to be needed,

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.440
to be necessary that
they actually enjoy

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.910
improved psychological health.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.100
So during the Blitz in
London, the English government

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.986
was convinced that there would
be mass psychiatric casualties

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:33.360
when the German
Air Force started

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.337
bombing London flat every
night, killed 30,000 people.

00:07:37.337 --> 00:07:37.920
What happened?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.200
Admissions to psych wards
went down during the Blitz

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.840
and then back up when
the bombing stopped.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.980
And one amazed
officials said, we

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.350
have the chronic neurotics of
peacetime driving ambulances.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.930
You give people a
task, a job, and they

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.120
will forget their own troubles.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.785
And therein lies a great
comfort for them, actually.

00:08:01.785 --> 00:08:04.480
SPEAKER 1: You keep talking
about the effect of 9/11,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.800
how it had an PTSD
rates for veterans

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.752
and also the murder
rate in the area.

00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:09.710
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.440
So in New York after 9/11,
the suicide rate went down,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.200
but a lot of other
things went down.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.400
The violent crime, the murder
rate went down in New York.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.640
And Vietnam veterans
who suffered from

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.860
PTSD from Vietnam--

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.620
most people don't wind
up with long-term PTSD.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.530
I mean, from car accidents
or violent attack.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.600
I mean, it's not just
soldiers that get

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.390
traumatized by violence.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.929
I mean, there's trauma
everywhere in society.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.380
Only around 20% of people wind
up with a long-term problem.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.950
Well, these Vietnam vets were
in that 20% and decades later

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.080
were still suffering from PTSD.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.300
And they said that as
soon as 9/11 happened,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.210
they stopped experiencing
their symptoms because boom,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.940
they're back on the
battlefield, what a relief.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.100
People need me, I can
ignore my own troubles

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.940
and help the group,
help other people.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.460
And that feels incredibly good.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.850
I mean, one of the sort of
sad ironies of modern society

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.670
is that we are so
affluent and so safe

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.440
that individually, none of us
are ever needed by the society.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.090
I mean, the society
continues on fine without us.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.300
Our country and our community
never ask anything from us

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.939
because they never need us.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.230
We have a fire department,
we have a police department,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.460
we have farmers
that grow our food,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.418
we have people who drill
for oil and get killed

00:09:30.418 --> 00:09:32.543
doing that, they've got
loggers cutting trees down,

00:09:32.543 --> 00:09:34.418
we've got commercial
fishermen catching fish.

00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:35.210
Everyone's dying.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.762
I mean, people die
doing those jobs.

00:09:36.762 --> 00:09:37.720
They're dangerous jobs.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.850
They're more dangerous than most
of the units in the US military

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.740
except the really
forward front line units.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.980
We don't have to
deal with any of it.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.800
And because we've subcontracted
out all these things

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.920
that society needs, until
there's a crisis, until there's

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.560
an emergency, none of us
have to step up and actually

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.550
contribute our time, run
risks, contribute our resources

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.290
to helping other people.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.140
Until there's a hurricane
that hits a city and all

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.360
of a sudden, people are
looking for any kind of boat

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.990
they can get their hands on
to go rescue other people.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.170
The so-called Cajun
Navy that was motoring

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.330
through the streets of
Houston saving people,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
they weren't making distinctions
of Republicans and Democrats.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.370
They weren't just
saving Republicans.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.800
They weren't making
distinctions of white

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.450
and black or rich and poor.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.870
They were just saving people.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.744
And there was an enormous
an incredible unity

00:10:32.744 --> 00:10:34.880
that happened there
that maybe will linger

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.026
or maybe won't, I
don't know, but there

00:10:36.026 --> 00:10:38.192
was an incredible unity
there and an egalitarianism.

00:10:38.192 --> 00:10:42.710
I mean, the terrible sort of
class distinctions in England

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.950
collapsed during the Blitz.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.700
Everyone was sleeping
shoulder to shoulder

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.320
in the tube stations.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.020
There's no rich or poor there.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.960
Bombs don't care if you're
rich or poor, they'll kill you,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.380
they'll bury you in rubble.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.120
And so that egalitarianism
is actually intoxicating.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.840
And as a result, people
really miss those days

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.220
when everyone was equal.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.930
And I studied one earthquake
in Italy, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.490
and one of the survivors said--

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.650
I mean, you understand
it in that area,

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.190
if I'm remembering correctly,
96% of the population

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.380
was killed instantly.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.350
They were basically hit
by a nuclear weapon.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.660
The people that survived
were on their own

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.600
for days until the
government got there.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.510
And this survivor wrote about
it and said that the earthquake

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.640
had produced what the law
promises but cannot, in fact,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.670
deliver, which is the equality
of all men, all people.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.640
Then the government got
there, supplies got there,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.090
and immediately the social
stratification resumed.

00:11:54.907 --> 00:11:57.240
SPEAKER 1: I was going to
have you read that quote next.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.578
Perfect timing.

00:11:59.578 --> 00:12:03.810
Can you talk about the
beauty and tragedy of safety

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.032
and how we lose the rights
of passage because of it?

00:12:06.032 --> 00:12:06.990
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.080
So humans evolved for
hundreds of thousands of years

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.780
in a pretty dangerous
environment,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.260
living in a small scale
society and small groups

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.340
where people knew each
other pretty well.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.670
And in that natural
world, I mean,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.580
understand that humans are
very vulnerable, anatomically

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.080
vulnerable.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.750
We don't have long, sharp claws;
we don't have sharp teeth;

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.840
we can't run very fast; we
can't climb trees worth a damn.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.180
I mean, we are really
vulnerable in the natural world,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.300
except that we coordinate and
collaborate very, very well.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.470
We know how to make weapons.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.570
We can speak to each
other, we can coordinate,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.990
we can strategize,
we can act in unison,

00:12:54.990 --> 00:13:00.550
and we a loyalty
to each other that

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.430
will get us to even sacrifice
our lives to help other people.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.780
Other animals don't do this.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:14.230
We're the only species where an
individual will risk their life

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.290
or sacrifice their life
to help a same-sex peer.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.740
I don't mean their spouse,
I don't mean their kids,

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.890
I mean another
male, for example,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.350
that you're not related to and
you throw yourself on the hand

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.030
grenade and that guy survives
and that guy has kids

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.150
and you don't and in Darwinian
terms, you're a failure.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.080
But humans do that.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.640
No other animal species-- even
chimpanzees don't do that.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.657
That makes us very, very potent.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.240
I mean, it's sort
of tactically potent

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.740
when you have a
group of people that

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.990
are all willing to do that.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.080
You can really defend
yourselves well,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.774
and so that's what
human beings are.

00:13:57.774 --> 00:13:59.440
I mean, most of the
hunting and fighting

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.570
was done by young
males, sort of organized

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.500
by older, experienced males--
just like the US military,

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.270
just about like every military.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.740
But if you're going
to go into combat

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.379
and you're going to risk
your life to help that guy,

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:17.920
how do you know that he's going
to risk his life to help you?

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.470
What you need is a
very, very deep loyalty

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.870
to the idea of that
group so that even

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.810
if I know you hate my
guts or I don't like you,

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.590
that has nothing to do with my
willingness or your willingness

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.270
to protect each other.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.430
And that group affiliation that
overrides our personal feelings

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.120
is absolutely essential to the
sort of small group dynamics

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.280
that combat and
hunting depend on.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.216
So how do you figure
that out before the test,

00:14:49.216 --> 00:14:50.340
before the first firefight?

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.280
You need to know this before
the first shots ring out,

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.100
before the first arrows fly,
before the tiger charges

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.240
the group.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.600
You need to know this.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.540
The way you find out is
through initiation rites.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.750
And if you're not
willing to go through

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.900
whatever tortures and
humiliations and whatever

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.940
else I can devise to test,
to challenge your identity

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.260
as an autonomous person--

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.100
I'm going to break your
idea of individuality.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.600
I'm going to make it clear
that you belong to this group

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.399
and that you will go through
anything for this group.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.940
And if you're not
willing to do that,

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.190
I don't want you in the group.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.400
I can't trust you.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.320
Because when the
chips are down, you

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.120
might make a decisions
that's just to save yourself

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.600
at the expense of others.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.184
So in that case,
fine, go in peace

00:15:40.184 --> 00:15:41.600
but you're a danger
to this group.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.500
So initiation rites are
very, very important

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.700
for bringing young males
into this sort of group that

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.950
will be doing something
extremely dangerous where

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.350
everyone is in a lot
more danger if there's

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.530
any weak link in the chain where
you can't rely on that person.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.840
And it's not done
in a formal way,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.240
but part of sort of boot
camp and all that stuff

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.180
is a sort of process of weeding
out the people who are just not

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.950
committed to doing absolutely
anything that's asked

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.940
of them on behalf of the group.

00:16:15.655 --> 00:16:18.280
SPEAKER 1: When you were talking
about training and initiation,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.070
it reminded me of
watching a History Channel

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.460
video on BUD/S training, you
guys have probably seen it.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.130
And there's the hell
week scene, and it

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.970
shows this guy who they're
trying to get in these rafts

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.490
and put them against
the current and then

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.750
take them down and whatnot.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:39.100
And there's this one
guy who has a broken leg

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.465
and he's crawling trying
to get back with this team.

00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:43.090
He's literally crawling
on a broken leg

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.673
so he can get to
where he needs to go.

00:16:44.673 --> 00:16:46.690
He's just that
unbelievably committed

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:47.940
like the whole entire group.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.830
It was almost like a
beautiful thing to see.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.100
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:51.770
Absolutely.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.980
I mean, that's like very
ancient human behavior.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.657
And it's not like everyone
has to be like that,

00:16:56.657 --> 00:16:58.990
but that the people who are
in the fighting group that's

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.810
defending this society,
they need to be like that.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.970
They absolutely have
to be like that.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.960
I mean, my friend, Brendan,
from Second Platoon

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.594
said to me at one point,
we were on an ambush,

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:12.260
we were sort of sitting
on this hillside

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.789
and we were pretty bored
and he was towards the end

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:17.539
of the deployment.

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:20.540
He was sort of musing about
this whole weird experience he'd

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.420
just had.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.024
He said, it's really
strange, there's

00:17:23.024 --> 00:17:25.190
guys in the platoon who
straight up hate each other,

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.782
but we'd all die for each other.

00:17:26.782 --> 00:17:28.490
And then he thought
about it and he said,

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.240
so how much do you
really hate each other?

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.580
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.170
When you're talking
to the hurricanes,

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.977
I remember since the election,
every other story in the news

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.310
is about how politically
divided we are in this country.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.630
But then I remember seeing
a picture of a human chain,

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.890
and it was people holding hands,
like old young, black, white,

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.057
Trump supporters, Trump
haters or whatnot,

00:17:54.057 --> 00:17:55.640
and they're all
reaching out to an SUV

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.820
to save someone
who was in the car.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.180
I wonder are there
possible ways for us

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.000
to bring about those
feelings without having

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.320
to go through that strife,
or is strife necessary for us

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.842
to get into those situations?

00:18:10.842 --> 00:18:12.050
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Well, yeah.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.270
I mean, the problem is
the two political parties

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.290
are very much invested in
not having that happen.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:22.730
I mean, their most
reliable political strategy

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:30.510
is to trigger the loyalty
and vehemence of their base.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.510
I mean, it works, right?

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.190
I mean, when you energize
your base, you win elections.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:46.210
And energizing your base
depends on this narrative

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:50.560
of villainizing the
other guy's base.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.130
There isn't room for
two bases in this town.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.900
There's the real,
way the right way,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.180
the American way, and then
there's the other way.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.180
And both sides are saying that.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.980
So both parties, the GOP--

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.750
I mean, I happen
to be a Democrat,

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:08.230
and I'm a Democrat
because I think

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.880
the GOP is acting slightly
worse than the Democrats.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.466
And when the Democrats act
a little worse than the GOP,

00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:16.840
I'm going to become
a Republican.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.381
If that happens or
not, I don't know.

00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:21.800
But I mean, that's the sort
of basis for my politics.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.950
And right now, I
think both parties

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.140
are acting extremely badly.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:31.720
And they have decided that
their political future does not

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.030
lie in getting Americans to
focus on what unites us all,

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.790
it lies in demonizing
the other side

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.822
and saying, this is the only
honorable way to do things,

00:19:44.822 --> 00:19:46.280
the only American
way to do things.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.800
And both sides engage in
it and it's disgusting.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.690
And honestly, when people
say, he's not my president,

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.430
you are saying is
deeply undemocratic

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.780
thing when you say that.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.690
He is your president.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.565
He was elected by the people.

00:20:00.565 --> 00:20:02.940
I mean, maybe in another
country he's not your president,

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.280
but if you're an American--
you may not like him,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.800
I don't like him, but
he's my president.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.300
He was elected.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:15.360
And that the DNC is not openly
rejecting that sentiment as

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.230
undemocratic and undermining
of our national ideals

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.700
is disgusting.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.110
And that the GOP, when
Donald Trump engaged

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.470
in a seven-year-long campaign
to convince the American public

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.780
that Barack Obama
was not a US citizen,

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.810
that the commander-in-chief
who was issuing orders

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.230
to our military was
actually an imposter,

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.300
and that the GOP never
denounced that, and never

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.330
said at least to the troops,
hey, guys, hey everybody over

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.912
there, listen, your
president is not an imposter,

00:20:47.912 --> 00:20:49.370
he is actually an
American citizen.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.120
Don't worry but what
this idiot's saying.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.690
That the GOP never said that
is absolutely revolting.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.760
I mean, it puts
soldiers and veterans

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.820
in an untenable position of
following the orders of someone

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.620
that shouldn't be in office.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.510
I mean, their jobs are
hard enough as it is.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.240
And I can't believe
that the GOP never

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.370
renounced that stupid idea.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.030
And so very clearly in
my mind, the last thing

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.524
the two political parties
want is a long line

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.190
of people that are
risking their lives--

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.330
black, white, rich,
poor, tall, short,

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:24.206
everything-- risking their
lives to save one of their own.

00:21:24.206 --> 00:21:25.830
That's the last thing
the parties want.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.246
And I'm not a
conspiracy theorist,

00:21:27.246 --> 00:21:31.800
but it's the only way I can
explain the partisan rhetoric

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.700
that is coming--

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.920
I mean, I don't
think the population

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.010
is naturally partisan.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.135
I think they're naturally
like that chain of people

00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:39.300
in the floodwaters, right?

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.050
They want to be like that.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.770
And it's the only
way I can explain

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.520
the behavior of our political
parties in trying to divide us,

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.100
that they must see some
political gain in doing so.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.739
And I think they should all
be locked up and put in prison

00:21:52.739 --> 00:21:54.030
for doing that to this country.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.232
I think it's
absolutely disgusting.

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:56.940
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:04.320
I remember when McCain was
running against Obama in 2008

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.010
and some person grabbed a
mic and said Obama was not

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.489
born here or a Muslim.

00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:11.280
And McCain right away
took the person's mic

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.420
and said, no, that's
incorrect or whatnot.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.040
And it just seems that the whole
tribal identity to what group

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.130
you're on, if you go against
that their talking points,

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.290
you're immediately
looked at as a traitor.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:24.820
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: That's right.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.370
No, that was incredibly
honorable thing

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.060
that McCain did.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:32.210
And he answered that question
with more dignity and more

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.290
honesty than
Hillary Clinton did,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.750
who is of the same
political party.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.249
I mean, she was
asked the same thing

00:22:37.249 --> 00:22:39.177
and she sort of
hedged on it, like I

00:22:39.177 --> 00:22:40.760
don't know if he's
a Christian or not,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.670
he says he is, whatever it was.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.780
And she's a Democrat.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.750
I mean, so I can't believe it.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.790
I don't think people want
that for this nation.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.020
I mean, some do,
some percentage does.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.150
I mean, they're marching
with tiki torches.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.900
Those people do,
but that's about it.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.566
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.920
So after the bombings
and the Blitz or whatnot,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.910
you mentioned that the politics
climate changed for Great

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.050
Britain for 20, 30 years.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.400
Can you go into that?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.358
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:23:14.358 --> 00:23:18.830
I mean, I think what
would be derided

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.600
as the sort of
modern welfare state

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.900
in Britain started with
the collective suffering

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.960
and collective
solutions that were

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.410
typical of the Blitz and
then the sort of caretaking

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.500
that the nation had
to undergo of itself

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.660
of the most vulnerable people
in the English population

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.860
after the war.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.920
That created a sort
of state society

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.090
where there was a lot of
welfare, a lot of state aid,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.440
a lot of medical care.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.120
And that came out of--

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.360
I mean, the politicians that
espoused those views came out

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.240
of the Blitz and understood
that the society needed

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.610
to take care of itself
and devote resources

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.980
to taking care of people
who were very vulnerable.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.430
And that ended with Maggie
Thatcher and in this country

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.380
with Ronald Reagan.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.712
I mean, both of those people
had absolutely legitimate

00:24:10.712 --> 00:24:12.420
political views and
I think were probably

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.880
right about a lot
of stuff, but it

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:21.610
did mark a radical change in
how we understand our society.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.690
And for a full
generation, we saw society

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.660
as something whose
main purpose was

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.850
to take care of the society.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.472
And then after that it became
something else, something

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.055
that had advantages
and disadvantages.

00:24:35.055 --> 00:24:36.995
It definitely was a departure.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.660
SPEAKER 1: Can we talk
about the coal miner

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.342
story in Europe and the gender
roles and what was going on?

00:24:49.342 --> 00:24:50.300
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.060
So there was a
coal mine disaster

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:58.410
in Canada in the 1950s.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:02.290
And basically, they had
something called a bump.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.289
It was an explosion.

00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:07.580
There's something in the coal
dust that's very volatile

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.570
and can explode.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:15.270
And the mine shafts
collapsed, they pancaked,

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.390
and they killed
scores and scores

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.900
of people that were trapped in
these collapsed passageways.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.110
And they trapped something like
I can't remember exactly, 15,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.250
16, 17, 18 people deep,
deep underground like two

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.650
miles down.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.000
I mean, what a nightmare.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.730
You're two miles
down in the earth,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.340
everything's
collapsed above you.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.850
You have no idea
if anyone's ever

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.400
going to be able to get to you.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.050
You have no water, no
food, people are injured,

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.720
and you have 24 hours' worth
of lamp light or battery life

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.490
in your lamps.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.540
I mean, talk about a nightmare.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.140
So what happened was in
the immediate aftermath,

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.450
those guys--

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.990
it was all men down there--

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:04.940
didn't know if the
collapsed passageways were--

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.442
if they dug through
100 feet of rubble

00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:08.900
and then they're
in the clear again

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.230
and they could leave or was it
a mile of collapse passageways?

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.195
They had no idea.

00:26:13.195 --> 00:26:15.320
So on the chance that they
could dig their way out,

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.910
they started digging.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.390
And I mean, this is a very
very traumatized group of men.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.289
And the people that
came to the fore

00:26:25.289 --> 00:26:27.080
weren't necessarily
crew bosses or anything

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.050
in an official role
as leaders, but they

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.220
were very aggressive
men who grabbed

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.650
a pick ax, grabbed a shovel,
started shouting orders--

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.750
dig here, we're going to do--

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.250
they didn't care
how people felt.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.560
Some guys were scared,
some guys were hurt--

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.270
they didn't care.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.780
We've got to dig now.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.250
It didn't work.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.530
They could not
dig their way out.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.860
And they ran out of water
and they ran out of food

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.660
and then they ran out of light.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.540
And eventually, they're just
sitting there in the darkness

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.720
and maybe facing the prospect
that for the rest of eternity,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.810
they'd be buried two miles
down in the earth never

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:09.240
to be dug up even as corpses.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.610
And so of course,
now the struggle

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.190
becomes not physical,
but psychological.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.600
And what they needed was a
different type of leader.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.070
They needed a leader who
actually was not aggressive,

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.170
who was not a go-getter.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.086
They needed someone
who was empathic,

00:27:27.086 --> 00:27:29.460
who was able to sort of take
the temperature of the group

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.550
to see who was suffering so
much that they might trigger

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:39.120
a panic in the whole group, who
needed help, who didn't, who

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.300
could go without their
sip of water that day,

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.876
who needed that
extra sip to get by.

00:27:44.876 --> 00:27:46.500
So there were people
that really needed

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.530
these sort of communicative
skills, these empathic skills

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.750
who was focused on the
unity of the group,

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.150
rather than on following orders.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.690
So what psychologists who
studied these people when

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.024
they eventually got them out--

00:28:01.024 --> 00:28:02.690
and they had to make
terrible decisions.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.660
One guy was pinned, his arm
was crushed between two timbers

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.644
and he couldn't move.

00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:09.060
And they were
trying to figure out

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.420
whether to take one of the
carpentry saws or an ax

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.010
and cut him free.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.870
I mean, there were
decisions like that that

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.700
had to be made in the darkness.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.930
Imagine.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.200
So what the
psychologists found was

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.120
that the first kind of leader,
the really aggressive kind that

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.930
didn't care how
anyone felt, that

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.260
was a very classically
sort of male role.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.400
It was a very kind of
male form of leadership.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.180
But you needed more
than that in a society

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.880
that has to deal with a lot
of different, some of them

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.410
being emotional challenges.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.420
You can't just go with that guy.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.010
That's super
important in a crisis.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.750
But in sort of longer
terms, you also

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.299
need someone who's
empathic, who's

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:56.590
concerned with the unity of
the group, who wants people

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.420
to communicate better
and all that stuff--

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.420
a classic classically
female role.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:06.580
And what these psychologists
found, which is in some ways

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.000
entirely in keeping with
this whole philosophy of sort

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.510
of transgender today,
is that gender roles

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.370
don't depend on sex.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:22.850
You can have females acting in
a quote male role, as leader,

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.580
or you could have
males acting in a quote

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.340
typically female role as leader.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.150
The sex doesn't matter.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.200
What does matter is that
these two different kinds

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.650
of leadership roles
that we have called

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.324
typically male or
typically female,

00:29:38.324 --> 00:29:39.740
you can call him
whatever you want

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.950
but that is what we
have always called them,

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.160
the important thing
is that whether it's

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.870
a male or female
filling these roles,

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.370
you do need both of these roles
filled and anyone can do it.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.550
You're not bound by your
sex in terms of what role

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.410
you can play.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:01.380
And so that to me was
this amazing story

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.864
because it both confirmed
the idea that society needs

00:30:05.864 --> 00:30:07.530
different kinds of
gender roles in order

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.310
to function harmoniously
and safely and well,

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.640
and it showed that those gender
roles are not dependent on sex.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:23.360
I mean, it sort of made the case
for both things that are true.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.390
SPEAKER 1: Can you talk
about the [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:32.040
and then also how our
presidency kind of put

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.920
those two into one [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.470
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: So
the Iroquois were really

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.880
in some ways a modern state.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.610
I mean, they were a small
scale agricultural and hunting

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:53.010
society in upstate
New York, but they

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.660
created these
incredible alliances

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.760
that reached all the way
out to the Great Plains.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.900
There's a theory that
had Europeans shown up

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.230
in the east coast 100 years
later that the Iroquois might

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:09.900
have been so involved that
they could not have gained

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.610
a foothold in North America.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.580
Who knows.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.200
But their government was
really, really interesting.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.370
They had they had women in
positions of great power,

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.840
women chose leaders.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.850
And the American
Constitution was

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.720
based in part on the Iroquois--

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.240
I think it was called the
Iroquois Great Law of Peace.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.960
And it was a document,
it was an understanding

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.090
that defined the
individuals' rights

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.881
within Iroquois society, an
extremely enlightened way

00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:46.380
of thinking.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.030
And Thomas Paine and
some of the other people,

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:55.740
the intellectual creators
of American independence,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.160
used these Iroquois
ideals as part

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.280
of what they understood to
be the natural rights of man

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.030
and how they're
incorporated into society.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.200
But at any rate, one of
the interesting things

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.270
about your society is that they
had war leaders and peacetime

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.280
leaders.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.340
And as soon as there was
a war with another tribe,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.010
as soon as there was an
enemy, war leaders took over.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.780
They had absolute authority
over absolutely everything.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:28.830
And if peace were going to
be negotiated with the enemy,

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.940
if they got to the point
of negotiating peace,

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:37.320
once the peace was ratified,
the war leaders instantly

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.370
lost all authority and
the governing of the tribe

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.490
shifted over to
peacetime leaders.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:49.260
And the peacetime leaders were
partially elected by women

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.160
and could be women.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.180
War leaders were not;
war leaders were men.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.760
But as soon as the conflict
was over, so as not

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.660
to risk a wartime mentality
governing a peacetime

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.000
society, so as not to
risk that, instantly

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.070
as soon as the
peace was ratified,

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.900
it shifted over to
the peacetime leaders.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.530
And I read a wonderful book
about the rise of fascism

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:18.640
in Europe in the
'30s, and this guy--

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.020
I can't quite remember his name,
a wonderful American writer

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:24.690
of the time--

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.240
I mean, he was sort of
documenting it in real time--

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.450
Whitaker, his name was Whitaker.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:37.270
He said that what fascists did
is they convinced a peacetime

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.720
society to operate as
if they were at war,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.530
and that was the
brilliance of fascism.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.610
They would take a country that
was at peace, like Germany

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:51.710
or Italy or Spain, and
convince the population

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.050
that wartime measures
were necessary,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.580
even though there was no enemy.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.689
And that's what fascism is.

00:33:58.689 --> 00:34:01.230
They were making a mistake that
the Iroquois were not making.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.000
SPEAKER 1: And we have
the position of president,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.980
it's like this
conflict and peace

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.500
at the same time in one brain.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.679
It's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.730
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Right.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.969
And our system has its
advantages and disadvantages.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:20.120
But for what it's worth, the
Iroquois would say it's crazy.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.520
I mean, it's just
different kinds

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.440
of people that can run
a war and run a peace.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.070
I mean, you certainly
don't want someone

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:31.130
who is oriented towards
peace commanding troops

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.580
and you really don't want
someone whose orientation

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.250
is war and commanding
troops to try to figure out

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.739
a fair and civil society.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.270
That's insane.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.790
SPEAKER 1: You also
mentioned the vital tension

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.840
between liberal ideas
and conservative ideas

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.810
for the society.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:48.768
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:34:48.768 --> 00:34:50.440
So one of the ideas
in my book, "Tribe,"

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.540
and that I've sort of explored
a little bit after writing

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:58.350
that book in my
research is the idea

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.300
of the sort of false
argument between liberals

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.320
and conservatives.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.480
And the false argument
is based on the premise

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.490
that one side's right
and one side's wrong,

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.440
and each side of course
thinks it's right.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.920
The truth is if you
look at our evolution,

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.380
if you look at human
genetics, if you

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.300
look at twin studies
that have studied this--

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.600
I mean, they know
from twin studies

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:26.380
that genetics determines about
50% of your political belief.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.870
So if you're liberal or
conservative, about 50%

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:36.180
of that belief comes from
a genetic predisposition.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:40.170
And they know that because
genetically identical twins

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.170
are far more likely to have
a far higher concordance

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.540
of political opinion
than fraternal twins

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.320
that don't share identical DNA.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.080
The only explanation for that
is that genetics plays a role.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.410
If genetics plays a role
in political opinion,

00:35:55.410 --> 00:36:00.085
that means that conservatism and
liberalism in its basic forms--

00:36:00.085 --> 00:36:01.710
I don't mean Democrats
and Republicans,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.120
I mean very basic human norms
of conservatism and liberalism

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.970
and the sort of particular
concerns that each holds--

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:14.640
that those two different ways of
seeing the world were adaptive,

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.730
had survival value in
our evolutionary past

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.440
or it wouldn't be
encoded in our DNA.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.130
I mean, the stuff that's encoded
in our DNA has survival value.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:31.690
And the fact that altruism,
that generosity feels good

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.290
is adaptive.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.320
I mean, it would have meant, as
in Darwinian terms, people that

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.531
act with generosity and
altruism towards the group

00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:40.280
immediately around
them, that those people

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.990
had a higher survival
rate than groups

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.239
of people that didn't think
that way and act that way.

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:46.440
That's all that means.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.660
So it means that conservatism
in its sort of basic orientation

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.460
that unknown people--

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.650
strangers, foreigners-- are
suspect, they may hurt us.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.460
We don't necessarily
let them into our group.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.060
The idea in a strong hierarchy
and sort of law and order

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.140
within the society, people who
aren't working hard enough,

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.380
that's really their problem.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.254
We don't have to bail
them out if they're not

00:37:10.254 --> 00:37:12.420
willing to participate
in the group.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.460
That sort of basic
conservative ethos,

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.020
whether you agree
with it or not,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.200
has very ancient
evolutionary roots

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.920
and clearly served to help
our ancestors survive.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.160
Likewise, liberalism with its
deep concern for fairness,

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.650
for having an
egalitarian society where

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.170
high ranking people,
high ranking males

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.180
can't abuse lower
ranking people,

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.340
where the vulnerable
are taken care

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.320
of whether they're
contributing to society

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.290
or not, where
strangers, foreigners

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.210
are not seen as a
threat, but as a source

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:51.310
of new ideas, new kinds of
food, new ways of thinking.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.520
That basic liberal
ethos also contributed

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.910
to our survival or
those ways of thinking

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.550
would not be encoded
in our DNA and passed

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:04.850
on with twins showing a higher
concordance than everybody

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:05.660
else.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:11.120
That means that those two sort
of opposing ideas, a society

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.070
that has only one or only the
other is incredibly vulnerable,

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.760
and that we survive best when
those opposing ideas exist

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.490
in a dynamic tension
with each other.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.350
and we arrive at
some middle ground

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:28.010
that incorporates the
best ideas of both

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.350
into one coherent ethos.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.590
that's what that means.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:36.620
So in now in Washington
with this stupid idea

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:40.830
that negotiation and
compromise is bad,

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.910
they're dirty words, that
the other side is not

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:47.390
only wrong but immoral
and un-American,

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.480
those idiotic ideas that are
now current in Washington

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.090
and current right on
up to the White House,

00:38:53.090 --> 00:39:00.670
unfortunately, those ideas
are absolutely utterly

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.890
in contradiction to
our evolutionary past.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.840
They make absolutely
no evolutionary sense,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.130
no scientific sense whatsoever.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.760
And it's pretty clear
that a society that

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.190
is at war with
itself politically,

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.450
morally, economically,
culturally

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.920
a society that's
at war with itself

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.770
and thinks that the
other side shouldn't even

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.590
be part of the union--

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.750
tell me a marriage
that has survived

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:29.920
that operates like that.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.980
I cannot think of one.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.980
And that is the danger
that this country is under.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.040
We are a powerful country,
we're the most powerful country

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:38.986
in the world.

00:39:38.986 --> 00:39:40.860
We are not going to get
taken down by bullets

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.750
fired by somebody else.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:49.290
This country, if this
incredible democratic experiment

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:53.520
that we are ever fails,
ever ends, ever collapses,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.210
it will not be from
bullets from other people;

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.910
it will be something
we did to ourselves

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.160
and that we did with words.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.750
That's the danger
of partisanship.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:08.910
And it makes partisanship
actually a national security

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:09.720
issue.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.000
I mean, literally
partisanship is

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.190
more dangerous to this
country than al-Qaeda,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.441
far more dangerous.

00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:17.190
And it makes it a
national security issue.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:20.460
And I wish Congress
would see it like that

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:28.032
and form a committee
devoted to somehow ending

00:40:28.032 --> 00:40:29.490
the partisanship
that is destroying

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:34.270
this country because it
will destroy this country,

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.170
probably faster than we realize.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.670
SPEAKER 1: That was an original
fear the founders, the party

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.540
system.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.790
They didn't want people
to form blocs and stop

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.110
thinking about the good
of the nation instead

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.240
of the good of the party.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.781
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Right And the thing

00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:48.910
is the parties reflect
our evolutionary past,

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.270
but up until now the parties
more or less disagreed

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.270
with the other side while
they kind of respected

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:58.420
its right to exist.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.240
I'm a Democrat, I disagree with
a lot of Republican thought,

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.670
but I'm glad it exists,
at least so I can have

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.010
someone good to argue with.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:10.830
I mean, conservatives
are what make liberals.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:13.669
Without conservatives,
liberals don't exist;

00:41:13.669 --> 00:41:15.460
conservatives don't
exist without liberals.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.390
I mean, we need each other.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.040
We exist in opposition
to the other.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.120
But that means that we sort of
disagree with the other side

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.660
but respect that it has
its own coherent ethos

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.169
and that the other side
actually thinks that way

00:41:27.169 --> 00:41:28.960
because the other side
thinks that's what's

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.450
best for the country.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.529
The idea that the other
side thinks that way

00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:35.320
because it's trying to
destroy the country,

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.510
that idea is completely toxic.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.720
It would never be that kind
of contempt for someone

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.070
you disagree with.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.830
Disagreement's fine,
argument's fine.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:49.080
It makes for sort of
strong solutions, I think.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.440
But contempt for someone you
share a combat outpost with

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.040
doesn't last very long.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.940
I mean, down in
Restrepo, there were

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.410
guys who really
disliked each other

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.210
but no one had contempt
for anyone else.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.210
You don't want to have
contempt for someone whom

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.700
you may be counting
on to put a tourniquet

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.400
on your femoral artery bleed.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.530
And that's what we're
doing in this country.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.321
We have contempt for
people we may actually

00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:14.280
depend on for our lives.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.800
I mean, we don't know
if or when this country

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.837
will be turned into one
huge combat outpost.

00:42:18.837 --> 00:42:20.670
We have no idea when
that's going to happen.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.710
It happened in Houston
and everyone acted well.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.170
But we're really gambling
with this country

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.979
of sort of institutionalizing
this partisan rhetoric

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:31.270
where we actually have a kind
of deep loathing for half

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:32.080
the country.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.790
Are you insane?

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.580
It doesn't work.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.246
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.080
You mentioned moral
courage and then

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.020
there was another courage,
which was more of like saving

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.460
someone [INAUDIBLE] or whatnot.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.418
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:42:47.418 --> 00:42:49.610
So from studies of
sort of bystander

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.100
rescues from fires
and other catastrophes

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.780
that happen sort
of spontaneously

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.290
in the world, what they
know from the statistics

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:02.720
of these incidents is
that the vast majority--

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.620
98% or something like that--

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:10.210
of bystanders who spontaneously
expose themselves to danger

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.090
to rescue people they don't know
who are in a burning building

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:17.880
or whatever, almost 100%
of the people that do that

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.820
are male, particularly
young male.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.420
And they will risk their lives
particularly for children--

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:30.680
in this order, for children,
for young women, for old people,

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.730
and eventually for young men.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.650
Young men are the first to
rescue and the last to get

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.060
rescued, as they should be.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.170
Young men in genetic terms are
very replaceable in society,

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.690
young women are not.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:48.907
I mean, the constraint on
the health of a society

00:43:48.907 --> 00:43:50.740
is the number of young
women, not the number

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.140
of young men, which
is one of the reasons

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.270
that young men are sent into
the meat grinder of World War

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.710
I. If the troops in World
War I had been young women,

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.710
Europe wouldn't exist anymore.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:04.030
It would be over.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:07.690
Europe recovered quite
quickly from World War I

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.820
because it was almost
exclusively young males that

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.730
were getting killed.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.520
Had it been millions
of young women,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.460
we would still be seeing
the consequences of that

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.060
in the demographics over there.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.910
So those are the statistics.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:20.890
Like it or not, those
are the statistics.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:26.989
People using their free will
walking down the street,

00:44:26.989 --> 00:44:29.280
whether they risk their lives
to save somewhere or not,

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.270
it's almost 100% male.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:35.510
That doesn't mean that men
are braver than women--

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.660
it doesn't mean that at all.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.440
There are different
kinds of courage.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.520
And there's also moral
courage that does not depend

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.520
on sort of a physical reaction.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:51.200
So men are adapted to that
kind of physical feat.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.100
On average, we're 20%
larger and stronger

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.000
than women are on average.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.300
But there are moral
decisions that don't

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.340
depend on physical strength.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.300
So during World War II,
a very serious decision

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:10.640
that families had to make
was the Germans are coming,

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.590
here's this Jewish family
we don't even know.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.010
They just showed
up in our driveway.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.210
Are we going to hide
them in the basement?

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:21.710
We're Gentiles, we don't have
a problem with the Nazis.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.130
We're fine.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.120
But here's this Jewish family,
they're fleeing the Germans.

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.250
Do we hide them or not?

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.690
If we hide them,
they may survive.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.020
We don't know them, we
don't owe them anything,

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.430
they just showed up.

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.710
If we hide them,
they may survive.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:41.030
If we hide them and the
Germans discover that,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.720
everybody's dead.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:49.130
So women were significantly
more likely to make

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:53.300
that morally courageous choice
of hiding a family of people

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.730
they don't know who would
be killed by the Nazis,

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.970
more likely them men were.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:03.920
It didn't require scaling
a burning building,

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.040
jumping onto the railroad tracks
to help someone with a train.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.780
It didn't require
a physical act.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.890
Men, frankly, are more adapted
to that kind of physical act.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.780
But it required
incredible courage,

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.115
and that's moral courage.

00:46:17.115 --> 00:46:19.470
And it's equally
important and you

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:23.520
can't have a humane
and civil society

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.920
if people are not willing
to act with moral courage.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.710
And moral courage doesn't just
mean sacrificing your life.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:31.210
It may mean sacrificing
your career.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:34.080
It actually may mean standing
on principle and saying,

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.240
I cannot abide this,
I'm stepping down.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.660
I'm not running for Senate
next year or whatever.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.970
There's principles
that I have that I

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.289
value more than my career
more than my party,

00:46:45.289 --> 00:46:46.080
more than anything.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:52.650
And as Martin Luther said, here
I stand for I can do no other.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:53.610
That's moral courage.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:57.200
It doesn't have to
be life and death.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.480
SPEAKER 1: Can we talk about
reintegration of veterans

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.560
into our society?

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.230
You mentioned World
War II and much more

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:06.330
casualties than what's going
on in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.020
PTSD rates were a much higher
in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.822
than they were
after World War II.

00:47:10.822 --> 00:47:11.780
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.530
So we're social primates.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.760
We clearly were adapted
to recover from trauma

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.650
because the natural world
is incredibly traumatizing--

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:25.600
forest fires, floods,
predators, enemies.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.370
If a significant
proportion of human beings

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.610
were psychologically
incapacitated by trauma

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.350
and could not
function and it had

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.330
to be taken care of
by everybody else,

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.430
the human race wouldn't exist.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.590
One lion attack in
the camp, everyone

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:46.330
is incapacitated and curled
up in the fetal position

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.670
and everyone starves.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.050
It can't work that way.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.690
We recover from trauma,
we're survivors,

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.340
were an incredibly
resilient species.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:58.500
We can survive virtually
anything psychologically.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:02.040
It's extraordinary
what we can survive.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.370
That psychological
survival is greatly

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.310
aided by the
community of others.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.260
We have a very hard time.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.390
Traumatize a rat and put
it in a cage by itself,

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.870
the rat doesn't do very well.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.110
That's what we are.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.030
We're traumatized rats
in cages by ourselves.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.720
And the problem
with modern society

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.390
is that we go into
combat in groups,

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:27.060
we come back
individually, and we

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.520
disperse to our
single-family homes

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:35.700
our apartments, our stratified
society where rich and poor are

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.340
not in it together, the
political parties aren't in it

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.100
together, the races
are not in it together,

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.940
and everyone is living basically
in these little cubby holes.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.720
That does not help our
psychological adaptation

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.050
to trauma, it doesn't
help our healing.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.530
And so every
generation in America

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:01.310
has gotten wealthier
and more individualized.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:09.040
So my wife is the
youngest of 12 kids.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.610
Her dad was 55
when she was born.

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:21.309
He fought in World War II from
North Africa to Sicily, Italy;

00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:23.350
south coast of France;
all the way through France

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:26.320
to Austria-- the whole deal
as a lieutenant and a captain.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.180
They just kept replacing
men underneath him.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.920
He was wounded many times--

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.410
I mean, a level of
trauma that very

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:37.740
few in the current wars I think
have undergone, thank god.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.950
He came home to
his hometown and he

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:45.810
lived within a few blocks of his
six brothers, who had all also

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:47.810
served.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:53.980
The transition from the
battlefields to the home

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.510
really wasn't much
of a transition

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:57.850
because when those guys
got home, everywhere

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.990
they turned there
were other people who

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:01.440
had been on the battlefield.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.580
It was a large scale war that
involved the entire country

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.590
in one way or another.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:12.642
That's no longer true.

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:15.100
I'm not saying that as a moral
judgment, it's just reality.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.016
That's no longer true.

00:50:16.016 --> 00:50:19.240
We don't need a massive military
like we did in World War II.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:19.960
That's great.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.535
There's a real upside to that.

00:50:21.535 --> 00:50:24.410
But the downside is that
when people come home,

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:27.061
chances are they can't
sit on their front porch

00:50:27.061 --> 00:50:29.560
and look around and say, that
guy's a vet, that guy's a vet,

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.600
and that guy's a vet.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.183
If I'm feeling a
little weird one day,

00:50:32.183 --> 00:50:34.007
I can just go over
and knock on his door

00:50:34.007 --> 00:50:36.090
and we can have a beer
together and talk about it.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.220
That's not possible anymore.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.320
The kind of community
that happens on Facebook

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.900
is better than nothing,
but it's not community.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:43.930
It really isn't.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:47.040
It's a pale
substitute for sitting

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.730
on a porch drinking a beer with
somebody and really talking.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.129
SPEAKER 1: Do we have
any audience questions?

00:50:55.129 --> 00:50:56.920
AUDIENCE: So on that
note, I had a question

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.530
about technology's
role in society

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:01.270
and where you see that going.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.280
Because I know a lot of
ways you can take that,

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.540
but one conversation
that happens a lot out

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:09.470
here is about the eventual
obsolescence of human labor.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.830
And I mean, there's a
robot mowing the lawn

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:14.907
right now so it makes sense.

00:51:14.907 --> 00:51:16.990
So what are your thoughts
on just the general role

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:20.367
of technology in society and
people being able to feel

00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:20.867
needed?

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:31.070
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I mean,
in general, modern society

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.850
requires less and less of
the individual's input,

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:38.150
and there's a real
psychological harm there.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.480
So there's one study I saw
comparing depression rates

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.390
in urban and rural
North America compared

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:45.680
to urban and rural Nigeria.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.810
Nigeria is one of the
poorest, most messed up,

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:49.670
chaotic, and violent
countries in the world.

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.850
I've worked there, it's a
very tough place to work.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.130
The lowest depression rates
were rural Nigeria, which

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:56.910
is also the poorest population.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.970
When people don't have
a lot of resources,

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:06.240
they have to act collectively,
and in that collective action

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.690
they are buffered from their
psychological troubles.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:12.274
In the wealthiest
societies, there's

00:52:12.274 --> 00:52:14.190
very little collective
action because everyone

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:16.940
is wealthy enough to
take care of everything.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:21.680
Instead of a neighborhood of
10 homes having one lawnmower

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.130
that they share, everyone
has their own lawnmower.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:26.750
That's great, it's
also not great.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:29.716
So as you automate
things people,

00:52:29.716 --> 00:52:31.590
need each other less
and less and just engage

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:32.910
with each other less and less.

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:34.350
And there's a real harm there.

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:37.440
And so we know in the
last 10, 15 years suicide

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:43.380
rates, depression rates, anxiety
rates have all been going up.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.920
And I can't prove--

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.357
I'm not interested in
proof somehow proving

00:52:47.357 --> 00:52:48.940
that that's the
effect of the internet

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.760
and social media on our sort
of collective mental health,

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.360
but it is interesting
to note that it exactly

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.860
coincides with young
people shifting

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:05.680
the central energy of
their social interactions

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.390
from one-on-one in the
same room to online.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.419
The shift has happened
in the last 10 years

00:53:13.419 --> 00:53:14.960
and the anxiety
rates in young people

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.540
have skyrocketed, as have
suicide and everything else.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.120
So I think the great
lie of our generation

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.250
is the phrase social media.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.130
It's really not social media,
it's anti-social media.

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.020
It has great applications.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.690
It's great for disseminating
information, organizing people.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:33.740
I mean, the internet is amazing.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.770
God forbid we lose it.

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:38.020
All of human knowledge
in this little machine--

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:39.340
I mean, it's incredible.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.462
But I say it's anti-social media
because when you put people

00:53:42.462 --> 00:53:44.170
in a group-- when you
put them in a room,

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.780
you put them in a restaurant--

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.280
they will ignore
each other in order

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.510
to pay attention to something
that basically is just ones

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:55.700
and zeros on the screen.

00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:00.860
If you saw 10 friends, people
who actually like each other,

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.054
standing around all
reading their own book,

00:54:04.054 --> 00:54:06.470
you would think these people
need to be institutionalized,

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:08.870
there's something
seriously wrong with them.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:12.150
That is not human behavior,
that is not social behavior.

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:16.141
And I think it's really costing
young people psychologically.

00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:18.250
SPEAKER 1: I have
an online question.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.740
You mentioned how important
being part of a tribe is.

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.660
What are some
strategies and methods

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.720
folks can use to find the level
of connection you discuss?

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.400
It seems many groups
and organizations

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.010
fail to give most people the
depth of connection they're

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:30.882
seeking.

00:54:30.882 --> 00:54:31.840
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:37.390
I mean, a real tribal community
is one that lives around you;

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:41.282
that you depend on for
your food, for your safety.

00:54:41.282 --> 00:54:42.490
I mean, it's a living group--

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:44.560
I mean, in the classic
sense of the word tribe.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.620
We're not going to burn down
the suburbs, ban the car,

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.980
and start living in sort
of collective units.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:53.050
I mean, obviously
that's not what we're

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:56.480
talking about as a solution.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.670
So how can we have it all?

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.910
How can we enjoy the benefits
of this modern society?

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.560
And the benefits are enormous.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:07.180
I mean, we'd need a whole other
hour just to enumerate them.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.100
We're very, very lucky
to live in this society

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.210
in all kinds of ways.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:12.910
But how can we have
that and reclaim

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:15.640
some of the sort of communal
energy and connection

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.450
that clearly makes
people feel good

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.660
and that arises
spontaneously in a crisis

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.340
like a war or a catastrophe?

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:26.830
How can we have that communal
thing without the crisis,

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:28.140
without the war?

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.280
You have to do it proactively.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:35.270
You have to say, I want
to make that happen.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:38.070
It will happen naturally if we
get slammed with a hurricane,

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.870
but let's not wait for that.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.200
Let's make it happen.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.477
And I think there's a few
things we could do as a nation.

00:55:44.477 --> 00:55:46.560
The largest community we're
part of is the nation.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.140
I think national
mandatory national service

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.809
with a military option.

00:55:55.809 --> 00:55:57.350
I think it's immoral
to force someone

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.891
to fight a war they
don't believe in,

00:55:58.891 --> 00:56:01.740
but it's entirely
moral to require

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.620
that someone put
some time and energy

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.850
into this incredible collective
experiment called the United

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.120
States and democracy.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.490
I think it's entirely
moral to require that

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:14.110
and I think it's quite helpful.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:14.957
I think it's good.

00:56:14.957 --> 00:56:17.040
It gives people a sense
of belonging to something,

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.831
a sense of meaning.

00:56:17.831 --> 00:56:22.215
It also mixes rich and poor,
black and white, religious

00:56:22.215 --> 00:56:24.240
and non-religious.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.457
It mixes everybody up
like the military does.

00:56:26.457 --> 00:56:28.665
That's one of the great
things about the US military,

00:56:28.665 --> 00:56:31.140
it mixes everybody
up and stirs them up

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.720
and judges them
on their behavior

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.180
and not on their skin
color or how much money

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.980
they have or whatever else.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.140
That would be an amazing
thing for this country.

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.500
And I defy the two political
parties to divide us

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.520
if we have all had two years
of national service behind us

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.620
and we know people from
these other demographics

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.380
that our leaders would
want to demonize.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:57.910
I defy the GOP and the DNC
to divide us with that.

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:02.130
The other thing, I think it
would be extremely important

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:06.180
as a people to demand that
our politicians refrain

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.630
from contemptuous
rhetoric, I mean

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:13.500
rhetoric that undermines our
sense of unity as a nation.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.210
It's protected
under free speech.

00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:17.970
Free speech is sacred, you
don't want to mess with that.

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:19.830
But that doesn't
mean that that kind

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:22.680
of really toxic
partisan rhetoric

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.150
shouldn't be condemned.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:26.970
And I think if we
asked our government

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:31.890
to form a committee that would
examine toxic partisan rhetoric

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:34.710
and condemn it in a bipartisan
way, that would actually

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:37.440
communicate a lot to
the rest of this nation

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.420
that we actually are a nation.

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.280
People who have harmed
this country really,

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.950
really badly like the dozen
or so mostly white men

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:51.890
who collapsed the
economy in 2008, that you

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:57.830
can harm this country that badly
and not pay any consequence

00:57:57.830 --> 00:57:59.180
means we're not a nation.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.130
Bowe Bergdahl
betrayed this country,

00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:04.110
he might spend life in prison.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.552
I don't think he harmed the
country in a material way,

00:58:06.552 --> 00:58:07.760
but he certainly betrayed us.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.010
He might spend his
life in prison.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.650
But the dozen or so men
who collapsed our economy

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:17.060
and cost us all $14 trillion,
not one of those guys

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.179
was even indicted.

00:58:18.179 --> 00:58:20.720
What's that communicate to us
as to whether you we're unified

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.020
or not, whether
we're a tribe or not?

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.090
Of course we're not.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:24.410
You can hurt us that badly.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:26.201
I mean, you can punch
my sister in the face

00:58:26.201 --> 00:58:29.100
and I won't do
anything about it?

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.480
That's not a family.

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.080
What is that?

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.730
That's us right now as a nation.

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:34.550
Those people should
be in court--

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:35.550
I almost said in prison.

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:37.560
Those people should be in court.

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:42.940
And finally, at
the personal level,

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:47.650
you can go out and find things
that feel communal and good

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:51.850
and feel that when
you're in that place,

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:54.040
people are judged
on their own merits

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.910
and not for their
role in society,

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.320
their position in society.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.990
So one thing I've found, I
was a long distance runner

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:03.460
for a very long time.

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.580
I was a pretty good runner as
a kid, I ran some good times.

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:10.795
As I got older, I couldn't run
as much and I started boxing--

00:59:10.795 --> 00:59:13.229
a really scary, tough sport.

00:59:13.229 --> 00:59:15.020
I wouldn't say I'm
particularly good at it,

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.730
but I would say that it's
pretty much consumed me.

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:19.870
I don't know why.

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.450
The thing that I
really like about it,

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:25.300
other than just the insane
physical effort of it--

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.400
which I for some reason
need something like that--

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.010
what I really like about
it is that at the gym,

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:34.550
I go to Mendez Boxing in New
York City, it's a basement gym,

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:39.400
it's been around for 30 years,
you leave your street identity

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.070
when you walk in that
door down the staircase.

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:44.590
You could be a poor
kid from Brooklyn,

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:48.460
you could be a suit from Wall
Street coming to work out

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.680
at lunchtime and
there's no prejudice,

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.200
there's no bias in
either direction.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.590
You're not judged for either.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.960
You're judged for how you act.

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.500
And if you respect
and honor the sport

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.650
and respect the other people
in the gym and you work hard,

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:06.590
it doesn't matter if
you are a Golden Glove

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:10.040
champion or a 55-year-old guy
who just took up the sport.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.840
It doesn't matter,
you have respect.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.330
That is a tribal type community
and it's an amazing thing.

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:17.900
And it's one of the reasons
the poor kids from Brooklyn

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.120
and the suits from
Wall Street all

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.220
go there and spend a huge
amount of their energy devoted

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.720
to this thing that
will probably not

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.510
pay off in any athletic sense.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.790
But it's clearly important.

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:32.930
So you can find
things like that that

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:37.059
operate on those terms that
are incredibly healthy.

01:00:37.059 --> 01:00:38.350
SPEAKER 1: I've got a question.

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:40.360
On a recent podcast,
you shared your vision

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.640
for how civilians can better
support our troops when

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.420
they come home.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.920
Do you have any
tangible suggestions

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.480
for how Googlers
can make veterans

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.420
feel like they're welcome
and part of our Google tribe?

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:53.450
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
So on my website,

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.960
sebastianjunger.com, there's
something called Veteran Town

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.471
Hall.

01:00:57.471 --> 01:00:58.720
And the idea is really simple.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.290
It's based on ceremonies
that Native American tribes

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.570
in this country would
conduct with warriors

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:06.830
who had come back from combat.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.890
It's very, very simple.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:11.120
The idea is that
people who fight,

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.400
warriors fight for their tribe,
their community, their people.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.530
And when they come
back, that community

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:21.290
must know and
deserves to know what

01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:24.220
that was like for the
warrior and that there's

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:28.690
an incredibly cathartic value in
the warrior explaining what he

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:31.630
or she did for the community.

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:34.630
But there's also a real
value in the community taking

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:38.430
on the moral burdens and
the triumphs of the warrior

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:41.000
so they're all in it together.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.790
And so obviously, we live in
a de-ritualized, non-tribal

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:48.890
society but we might be able
to recapture some of that.

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:50.890
So the idea that I had
was that on Veterans Day,

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.710
instead of the parade which I
don't think parades have high

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:57.370
therapeutic value for
people particularly,

01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:00.040
or in addition to the parade,
the town hall gets opened up--

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.110
they're not doing business,
it's Veterans Day--

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:09.940
and veterans of any war
who served in any capacity

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:15.530
get 10 minutes to talk
about how it felt to serve.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.250
And if you say, I
support the troops,

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:22.650
that means actually going to
the town hall and listening.

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:25.740
And you might be a super
conservative patriotic kind

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:31.157
of person who really doesn't
want to hear a Vietnam vet

01:02:31.157 --> 01:02:33.740
scream at you for 10 minutes for
having to fight a war that he

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.520
didn't believe in.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.010
You may not want to do
that, but you know what?

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:39.170
He's your countryman and
you paid for that war

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:42.030
and he had to fight it and
you didn't, he fought for you.

01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:43.220
You need to listen.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.780
You might be a
super lefty anti-war

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:50.510
and you really don't want to
hear some young guy saying

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:53.050
that his experience
in the military

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:55.550
was the very best thing that
ever could have happened to him

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:56.900
and he misses it.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.480
You may not want to
hear that, but you what?

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.430
He's your fellow citizen.

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:04.250
You pay for that war whether
you agreed to it or not.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.500
It was your taxes that sent that
guy over there so hear him out.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.289
You may learn something.

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:11.330
And everyone might be
quite uncomfortable to have

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:15.020
someone stand up, and I've
seen this, and basically

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.260
be crying too hard to really
talk coherently because they're

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.360
trying to explain how their
brother got shot and killed

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.570
right next to them and
they should have died,

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:29.900
not the other guy and they
have the guilt of survival

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.500
with the rest of their life.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.460
We all need to hear that.

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.320
And so when you do that,
you are basically saying,

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.920
we're a community as a nation,
we're a community as a town.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.880
The people that have
served this country,

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.890
we honor them even if
we disagree with them,

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.020
but we're here for them
and we'll hear you.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.120
As long as you need to
talk, we're here to listen.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.840
And that's an extremely
important process

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.435
for both sides.

01:03:57.435 --> 01:03:58.310
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.050
That was an excellent response.

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:01.822
Do we have anymore
audience questions?

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.300
Awesome.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.670
Well, thank you so
much for joining.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:08.670
We really appreciate it.

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.920
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: My pleasure.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.399
SPEAKER 1: We love all the
work you do and to please

01:04:12.399 --> 01:04:14.940
continue making documentaries
and books because we definitely

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:15.924
will be buying them.

01:04:15.924 --> 01:04:17.090
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:18.730
I really enjoyed
talking to you guys.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:21.490
Thank you for sticking it
out for the full two hours.

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:22.800
That's great.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.300
Thank you.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.700
I really appreciate it.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.450
[APPLAUSE]
