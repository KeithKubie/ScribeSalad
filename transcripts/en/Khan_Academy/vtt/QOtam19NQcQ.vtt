00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.240
I've written the same
subtraction problem twice.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.750
Here we see we're
subtracting 172 from 629.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.950
And all I did here is I
expanded out the numbers.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.400
I wrote 629 as 600 plus 20
plus 9, and I rewrote 172,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.000
the one is 100.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.190
So that's there.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.430
This is 7/10.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.360
It's in the tens
place, so it's 70.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.610
And then the 2 is 2 ones,
so it just represents 2.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.031
And we'll see why this
is useful in a second.

00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:30.780
So let's just start
subtracting, and we'll

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.160
start with the ones place.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.090
So we have 9 minus 2.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.390
Well, that's clearly just 7.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.410
And over here we could
also say, well, 9 minus 2,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.090
we have the
subtraction out front.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.130
That is going to be 7.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.527
Pretty straightforward.

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:47.110
But then something
interesting happens

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.620
when we get to the tens place.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.770
We're going to try to
subtract 2 minus 7,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.660
or we're going to try
to subtract 7 from 2.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.790
And we haven't learned
yet how to do things

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.110
like negative numbers, which
we'll learn in the future,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.340
so we have a problem.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.360
How do you subtract a larger
number from a smaller number?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.900
Well, luckily we have
something in our toolkit called

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.490
regrouping, sometimes
called borrowing.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.840
And that's why this is valuable.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.180
When we're trying to
subtract a 7 from a 2,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.930
we're really trying to
subtract this 70 from this 20.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.220
Well, we can't subtract
the 70 from the 20,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.030
but we have other
value in the number.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.150
We have value in
the hundreds place.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.180
So why don't we take 100 from
the 600, so that becomes 500,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.230
and give that 100
to the tens place?

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.570
If we give that 100 to the tens
place, what is 100 plus 20?

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.370
Well, it's going to be 120.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.920
So all I did, I didn't
change the value of 629.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.890
I took 100 from
the hundreds place

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.760
and I gave it to the tens place.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.020
Notice 500 plus 120
plus 9 is still 629.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.680
We haven't changed the value.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.130
So how would we do
that right over here?

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.750
Well, if we take 100
from the hundreds place,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.870
this 600 becomes
a 5, 500, and we

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.949
give that hundred
to the tens place,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.690
it's going to be 10 hundreds.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.390
So this will now become a 12.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.920
This will now become a 12.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.010
But notice, this 12 in the
tens place represents 12 tens,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.760
or 120.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.090
So this is just another
way of representing

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.100
what we've done here.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.080
There's no magic here.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.760
This is often called borrowing,
where you say hey, I took a 1

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.020
from the 6, and I
gave it to the 2.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.970
But wait, why did
this 2 become a 12?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.900
Why was I able to add 10?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.610
Well, you've added
10 tens, or 100.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.180
You took 100 from here, so
600 became 500, and then 20

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.990
became 120.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.780
But now we're ready to subtract.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.030
12 tens minus 7 tens is 5 tens.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.030
Or you could say
120 minus 70 is 50.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.460
And then finally, you
have the hundreds place.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.880
5 minus 1 is equal to 4, but
that's really 500 minus 100

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.880
is equal to 400.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.630
500 minus 100 is equal to 400.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.600
And so you get 457, which
is the same thing as 400

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.710
plus 50 plus 7.
