00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.840
Auschwitz was the most notorious and horrible
of the concentration camps during World War

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.840
II.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.260
Over a million innocent people were murdered
at the camp located in Southern Poland (which

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.590
was “annexed” by Nazi German forces at
the beginning of the war).

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.820
Survivors, of which there were only about
200,000 of the 1.3 million that were sent

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.050
there, reported that when it came time for
them to be paraded up a long ramp and “inspected,”

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.359
there was always one SS official who would
stand off to the side.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.219
He would gesture to the soldiers, giving his
decision about which people would be placed

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.151
in work camps and which ones would be sent
to their death in the gas chambers.

00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.359
The survivors came to call this man the “Angel
of Death” due to his direct connection to

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.339
theirs and their loved ones’ fate.

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.690
This man’s real name was Josef Mengele.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.799
Josef Mengele grew up wealthy in Gunzburg,
Germany.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.070
His father, Karl Mengele, fought in World
War I, while his mother took over the family

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.059
threshing production business.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.119
When the war ended, the company, simply named
Karl Mengele, took full advantage of a peacetime

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.780
hike in production and became the third largest
company of its kind in Germany.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.799
According to Gerald Posner’s book Mengele:
The Complete Story, the factory became Gunzburg’s

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.040
largest employer and the Mengeles became the
town’s wealthiest family.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.040
According to a few unverified reports, the
factory still exists, with many jobs attached

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.040
to it, in Gunzburg today.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.619
As the oldest son, he was expected to take
over the family’s factory.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.340
This was not what Josef desired, due to his
own ambition and, according to several biographers,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.900
his distaste of his parents’ “coldness.”

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.479
Instead, in 1930 at the age of 19, he traveled
to Munich to attend the university there to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.479
study medicine.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.299
By 1930, the Nazi party had become the second
largest political party in Germany and Hitler

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149
had begun his rise to power.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.619
In his autobiography, Mengele noted that he,
as a university student, was greatly persuaded

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590
by the National Socialist Movement,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.259
“In the long run, it was impossible to stand
aside in these political stirring times, should

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.240
our Fatherland not succemb to the Marxist-Bolshevik
attack.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.520
This simple political concept became the decisive
factor in my life.”

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.740
Meanwhile, Karl Mengele himself had joined
the Nazi party due to his belief (and, as

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.420
it turned out, not wrongly) that it would
be a profitable move for him and his company.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.420
Aligning with the soon-to-rise political power
not only kept the Mengele family in business,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.420
but allowed it to prosper.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.420
Posner’s book notes that it is rather hard
to pin down exactly when Josef Mengele’s

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.420
turn to evil.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.420
Being infected with party politics at young
college age probably was a big factor.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.459
He also had a “real interest in genetics
and evolution” and since he was where he

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.450
was, he studied under professors who subscribed
to the “life unworthy of life” (German:

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.780
Lebensunwertes Leben) theory, or more simply
known as “Nazi eugenics.”

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.400
(Eugenics in general was extremely popular
throughout the world at this time, even supported

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.290
by the likes of Winston Churchill.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.500
Further, by 1936 in the United States, 31
of 48 states had some type of eugenics or

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.590
forced sterilization laws for undesirables.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.959
For more on all this, see: The Fascinating
History of Eugenics)

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.810
For the Nazis, their particular brand of eugenics
stemmed from the belief that the German and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.370
Aryan race was the master race and those who
threatened to “weaken” it must be sterilized

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.750
or simply just killed.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.349
As one can imagine, this encompassed many
groups of people – those of Jewish origin,

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.810
anyone with a physical deformity (even being
deaf), “gypsies,” homosexuals, people

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.409
of African origin, etc.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.060
In fact, one of Mengele’s teachers was Ernst
Rudin, the man behind Hitler’s compulsory

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.860
sterilization laws that were enacted in 1933.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.290
Fully ingrained in this world and his studies,
Mengele received his PhD in anthropology (while

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.390
also studying to be a doctor) with his thesis
“Racial Morphological Research on the Lower

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.490
Jaw Section of Four Racial Groups,” which
basically concluded it was possible to identify

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.200
races based solely on jaw lines.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.750
He worked his first job at a hospital and,
then, in 1937 was hired as a research assistant

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.159
at Third Reich Institute for Heredity, Biological,
and Racial Purity at the University of Frankfurt.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.420
He was taken under the wing of Otmar Freiherr
von Verschuer, who took interest in twin research

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.730
and said that Hitler was “the first statesmen
to recognize hereditary biological and race

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.730
hygiene.”

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.370
Mengele quickly became Verschuer’s protege
and he officially was made part of the Nazi

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.390
Party in 1937 and the SS (Schutzstaffel) in
1938.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.000
With war was on the horizon, Mengele went
to basic training and eventually was assigned

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.950
to a regiment as a medic.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.720
He fought for the Third Reich in the early
years of the war, even continuing his medical

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.610
work with a paper about hereditary links found
in ear fistules (folds).

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.690
He also found time to marry Irene Schonbein,
though first, as a requirement for being a

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.750
member in the SS, he had to make sure she
was of “pure blood.”

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.010
Though it could not be determined if her great
grandfather’s (an American diplomat named

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.220
Harry Lyons Dumler) mother had any Jewish
blood, she was given the okay due to friends

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.230
saying she was “very Nordic in her ways.”

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.410
In 1942, Verschuer got Mengele placed out
of harm’s way and into the Kaiser Wilhelm

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.530
Institute for Anthropology, Human Genetics
and Eugenics.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.440
There, Verschuer and Mengele continued their
work together.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.980
In 1943, with Verschuer’s blessing, he applied
for work at Auschwitz to take advantage of

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.980
the prisoners there.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.220
He was accepted and thus began Mengele’s
most notorious work.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.900
Mengele arrived at Auschwitz when it housed
nearly 140,000 prisoners.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.350
It was an enormous complex, that if it wasn’t
designed to commit unspeakable horrors, could

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.040
have been admired for its organization.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.990
It had several libraries, its very own soccer
stadium, theaters, swimming pools, and even

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.090
a brothel.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.960
Mengele quickly took advantage of his new
position when the camp was in a the middle

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.490
of a typhoid epidemic.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.110
Instead of treating it, he sent thousands
of people stricken with the disease to the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.110
gas chamber.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.740
Mengele, like his mentor, took great interest
in the medical attributes of twins, especially

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.740
children.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.730
He would routinely separate twins, sometimes
killing one to see if the other could “sense”

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.730
it.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.150
He would study the differences and similarities
between the two, often the eyes.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.270
To do this, he would gouge out the eyes, among
many other similarly appalling experiments.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.530
As the war dragged on, his “work” expanded
beyond twins to others.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.740
As mentioned, he and several guards would
stand at the top of “the ramp” while trains

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.470
unloaded, pointing and shoving people in one
direction or another, nearly solely at Mengele’s

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.470
discretion.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.870
As described in a 1992 report, seven years
in the making, prepared by the United States’

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.220
Office of Special Investigations and presented
to the Attorney General, “in a grotesque

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.020
perversion of the physician’s role, Auschwitz
so-called ‘Angel of Death’ employed his

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.430
knowledge of the workings of life in order
to destroy it.”

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.830
The report goes onto describe his apparent
complete lack of remorse for anything he did

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.050
and the continuous heinous acts that Mengele
committed.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.200
(You can read the full 197 page report here.)

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.920
The Soviet Armed Forces (the Red Army) captured
Auschwitz on January 27, 1945, but Mengele

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.930
had already fled by then.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.610
He traveled around occupied German territories,
evading Soviet and American forces while carrying

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.040
with him several boxes of medical records.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.690
He worked as a farmhand, until he went to
Genoa in 1949 and, then, a few months later,

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.360
he took sanctuary in Argentina.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.560
His wife Irene refused to go with him and
they divorced.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.070
He chose Argentina, like many of his Nazi
colleagues, because the government was firmly

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.740
pro-Axis, thanks to President Juan Dominego
Peron’s fascist admiration.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.700
To this point, German was taught in many Argentinian
schools.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.020
With open arms, Peron accepted Nazi fugitives,
not just for ideological reasons, but financial

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.020
as well.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.140
Many of these escapees brought wealth with
them often looted from former prisoners.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.470
Argentina is where Mengele lived the next
five years of his life, mostly under a false

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.180
name, working as a small pharmaceutical business
owner and farmer.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.840
After an incident where a girl he tried to
perform an abortion on died, he left for Paraguay.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.010
In May 1960, the Mossad (the Israeli Intelligence
Agency whose job was to track down Nazi war

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.570
criminals and bring them to Israel for trial)
captured Adolf Eichmann.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.610
They turned their attentions next to Mengele.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.930
During the Nuremberg Trials in 1945/1946,
Mengele’s name was mentioned several times,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.300
but Allied forces thought he was dead.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.300
The Mossad knew otherwise.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.560
Much later, it is almost universally thought
that the Mossad had found Mengele living in

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.420
São Paulo, Brazil in 1962.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.290
But, due to budgetary concerns and the ongoing
dispute with Egypt, the Mossad was called

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.140
back home and could not pursue.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.560
Josef Mengele went on to live another 17 years
in relative seclusion and deteriorating health,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.870
with recently published journal entries indicating
he never changed his political ideologies

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.480
nor showed any remorse for his actions.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.370
He had a stroke in 1976 and died in 1979.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.070
He was buried under the false name “Wolfgang
Gerhard” in Brazil.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.480
It wasn’t until 1992 that authorities exhumed
the body and DNA proved that this Wolfgang

00:08:29.480 --> 00:09:00.970
was, in fact, Josef Mangele, Auschwitz’s
Angel of Death.
