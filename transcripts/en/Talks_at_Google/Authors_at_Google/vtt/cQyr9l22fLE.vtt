[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:04.080
PAUL MASON: Well,
let me first of all

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.810
say thank you for inviting me.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.000
And I do feel honored
to be particularly

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.720
in this part of
Google's operations.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.175
I use your products
probably once a minute.

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:17.650
When me and Peter
were working together,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.690
our success metrics were
things like something

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.390
called BARB, which is a
sort of theoretical thing

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.010
that tells you how many
people have watched you on TV.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.130
My success metrics, I
know how many people

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.230
watch my YouTube videos.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.350
And that's only in
the space of 10 years.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.590
So, yeah.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.120
Thank you.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.850
And I'll just consult my
iPhone for the next bit

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.480
of what I'm about to say.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.070
So in my book,
there's a big critique

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.100
of what we call
neoliberalism, free market

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.590
economics, the current
model of capitalism.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.100
I'm going to cut to the
chase and skip that over,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.120
because I think what I
wanted to say to you is have

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.530
a conversation with
you about the more core

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.290
idea of the book, which is
the other bit of it, which

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.540
is the idea that
we may be entering

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.030
a transition beyond what
we know as capitalism.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.680
And that this transition is
primarily driven by technology.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.937
And I want to kind of sort of
explain what I mean by that

00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:15.520
and get your feedback
on it, and maybe

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.080
have a discussion with Peter
and with yourselves about it.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.290
So there's been lots of people
before me posing the question,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.980
can capitalism survive?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.840
Will it one day run out?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.180
Will it-- are
there limits to it?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.960
Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill,
Karl Marx, David Ricardo,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.074
the great economists
of the 19th century

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:39.490
all were obsessed
with the problem

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.730
that capitalism--
Malthus as well,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.060
the population specialist,
obsessed with the idea

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.800
that capitalism might
one day reach its limits.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.230
But the reason we
haven't for 150 years

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.150
tended to worry about that is
because whenever it has reached

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.140
limits, whenever specific
societal business models have

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.330
reached a limit or an impasse,
what has generally happened

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.700
is that capitalism has adapted.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.510
And therefore, when I first--
when I went to university,

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.120
the theory of complex
systems didn't exist, OK?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.150
In the late 1970s, it
was in its infancy.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.730
But now I think we have
a really niche label

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.260
to be able to talk
about capitalism

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.210
as a 250-year-old
industrial system

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.400
and it is a complex,
adaptive system.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.290
Which hopefully as
engineers, some of you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.430
have knowledge of that
concept, that systems

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.220
can be complex and adapt.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.760
Now in other words,
I'm not saying, hey,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.420
capitalism's doomed simply
because it has contradictions.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.430
I'm saying that capitalism
might be about to transition

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.520
to something else because it
has lost its ability to adapt.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.360
And why might it have
lost its ability to adapt?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.310
The answer is to do with the
specific nature of information

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.610
technology.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.520
Now before we go
into that, let's

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.350
just examine the ways in
which capitalism has adapted.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.870
OK, I'm told you're
mainly engineers,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.670
so that may mean some of you
have not a massive groaning

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.350
in social and economic history.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.560
But the sort of 101
version is this.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.050
About every 50 years, the
societal business model

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.360
hits a buffer, hits a problem.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.300
And what we tend to observe
is a fairly rapid mutation

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.280
of a system.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.390
New social institutions,
new mixture of industry,

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.720
finance, services, consumption.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.970
The classic one is in the 1840s
where the railways arrived

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.380
to take over from an initial
spurt of development that

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.570
was fueled by the rise
of the factory system

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.110
alongside canals.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.270
You get railways.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.400
And then in the
1890s, you get what

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.150
we call the second Industrial
Revolution, this fusion

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.660
of electrical engineering,
of material science,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.010
of big infrastructure.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.640
Iron is replaced by steel.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.270
The telegraph is
replaced by telephones,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.820
et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.240
And then in World War II, we
get this other adaptation,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.990
this huge synthesis of
new-- a new synthesis

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.079
between technology,
consumption, et cetera.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.080
One of the things
we observe when

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.670
we look at social historians,
at these moments of mutation

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.240
and big change in capitalism,
is that there's nearly always,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.120
when something goes wrong,
the knee-jerk reaction

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.730
is nearly always for the
elite to try and solve it

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.910
through pressure on wages,
pressure on consumption.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.980
Basically just cuts everybody's
wages and carry on as normal.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.290
And usually, up to
now what's happened

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.900
is that that hasn't worked
because workers resisted.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.190
The 1880s and '90s are
a brilliant example

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.830
of this from social history.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.580
But this time, it didn't happen
because the specific solution

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.330
that was adopted when the
old Keynesian economics

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.610
of the 1970s and '80s fell apart
was what we call neoliberalism.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.540
That is, a free market system
in which wages were more or less

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.210
strategically suppressed.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.360
So any Americans
here may know that

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.910
the median hourly male wage in
America was the same in 2008

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.200
as it was in 1973.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.380
So lower was much worse,
higher was much better.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.890
And this is a problem,
because it means--

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.782
and this is the kind
of clue number one

00:05:36.782 --> 00:05:39.060
why we might be
facing strategic,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.280
big 200-year long kind
of epochal change--

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.850
is that if you get a situation
where capitalism is in trouble

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.040
and it adapts through
suppressing wages,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.720
then what it
eventually does is it

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.640
finds another solution
to consumption,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.690
and that is credit.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.690
So since about the 1990s,
we have a situation

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.780
where wages are suppressed
for the mass of people,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.150
and yet credit is very,
very much more available

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.140
than it ever was.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.312
What happens there
is it's almost

00:06:10.312 --> 00:06:12.770
like a law of physics, some of
your physicians in the room.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.030
That laws of physics,
but it's economic,

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.150
that if you've got static
incomes and ever-expanding

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.780
credit, that at some point,
the kind of wine collections

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.740
and the art collections and the
luxury apartments at Vauxhall

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.300
Bridge cannot go on rising in
value, and they just snap back.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.940
We call that a boom-bust cycle.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.250
And we've lived through
three in 15 years.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.830
So this is a signal
that something

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.990
might be wrong with
the economics that

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.870
is not being actually
solved by the technology.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.200
It's not being solved by the
creation of new, high value,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.820
high wage, high sort
of well being synthesis

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.760
of the kind you got in the 10
to 15 years before World War I.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.540
OK.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.090
Now here's my explanation,
drawn on the work of others,

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.920
of why that might be happening.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.010
Because information technology
is different in the three

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.500
following ways.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.050
First of all, it is corroding
the price mechanism.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.020
An economist call
Paul Romer in 1990

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.150
wrote a paper that has gone
down in history for its title,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.040
because a British
politician Ed [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.690
once tried to quote
it in Parliament.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.580
It's called "Endogenous
Technological Change."

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.930
But the 101 warm
version of it is

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.255
that if you can-- if the
reproduction cost of something

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:40.790
is dictated by the actions
Command-C, Command-V,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.210
then economics tells you that
its price should fall to zero,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.520
or close to zero.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.420
Because you're using zero
energy, or almost no energy,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.097
almost no labor, and
almost no materials.

00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:53.180
We'll come to how much
material, energy, and labor

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.410
you're using in a minute.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.180
But if you can copy something
for free, then economics,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.860
mainstream, non-market,
Marxist economics

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.960
tells you that
its price is going

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.480
to be close to zero under
conditions of competition.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.750
This is what Romer says.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.280
Also about information
goods is they are

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.370
what economists call non-rival.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.540
So if you smoke one
inch of a cigarette,

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.280
I can't smoke that one inch.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.020
I can smoke the next
inch, especially

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.830
if it's one of those
cigarettes that you share.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.540
But I can't smoke
the same inch as you.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.930
It's a rival good.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.040
Not true of an MP3 track.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:34.110
Not true of the database
that builds a Boeing 787.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.130
You can copy it and use it at
the exact same time for free.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.850
Now Romer said in this
situation, the only thing that

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.540
keeps the price
mechanism-- i.e.,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.180
things cost more than zero--
is if you artificially

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.120
create scarcity.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.060
Because information
is now abundant.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.610
It's unlike all other goods.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.130
Obviously, there
are limits to it.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.010
The limits are
storage and bandwidth.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.170
But information is
essentially abundant, as far

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.860
as most people are concerned.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.630
And so what you do to
maintain any kind of price

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.990
is you create artificial
restrictions on it,

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.830
using either a widget.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.150
You remember DVDs.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.870
You couldn't copy
a DVD because there

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.810
was a widget inside the
protected software that

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.150
takes 13-year-olds about
10 seconds to break,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.820
but nevertheless, it's there.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.900
Or you get a good
lawyer, and you

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.780
arrest every person
in the car park

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.370
at the supermarket going
around with fake DVDs,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.990
and you sue the pants off
everybody who tries to copy.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.780
You'd shut down
BitTorrent, and et cetera,

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.570
et cetera, et cetera.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.380
Now you can do that.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:46.010
But essentially, the good
itself is replicable for free.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.622
The next thing
information does--

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.330
and you will be very,
very aware of this.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.490
Some of the audiences I
speak to are just, oh, wow.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.990
Is it?

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.440
But information dealings
work from wages.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.470
Information blurs
the distinction

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.750
between work and non-work,
or what we used to call life.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:08.850
And it de-links work
hours from wages.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.130
So my dad's generation,
they turn up at a factory.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.040
If you're not there
on the production line

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.022
cranking the screw here, I
can't tweak the nut here.

00:10:16.022 --> 00:10:17.980
So you and me have to
turn up at the same time,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.105
and the work is sequential.

00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:19.850
It goes past.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.890
Best to give us both
a little card, clock

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.345
into a machine that
goes clunk, and pay

00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:27.360
is when we arrive, and stop
paying us when we leave.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.200
That's work-- that's
capitalist work.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.285
Your work is different.

00:10:31.285 --> 00:10:33.910
I mean, when I tell people about
the white board and the yellow

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.430
Post-it notes who are not
in the world you're in, they

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.990
don't-- they go, wow, really?

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.200
Do people work like that?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.262
But you will know the modular
basis of most information work.

00:10:43.262 --> 00:10:44.720
You pick up the
bit of the project,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.265
you work with it for a bit,
you put the Post-it note back

00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:48.630
and you record your work.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.400
Somebody else can
take it, pick it up.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.970
Modular work allows very,
very easily distributed

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.090
and networked forms
of organization.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.030
But it really challenges,
what are we being paid for?

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.020
So my common experience
like some of you

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.860
is you get on a
plane to Brussels,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.010
you try and keep your
elbows away from the person

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.280
next to you, you try
and do a bit of work.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.590
If it was a factory,
it would be closed down

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.900
on health and safety grounds,
the kind of morning flight

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.550
to Brussels.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.740
But we are actually all working.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.040
Nobody asked us, what
time did you start work?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.040
Nobody really cares if
I flip to the latest

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.520
episode of "Game
of Thrones" when

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.090
I get sick of my spreadsheet.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.190
Because we work at a
target, not to time.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.200
And that in itself
is quite interesting,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.100
because it means at
the higher level,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.710
we're all target-based
rather than time-based.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.270
And at the lower
level, we're tending

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.210
to create jobs in a
lot of societies that

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.090
almost don't need to exist.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.890
We could be automating a
lot of work a lot faster,

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.340
but the societal
limits to it, our fear

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.850
of creating-- the Oxford Martin
Institute says 47% of all jobs

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.050
are automatable within 30
years-- our fear of doing it

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.090
means we don't do
it, and we instead

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.640
create lots of
person-to-person jobs

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.432
at very, very low value that
probably don't need to exist.

00:12:08.432 --> 00:12:10.390
The first time I walked
into a McDonald's where

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.210
you could touch screen and undo
your order on a touch screen

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.186
and then swipe your
card, I mentally cheered.

00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:20.760
Because it's no fun
being one of those people

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.890
behind the counter.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.690
It's no fun standing
in the queues going,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.670
am I being served
or not being served?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.860
Is she serving me or not?

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.820
The whole thing is automatable.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.730
Who knew?

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.915
When I first got a
car, we used to put it

00:12:33.915 --> 00:12:36.690
in something called a car wash.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.750
It was a machine.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.685
You know, you put your coin
in and the thing came over you

00:12:40.685 --> 00:12:41.960
and washed your car.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.980
Who knew that eight
guys with rags

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.050
could undercut that machine?

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.130
They undercut it because
labor is so cheap.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.482
In other words, we're
not forced to innovate.

00:12:52.482 --> 00:12:53.850
So that's the second thing.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:54.950
Work and wages.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.400
And the third thing that
flows on from the modularity

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.790
is that organizations and
hierarchies and ownerships

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.230
are beginning to
fragment as well.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.220
So you know that many
people in your space,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.960
also in the open source
space, will literally

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.390
be working in no managed--
no managed hierarchies.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.500
They'll be working in
very flat hierarchies.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.540
They'll be working
sometimes non-managed.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.210
And in some
organizations, the product

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.480
is produced in a
non-managed way.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.210
Wikipedia is a great
example, because nobody

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.320
tells some professor
sitting in Seattle

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.350
or wherever to do a
page about Napoleon.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.570
They just do it.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.010
The organization facilitates
the voluntary creation

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.610
of a product.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.050
But you can see,
those of you who

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.470
use open source tools
will know that, in fact,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.770
that way of working,
it's not like somebody

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.650
sitting in the middle
of a committee.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.200
There is a committee
on TCP/IP isn't there?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.910
There's a committee
that looks after it.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.810
But that committee doesn't
tell people how to improve it.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.940
It just improves itself
through interaction

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.520
of people who use it and
make improvements to it.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.280
Ruby on Rails, et cetera.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.780
So these three things, the
price mechanism dissolving,

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.080
the link between work
and wages dissolving,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.300
and then organizations and
hierarchies-- organizations

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.200
and hierarchies being
decentralized, falling apart,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.930
and the ownership of
things not being clear.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.320
So who owns Wikipedia?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.060
Well, you know, technically
probably Jimmy Wales probably

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:23.880
owns it.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.970
But it is an open source
product with which

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.700
every other
corporation on Earth,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.090
if you trace their IP addresses,
transacts every day, probably

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.350
every minute.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:37.090
This is very new in the
history of capitalism.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.920
So the price fall thing is
the most important thing.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.430
Why?

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.890
Because it doesn't
just impact on-- it

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.800
doesn't just impact
on information goods,

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.530
on virtual things.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.010
I kind of rebel against the word
cyber, immaterial, and virtual.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.810
Because as the Oxford
professor of philosophy,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.452
Luciano Floridi tells us,
information is physical.

00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:03.160
Those of use who have
studied cybernetics

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.580
know about Norbert Wiener, the
founder of cybernetics in 1948

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.795
writes, "information is
neither mass nor energy."

00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:14.290
It is something
new, and materialism

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.860
has to adjust for that.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.820
I disagree with that,
and Floridi does as well.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.320
I say information
has its own dynamic

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.820
separate to mass and energy.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.660
Of course, funnily enough,
the laws of that dynamic

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:33.810
are weirdly mappable onto
the laws of thermodynamics.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.580
But leave that aside.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.550
But it needs mass and
energy for representation.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.960
And therefore, it exists
in the physical world.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.060
And that's what explains
any physical good that

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.770
is heavily dependent on
an information content

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:50.630
is also very susceptible to
this exponential price fall that

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.770
is inherent in the idea of
information costs nothing

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.870
to reproduce.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.360
So you will know that
if I add PowerPoint,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.620
the price of bandwidth,
processing power, and storage

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.190
is all over a 15-year
period exponentially

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.190
off a cliff like that.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.907
Deloitte, the
consultancy, believes--

00:16:07.907 --> 00:16:09.740
I don't know whether
this is true-- believes

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.970
that that exponentially
will just carry on.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.937
They call them
exponential technologies.

00:16:13.937 --> 00:16:15.770
And it means that we've
never lived through.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.290
My dad's generation, my
granddad's generation,

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.930
industrial workers in factories
never lived through a period

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.100
when a technology fell off
a cliff in price terms.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.530
And how do we know
that it's important?

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.870
Because it's also affecting
things like DNA sequencing.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.620
The exponential curve of
DNA sequencing price fall

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.610
is faster than Moore's law.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.660
It's actually,
bang, off a cliff.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.840
If you thought your kids
would make a big living,

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.989
a high value living sequencing
DNA, no, they won't.

00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:46.780
What do we call it?

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.750
Synthesizing DNA, yes,
because that's a lot harder.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.170
But eventually, information
will-- technology

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.010
will develop to a point where
we can do that exponentially

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.330
faster and cheaper as well.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.190
So what happens, what's
capitalism doing?

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.630
How is it changing to defend
itself against these problems?

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.310
Well, you're sitting in one
of the defense mechanisms.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.099
The evolution of the
large technology company,

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.500
which exists one way
or another-- I'll

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.530
put it simply like this--
to create a barrier

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.000
around some information products
whereby that price does not

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.250
fall to zero.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.670
Now your one is quite
an interesting one.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.760
We can talk about the
interesting way it has adapted.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.460
I'm a fan of it.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.010
But let me give
you a good example.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.440
99p a track on iTunes.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.780
What determines that price?

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.430
Supply?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.670
No.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.630
The supply is infinite.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.210
Demand?

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:37.710
No.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.050
The demand might be
infinite, actually.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.470
We don't care what
the demand is.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.050
Quality?

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:42.590
No.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.820
The same track by some
bog standard group

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.920
is the same as a classic--
rock classic, 99p.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.720
It's determined by
the fact that Apple

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.450
has a 95% share at
the time I start

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:57.100
writing this book of
online digital music, that

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.360
which is paid for.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.860
They can dictate the price.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.650
That's the defense mechanism.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.440
Of course, then you
create technologies

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.130
that you have to use.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.910
It's easier to use
certain technologies that

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.410
help you maintain that price.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.800
Now economics says
that the moment that

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.240
is-- the moment that
monopoly is subjected

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.950
to effective competition,
price should fall.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.000
And there's a website
called Information

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.260
is Beautiful who have logged
the impact of competition.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.790
Because right now, to make
the minimum wage in the USA,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.610
a solo artist signed
to a record label

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.900
will have to get 1,500 plays
on iTunes of a single track

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.780
to make the minimum wage.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.890
On Spotify, it's 1.1 million.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.710
So the price-- the
impact of competition

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.670
has collapsed-- tell me what
power of 10 that is-- it's

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.560
collapsed the price.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.610
Right.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.240
Now to cut to the
chase, there's that.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.080
There's the tech monopolies.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.310
There is the fact that
we've actually begun to,

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:05.780
as well, as human beings, I
would argue, live and create

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.650
value and create our own social
image much more outside work

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.136
than my dad's generation did.

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:13.760
You all know that
workers for 200 years

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.860
thought of themselves as kind
of communities and factories.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.090
Now through network
technology, we

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.330
create several personalities,
and we live in networks.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.140
We live far more in networks.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.460
We are leaky in the terms
of our personalities,

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.820
ourselves in a way that
previous generations didn't do.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.500
And at the edges,
we are beginning

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.060
to see new forms of
economic production.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.030
So all the open source stuff
is a new form of economic life.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.700
It doesn't map onto the state,
the market, the public library.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.450
It's different.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.220
And I argue that
we might therefore

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.760
be in the beginning
of a long transition

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.990
whereby the state which we know,
which provides maybe 30% to 40%

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.740
of GDP through providing
essential services,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.000
the private sector, which has
provided the rest, and then

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.890
this new non-market,
difficult to price,

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.920
free stuff and voluntary
incorporation sector

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.490
is growing up alongside it.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.580
What's the problem?

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.140
What's the problem for me, if
you use Ruby on Rails or PHP

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.900
or whatever, it's not
a problem for you.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.270
Problem for me as an economist
is, how do I value it?

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.570
There's a brilliant
tool called CATIA,

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.650
which is used to virtually
manufacture aircraft.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.860
If you look at the small
print in Dessau-- Dessau

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.910
systems owns this software.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.490
It's about 25,000
a head, a desk.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.197
It's a really top-end software.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.530
And then the small print of
their annual report it says,

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.167
what's the main risk
to this company?

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:44.750
It says, the main
risk to this company

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:49.230
is that somebody works
out how to copy and paste

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.500
the program CATIA 3.0.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.080
Because if they can do that,
then the value of this company

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.040
falls from there to there.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.640
So economics just
doesn't know how

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.200
to value or understand this
third post-capitalist sector.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.900
And the challenge for us is to
work out what to do about it,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.690
and whether or not
it's a good thing.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.060
I did a debate about this
book a couple of weeks

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.130
ago with one of Jeremy
Corbyn's advisers.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.095
And a developer from
the open source world

00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:20.280
stood up-- it was in
St. Paul's Cathedral--

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.630
and said, well, what should--
what should happen to me then?

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.970
Should I be paid wages for
developing an open source

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:29.670
product?

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.810
And I said, no, because
that's postcapitalism.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.354
The point is, I write
my Wikipedia page.

00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:36.270
I'm going to make a
documentary and put it out

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.230
for free, crowdfunded on
Indiegogo because I believe

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.600
in this.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.070
I go to an organic farm
because I believe in it.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.630
And I want part of my
life to be non-capitalist.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.760
And this Corbyn
adviser said, no, no.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.120
You should be paid wages.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.480
And in other words, they
wanted to drag him back

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.430
into the wage sector
because they just

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.960
couldn't understand what
this new sector could become.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.338
I would like to expand that
new sector for this reason.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:12.900
I once interviewed Larry Page
and Sergey Brin before the IPO.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.840
And I said to them, what
is your remaining ambition?

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.510
And like they said, I'd like
to design a machine that

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.434
knows everything.

00:22:21.434 --> 00:22:22.850
At which point
there was this kind

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.684
of massive jaw drop
among kind of all people

00:22:24.684 --> 00:22:26.683
who were sitting around,
because they all wanted

00:22:26.683 --> 00:22:28.490
to talk about computer stuff.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.190
I want to design a machine
that knows everything.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.660
Well, there's an
economist called

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.606
Ken Arrow who was once the
guru of economics in the 1960s.

00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:39.230
He was one of the
first people to think

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.840
about intellectual property.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.620
We used to think
intellectual property was

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.300
like a public library.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.840
We used to think information
was like a public library.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.070
It was a public good
like a water system.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.340
You turn on and off,
[INAUDIBLE] it's just there.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.270
In the '60s we realized
it wasn't that,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.530
and we needed to economically
classify it and understand it.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.210
And Ken Arrow came up with one
of the neatest descriptions

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:07.730
of what information property,
information-- owned information

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:08.230
does.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.460
He says this.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.640
In a free market and
with private ownership,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.340
if entrepreneurs
produced patents

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.230
and intellectual property, then
the aim is for it to be scarce.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.960
Therefore, in a free market
with private property,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.690
an intellectual
information economy

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.960
will lead to the under-- the
systematic underutilization

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.530
of information.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.720
Now I would like
to see a society

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.860
where there is the
systematic full utilization

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.750
of information.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.960
And therefore, what I
argue is that you probably

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.980
can't have private property in
a free market in information.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.230
And it's the property bit
that I would like to attack.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.940
The market bit is good.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.650
It sorts out the information.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.000
It's the property bit.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.620
In other words, some
of it should be free.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.840
It wants to be free.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.800
It should be free.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.580
And so what I would
say to Larry Page now--

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.330
I wish I'd thought
of it then-- but what

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.120
I would say to him if I ever
met him again is you can't have

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.050
that machine that
knows everything,

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.380
that even this thing
that you guys work on,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.710
which is a machine that is
trying to know a heck of a lot,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.050
it can't know everything
for this reason.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.580
You can ask it any
question you want,

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.140
but I can't ask it all
the questions I want,

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.340
and therefore you don't
know what my questions are.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.200
I can only ask it
the dumb questions

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.990
that I ask via the interface,
whereas if it was open source,

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.010
we could all ask
it every question.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:42.370
And then your machine would
know everything far quicker

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.930
than it's going to
at the current rate.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.590
I don't know what that means
for the commercial model,

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:53.110
but it means that if we all
open sourced more stuff, then

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.990
the leading edge of that which
is not ownable, not-- rather,

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.900
that is ownable, that has
ultra value, that is innovative

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.600
would be far more identifiable.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.920
And we'd all have a far
more equitable relationship

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.910
with that which
should be shared,

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:13.960
which I think is far more than
is currently being shared.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.730
That's it.

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:16.590
Great.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.572
Thank you very much.

00:25:17.572 --> 00:25:21.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.420
MALE SPEAKER: Just a few
things to pick up on there.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.350
Eric Schmidt, he famously
said, Google is a [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.460
decapitalistic company.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.040
So what does
postcapitalism selflishly

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.690
mean for Google, and
what do you think

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.776
it should mean for Google?

00:25:36.776 --> 00:25:37.960
PAUL MASON: OK, look.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.790
I think there was a phase
in Google's history,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.490
and we recovered it.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:46.630
I watched it go from
a good idea to one

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.890
of the most important
corporations in the world

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.196
where you had to say, look.

00:25:51.196 --> 00:25:53.280
We have to decide that
which is capitalist

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.940
and that which is
not capitalist.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.660
You could rationalize
the 80:20 principle,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.370
and completely capitalistically,
you probably do know.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.930
But there are
non-capitalist ways

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.750
of even rationalizing that.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:11.390
However, for future-proofing
a giant tech monopoly,

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.800
I think what you
have to understand

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.950
is that this process of the
price mechanism dissolving

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.320
is probably happening.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.736
It's like Wile E. Coyote.

00:26:21.736 --> 00:26:23.110
It's happening
beneath your feet,

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.210
even if you're running
along horizontally.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.450
The price of stuff,
of information stuff,

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.810
is going to fall more rapidly
than I think people understand.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.770
So future-- easy to
say, future-proof iTunes

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.400
by becoming Spotify, because
you're just not going

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.810
carry on being able to charge
99p, bom, bom, bom, bom.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.610
Future-proof HBO by
becoming Netflix.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:48.900
It's kind of, move to
a quasi-sharing thing,

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.550
even if you're still charging.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.400
But I don't think even
that's going to last.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.858
Clay Christensen,
who's the guy who

00:26:53.858 --> 00:26:56.390
invented the idea of
disruptive technology,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.490
always points out that
BlackBerry just could not last.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.990
Despite having a cast iron
infotech and defensible IP

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.230
monopoly, it just disappeared.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.080
So you've always got to
be asking yourself, not,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.360
how do we stop ourselves--
how do we keep BlackBerry

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.481
being the only smartphone?

00:27:14.481 --> 00:27:14.980
You can't.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.890
It's not going to be.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.320
So you just have
to ask yourself,

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.430
what does the corporation
do as one monopoly

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.640
after another kind of
falls away from us?

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.500
And I think you are.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.610
That's, I mean, that's what's
behind-- clearly, to me,

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.130
behind--

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.250
MALE SPEAKER: Popular
rather than monopoly.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:29.219
But--

00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:31.010
PAUL MASON: I know you
don't like monopoly.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.730
MALE SPEAKER: So get ready
for questions in the room.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.063
There's just one question I
want to ask you before that,

00:27:35.063 --> 00:27:36.220
which is about Karl Marx.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.650
And there's a
fascinating passage

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.860
where you pick up on a
sort of lost document

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.435
that Karl Marx
wrote in 1850 where

00:27:42.435 --> 00:27:43.875
he kind of predicted this.

00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:46.440
And there's a quote, which
I've picked out, which is,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.800
"capital collapses because it
cannot exist alongside shared

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.300
knowledge."

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.680
PAUL MASON: Yeah.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.760
So it's an amazing
document, "The Fragment--"

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.630
it's called "The
Fragment on Machines."

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.210
And it wasn't discovered by me.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.880
It was actually
really popularized

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.760
by a guy called Antonio
Negri who is now well known

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.920
for his work on the "Multitude"
and kind of far left

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.910
of Italian-- he was
even more far left then.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.800
But Negri and the Italian
autonomous Marxists

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.840
discovered this text.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.940
And what they
recognized is there's

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.835
a completely other
collapsed story in there

00:28:18.835 --> 00:28:22.320
than there is in the normal
Marxism of "Das Kapital," which

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.820
is all about the clash between
private ownership and equitable

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.730
distribution, effectively.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.400
So in "The Fragment" he
basically says, look.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.370
What we're getting is
a kind of technology

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:43.470
where all its effectiveness and
productivity derives from what

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.630
he called social knowledge.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.610
That is, he'd
observe telegraphers.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.810
Telegraphers don't just work
with a kind of a switch.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.240
The machine is all
the telegraphers.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.340
In other words, it's
an early network.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.600
You could probably look
at early railway networks

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.400
and identify some early
features of network

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.380
rather than simply
hierarchy in them.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.640
But Marx is saying, what
this is going to lead to is

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.920
when all the innovative
power of society

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.860
is concentrated at
the level of ideas,

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.660
then the private
property side of things

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.790
is going to fall apart.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.230
And in an amazing leap-- he
calls it the general intellect.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.910
When there is a
general intellect,

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.710
you can't have private property.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.700
But in an amazing leap, he then
does this thought experiment.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.560
He says, right.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.430
What would the ideal
machine be for capitalism?

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.270
And he says, it would be a
machine that costs nothing

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.340
to make and lasts forever.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.690
Because he says then,
then everything it does

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.020
is beneficial.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.945
And everything it does draws
down to social knowledge.

00:29:42.945 --> 00:29:44.590
And it costs nothing to do.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.710
I mean, in other words, I think
software is a machine that

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.300
costs nothing to reproduce
and would last forever

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.270
if you wanted it to.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.120
It only becomes
obsolete-- it could

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.590
last-- I'm sure that there's
a version of Windows 3

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.650
sitting on a crappy old
laptop in my loft somewhere.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.120
If I fired it up-- I've got
a Mac that I can fire up

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.565
and it's still got-- from 1984.

00:30:04.565 --> 00:30:06.120
It still works.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.790
So it's kind of--
it's the idea--

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.370
and the problem is because he
wrote it at 4:00 AM in 1858,

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.300
and then he never published it.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.360
And therefore, everybody
forget about it.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.830
But it's a fascinating
sort of insight

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.677
into some of the
problems we are facing.

00:30:21.677 --> 00:30:22.510
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.135
Your questions.

00:30:23.135 --> 00:30:27.410
And please wait for the
microphone to come to you.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:27.977
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:27.977 --> 00:30:29.435
I got the impression
that you think

00:30:29.435 --> 00:30:33.122
that interpersonal
bandwidth has increased

00:30:33.122 --> 00:30:38.040
because of distributed networks
and distributed communication.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.360
But isn't it much more true
that it's massively decreased?

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.310
Because now we are communicating
through distributed networks

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.960
based on text and video
very asynchronously

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.760
rather than face
to face as we're

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.880
doing now with our
massive bandwidth of all

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.320
of the [INAUDIBLE] ability
to read each other.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:02.680
And so effective
social media is not

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.540
to increase important
information distribution.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.950
It's to decrease the ability
of the workers to organize.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.240
PAUL MASON: Well, I think
there's loads of concepts

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.730
there, and my brain's struggling
to unpack some of them.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:22.040
But let me-- I think it was
the novelist Thomas Pynchon who

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.320
in 1967 in the novel
"Gravity's Rainbow"

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.260
actually said bandwidth
increases in inverse proportion

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.890
to density.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.860
About people.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.670
In other words-- let me tell
you what that means to me.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.020
As a result of the
information revolution,

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.670
I feel a denser person
and a more-- I mean,

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:47.660
denser and a richer person,
and a more connected person.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.620
And I feel that I'm able to
bring-- to upload knowledge,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.610
use it, and download
knowledge in a way

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.900
that I couldn't before
the information age.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.770
Literally, my brain is a
product of this transition.

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.690
And things that I
would have had to spend

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:07.280
years analogally learning to
remember, I now don't have to.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.810
So I think that makes
me a more richer person.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.990
But I do buy the idea that
we now have weak ties.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.100
We have what the
sociologist Richard

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.340
Sennett has called weak ties.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.700
But the weak-- in a
network, the weak ties

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.555
can provide collective strength.

00:32:24.199 --> 00:32:24.740
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.340
I would say that personally,
I am a much less dense person

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.000
in that sense because each day
I get on a train for an hour

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.420
and I stand in a metal tube
with 100 strangers, none

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.852
of whom I talk to, and
everyone is on their phone,

00:32:35.852 --> 00:32:37.560
getting a much lower
bandwidth connection

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.060
to the people around them.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.484
May I ask another question.

00:32:41.484 --> 00:32:44.830
PAUL MASON: Fine by me.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.360
AUDIENCE: Do you think
there is no analogy at all

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.645
between open source software
and pre-enclosure [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:53.645 --> 00:32:54.620
PAUL MASON: Yep.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.740
I do think there is.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.940
So I don't use the word
commons, because I think--

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.390
because the commons is an
overused thing in the world

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.135
that I'm talking about, in
the sense that I want to try

00:33:05.135 --> 00:33:10.705
and-- the commons were
part of feudalism.

00:33:10.705 --> 00:33:12.540
This is what people
don't understand.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.610
That a common was a forest.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.550
And the point-- the free stuff
you got from it was firewood.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.110
Which if you think about
being a peasant, that's

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.850
quite important.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.740
Otherwise you don't eat, right?

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.247
It then said, you can't
chop the king's trees down,

00:33:25.247 --> 00:33:27.580
which everywhere else except
the commons, that was true.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.480
You starve.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.100
So the commons is a
key part of feudalism.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.070
Then Shakespeare,
where do people

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.790
go when they want to
dream and be free?

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.790
They always go to a forest.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:41.180
In other words, it has that
mythic and almost functional

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.930
role in feudalism.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.090
The commons in
capitalism can't exist.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:48.640
It's inimical to them.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.260
In postcapitalism, you have to
promote that which is common.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.290
But what I'm wary
of is the obsession

00:33:55.290 --> 00:34:00.880
with specific forms of
peer-to-peer, quite low level

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.770
stuff.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.970
I think that we'll have
different ranges of stuff,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.570
things we produce,
some of which will

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.460
be common like
common, some of which

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.310
will be kind of a
negotiated sharing.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.277
Creative Commons license isn't
really a common in that sense.

00:34:15.277 --> 00:34:16.860
I've published
Creative Commons stuff,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.800
and I'm rigorously sticking
those little extra bits on it

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.719
so that my rivals can't copy it.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.860
And I mean, Creative Commons is
a negotiated common rather than

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.480
a flat freedom.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.209
But we could talk a
lot more about this.

00:34:31.209 --> 00:34:31.750
Do you want--

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.333
AUDIENCE: I have a
question over here.

00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:34.095
PAUL MASON: Yeah.

00:34:34.095 --> 00:34:35.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:35.850
Right.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:39.150
So you may feel this is a
fad, but you come across

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.440
as quite Marxist, really.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.010
And the best thing about
Marx is always the analysis

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.510
in the peak of capitalism.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.139
But he also talks about power
structures and the dynamics

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:52.260
and the society trying
to better [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.340
So my question to
you is, do you think

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.907
that the pressures on
price you describe,

00:34:57.907 --> 00:35:00.240
which were analogous to some
things which were happening

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.910
in the 19th century
with mass production,

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.970
are going to result in the
world evolving nationally

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:06.820
to postcapitalism?

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.403
In other words, do
you basically think

00:35:08.403 --> 00:35:11.280
that market mechanism works,
and Spotify will conquer Apple,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.377
and then whatever comes
next will conquer Spotify?

00:35:14.377 --> 00:35:16.710
Or do you think there's an
issue about how we get there?

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.709
And if there is an issue
about how we get there,

00:35:18.709 --> 00:35:19.812
how do you resolve that?

00:35:19.812 --> 00:35:22.270
PAUL MASON: I'd certainly think
there is an issue about how

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.040
we get there.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.840
I certainly think
that-- that there

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.030
are-- that there are both
political and economic

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.560
mechanisms.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.089
Because your own company--
and it's not alone

00:35:30.089 --> 00:35:31.630
in the tech sphere--
will spend a lot

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.350
of money going to Brussels
and to Washington, DC

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:39.140
to lobby for less regulation
on a specific sector, OK?

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.620
Now I would like
to regulate some

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.640
of the tech monopolies not
so much out of existence,

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.070
but to be non-monopolies.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.030
So you know, I would be
quite happy to have a big six

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.900
insurge or a big
six in friendship

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.210
provision of social media,
or big six messaging apps.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.926
I mean, there's only--
there's two or three.

00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:02.950
I think that regulation doing
its job in the kind of Theodore

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:06.100
Rooseveltian sense,
pre-1914, should be promoting

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.380
a lot more competition.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.350
And don't buy the idea that we
need a big one in each sector

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.890
to achieve scale and
to achieve efficiency.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:14.640
So I would do that.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.050
And I would also then look at
the-- the problem we have is

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.490
that's a second order problem.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.400
The first order problem
we have is we've

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.290
got an elite in the world that's
addicted to low wage, low value

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.120
creation.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.840
You don't work in a low
wage, low value world.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.710
But I'll tell you that
basically, a lot of-- there's

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:36.010
a huge incentive to create
low value businesses

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:36.860
and not innovate.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.900
You can innovate in the world
of coffee shop logo design.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.400
Yeah?

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.470
That's the maximum innovation.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.470
Or how to get the
nicest high vis

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.130
jackets for your semi-slave
construction workers.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.842
That's where innovation
is taking place.

00:36:50.842 --> 00:36:52.300
And I want innovation
to take place

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.560
that wipes those jobs
out and replaces them

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.680
with a more equitable
distribution of work and money,

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.341
not through the wages system.

00:37:00.341 --> 00:37:00.840
But, yeah.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.849
There's a massive
obstacle to it.

00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:05.390
And what I've tried
to do in the book

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.310
is to provide the
economic framework

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.170
for having the
argument, and leave it

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.794
to everybody from social
democrats in Norway or Sweden

00:37:14.794 --> 00:37:17.210
right through to anarchists
who are kind of blockading COP

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.780
21 right now to have the debate
about what you do about it.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.500
Because I think
that the it that you

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.480
want to do something
about, the transition,

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.020
is not well understood.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.400
So I've stepped back from that
debate to try and actually

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.360
have the debate across
parties, you know,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.622
and across kind
of social milieu.

00:37:34.622 --> 00:37:37.274
MALE SPEAKER: Next question.

00:37:37.274 --> 00:37:38.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.515
One of the things that
I wanted to throw out

00:37:39.515 --> 00:37:40.233
was that the crisis
that's happening

00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:42.140
is a crisis of profitability.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.615
It's not so much of [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:43.615 --> 00:37:45.360
And the way we solved
the last crisis,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.960
which is the one
that predicated this,

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.710
and it follows that
the one way that we'll

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.000
solve this [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.680
And the one that we
create at the moment

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.350
is that there's
one of no interest.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.650
There's absolutely no savings.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.654
And a lack of-- and
the public sector

00:37:57.654 --> 00:37:59.070
is being absolutely
removed, which

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:03.130
will create more space for
private sector [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.910
We create by
destroying, and that's

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:08.330
the way it's happened since the
end of the second world war.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.640
And I think that that's
where the focus is.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.200
I'm not sure
[INAUDIBLE] technologies

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.980
where the cutting edge of
where the next crisis will be

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.330
or what [INAUDIBLE] will be.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.280
If there was a place where
we could go in order to work,

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.430
it would be bombed.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.370
So wherever there
is the prospect

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.198
of a bubble inside capitalism
that is non-capitalist,

00:38:27.198 --> 00:38:28.194
it will be closed.

00:38:28.194 --> 00:38:29.190
It will be popped.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.095
Because you said,
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:32.095 --> 00:38:35.560
It existing is a contradiction
we cannot contest and cannot

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.060
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.130
PAUL MASON: Well, I think--
I see what you mean.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.600
And I think that's
quite pessimistic.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.690
Or let's talk about one
of the things you talked,

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:45.315
the stagnation.

00:38:45.315 --> 00:38:47.207
The stagnation problem
is a real problem.

00:38:47.207 --> 00:38:49.790
You're in starting your careers,
your early stage career, most

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.065
of the people in this room.

00:38:52.065 --> 00:38:54.400
You're where zero
interest rates are normal.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.330
This is bizarre.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:57.070
You know, that's not capitalism.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:00.060
Capital is money that
makes more money.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.510
You can't have a capitalism
where-- to hold money

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.040
in the bank costs you money.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.610
That's an abnormal capitalism.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.190
The reason we have
it is because we

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.920
haven't sorted out
the debt overhang

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.810
of the post-2000 situation.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.554
That's a kind of
short order problem.

00:39:14.554 --> 00:39:15.970
I know what the
answer to that is.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.220
Write off some debts.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.160
Make some people--
make some people who

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.200
have savings poorer,
unfortunately,

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.620
and inflate your way out of it.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.650
That's what you do.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:24.510
We can't do it.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.540
And the Greeks tried to
just do one bit of it.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.160
And bang, like you say,
they were quite clearly

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.030
heavily pressured.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:36.010
But I think-- I've got
this great favorite passage

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:40.465
from Hilary Mantel's "Wolf Hall"
where you remember, those you

00:39:40.465 --> 00:39:43.230
who've seen it, where Mark
Rylance, the kind of Thomas

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:47.870
Cromwell figure, he gets this
hapless aristocrat called Harry

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.070
Percy.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.570
And he's basically [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:51.320
And he says, look.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.300
You think-- you think-- this is
in 1515, whatever-- you think

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.270
the world is based on jousting
and castles and chivalry

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.770
and feasts.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.757
I know the world is
based on banking.

00:40:04.757 --> 00:40:06.590
And I can switch-- I
know this because I can

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.625
switch your world off tomorrow.

00:40:08.625 --> 00:40:09.730
I don't like you.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:10.690
I can take you out.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.910
You can't take me out.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.090
Postcapitalism is about
saying, look-- to capitalists--

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.811
you think the world
is based on banking.

00:40:17.811 --> 00:40:19.810
You think the world is
based on private property

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.680
and large monopolies, tech IP.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.600
We can switch it off.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.530
But I don't want to do it
in a kind of aggressive way.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.450
I want to persuade people that
we should switch part of it

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.990
off.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.010
And yes, exactly
to create a bubble.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.326
And some of these bubbles are
not-- they're not smashable.

00:40:35.326 --> 00:40:38.220
A lot of the anarchist networks
in Athens have this slogan.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.120
You can't default on a squat.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.870
You can't default
on unoccupied space.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.570
I don't necessarily
think occupied spaces are

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.160
the same as Wikipedia
or Ruby on Rails,

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.870
whatever, open source projects.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.120
They're different parts of
what the world used to make,

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.405
this synthetic, new
part of the economy.

00:40:56.405 --> 00:40:57.530
And we haven't done it yet.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.090
So I don't know.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.772
The transition is a challenge.

00:41:01.772 --> 00:41:04.607
AUDIENCE: How do you reconcile
that with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:04.607 --> 00:41:06.440
Because they can close
down the [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.480
PAUL MASON: Yeah, they can--
as a monopoly on violence

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:08.980
everywhere.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.570
But I've seen it in my
professional career.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.990
Large masses of people use
technology to overcome that.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.310
Even now, the people
who are the most

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:20.140
expert in the
Egyptian revolution

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.190
will tell you that
it's not over.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.075
That even now when
you think it's over,

00:41:24.075 --> 00:41:25.920
over, over, it's not.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.110
The networks are alive.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.100
The ideas-- this is what the
great thing about infotech

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.690
is, that in the
information world--

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.160
you'll know this
from your work--

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.460
no active imagination is
wasted because you can always

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.810
record it and use it later.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.620
In the world of analog, then
kind of it's about spontaneity

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.300
and the moment's gone.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:50.400
And so I think a lot of people
react to state crackdowns--

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.350
like Syria.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.735
You could imagine, we
should be creating now

00:41:53.735 --> 00:41:55.956
a virtual Syrian university.

00:41:55.956 --> 00:41:58.330
In fact, you guys could do it
with your corporate weight,

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.430
your Facebook, et cetera.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.610
Virtual Syrian university
that when it's over,

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.440
just basically move
from the digital space

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.190
to the analog space,
lands like a spaceship,

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.360
and it can start
working immediately.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.610
We couldn't do things
like that 20 years ago.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.110
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
what your thoughts are

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.296
on GMI, or basic income.

00:42:21.296 --> 00:42:22.004
PAUL MASON: Yeah.

00:42:22.004 --> 00:42:24.385
Well, I'm in favor of it.

00:42:24.385 --> 00:42:27.000
Universal basic
income, or the state

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.400
as the employer
of last resort is

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.440
the quick and dirty
or slow and dirty,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.850
but still nevertheless short
term answer to this problem of,

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.140
how do we rapidly automate?

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:40.510
I see it as a one-off subsidy
for rapidly automating

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.100
the world.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.170
But of course, who pays?

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.605
It's the taxpayer.

00:42:43.605 --> 00:42:45.480
I've done a back-of-the-envelope
calculation,

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.710
that to pay everybody the
same as the state pension here

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.922
as of right, no means
testing whatsoever,

00:42:51.922 --> 00:42:53.630
you get it whether
you're at work or not,

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.990
six grand would double
the welfare bill.

00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:02.750
But some of the right wing
proponents of the basic income

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:06.060
have kind of grasped some
of the economies of scale

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.530
that you could do via that.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:13.076
That is, actually
for example, you're

00:43:13.076 --> 00:43:14.200
going to means test people.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.470
But lots of diseases
are to do with poverty.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.417
Lots of disease.

00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:19.750
And you could basically say, OK.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:22.800
Well, what do we save
from that for the taxpayer

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.560
by managing diseases of poverty
and mental illness, type 2

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.080
diabetes, et cetera.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.740
Stress, hypertension in
oppressed communities

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.790
is very high.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.360
So if you could just take some
of the stress away from them

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.370
by making them not have to worry
about where their money comes

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.600
from, you could probably
save some of what

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.250
it costs society that way.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.750
But look.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.220
You know, it's not-- everybody
knows about the basic income

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.790
proposal, and there's a
right wing and left wing

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:48.373
version of it.

00:43:48.373 --> 00:43:50.480
What is amazing is no
serious politicians

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.135
are prepared to [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:52.135 --> 00:43:54.054
AUDIENCE: I have a
question on [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:54.054 --> 00:43:56.995
So you talked a lot about
the copying being free,

00:43:56.995 --> 00:43:57.495
which it is.

00:43:57.495 --> 00:44:00.072
But the first copy's
always really expensive.

00:44:00.072 --> 00:44:02.377
And you haven't really
said, how do you

00:44:02.377 --> 00:44:05.847
motivate excellent creation.

00:44:05.847 --> 00:44:06.680
PAUL MASON: Exactly.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.820
And I think the--
so my answer to that

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.240
is that those of us who create
intellectual products only

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.080
have to be really-- have to
really get it into our heads

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.450
why we're doing it.

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.730
So I've written this book.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.284
It goes out as an
analog copy like this.

00:44:22.284 --> 00:44:24.200
And I'm absolutely certain
there's a PDF of it

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.770
somewhere on BitTorrent.

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.070
But why do I want to do that?

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:32.150
Because ultimately, I want to
make a statement to the world--

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:36.160
and most authors will tell
you that hours versus income

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.970
is minimum wage across lots
of branches of writing.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.800
But I know that as an
intellectual product,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.960
as an ebook, it is either
copyable or very easily-- so

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.710
what do I do?

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:49.270
What do I do?

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.190
Where does somebody like
me make higher value work?

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.300
They make it in corporate
speaking engagements.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.775
They make it in
advice, in consultancy.

00:44:58.775 --> 00:44:59.805
That's what's normal.

00:44:59.805 --> 00:45:01.430
Let me put it this way.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:04.010
Certain key artists
don't really care about--

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:06.680
--about whether their
work is pirated.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.499
Because Glastonbury
sells out in three hours.

00:45:09.499 --> 00:45:11.290
And in other words,
you move to the analog.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:13.670
So as creators of
intellectual property,

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.720
we have to really
ask ourselves, where

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.610
is the reward going to be?

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:20.530
Now Hollywood has an answer
to this called lawyers.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.060
They would like the copyright
on James Bond's "Diamonds

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.910
are Forever" to be still in
existence when the world is

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.690
atomized and become dust.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.290
It matters to them.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.080
Their contracts say all time
and forever in the universe

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.010
is the copyright.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:41.640
So what you can do is you can
record quicker and spikier

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.480
the creation.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.800
I don't think The Beatles
wrote their music so it could

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.500
be still in copyright in 2050.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.980
I think they wrote it to
meet attractive members

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.421
of the opposite
sex and smoke dope.

00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:55.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:55.315 --> 00:45:57.124
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
this makes sense.

00:45:57.124 --> 00:45:59.165
But if you think about
the classic examples which

00:45:59.165 --> 00:46:01.248
are always brought up in
the intellectual property

00:46:01.248 --> 00:46:03.530
field which are
lifesaving drugs,

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:07.430
and software is the other
one, creating a new drug

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:08.565
costs billions.

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:11.660
And a lot of that work it
hard work and not particularly

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:12.826
exciting and not fulfilling.

00:46:12.826 --> 00:46:14.360
The reason you're
doing it is clear.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.282
You want to save lives
in a perfect setting.

00:46:16.282 --> 00:46:18.840
But it's still
expensive, and you still

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.039
have to reward that somehow.

00:46:20.039 --> 00:46:20.830
PAUL MASON: You do.

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:25.430
And I would simply create a
copyright mentality that is

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.917
shorter-- shorter and steeper.

00:46:27.917 --> 00:46:29.000
And I think that's doable.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.980
If you look at the different
copyrights and patent

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.410
laws for IP, it goes from--
because you know the example

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.640
of the generic drugs.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.030
So the HIV drugs.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.992
The Indian government basically
busted the world's pharma

00:46:42.992 --> 00:46:43.950
companies and said, no.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.470
You're not going
to do, no matter

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.600
how talented your guys were,
no matter how long they spent

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.760
in a lab and how boring it was,
this has to be deployed now.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.180
So we're going to
produce it generically.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.660
And the pharma industry has
had to react to that, probably

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.545
not in a very-- in some sense,
not in a very virtuous way.

00:46:59.545 --> 00:47:00.920
Because what
they've had to do is

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.740
pursue that form of intellectual
property, which is niche.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.495
So often, you get
pharmaceutical giants

00:47:07.495 --> 00:47:09.830
now looking for a
pipeline of products

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.230
that is so niche that
you're sometimes wondering

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.230
whether or not it's
simply designed to avoid

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:15.688
the generic drug thing.

00:47:15.688 --> 00:47:17.104
AUDIENCE: No, I
think the way they

00:47:17.104 --> 00:47:19.897
avoid it is they go, [INAUDIBLE]
HIV drugs, they're going,

00:47:19.897 --> 00:47:21.480
we're not going to
research HIV drugs.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.580
We're going to research
anti-depressants

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.583
because we can sell those in the
US where it's still protected.

00:47:25.583 --> 00:47:25.937
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:47:25.937 --> 00:47:26.530
It's a niche.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:27.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:27.155 --> 00:47:31.090
And so you end up
losing a net benefit.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.540
PAUL MASON: So society
has to take that on board.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.709
And more important to
you-- to your world,

00:47:35.709 --> 00:47:37.750
I think you have to take
it on board at a level a

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.660
of pure information property.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.750
And I think this is what
we're grappling with.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.500
I'd be quite happy to
see copyright-- quite

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.060
happy-- Penguin
wouldn't, but I'd

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.240
be quite happy to see
copyright shortened

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.780
for intellectual, pure
intellectual products

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.290
like that.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.440
Because in the real
world, it is-- I'm sorry.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.660
I don't know how good I am.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.740
But basically, if I don't see
that in some kind of Oxfam shop

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.870
in the next year or so,
I'll be very surprised.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:11.200
That's the analog version
of the long but narrow tail

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.790
of information products.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:14.545
So, yeah.

00:48:14.545 --> 00:48:18.520
Shorter but spikier
rewards, and recognizing

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.140
that there are tactical
things that you can do,

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.105
which is move to the
world of analog space.

00:48:24.105 --> 00:48:25.610
And sometimes it's nice.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.000
Actually, the
bandwidth at a concert

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.190
is high, whereas the
bandwidth with a white wire

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.167
is not as high.

00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:34.750
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I mean, you talked

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:36.880
about-- actually, people
laughed when you said

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.330
what we need to know is life.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:41.230
But then we see books about
chopping wood and living

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.604
in cabins, and responding
to your concern

00:48:43.604 --> 00:48:45.270
about not talking to
people on the tube.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.936
I mean, these things are sort of
bound up together, aren't they?

00:48:47.936 --> 00:48:51.460
PAUL MASON: Well, you know,
and also about-- there's

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.040
a story that isn't mine of
a kind of famous iconic case

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.820
today of a guy who
made axes in Sweden.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.662
And basically, he had a
mass production ax company,

00:49:00.662 --> 00:49:01.870
and it wasn't going anywhere.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:04.920
So he went away and rethought
for a year and said, right.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.829
Well, we've got an ax museum,
so we'll look at 700 axes.

00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:09.620
Because you need axes
in the Nordic country

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:10.800
to chop your wood.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.060
It's not just a
kind of status item.

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.330
And so they designed what
they thought was a perfect ax.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.830
And so they produced it as
a kind of craft product.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.790
And that lasted two years
until a Chinese version of it

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.176
turned up in their
equivalent of being cute.

00:49:25.176 --> 00:49:26.800
And so they went,
well, what can we do?

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.424
So they simply, as
well as all the kind

00:49:28.424 --> 00:49:31.060
of extra bit of nice
packaging and paper

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.650
and you get your individual
ax, they just said,

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:35.200
it's got a lifetime guarantee.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.799
When it runs out, when
it actually breaks,

00:49:38.799 --> 00:49:39.590
just bring it back.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:40.980
You can have one for free.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.430
And in other words,
that was a rethinking

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:46.700
of a very physical product
in a kind of open source way,

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.920
or as certainly a
quasi-open source way.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.140
And I think it's just
a good example to me

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.960
about-- so you were talking
about lifestyle, life and work.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.650
It's about thinking
about-- thinking

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:03.070
beyond the short-term
remuneration issue of work.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.930
I mean, the 80-20
thing, you know,

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.929
is a good example of doing it.

00:50:08.929 --> 00:50:10.720
But I bet there are
other corporations that

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.822
do it in an even
more interesting way

00:50:12.822 --> 00:50:14.155
that we haven't heard about yet.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.140
Yeah?

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.200
Going back to your
universal income question.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.400
How do you handle
that against a type

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.330
[INAUDIBLE] primarily sort
of housing here where it's

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:33.570
a competitive bidding war.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.070
There's a limited
amount of housing.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:38.620
So if you just increase
everyone's income

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.130
by a factor of 10, or what
happens is by next year,

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.150
house prices have gone
up by five or 10--

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:44.210
PAUL MASON: I wouldn't
increase anybody's income

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.160
by a factor of 10.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.710
At least by a factor
of 0.1 is more like.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.020
But yeah.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.820
You know, weirdly,
even-- it is weird,

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:56.920
especially for maybe people from
beyond the British Isles, born

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.070
outside the British
Isles, or young.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.370
You know, when my grandma--
she lived in a slum

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:03.290
for the first 30
years of her life.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.900
And just before World War II,
something quite remarkable

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.400
happened.

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.550
The state gave her a house.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:09.630
They gave it to her.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:10.890
She didn't buy it.

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.605
That rent was minimal.

00:51:12.605 --> 00:51:14.790
And she could have it for life.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:19.160
Basically social housing
could be cheap or free.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.647
And actually, we know how
many people there are.

00:51:21.647 --> 00:51:23.480
We know what the
population projections are.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.010
We know what the demand
side is going to be.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.970
You could easily meet the
demand with supply and tank

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.230
the market if you wanted.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.830
I don't see that
as a big problem.

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:37.590
I see the problem you describe
as what if everybody's income

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:38.800
is kind of reliable?

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.070
Does it suppress competition?

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:41.970
Because it would.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:43.670
You could actually--
if somebody paid

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:48.750
me X grand a year not to
work, I'd probably work less.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.666
And the reason I
want us to think

00:51:50.666 --> 00:51:52.290
about doing that is
because don't think

00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:54.480
there's going to be
enough work to go around

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.590
of a satisfying nature.

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:58.820
And what's going
to happen-- there's

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.010
a lot of angst around
gender balance and ethnicity

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:03.282
balance in work forces.

00:52:03.282 --> 00:52:04.990
And I'm glad to see
you guys have clearly

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.160
put a lot of thought
into how to do that.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.880
But 20 or 30 years
down the line,

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.540
you're going to
have male be female,

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.250
black be white, et cetera,
et cetera, competition

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.420
over a very, very scarce
number of high value jobs.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:23.000
And I think we need to kind of
address that really to avoid it

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.340
all being the Oxbridge
graduates who get everything.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.210
We just have to kind of think
around the problem societally.

00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:31.370
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:35.060
So assuming before universal
income could be a thing,

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.110
you would have to vastly
increase the supply of houses.

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:43.100
Otherwise, someone's
getting 6k a year

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.440
but then basically the
rent is paying the level

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.240
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.310
Your rent can be-- you
can just live on, say,

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:50.840
500 pounds for your groceries.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.440
So I'm going to
set rent at 5,500.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.120
And increase the universal to
10 [INAUDIBLE] of the rent's

00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:00.289
going to go up to 9,500, which
is everything you've got other

00:53:00.289 --> 00:53:01.680
than you need to survive.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.430
PAUL MASON: I mean, I
would just-- I mean,

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.110
what I'm talking
about here is not

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:06.580
a series of short-term measures.

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.850
I'm trying to design a
kind of holistic framework

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:10.895
for how to act.

00:53:10.895 --> 00:53:15.650
And alongside it, to take the
exact specific example you use,

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:18.040
you just do what New
York did in the '50s.

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.020
Rent control.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.270
I mean, that would-- yeah, no.

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.040
It would tank the
buy-to-let market.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.530
But these are short-term issues.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.863
They don't solve the long-term
issues I'm talking about.

00:53:25.863 --> 00:53:26.752
Do we have time for--

00:53:26.752 --> 00:53:28.640
MALE SPEAKER: Time
for last questions?

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.290
Yeah, one more.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:29.790
One more.

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:37.810
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:38.310
Two more.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.630
Two more.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.380
PAUL MASON: You know
what, do it together.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.350
AUDIENCE: So how do you think
that the current structure

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:51.690
of the state and the taxation
system that the state uses

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:53.910
to fund itself need to change?

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:58.020
Especially now when we have
people who are very highly

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:02.830
trained who [INAUDIBLE] training
who make something at one time

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:05.404
cost that then distributes
it everywhere for nothing.

00:54:05.404 --> 00:54:08.569
Do you need to tax them on the
redistribution of something?

00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:11.450
Or is that an impossible
thing, because the company

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:13.119
is making no money on it?

00:54:13.119 --> 00:54:14.910
MALE SPEAKER: In the
two minutes remaining.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.910
PAUL MASON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.300
OK.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.022
I say in the book that
a basic income is only

00:54:23.022 --> 00:54:23.980
a transitional measure.

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.430
Because if you-- my ultimate
aim is to make as much stuff

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.920
as possible abundant.

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.330
And so basically,
to dissolve-- it's

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.570
like taking the
complexities of the economy,

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.180
drawing them on blotting paper,
and then dipping it in water.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.370
Basically, the complexities
disappear when stuff is free.

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:42.930
You know, it's like if I take
your ball pen off your desk,

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.950
you don't come running down to
reception saying, give it back.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:48.130
In a sense, once
stuff is abundant,

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.940
you tend to stop
thinking about it.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.690
So that is the solution to that.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:57.010
But in the process, if
you've got a state, a market,

00:54:57.010 --> 00:55:02.030
and a non-market sector, then of
course-- think of it like this.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.210
The taxes from the market
sector pays for the state.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.460
But what comes from
the non-market sector?

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.980
You know, the OECD
is very clear.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.320
This non-market sector
is big physically,

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.030
but we just can't
value it economically,

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:14.740
nor can we tax it.

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.860
So you know, the
capitalist solution

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.930
is to turn Wikipedia
into a corporation,

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:21.845
make 27,000 people
micro employees,

00:55:21.845 --> 00:55:23.300
and get it to pay tax.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.550
That will be the solution.

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:27.460
My solution will be to say
to understand that actually,

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.620
what a product like
Wikipedia-- or we could use

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.180
other examples-- is
actually creating

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.670
a non-market value
through both the market

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:35.695
sector and the state.

00:55:35.695 --> 00:55:37.570
It is like-- it's the
bit that you've already

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:38.760
dipped in the water.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.700
We can't measure
it economically,

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:42.750
so what we have to do is
to these other two bits,

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:45.160
to really focus on them,
the state and the market

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.340
and say, hold on a minute.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.730
They're going to be under
a long-term, strategic,

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.740
century-long pressure
from this new sector,

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.500
because it's going to-- it
looks like it's sucking value.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.570
I mean, the example I give as
well is the internet of things.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.570
There's a lot of hype
around internet of things.

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:03.120
It's been described as a
$9 trillion opportunity.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.550
Yeah, it is, to take $9 trillion
of value out of the economy.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:09.150
Because all it will do
is make things cheaper.

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:12.250
I can't-- yes, Cisco and whoever
makes switches will make a lot

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:12.770
of money.

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:15.650
Whoever installs all the
smart meters in people's homes

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:16.570
make a lot of money.

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.270
You guys have got
this app thing.

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:22.520
I mean, you've got
this house thing.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.770
House energy thing.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:24.670
I can't remember
what it's called.

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:25.000
MALE SPEAKER: Nest.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.958
PAUL MASON: Nest, yeah.

00:56:25.958 --> 00:56:29.760
I don't use it because
my house is analog.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.670
But, yeah, you'll make
money out of that.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:34.340
But ultimately,
what ILT will do is

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:37.490
it will basically-- it will
basically make things cheaper,

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:41.010
because it's going to
utilization of energy capacity,

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:46.360
utilization of transport
capacity very, very efficient.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:51.670
So you have to ask the question,
how do we manage the transition

00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:54.830
to where this is a bigger
sector and a more virtuous

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:58.360
relationship between what the
open source and free sector

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.030
provides to the other
two sectors for free

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:04.170
is utilized in an
efficient way, rather

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.700
than being seen as
what I described it as,

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.130
sucking value from it?

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:11.526
Which is how economists would
try and-- they'd say, look.

00:57:11.526 --> 00:57:13.874
People now will say, you
know, Wikipedia's a $3 billion

00:57:13.874 --> 00:57:14.790
hole in the ad market.

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:16.201
That's how people look at it.

00:57:16.201 --> 00:57:16.700
Well, no.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.660
To me, it's a great future
opportunity and virtuous thing.

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.730
And I want to make
it better and more

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:25.836
protected while controlling
the-- controlling

00:57:25.836 --> 00:57:27.460
the deflation of the
other two sectors.

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:29.840
And for the left wingers
here, the traditional left,

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.840
it's actually [INAUDIBLE]
as well, but deflation

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.060
of the state sector as
well as the deflation

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.390
of the market sector.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:37.860
But on that note-- and
the caveat that everything

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:44.020
I say as a kind of, look, as
a kind of think challenger.

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.240
That's what I'm doing here.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.830
I'm not handing down a
kind of peer reviewed,

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.920
engineering certified thing.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.642
I'm offering a series
of challenging ideas.

00:57:53.642 --> 00:57:55.600
And I'm absolutely certain
that your generation

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.270
of economic engineering
software, business process

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:01.820
specialists will come
up with the solutions.

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.354
I don't have the solutions.

00:58:03.354 --> 00:58:05.020
MALE SPEAKER: Paul,
thank you very much.

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.020
PAUL MASON: My pleasure.

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:09.570
[APPLAUSE]
