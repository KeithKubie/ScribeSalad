00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.680
Well we have a special treat for everyone on board this evening.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.020
We can get a real live performance by some of our guests

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.010
joining us on this flight this evening. We'd like to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.070
welcome aboard the Princeton Choir. And I believe they are

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.080
going to show us (laughter) Stand up Quinton! (singing)

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.670
Well we're about to go to rehearsal at the Bethlehem

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.100
Chapel. And it's really famous because, like, Jan Hus

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.530
preached there in Czech for the first time ever. Well, I

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:23.580
mean, the first time it wasn't in Latin. (singing)

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.330
With a choir from the United States and a choir from the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.160
Czech Republic singing both American and Czech songs is

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:41.070
really at the heart of good diplomacy.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.480
Behind us is the Stephansdom, or St. Stephen's Cathedral in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.170
Vienna, which is where we performed last night which was

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.060
super exciting. It's one of the top sites in Vienna so.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.150
And because of our concert we have now helped to raise some

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.460
money for restoration on the roof.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.630
And we just got a standing ovation when we did our show at

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.060
the Stephansdom. Oh my gosh it was so amazing.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.210
Coincidence had it that both the Choir and I were here in

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.270
the same week. I had a concert on Tuesday, two nights ago,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.460
at the Theater an der Wien. The Chapel Choir provides me

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.290
with some of my best memories from Princeton.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.450
This is St. Stephen's Basilica, the biggest Roman Catholic

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.430
Church in Budapest and we're about to perform an impromptu

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.950
concert. Enjoy!

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.440
It had such a strong impact on the choir that it was

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.210
important to do this as often as possible. Part of what

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.210
happens with a choir is because they're together for so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.020
long they get to know each other better, they trust each

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.020
other more, and the sound of the choir changes. So when we

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.900
got back it was a fuller sound, it was a richer sound, and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.400
people knew each other better. So it was a marvelous

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.570
experience altogether. Our Monday rehearsal after we got

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.360
back from the tour was pretty much chaos the whole time

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.040
because everyone was so excited to see each other again.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.350
They'd been away from each other for, oh, 24 hours and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.320
couldn't wait to see each other again. So that told me that

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.420
this tour had had a big impact on their relationships.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.430
You can have recordings, you can photographs, you can have all

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.760
of these things but the experience of singing it is

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.030
ephemeral. It touches you, it leaves its mark, and then it

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.000
goes away. The actual experience goes away but still it has
0:03:41.01,0:00:02.27     
touched you in a way that is indelible.
