00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.970
We're on problem--
where are we?

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.670
Problem 232.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.830
Only a few left.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:22.280
If 1/x minus 1 over x plus 1 is
equal to 1 over x plus 4,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.850
then x could be which
of the following?

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.740
And you might have a temptation
to just invert both

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.480
sides, but you can't
do that just yet.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.840
Because if you took the inverse
of this, it's not like

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.850
you just get x minus x plus 1.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.680
You actually have to subtract,
or you could say add these two

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.480
fractions together.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.590
So let's do that.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.320
So if we simplify this left-hand
side, a common

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.700
denominator would be
x times x plus 1.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500
And then a numerator would be,
let's see-- 1/x is the same

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.950
thing as x plus 1 over this
thing, because that cancels

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.610
out and you get 1/x, minus-- 1
over x plus 1, that's the same

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.080
thing as x/x times x plus 1.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.960
The x's would cancel out,
you get 1 over x plus 1.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.380
So this left-hand side, the x's
cancel out and you get 1

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.070
over-- well, we could
just make that x

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.130
squared plus x, right?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.825
So now this simplifies to-- the
left-hand side is 1 over x

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.670
squared plus x, and the
right-hand side is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.730
1 over x plus 4.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.690
And now we can invert both
sides or just set the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.880
denominators as equal
to each other.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.670
But let's just invert both.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.930
It's the same thing, actually.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.540
So if you take the inverse of
both sides and you get-- and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.130
I'll just switch colors just
randomly-- x squared plus x is

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.080
equal to x plus 4.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.290
Let's subtract x from
both sides.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.260
You get x squared
is equal to 4.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.320
So x is equal to plus
or minus 2.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.210
And they say then x could be--
well, choice C is minus 2, so

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.270
that's one of the values
that x could be.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.070
Next question, 233.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:04.490
All right, they have 1/2 to the
minus 3 power times 1/4 to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.130
the minus 2 power times
1/16 to the minus 1.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.760
The first thing I do when I see
negative exponents, just

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.250
so they don't confuse
me, is that I just

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.340
invert all of the numbers.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.910
So this is the same thing.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.960
This is the exact same thing as
equal to-- this is the same

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.720
thing as 2 to the third
power, right?

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.830
When you take something to a
negative exponent, that's the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.690
same thing as the inverse of
that thing to the positive

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.830
exponent, so this is 2
to the third power.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.200
This is times 4 squared
times 16.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.510
And so 2 to the third is 8
times 16 times 16, right?

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.830
That's 8 times 256.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.260
And then-- oh, wait.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.510
I'm going down the wrong path,
because they have it in

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.880
completely different format.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.430
So actually, maybe I should look
at the choices before I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.300
continue these problems.
So let me rewrite it.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.090
So they all have it as -- you
know, 1/2 to some power, 1/8

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.490
to some power, so let
me rewrite this.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.410
I went down the wrong road.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.760
So let's write all of these
as powers of 1/2.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.800
So 1/2 to the minus 1/3, fine.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.150
That's still 1/2 to
the minus 1/3.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.930
1/4, what is that?

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.630
1/4 is the same thing
as 1/2 squared.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.110
We're raising that
to the minus 2.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.260
And then 1/16, that's the same
thing as 1/2 to the third

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.205
power is 1/8, so it's
to the fourth power.

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:35.420
We're taking that to
the negative 1.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.330
And then this is-- we'll just
use what we know about

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
exponent rules, and we've proven
this in other Khan

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.970
Academy videos.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.360
1/2 squared to the minus 2.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.230
You can just multiply these
exponents, so that's equal to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.650
1/2 to the minus 4.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.190
And then 1/2 to the 4 to the
minus 1, you multiply them and

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.190
that's equal to minus 4.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.800
And now we have the same base,
and we're multiplying them, so

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.010
we can just add the exponents.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.420
This is equal to 1/2 to the
minus 3 plus minus 4, minus 7,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.520
minus 4, is equal to minus 11.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.310
So it's 1/2 to the negative 11th
power, which is choice B.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.310
That was a good lesson there.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.540
Look at your choices before you
go down some path because

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.280
I was actually going to evaluate
this thing, which

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.990
would have taken a little
bit of extra time.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.000
Problem 234.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.800
In a certain game, a large
container is filled with red,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.320
yellow, green-- so let's see,
there's red, yellow, green,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.980
and blue beads, worth
respectively-- so respectively

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.200
means the same order; we said
the colors are in the same

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.450
order that they're worth -- so
worth respectively 7, 5, 3,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.840
and 2 points each.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.290
OK, a number of beads are then
removed from the container.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.460
If the product of the point of
values of the removed beads is

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.010
147,000, how many red
beads were removed?

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.850
So this is interesting.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.320
So there's something that
hopefully will jump out at you

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.800
about these numbers.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.230
They're all prime
numbers, right?

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.390
So if you look at any number,
you can tell how many of a

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.790
certain prime number there is in
that number by just doing a

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.310
prime factorization.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.320
So let's do that for 147,000.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.560
And you'd be surprised
how quickly a

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.080
number can get smaller.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.330
So let's see.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.190
How many times-- let's
see, does 3 go 147?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.800
I think we've done
this before.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.050
Sure, 3 times -- let me
just do it up here.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.210
3 goes into 147 4,
12, 27, 49 times.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.410
So you get a 3 and you
get a 49, right?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.710
49,000, I should say.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.370
You could do a 7 and a 7,000.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:07.370
And then you can get another
7, and you can get a 1,000.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.520
And then you could do
2 a bunch of times.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.130
So you get a 2, you get a --
well, the main thing, just so

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.490
we don't waste time is they want
to know-- what color do

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.530
they want to know?

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.660
They want to know how many red
beads were removed, right?

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.910
So red corresponds to 7.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.060
So all the beads, you
multiply them

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.240
together and you get 147,000.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.440
So we've essentially factored
out all the 7's that we can

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.530
fit into 147,000.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.450
7 does not go into
1,000 at all.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.870
7 is not a factor.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.120
So we've already solved
our problem.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.700
There are exactly two 7 prime
factors in 147,000.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.770
You could keep going
with this.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.410
You know, you get a 2.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.820
2 times 500.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.820
You get another 2.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.990
2 times 250.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.620
There's a bunch of
2's in here.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.000
And then you'd probably get-- I
don't know what else you're

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.370
going to get.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.480
You'd probably get a couple
of 5's in here, and

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.280
then you'd be done.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.310
But these are all the 7's.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.550
There are two 7's in 147,000.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.640
Two 7 prime factors, so there
would be 2 red beads.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.610
And that is choice D.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.320
Problem 235.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.750
Switch colors.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.800
235.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.190
If 2 over 1 plus 2 over
y is equal to 1,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.750
then what does y equal?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.460
Let's take the inverse
of both.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.800
Let's multiply both sides of the
equation times 1 plus 2/y.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.340
And so we get 2 is equal
to 1 plus 2/y.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.260
And let's multiply both sides
of the equation by y.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.710
So you get 2y.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.090
And actually, you could probably
already eyeball this.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.830
Actually there's
an easier way.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.660
Let's subtract 1 from
both sides.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.340
You get 1 is equal to 2/y.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.920
Multiply both sides by y and
you get y is equal to 2.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.305
And that is choice D.

00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:01.400
And you could've actually
eyeballed it, because, say, 1

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.470
plus 1 is equal to 2,
so this has to be 1.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.590
So how am I going to
make that a 1?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.390
That equals 2, but sometimes
it's easier just to

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.130
mechanically go through the
algebra, because sometimes,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.470
you can't eyeball it,
and it's good to

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.610
just keep moving forward.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.120
Problem 236.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:27.100
If a, b, and c are consecutive
positive integers, and a is

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.210
less than b, which is less than
c, which of the following

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.539
must be true?

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:38.520
Consecutive positive, so, you
know, we could say that b

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.539
would be equal to a plus 1, and
c would be equal to a plus

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.340
2 or b plus 1.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.740
And, of course, a
is equal to a.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.110
I don't know if that helps,
I just felt like

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.220
writing that down.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.720
So in statement 1, they say
c minus a is equal to 2.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.050
Sure.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.460
They're consecutive positive
integers, so c is going to be

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.680
2 more than a.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.040
So this is right.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.005
Statement 2, they tell
us abc is even.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.640
Well, instead of going into some
algebraic thing where I

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.390
represent even and odd integers
and all of that,

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.590
let's just try it with two
cases, one where a is odd and

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.820
one where a is even.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.240
So let's say a is even.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.170
So the numbers would be 2--
sorry, would be 2 times 3

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.070
times 4, right?

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.470
So then we would get 8.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.260
Well, you know what?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.510
This has to be even because one
of these numbers are going

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.300
to be even, right?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.500
And so if you're divisible, and
by definition, if one of

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.490
these numbers are even,
it's divisible by 2.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.840
So the whole thing, when you
multiply it together, it's got

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.530
to be divisible by 2, right?

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.830
Either a and c are even, in
which case this whole thing

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.180
has to be even, or b is even, in
which case this whole thing

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.750
is even, right?

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.370
If you multiply a string of
numbers and at least one of

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.120
them is even, then that whole
number is going to be even,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.270
because that number that's even
is a factor of that whole

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.340
string of numbers.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.690
But anyway, you could try it
with 2, 3, 4, or you could try

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.560
it with 3, 4, 5.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.470
Either way, you're going
to get an even number.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.840
So this is also right.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.840
Statement 3.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.730
a plus b plus c over
3 is an integer.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.440
Well, let's think about it.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:19.830
I don't know.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:25.500
Let's say if we were to
take a plus b plus c.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.940
I don't know, even if we were to
take-- let's see, 3 plus 4

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.500
plus-- no, that works.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.840
2 plus 3-- no, that works.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.540
Let's write it as-- so this
is a plus a plus 1, right?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.700
B is a plus 1, plus a plus
2 over 3, right?

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:50.735
And so this is equal to 3a plus
3 over 3. b is just a

00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:52.390
plus 1, c is a plus 2.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.430
You add them all together.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.360
Sure enough, you know, you could
divide the top and the

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.630
bottom by 3 and you
get a plus 1.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.510
So yes, statement 3
is also correct.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.050
This is always going to evaluate
to a plus 1, which is

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.890
an integer.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.690
So all three are true,
so that is choice E.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.400
And I'm all out of time.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.420
See you in the next video.
