00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.802
 - As every third think
 piece will tell you,

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.138 size:88% position:44%
 we are a fractured country.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.574
 And when it comes to guns, the
 debate is as heated as ever.

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:11.177 align:start size:88% position:13%
Thankfully on June
11th on Comedy Central,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.080
 I, Jordan Klepper, solve guns

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:17.683 align:start position:0%
 through an ingenious
 strategy of rubbing elbows,

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.053 align:start position:0%
 imbedding with the
 militia, driving race cars,

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.821
 and shooting big ass weapons

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:24.424 align:start size:88% position:13%
til a bit of sanity
returns to our country.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.324 size:84% position:42%
  (gunshot)

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:26.592
- Miss!

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:27.527 size:88% position:44%
 - You don't have to
 keep saying miss.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.195
 Just a little over a week ago,

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.065 size:88% position:44%
 our nation's gun divide was
 on full display in Atlanta,

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.767
where the NRA held it's
national convention.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.502 align:start size:88% position:13%
 A perfect place for
 me to selflessly

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:38.404
 reach across the partisan line

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:42.075 align:start position:0%
  and get NRA members pumped
  to watch my special.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:45.211
 Who doesn't like common sense
 approaches to gun violence?

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.113 size:84% position:42%
  You're for closing the
  gun show loophole, right?

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.048 size:88% position:44%
 You're a smart guy.

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:52.585 size:88% position:44%
  So what is it that brings
  80,000 gunners to Atlanta?

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - It's just fun to
 look at all the stuff

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.722
and see the people that
you've seen in magazines

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.024 size:88% position:44%
 and, y'know, on television.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.027
 - This is like Comic
 Con, but for death.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.196 size:84% position:42%
  - Guess I'll just have
  to take your word for it.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.230
- Bingo!

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start size:88% position:13%
What are the fanboys
excited about this year?

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.302
 - Kinda cool to walk around
 and see all the new products

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.437 size:84% position:42%
  that come out and the new
  ammo and stuff like that.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.139
- So 2017's going to be
a good year for guns.

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:14.373 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh yeah.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.442 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What was your favorite
shooting of 2016?

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:20.713 align:start position:0%
  - 2016, honestly, um,
  watching like Shane Coley

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:21.714
and those guys.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.049
- Was he Denver?

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.051 size:88% position:44%
  - No, it was out
  in Utah, actually,

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.085
 They had a big Utah--

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.053 size:88% position:44%
 - Was it a mall or?

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.554
- No, what do you mean?

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:29.922 size:84% position:42%
  - Where was the shooting?

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - It wasn't a
 shooting like that--

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.092 size:88% position:44%
 - A school?

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.062 size:88% position:44%
 - No, it was like a
 tournament, y'know.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:36.963
 - Oh!

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.064 size:88% position:44%
 I'm doing a special

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.232
 where I claim to solve guns.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.633
 - Solve guns?

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.968 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm solving guns.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.069
 - What's solving guns
 have to do with it?

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.437
 - Well, you're gonna
 have to watch it.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.272
 - That's the day, June 11th?

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.473
 - June 11th.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:48.407
 - On Comedy Central?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.342
 - On Comedy Central.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.410
 - I just hope it's not comedy.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:52.345
 - That's me.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.946 size:88% position:44%
  Guns don't solve problems,

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.150 align:start position:0%
 Jordan Klepper solves problems
 about guns on June 11th.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.584
- What?

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.186 size:88% position:44%
  - I'm not getting through.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.089 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's time to become a
sheep in wolf's clothing

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.124 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and give these people
 what they want:

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:07.160
Guns and witty t-shirts.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.465
 (pop)

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:18.638 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Who likes moderate
 gun stance, huh?

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.472 size:88% position:44%
  June 11th!

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.109
Big tees are comin' out
of a gun, am I right?

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:23.910 size:88% position:44%
 Ho!

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:26.879 size:84% position:42%
  Oo, yeah!

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:27.714 size:88% position:44%
  Lovin' it!

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:34.353 size:88% position:44%
  Unfortunately common sense
  isn't one size fits all.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.988 size:88% position:44%
 If t-shirts weren't
 going to solve it,

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:38.224
 I would to have to solve it.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.993
 On Sunday, June 11th.
