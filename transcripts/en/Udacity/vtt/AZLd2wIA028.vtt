00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.373
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The slope here is 1 half. I can start by choosing two points on the line.

00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:09.271
This one is 0,3, and this one is 2,4. We can see to go from this point to the

00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:14.104
next point, we should move up one. And then write 2. We moved one unit up in a

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:18.937
positive direction. So we know the rise is positive 1. And then, we move two

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:23.087
units to the right, in a positive direction. So, the run is positive 2. These

00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:27.377
direction arrows can help me associate the positive and negative signs for the

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:31.710
rise and the run. There are, of course, other ways to find the slope. If you've

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.043
found other ways to find the slope, share your thoughts on the forum. We'd love

00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:37.135
to see what you did.
