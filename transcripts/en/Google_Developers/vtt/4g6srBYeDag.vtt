00:00:02.795 --> 00:00:03.920
JOSH GORDON: Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.920
My name is Josh Gordon.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.852
I'm here for "The Developer
Show" with Sherol and Doug.

00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:10.310
So Sherol, could you tell me
a little bit about the Magenta

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.250
Project and your
role on the team?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.570
SHEROL CHEN: Yeah, so the
Magenta project is really

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.170
focused on how
machine learning has

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.086
a role in art and expressivity,
and how it can extend

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:23.210
the human creative process.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.970
So that starts with
generative models research,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.950
but then goes into
creating tools

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.630
that developers can use
to create these entry

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.575
points into using these
models for art and creativity.

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:36.950
JOSH GORDON: So
one of the things

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.450
that I think the Magenta project
has done an extraordinarily

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.080
good job of is making
reproduceable software

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.750
and demos that other
developers can try.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.480
So could you tell me about a
couple of your favorite demos

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.626
that you've released
over the past few years?

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.500
DOUGLAS ECK: Yeah, we've
done a lot of demos.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.958
I think the goal
of these demos has

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.950
been to engage the
developer community

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.567
and to bring artists, and
musicians, and creative coders

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.650
to work together with us
on these machine learning

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.400
problems.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.290
I particularly like
a project that Sherol

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.720
talked about today,
Performance RNN, which

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.210
learns how to generate
something that's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.060
half a composition and
half a performance,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.980
because all of the
nuanced velocities

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.632
and dynamics of a piano
performance are there.

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:17.090
And I really love
the new Music VAE

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.590
stuff that's coming
out, where we're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.390
able to explore an
embedding space,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.300
and some really cool
JavaScript-based tools

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.260
developed around
TensorFlow.js that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.507
turned things on for everybody.

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:32.090
And I particularly love the idea
that we have other developers

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.450
that are not Googlers taking
our JavaScript interface

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.909
and playing with
things themselves.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.366
JOSH GORDON: So I actually have
one question for you, Doug.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.690
So you talk a lot about
generative models for Magenta

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.604
in the context of art and music.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.020
What do you think
the future might

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.822
hold for generative models?

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:48.530
DOUGLAS ECK: I'm
perhaps biased because I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.150
work on this every day.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.390
But what I see is
that the overall field

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.690
of generative models is
going to sweep through

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.190
in the next decade and become
a major, major part of machine

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.840
learning research.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
I think all you have to do
is look at what we have with

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.140
Translate, end-to-end,
sequence-to-sequence-based

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.070
translation, and think, OK, we
can start to get some beautiful

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.800
nuanced translations when we
pass between, for example,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.510
English and Japanese.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.960
What can we do if we start
to generate from these models

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.810
and try to train these
models to help us write,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.300
help us do visual art, help us
communicate in different ways?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.800
Think of Smart Reply.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.590
You get that one
relevant response.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.510
Now imagine Smart
Reply, but its helping

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.060
you craft whole paragraphs.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060
It's still your message.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.314
It's still you communicating.

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:37.730
But you're seeing
machine learning

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.520
help you solve that problem.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.970
I think the future is very, very
bright for generative models.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.584
And very excited
to be part of it.

00:02:45.584 --> 00:02:47.000
JOSH GORDON: Sherol,
another thing

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.666
that I really, really
like about Magenta

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:51.200
is how easy it is to use the
demos that you've released.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.090
Can you tell me a little bit
about your Docker images,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.890
and the notebooks, and
the different demos

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.223
that are available on the
website for developers to try?

00:02:57.223 --> 00:03:00.290
SHEROL CHEN: For developers,
of course, its all in GitHub,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.460
open source.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.840
And you can contribute
to the projects as well.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.120
But there's also CoLabs.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.540
And I think CoLabs recently
released just an amazing entry

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.070
point into training and
running Magenta models.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.180
And outside of that, we have
just the demos that get built

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.620
out of it, anyone can use.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.830
So developers, artists-- you
could have no programming

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.660
experience and be
able to still explore

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.100
these generative spaces.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.016
DOUGLAS ECK: You know,
Sherol, I'd add to this

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:30.350
that the fact that a
JavaScript developer was

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.080
able to play around
with some of our tools

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.610
has led us to go full in
on developing Magenta.js

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.070
that's heavily integrated
with TensorFlow.js

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.040
and also is able
to pull in from P5

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.130
and other commonly used
tools for visualization.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.287
And I love the idea that
working with our developers,

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:53.870
even creative coders-- someone
who doesn't think of themselves

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.494
as a developer, but
they like to hack--

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:57.530
I want to see people
continue to take our ideas

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.020
and twist them around a
little bit, make something

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.280
that we didn't quite expect.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.080
And I think we're
getting much closer as we

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.290
get simpler and simpler tools
and ways to use our research

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.542
in the open source community.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.000
JOSH GORDON: And
one last question.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.583
Where is the best
place for developers

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.940
to go to learn more about
Magenta and get started?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.898
SHEROL CHEN: All right.

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:17.531
This is where you go.

00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:21.110
You go to G.co/Magenta.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.700
And you'll find
everything there--

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.760
blog posts, references
to publications.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.960
The demos themselves
will be linked there.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.270
And finally, last but not least,
the Magenta discussion group,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.400
where we want to
really cultivate

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.699
open community for people
to share things they do.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.240
Whether they're
using Magenta or not,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.580
we want to really tap
into the creative space

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.490
because we know creativity
is an important part

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.740
of the human existence.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.420
And we want to see
more of that and how

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.659
technology can promote that.

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.450
JOSH GORDON: That's a
great answer, Sherol.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.480
And I like the
DevRel enthusiasm.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.552
So again, Doug and Sherol,
thank you very much.

00:04:55.552 --> 00:04:57.260
I'm Josh Gordon for
"The Developer Show."

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.950
This has been great.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.200
Thanks very much for watching.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.840
