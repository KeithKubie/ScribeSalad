JASON SILVA: So you hear
people complain these days

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.040
that everything is
becoming automated.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.590
The robots are
stealing our jobs.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.070
AI is coming, the
Terminator scenario.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.530
But I think that ultimately
people don't really

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.230
have a reason to be scared.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.170
Because I think that what
artificial intelligence

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.590
ultimately comes down
to, what outsourcing

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.810
our cognition into the
machines is really all about,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.730
it's about amplifying the
most powerful phenomenon

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.000
in the universe,
which is intelligence.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.730
We're finally learning to
reverse-engineer, distill,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.360
understand, reproduce
intelligence.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.099
Once we can create
sentience that is not

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.370
bound by the bandwidth of our
physicality, of our biology,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.720
we will literally be
creating a sentience

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.420
that can upgrade itself.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.930
Minds that create minds.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.130
Computers that build
better computers.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.430
And at this point,
the runaway train

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.435
that literally is speeding
up at an exponential rate,

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:23.460
will leave everything behind.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.150
The human era will have ended.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.650
We will have become
our creations.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.110
They will be our children,
but they will really be us.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.880
There is no reason to fear this.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.940
This is just evolution.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.540
