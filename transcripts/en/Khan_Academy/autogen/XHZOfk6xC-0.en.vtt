00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.530
 
for unit squares each have four-fifths

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540
for unit squares each have four-fifths
 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.510
for unit squares each have four-fifths
of their area shaded and we see that

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520
of their area shaded and we see that
 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.000
of their area shaded and we see that
here if we had this whole thing shaded

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
here if we had this whole thing shaded
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339
here if we had this whole thing shaded
in that would be a whole but we only

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
in that would be a whole but we only
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.200
in that would be a whole but we only
have four fifths of it shaded and it

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
have four fifths of it shaded and it
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.620
have four fifths of it shaded and it
split up into five equal sections and

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630
split up into five equal sections and
 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.140
split up into five equal sections and
four-fifths are shaded in so this is 1/5

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
four-fifths are shaded in so this is 1/5
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.700
four-fifths are shaded in so this is 1/5
that's another fifth that's another

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
that's another fifth that's another
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.590
that's another fifth that's another
fifth and that's another fifth so we

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
fifth and that's another fifth so we
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.859
fifth and that's another fifth so we
have four-fifths shaded in and we have

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
have four-fifths shaded in and we have
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.650
have four-fifths shaded in and we have
these four fifths four times so you

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
these four fifths four times so you
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570
these four fifths four times so you
could view this entire shaded area as

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
could view this entire shaded area as
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.410
could view this entire shaded area as
four times four fifths so all of this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
four times four fifths so all of this
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.930
four times four fifths so all of this
all of this we could view as 4 times 4/5

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
all of this we could view as 4 times 4/5
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850
all of this we could view as 4 times 4/5
well what is this going to be what is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
well what is this going to be what is
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.400
well what is this going to be what is
the total area that is shaded and I

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
the total area that is shaded and I
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.779
the total area that is shaded and I
encourage you to pause the video and try

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
encourage you to pause the video and try
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.209
encourage you to pause the video and try
to think about it well each of these

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
to think about it well each of these
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340
to think about it well each of these
bars this right over there

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
bars this right over there
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.819
bars this right over there
that is fifth we've already seen that if

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
that is fifth we've already seen that if
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260
that is fifth we've already seen that if
you took a whole you split into five

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
you took a whole you split into five
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630
you took a whole you split into five
equal sections one of those sections is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
equal sections one of those sections is
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819
equal sections one of those sections is
going to be 1/5 that's 1/5 right over

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
going to be 1/5 that's 1/5 right over
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.580
going to be 1/5 that's 1/5 right over
there so how many fifths are shaded in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
there so how many fifths are shaded in
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.979
there so how many fifths are shaded in
well that's let me do this in a color

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
well that's let me do this in a color
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.130
well that's let me do this in a color
you can see this is 1 and I didn't

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
you can see this is 1 and I didn't
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.940
you can see this is 1 and I didn't
switch the colors this is 1 2/5 3/5 4/5

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950
switch the colors this is 1 2/5 3/5 4/5
 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.770
switch the colors this is 1 2/5 3/5 4/5
5/5 6/5 7/5 8/5 9 fifths 10 fifths

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
5/5 6/5 7/5 8/5 9 fifths 10 fifths
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.510
5/5 6/5 7/5 8/5 9 fifths 10 fifths
eleven fifths 12 fifths 13 fifths 14

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
eleven fifths 12 fifths 13 fifths 14
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520
eleven fifths 12 fifths 13 fifths 14
fifths 15 fifths 16 fifths we have 16

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
fifths 15 fifths 16 fifths we have 16
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190
fifths 15 fifths 16 fifths we have 16
fifths sage shaded in so what is the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
fifths sage shaded in so what is the
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.990
fifths sage shaded in so what is the
total area that is shaded we can say 16

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000
total area that is shaded we can say 16
 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.130
total area that is shaded we can say 16
16 fifths are shaded in or 16 v square

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
16 fifths are shaded in or 16 v square
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010
16 fifths are shaded in or 16 v square
units where hole would be one square

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
units where hole would be one square
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.280
units where hole would be one square
unit but we we have 16 fifths of the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
unit but we we have 16 fifths of the
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980
unit but we we have 16 fifths of the
square units actually shaded in let's do

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
square units actually shaded in let's do
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.760
square units actually shaded in let's do
another example what is two thirds of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
another example what is two thirds of
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.420
another example what is two thirds of
six well we have six triangles here and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
six well we have six triangles here and
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.830
six well we have six triangles here and
you can see that they're giving us a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
you can see that they're giving us a
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.990
you can see that they're giving us a
little hint and they've divided into

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
little hint and they've divided into
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.209
little hint and they've divided into
thirds they've divided into three equal

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
thirds they've divided into three equal
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.670
thirds they've divided into three equal
groups notice that's one equal group

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
groups notice that's one equal group
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.550
groups notice that's one equal group
that is two equal groups and that is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
that is two equal groups and that is
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.839
that is two equal groups and that is
three equal groups

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
three equal groups
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.990
three equal groups
so each third so each of these thirds

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
so each third so each of these thirds
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.370
so each third so each of these thirds
this is one-third

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
this is one-third
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.160
this is one-third
of six we see that one third of six is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
of six we see that one third of six is
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.090
of six we see that one third of six is
two but we want two-thirds of six so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
two but we want two-thirds of six so
 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.070
two but we want two-thirds of six so
that's going to be two of these groups

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
that's going to be two of these groups
 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.010
that's going to be two of these groups
of one-third so that's one group of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
of one-third so that's one group of
 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.080
of one-third so that's one group of
one-third of six and that's another

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090
one-third of six and that's another
 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.400
one-third of six and that's another
third of six one third of six so if you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
third of six one third of six so if you
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.810
third of six one third of six so if you
took both of these together you're going

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
took both of these together you're going
 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.290
took both of these together you're going
to have two thirds of six and we see

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300
to have two thirds of six and we see
 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.850
to have two thirds of six and we see
that that is one two three four

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
that that is one two three four
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.900
that that is one two three four
triangles so that is four triangles

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
triangles so that is four triangles
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.250
triangles so that is four triangles
let's do another one

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
let's do another one
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.750
let's do another one
and this one's a little bit more

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
and this one's a little bit more
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.670
and this one's a little bit more
interesting what is 5/8 of 4 and we have

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
interesting what is 5/8 of 4 and we have
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.040
interesting what is 5/8 of 4 and we have
drawn here four holes this is a hole

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
drawn here four holes this is a hole
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.690
drawn here four holes this is a hole
this is a hole this is a hole and that's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
this is a hole this is a hole and that's
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.610
this is a hole this is a hole and that's
a hole and we see that they're split

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
a hole and we see that they're split
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.290
a hole and we see that they're split
each of the holes is split in two

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300
each of the holes is split in two
 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.520
each of the holes is split in two
so this is one half this is another one

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
so this is one half this is another one
 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.370
so this is one half this is another one
half this is one half that's another 1/2

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380
half this is one half that's another 1/2
 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.130
half this is one half that's another 1/2
that's one half that's another 1/2

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
that's one half that's another 1/2
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.640
that's one half that's another 1/2
that's 1/2 that's another 1/2 now why do

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
that's 1/2 that's another 1/2 now why do
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.520
that's 1/2 that's another 1/2 now why do
they do this why did they give us a hint

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
they do this why did they give us a hint
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.120
they do this why did they give us a hint
what we see that each half is actually

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130
what we see that each half is actually
 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.480
what we see that each half is actually
1/8 of the entire four holes what am I

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490
1/8 of the entire four holes what am I
 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.140
1/8 of the entire four holes what am I
talking about

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
talking about
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.480
talking about
well if I were to take all of these four

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490
well if I were to take all of these four
 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.770
well if I were to take all of these four
holes and if I were to divide them into

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
holes and if I were to divide them into
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.250
holes and if I were to divide them into
each in into 8 equal sections this is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
each in into 8 equal sections this is
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.200
each in into 8 equal sections this is
one of the eight equal sections right

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210
one of the eight equal sections right
 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.600
one of the eight equal sections right
over here it just happens to be half of

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610
over here it just happens to be half of
 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.380
over here it just happens to be half of
a hole so if I'm talking about so one

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390
a hole so if I'm talking about so one
 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.970
a hole so if I'm talking about so one
way to think about it is if I say 1/8 of

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980
way to think about it is if I say 1/8 of
 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.120
way to think about it is if I say 1/8 of
4 that's going to be equal to 1/2 you

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
4 that's going to be equal to 1/2 you
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.310
4 that's going to be equal to 1/2 you
see it here we have four holes and if I

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320
see it here we have four holes and if I
 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.810
see it here we have four holes and if I
were to divide that into 8 equal

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820
were to divide that into 8 equal
 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.330
were to divide that into 8 equal
sections that would mean taking each

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
sections that would mean taking each
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.730
sections that would mean taking each
hole and dividing it into 2 so 1/2 is

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740
hole and dividing it into 2 so 1/2 is
 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.490
hole and dividing it into 2 so 1/2 is
1/8 of 4 but that's not what they're

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500
1/8 of 4 but that's not what they're
 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650
1/8 of 4 but that's not what they're
asking us they're asking what's 5/8 of 4

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660
asking us they're asking what's 5/8 of 4
 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.640
asking us they're asking what's 5/8 of 4
so this is 1/8 this is 2 this is 2

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650
so this is 1/8 this is 2 this is 2
 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.000
so this is 1/8 this is 2 this is 2
eights this is 3/8 this is 4 8 this is

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
eights this is 3/8 this is 4 8 this is
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.670
eights this is 3/8 this is 4 8 this is
5/8 so what is that going to be all

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
5/8 so what is that going to be all
 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.770
5/8 so what is that going to be all
together so I just want to remind you

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
together so I just want to remind you
 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930
together so I just want to remind you
because it's a little confusing I'm

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940
because it's a little confusing I'm
 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.550
because it's a little confusing I'm
saying eighths and halves and all that

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
saying eighths and halves and all that
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.190
saying eighths and halves and all that
remember 1/8 of 4 is 1/2 so to let me

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200
remember 1/8 of 4 is 1/2 so to let me
 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.960
remember 1/8 of 4 is 1/2 so to let me
shade this in I'm gonna do this with a

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970
shade this in I'm gonna do this with a
 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.900
shade this in I'm gonna do this with a
different color so 1/8 of 4

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910
different color so 1/8 of 4
 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.450
different color so 1/8 of 4
lighter color so 1/8 of 4 is 1/2 2

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460
lighter color so 1/8 of 4 is 1/2 2
 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.060
lighter color so 1/8 of 4 is 1/2 2
eights is 2 halfs 3/8 is three halves

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070
eights is 2 halfs 3/8 is three halves
 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.510
eights is 2 halfs 3/8 is three halves
four eighths is four halves and five

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520
four eighths is four halves and five
 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.440
four eighths is four halves and five
eighths five eighths is five halves so

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450
eighths five eighths is five halves so
 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.030
eighths five eighths is five halves so
I've just shaded notice I took the whole

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040
I've just shaded notice I took the whole
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.400
I've just shaded notice I took the whole
4 I divided into 8 equal sections and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410
4 I divided into 8 equal sections and
 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.370
4 I divided into 8 equal sections and
I've shaded in five of them one two

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380
I've shaded in five of them one two
 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.360
I've shaded in five of them one two
three four five now how many is that

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370
three four five now how many is that
 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.960
three four five now how many is that
total well each of those are half this

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970
total well each of those are half this
 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.280
total well each of those are half this
is let me just and this is one half this

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290
is let me just and this is one half this
 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.420
is let me just and this is one half this
is another half

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430
is another half
 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.640
is another half
that's another half that's another half

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650
that's another half that's another half
 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.740
that's another half that's another half
and that's another half so altogether I

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750
and that's another half so altogether I
 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.160
and that's another half so altogether I
have five halfs that I have shaded in so

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170
have five halfs that I have shaded in so
 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.230
have five halfs that I have shaded in so
that is five halves

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240
that is five halves
 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.250
that is five halves
let's do one more what is four-fifths of

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260
let's do one more what is four-fifths of
 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.740
let's do one more what is four-fifths of
ten and once again I encourage you to

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750
ten and once again I encourage you to
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.850
ten and once again I encourage you to
pause the video and try to think about

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860
pause the video and try to think about
 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.220
pause the video and try to think about
it well we see here on the number line

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230
it well we see here on the number line
 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.310
it well we see here on the number line
they've taken from zero to ten and they

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320
they've taken from zero to ten and they
 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.820
they've taken from zero to ten and they
have split it into five equal sections

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830
have split it into five equal sections
 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.760
have split it into five equal sections
so each of this so this right over here

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770
so each of this so this right over here
 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.470
so each of this so this right over here
this is 1/5 of 10 if you go from zero to

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480
this is 1/5 of 10 if you go from zero to
 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.980
this is 1/5 of 10 if you go from zero to
ten

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990
ten
 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.660
ten
he's right into five equal sections this

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670
he's right into five equal sections this
 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.120
he's right into five equal sections this
is 1/5 of 10 let me write that down

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130
is 1/5 of 10 let me write that down
 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:48.450
is 1/5 of 10 let me write that down
this is 1/5 of 10 right over here now

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460
this is 1/5 of 10 right over here now
 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.950
this is 1/5 of 10 right over here now
what number is that well we see that

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960
what number is that well we see that
 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.720
what number is that well we see that
that number is 2 2 is 1/5 of 10 1/5 of

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730
that number is 2 2 is 1/5 of 10 1/5 of
 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.380
that number is 2 2 is 1/5 of 10 1/5 of
10 is equal to 2 well they're not just

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390
10 is equal to 2 well they're not just
 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.030
10 is equal to 2 well they're not just
asking us 1/5 of 10 they're asking us

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040
asking us 1/5 of 10 they're asking us
 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.980
asking us 1/5 of 10 they're asking us
4/5 of 10 so this is 1/5 of 10 2/5 if we

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990
4/5 of 10 so this is 1/5 of 10 2/5 if we
 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.190
4/5 of 10 so this is 1/5 of 10 2/5 if we
go actually maybe we go this way so let

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200
go actually maybe we go this way so let
 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.860
go actually maybe we go this way so let
me do another color so this is 1/5 of 10

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870
me do another color so this is 1/5 of 10
 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.800
me do another color so this is 1/5 of 10
now we're going to go 2/5 of 10 3/5 of

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810
now we're going to go 2/5 of 10 3/5 of
 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.800
now we're going to go 2/5 of 10 3/5 of
10 and we go all the way to 4/5 of 10

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810
10 and we go all the way to 4/5 of 10
 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.440
10 and we go all the way to 4/5 of 10
which get us to this number right over

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450
which get us to this number right over
 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.870
which get us to this number right over
there now what number is that well we

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880
there now what number is that well we
 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.880
there now what number is that well we
see this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so it's

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890
see this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so it's
 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.090
see this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so it's
the number 8 so what is 4/5 of 10 it is

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100
the number 8 so what is 4/5 of 10 it is
 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.910
the number 8 so what is 4/5 of 10 it is
the number 8
