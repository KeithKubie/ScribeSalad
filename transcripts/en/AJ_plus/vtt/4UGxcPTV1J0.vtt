00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.560
What has happened in Boat Harbour is
definitely environmental racism.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.080
This happens across Canada
way too often

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.240
with our First Nations communities.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.360
And, you know a corporation
will come in and

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.440
they will do what they can to
extract the resources that they need.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.080
The Northumberland Strait is a
breeding ground for lobsters,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.600
and for herring and mackerel and rock crab,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.560
everything that our community fishes on,
right? So if we go in there and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.760
destroy the habitat for them to reproduce and that,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.120
we're generally going to be f*cked.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.640
People from the reserve, they've been
fighting this for 51 years

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.320
and it's the fishermen, the non-native fishermen,
that have been joining them.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.080
It's just this mill is no good, the pipeline,
it's gonna ruin our fishery.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.640
Yea, we all came together for a common interest.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.360
For too long they've tried to take advantage
of First Nations people,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.560
but it's going to come to a stop because First Nations
people across this nation are rising up.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.800
Go back!

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.400
Go home!

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.800
Everybody's ready.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.640
We're throwing this, trying to fall out the prop

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.960
on that survey boat right there that's coming in.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.880
It will kill our
fishing.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.960
If they don't know what the bottom's like, they
can't lay that pipeline in, right?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.240
And the only way we are going
to be able to stop this

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.520
is to stop that from surveying the ocean floor.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.440
They probably never ever thought they'd
have this much resistance.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.640
This whole area depends on fishing.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.800
It's the number one main industry
for Northern Nova Scotia.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.840
My name is Warren Patrick Francis.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.760
I belong to the Mi'kmaq tribe.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.640
I'm from Pictou Landing First Nation.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.400
I'm a self-employed fisherman.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.760
Our community has been dealing with a lot of
asthma, a lot of breathing problems,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480
and I blame it all on this plant here.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.400
We've been living for 50 years
with this garbage.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.560
Northern Pulp uses a bleaching process to
make their paper white.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.600
They have to get rid of all the stuff that
comes out of the wood,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.400
like all the discoloration and all the
heavy solubles and stuff like that.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.320
And you got to take it somewhere
to be treated,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.560
and then they got to
dump it somewhere

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.120
because it's too caustic to
run through their pipes.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.320
When the water first gets here from
the plant, it takes 28 days

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.040
to get here and to go through the whole process

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.760
and to leave into the Northumberland
Strait there.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.760
The new system they're proposing is
only gonna take a few hours

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.640
and then they're gonna pump it
straight out into the strait.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.280
The smell is horrible, I mean, ugh... I'm even
breathing through my mouth

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.280
so I don't have to smell it, but the steam
and everything that's coming off

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.480
this hot water is just... oh it's sickening.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.720
This far corner here is where our
reserve is located.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.800
And right here is Boat Harbour, where the
treated effluent goes into.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.520
It's not even a kilometer, so we've been living
with this poison all our lives.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.760
We've shot deer and rabbits and then
when we go to gut them we find lumps in them.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.920
So we sent them to DNR for testing
and they're full of cancers.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.480
We're gonna check the clarity of the water.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.760
This is where the outfall for Boat Harbour [is],
which treats Nothern Pulp's effluent.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.840
This goes out into the Northumberland Strait.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.480
And it's stuff like this that's going
to be going into the strait.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.800
And that water isn't very clean.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.120
You can see it's even purple there.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.040
There's two families in there
that fish.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.640
And this is where our fisheries manager
lives and his wife fishes.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.040
And the other guy, he works for my
brother in fishing.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.960
He's employed by fishing.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.040
This fight isn't just with the fishermen,
it's with our community as well.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.720
And this is the leader of our community, Chief
Andrea Paul, which is my sister,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.960
and she's the voice of our people.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.120
Because we've dealt with this
for such a long time,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.680
trust is such a big word.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.000
In the community, people don't trust the water.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.480
So a lot of people won't drink out of
their taps because they're worried that,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.120
you know, maybe there's
contamination in our water.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.120
People don't trust the air. And then
there's the trust of the soil.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.480
If I plant a garden, is it safe to eat?
And that's been a huge one.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.520
Traditionally, that's what people did, right?

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.400
We planted food, we fished, we hunted
and we gathered our traditional medicines.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.760
All of those were taken
away from us.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.760
They had farms and everything else and
everybody shared the work

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.400
and everybody shared the profits.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.600
We were strong, healthy people.
Now, we're all full of cancer and whatnot.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.000
And there's a lot of people that have
died from it already, eh?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.280
But there's nothing that says
it's because of the mill.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.920
There's been no proof of it.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.040
The mill is way over there and

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.600
why did they decide all of a sudden to put the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.240
pipe all the way down to the reserve?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.040
It's not a coincidence,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.440
they just have no respect for Native people.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.080
It's been a struggle for our community
for such a long time.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.320
My people never had a voice.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.760
Every time an elder passes, or a
community member passes,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.440
that's another person that doesn't
get to see the end result.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:53.120
We fish lobsters, herring, mackerel,
rock crab, scallops, snow crab.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.480
Garbage.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.320
Fishing, it's not only a job,
it's a way of life.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.800
You know, it's something we love doing.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.560
We love getting up every morning and going fishing.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.840
Without the fishing industry, you know, it would
be a ghost town around here.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.880
All our money we make, we spend local.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.280
In the mill, their profits,
they go overseas.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.960
We're not backing down, and
we'll keep fighting right to the end.
