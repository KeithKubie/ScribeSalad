00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:18.677
So we live in what I think of as a CSI age

00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:20.319
where we take for granted

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.894
that scientists are going to work together with the police,

00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:25.188
help them solve crimes,

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:26.565
map fingerprints,

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:27.990
analyze poisons,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.267
but in fact, this is really a very new idea.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.330
We only actually started training scientists and forensics

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.831
in this country in the 1930s.

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.607
So as a writer interested in chemistry,

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:41.071
what I wondered was,

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:44.908
"What was it like before scientists knew

00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:47.444
how to tease a poison out of a corpse,

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:49.954
before you could actually catch a killer that way?"

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:51.405
And it won't surprise you to learn

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:53.917
that the answer is pretty dangerous.

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:58.188
And in fact, in 1918, New York City issued a report

00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:01.065
admitting that smart poisoners could operate

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:04.332
with impunity in the city.

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:08.529
This is a 1918 crime scene photo from Brooklyn,

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:12.569
and at this time, the coroner system was so corrupt

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.233
that you could literally buy your cause of death.

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:18.676
Often coroners didn't even show up at crime scenes.

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:22.018
And if you go back and you look at the death certificates of the time,

00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:23.878
I found one that read,

00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:27.672
"Could be an auto accident or possibly diabetes."

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:33.291
And another, which involved a man who shot himself in the head,

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.658
said, "ruptured aneurysm".

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:39.331
So you find, not surprisingly, the police saying,

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.942
"We're going to look a lot smarter

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:45.146
if we stay away from the science side of the story."

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.068
But, in 1918 New York City appointed

00:01:48.068 --> 00:01:51.319
the first trained medical examiner it ever had.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.492
That's the gentleman sitting down there.

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:57.245
And he hired the first forensic toxicologist ever

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:59.389
attached to an American city.

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:00.992
And together, these two men,

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:03.483
Charles Norris, the medical examiner,

00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:05.922
and Alexander Gettler, the chemist sitting next to him,

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:10.075
rewrote the rules of crime detection in this country.

00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:14.393
And that wasn't easy because poisons were everywhere.

00:02:14.393 --> 00:02:17.524
If we take this one, arsenic trioxide,

00:02:17.524 --> 00:02:22.385
arsenic trioxide's probably the most famous homicidal poison in history

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:24.558
and it was in every home.

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:28.017
Anyone could go to the grocery store or the pharmacy and buy it.

00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:30.237
It was in every kitchen because,

00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:33.035
believe it or not, it was used to color food.

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:34.931
It was in medicines

00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:37.827
and it was in cosmetics

00:02:37.827 --> 00:02:41.314
in ways that prevented people from really understanding

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:43.416
how dangerous these poisons were

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:45.172
or how they worked.

00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:48.371
Now, scientists had in the 19th century

00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:52.615
begun developing tests to look for poisons in corpses.

00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:56.674
But as this cartoon shows you of the first test for arsenic,

00:02:56.674 --> 00:02:59.682
these were very primitive tests,

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:03.884
so, that our heroes really have to figure this out

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:06.253
as they go in the 1920s.

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:09.625
Gettler, for instance, was the first person in the world

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:13.416
to know how to tell if someone was drunk at time of death.

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:16.299
He figured that out right about 1930

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.272
and he said later it took him 6,000 brains from the morgue

00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:24.401
to get to the point that he could get to that answer.

00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.581
And to give you a sense of what this is like,

00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:29.328
I'm going to ask you for a moment

00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:33.391
to become 1920s forensic detectives.

00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:38.947
This is a case based on one solved by Alexander Gettler in 1923,

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.108
and as you can probably tell,

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:44.374
it's a case that begins in a tenement building.

00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:49.245
This particular one was on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:51.681
And these buildings were very crowded

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:55.474
with families who had very little money.

00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:57.553
And the rooms were very poor.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:00.089
This is actually an abandoned room

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:01.708
at the Tenement House Museum

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.235
that is in Lower Manhattan today.

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:07.199
These rooms often had no electricity,

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.904
they had no hot water,

00:04:08.904 --> 00:04:10.835
and people who lived this way

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:13.200
depended on gas to fuel everything

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.786
from their stove to their electric lights.

00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:18.140
And this gas was called illuminating gas,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.864
and it was both a toxic and explosive mixture

00:04:21.864 --> 00:04:24.814
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:28.224
So you, the forensic scientist, are called

00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:30.721
to a crime scene in a tenement house.

00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:34.457
This is actually a police photo from the time in question,

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:36.758
but the story that I'm going to tell you

00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:39.128
is a little more complicated than this.

00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:43.166
Nevertheless, you're going to go into this building,

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:45.468
you're going to walk down this hall,

00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:48.137
you're going to go through the door,

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:49.511
and you're going to find yourself

00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.011
in a very shabby apartment.

00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:53.794
The floors are splintered,

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.720
the walls are peeling,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.746
there's only gas lighting,

00:04:57.746 --> 00:04:59.022
and in this case,

00:04:59.022 --> 00:05:01.210
you go into the back bedroom.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.459
There's clearly been a gas leak,

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:05.421
there's a broken fitting on the wall.

00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:07.390
The police are opening the windows,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.376
and in the bed there's the body of young woman

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:12.496
who's clearly been dead for some time

00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:13.803
because she's cold

00:05:13.803 --> 00:05:14.931
and she's stiff

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:16.378
and she's pale.

00:05:16.378 --> 00:05:20.070
And you turn to the police and you say,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.105
"No, this is not an illuminating gas death

00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:27.784
because...."

00:05:27.784 --> 00:05:30.782
Because if you're killed by carbon monoxide,

00:05:30.782 --> 00:05:34.518
there is such a powerful chemical reaction in your blood

00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:37.327
as the oxygen is muscled out of the blood stream

00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:42.326
that the blood cells are turned a bright, cherry red.

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:46.630
And this red is so strong that it flushes the skin

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.866
of the corpse a cherry pink.

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:51.044
In fact, people who see bodies

00:05:51.044 --> 00:05:53.125
after someone has died of a carbon monoxide death,

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:55.580
they'll often talk about how healthy they look.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.677
So your poor, pale corpse could not have been killed by this gas.

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:01.946
You take the body back to the morgue,

00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:03.654
you run more blood tests,

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:06.417
and you find another gas at extremely high levels,

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:08.650
carbon dioxide.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.431
And what does that tell you?

00:06:11.584 --> 00:06:13.609
If you think about the way we breath,

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:15.006
we inhale oxygen,

00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:16.520
we exhale carbon dioxide,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.676
but what if you can't exhale?

00:06:18.676 --> 00:06:20.941
What if that gas can't get out?

00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:23.248
It backs up into your lungs,

00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:27.785
and the number one clue of a suffocation or a strangulation

00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:30.956
is elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:34.164
And in fact, what they found

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:36.460
when they took a closer look at the body

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.169
were the bruise marks left by her husband's fingers

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.432
as he had held her down and suffocated her.

00:06:43.432 --> 00:06:46.220
And it turned out that he had

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.651
taken out an insurance policy on her life,

00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:51.080
suffocated her,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.185
broken the gas fitting to try to stage an accident scene,

00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:58.293
and it turned out that it was chemistry

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:01.303
that sent him to prison.

00:07:01.303 --> 00:07:04.234
There are so many good poison and murder stories

00:07:04.234 --> 00:07:07.397
from this time period that I would love to tell you.

00:07:07.397 --> 00:07:10.638
It's one of my favorite subjects obviously.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.269
But I want to leave you with this thought.

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:13.967
Two things.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:17.011
One is that case that I just described to you

00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:18.241
is one of my favorites

00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:21.507
because it's the beginning of a series of investigations

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.787
that persuade the New York police

00:07:23.787 --> 00:07:25.965
that they do need to work with scientists

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:28.275
and it lays the foundation for, in fact,

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.885
our CSI-era age,

00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:36.077
and, because it's such a good story of two very determined people,

00:07:36.077 --> 00:07:38.594
in this case two city scientists,

00:07:38.594 --> 00:07:41.194
who were able to change the world around them.

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.497
Thank you.
