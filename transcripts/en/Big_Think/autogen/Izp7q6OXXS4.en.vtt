right so why can't we get better aliens

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
right so why can't we get better aliens
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.960
right so why can't we get better aliens
and then the aliens think just like us

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
and then the aliens think just like us
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.490

to us and press tapper next to us we say
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.620
to us and press tapper next to us we say
to ourselves all nice cat cat is being

alien now on the question of

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219
alien now on the question of
 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.789
alien now on the question of
intelligence if these aliens are more

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799
intelligence if these aliens are more
 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.099
intelligence if these aliens are more
intelligent than us how would they be

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109
intelligent than us how would they be
 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.830
intelligent than us how would they be
more intelligent in the book I say that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
more intelligent in the book I say that
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.119
more intelligent in the book I say that
one of the main ingredients of

one of the main ingredients of
 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.869
one of the main ingredients of
intelligence is to predict the future

the ability to simulate today so we see

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639
the ability to simulate today so we see
 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.089
the ability to simulate today so we see
tomorrow and that requires a high level

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099
tomorrow and that requires a high level
 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.059
tomorrow and that requires a high level
of intelligence to be able to understand

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
of intelligence to be able to understand
 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.429
of intelligence to be able to understand
the laws of nature the laws of people

what is the most likely outcome of a

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959
what is the most likely outcome of a
 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.770
what is the most likely outcome of a
future event that requires intelligence

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
future event that requires intelligence
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.250
future event that requires intelligence
if they are more intelligent than us

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260
if they are more intelligent than us
 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.649
if they are more intelligent than us
they will see the future much better

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659
they will see the future much better
 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.830
they will see the future much better
than us they will see outcomes that we

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
than us they will see outcomes that we
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.869
than us they will see outcomes that we
cannot foresee they will simulate

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879
cannot foresee they will simulate
 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.030
cannot foresee they will simulate
scenarios that we cannot even dream of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
scenarios that we cannot even dream of
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.039
scenarios that we cannot even dream of
they can outwit us every time think of a

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049
they can outwit us every time think of a
 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:04.970

safecracker

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
safecracker
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.300
safecracker
a safecracker may have a low IQ may have

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
a safecracker may have a low IQ may have
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.530
a safecracker may have a low IQ may have
dropped out of elementary school but the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
dropped out of elementary school but the
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.409
dropped out of elementary school but the
safecracker can simulate the future much

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419
safecracker can simulate the future much
 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.439
safecracker can simulate the future much
better than a cop can and that's why he

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449
better than a cop can and that's why he
 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.530
better than a cop can and that's why he
can rob banks and get away with it so in

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
can rob banks and get away with it so in
 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.899
can rob banks and get away with it so in
other words the criminal mind is not

other words the criminal mind is not
 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.020
other words the criminal mind is not
necessarily stupid because it has low IQ

it's quite well adapted for what it does
 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.189
it's quite well adapted for what it does
and what it does is to simulate the

and what it does is to simulate the
 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.909
and what it does is to simulate the
future of a crime now think of what when

future of a crime now think of what when
 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.089
future of a crime now think of what when
we encounter intelligent life that is

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099
we encounter intelligent life that is
 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.490
we encounter intelligent life that is
more intelligent than us they may see

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500
more intelligent than us they may see
 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.559
more intelligent than us they may see
the world totally differently their

world may be a world of smells a world
 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.699
world may be a world of smells a world
of sounds rather than a world of

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709
of sounds rather than a world of
 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.830

eyesight like our brain is constructed
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.800
eyesight like our brain is constructed
and most important they may be able to

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810
and most important they may be able to
 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.830
and most important they may be able to
see the outcome of future events much

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840
see the outcome of future events much
 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.170
see the outcome of future events much
better than us they'll be able to

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180
better than us they'll be able to
 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.800
better than us they'll be able to
actually run circles around us because

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810
actually run circles around us because
 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.340
actually run circles around us because
they see the future

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350
they see the future
 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.410
