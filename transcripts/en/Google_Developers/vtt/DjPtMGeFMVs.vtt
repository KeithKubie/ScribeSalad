PAUL MATTHEWS: Hello.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.985
I'm Paul Matthews.

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:15.670
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer on the AdWords API.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.991
MARK BOWYER: And I'm Mark
Bowyer, a Developer Advocate

00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:19.240
on the same team.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.220
PAUL MATTHEWS: We're going
to talk to you

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.580
about the AdWords API.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.290
And in particular, we're going
to talk to you about how to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.570
start with the AdWords API.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.800
So this is really taking a fresh
look if you're maybe new

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.120
to the API or if there's just
some aspects of the API that

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.370
you don't currently
understand.

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:37.130
MARK BOWYER: Please keep in
mind that you can scroll

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.240
backwards and forwards through
this as often as you want.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.880
We put title slides in here, so
you can easily find the bit

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.980
that you want to find--

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.440
loads of links over the top of
this that you can click on to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.460
go and see the reference
material

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.390
we're telling you about.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.110
And just come back to us when
you've read up on what you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.996
need to know and find out
about the next bit.

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:55.230
PAUL MATTHEWS: So in this
session, we're going to look

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.420
at what the AdWords API is,
how you might go about

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.420
interacting with it, how to
create a first request--

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.390
so how to build up that
first request and make

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.910
a call to our service.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.810
We're going to look at the
reporting aspects of the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.890
AdWords API, tools that surround
the AdWords API, and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740
then we're going to look at
the manual, which is the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.260
really important part for
understanding the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.500
documentation that's
available to you.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.760
And finally, we're going to
look at how we support the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.040
AdWords API and how that can be
useful to you, and how to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.720
contact us.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.270
MARK BOWYER: So what is it?

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.720
And what can you do with it?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.600
Well, AdWords is for managing
your adverts on either Google

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.480
Search or Display Network.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.990
Optimizing your ads, getting
ad ideas to come up with an

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.880
extension of what you're already
doing in your ads.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.810
And then we give you a web
interface for users to go in,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.995
set up their ads, line up the
text for it, add anything that

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:52.535
they want on to there,
and then set them

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:54.130
up to go and serve.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.870
Then once you know what you're
doing with your ads, you may

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.260
want to automate or grow the way
that you're managing it.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.485
And we provide an API, so you
have programmatic interaction

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:05.080
with your ads.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.530
And also, you can integrate the
data within your ads to,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.140
say, your own software that
you already have managing

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.390
other parts of your business.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.610
PAUL MATTHEWS: So that's what
the AdWords API is.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.500
Now, what can you do with it?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.400
Well, for starting off, the main
use that you're going to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.540
use the AdWords API
for is retrieval.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.140
So that means that you can get
all your information that's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.690
currently stored in AdWords--
all those campaigns, all those

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.630
accounts, all those ad groups
and criteria that you've set

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.540
up with it.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.330
And you can get that information
back so that you

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.370
can keep a local store of it
for whatever purposes.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.680
Then you can use the AdWords API
to manage those entities.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.440
So basically, you can interact
with your ads.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.050
You can interact with
your campaigns.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.210
You can interact with your
criteria and really affect how

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.290
your ads are displayed.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.800
You can adjust your bidding so
that you can up your bids, or

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.370
adjust it so that you're getting
more effective bidding

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.680
strategies.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.220
You can adjust your targeting.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.370
So you make sure that you're
really finely tuning your ads

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.140
to the right people.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.320
And finally, you can update
your ad text.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.600
With all of that, you can
also do bulk uploads.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.680
So if you're considering putting
in a lot of new ads

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.230
into the system or doing a lot
of mutations to your campaigns

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.970
and things, then you can
do that using the API.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.470
And you can bulk upload that.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.600
And finally, you can do
keyword research.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.090
So that means if you know
roughly what sort of keywords

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.250
you want to target, but you're
not exactly sure of the entire

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.990
landscape the other keywords
are maybe associated to it,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.170
then you can do some keyword
research, which can offer you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.360
some really good alternatives.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.870
So the main purpose of the
API is automation.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.450
This is for you to automatically
interact with

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.600
our services without having to
have a user sit there and do

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.780
anything with them.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.990
So for instance, you might use
some sort of script that would

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.440
automatically adjust your bids
on your umbrellas if today was

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.960
a wet day and you knew that
customers were more likely to

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.120
buy on a wet day.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.579
You can also do updates
across your account.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.290
So if, for instance, you wanted
to update all of your

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.150
bids globally to outbid your
competitors, then you would be

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.880
able to just do an automatic
up-bid of

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.750
10% more, for instance.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.870
It also allows you to hook
in to your applications.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.340
So if you happen to have,
let's say, an e-commerce

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.670
platform, and you wanted to
hook your ads into your

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.150
inventory management, then
perhaps you could set up a

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.050
link between the two
applications so that when you

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.930
run out of inventory of
something, you would turn off

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.910
an advertisement.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.100
Or as you got more inventory,
you would up your ads to make

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.960
more of a presence on that
to improve your return on

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.290
investment.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.890
And then finally, you can do
a lot of reporting with the

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.670
AdWords API.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.580
So what that means is it allows
you to collect reports

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.790
for your account-- so, for
instance, things like

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.790
impressions.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.100
And you can really retrieve a
lot of information on how your

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.210
ads are doing.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.020
It'll also allow you to gather
all of your information in a

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.120
structured way very
simply and easily.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.255
But more on that later.

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:22.490
MARK BOWYER: So how
do you use it?

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.040
PAUL MATTHEWS: So for starters,
the main concepts

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.385
you want to understand are the
entities and the services.

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:31.910
And more on services
in a second.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.890
But right now, we're going
to look at the entities.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.510
So, entities are concepts that
should be pretty familiar with

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.800
you at this point in time.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.280
So, for instance, Customer.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.120
That's you.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.740
That's how you log in.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.710
You've got your ad groups.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.220
So that's the groups of ads.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.550
You've got your ads themselves,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.800
campaigns, and criteria.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.730
So these are entities that
live within our system.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.800
And then the services
allow you to

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.080
interact with those entities.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.350
So, for instance, if we have a
look at the campaign service,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.890
then that will allow
you to interact

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.440
with a campaign entity.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.070
So, for instance, if you wanted
to retrieve information

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.760
about the current campaigns
that are already in your

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.100
AdWords accounts, then you could
use a selector object

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.340
sent to the get action on
the campaign service.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.445
And it'll allow you to retrieve
information about

00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:18.840
your campaigns.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.420
Then you can do operations.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.450
So once you've got this
information, then perhaps you

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.870
want to adjust this
information--

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.940
for instance, adjusting your
ad text or adjusting your

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.660
campaign targeting.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.570
And basically, you send an
operation object to the mutate

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.370
action of the service
that allows

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.230
you to affect a campaign.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.820
And finally, you
can do queries.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.240
So this is back to reporting.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.590
And we'll talk more about
this later on.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.170
But essentially, you don't need
to send an object to the

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.230
query action.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.700
It's more of just a string.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.860
So it's a very simple interface
for you there.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.090
And that's the main sort of
strategy you're going to see

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.662
with any service in
the AdWords API.

00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:01.860
MARK BOWYER: So then SOAP.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.790
SOAP stands for Simple Object
Access Protocol.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.060
And this is the text language
that is used to pass the

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.030
information from your code back
to our back end and then

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.320
from our back end back to you.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.660
It's an XML-based form protocol
for exchanging

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.880
structured information backwards
and forwards between

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.030
our two sets of code.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.220
What does it look like?

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.570
Well, you can do discovery.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.145
There is WSDL, which is Web
Service Definition Language.

00:07:28.145 --> 00:07:30.710
You do a request on to our
service-- you will find this

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.180
on the documentation pages--

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.750
that tells you what each service
looks like and what

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.740
you can do to it.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.910
The SOAP request itself
comes in an envelope.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.410
It has a header, which then has
your authentication and

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.050
your authorization information,
and a body, which

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.710
is the request that you're
trying to make on our service.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.950
You will then get back a
response that's formatted in a

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.200
similar way.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.540
Finally, we give you logging
and debugging tools.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.440
So you can switch on inside
your code using the client

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.430
library's logging system that
stores in files each of the

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.960
requests you make in the
original SOAP and the SOAP

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.350
response you get back.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.740
And you can look through those
and try and figure out what's

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.630
just gone wrong for you.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.160
Also, because these are just
plain text files, you can just

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.980
send the XML to our servers
using something

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.240
as simple as cURL.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.570
So you can do it from
the command line.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.850
Or you can write a shell script
to try and test out

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.100
these files.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.120
PAUL MATTHEWS: So that brings us
on to the client libraries.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.500
And this is really where we
try and help you integrate

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.230
with our API.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.159
So these are libraries that have
been written by Googlers

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:37.630
that really aid your integration
with our services.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.130
For starters, they're available
in most of the

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.980
common languages, such as
Java, Python, Ruby,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.542
.NET, PHP, and Perl.

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:49.170
And they're all written in a
very clear, defined way for

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.040
those languages.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.010
So they should become very
familiar for you.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.420
They are auto-generated.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.110
As Mark was talking about
before, the WSDLs offer a

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.590
description of the services.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.440
So these client libraries are in
a good proportion generated

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.940
based on the WSDLs available.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.110
So that means that they offer
objects that closely map to

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.680
the API as first world objects
within your application.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.770
They come with a load of
utilities that really help you

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.110
to make the most out of the API
with writing the minimum

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.040
possible code.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.670
So, for instance, we take
care of things,

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.630
like OAuth2 for you.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.530
We try and make just the code
you have to write-- just the

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.370
logic you need to interact
with our services.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.820
They also come with utilities
such as safe logging, which

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.750
means that when you do want to
log a request, if you're

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.680
trying to understand what's
going on, or if you just

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.720
happen to want to log every
request, then we try and

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.170
smudge out the sensitive parts
so that there's no worry about

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.240
anything that's being logged.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.500
And then, most importantly, the
client libraries come with

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.900
some really helpful examples.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.540
Now, these examples will help
to teach you how to use the

00:09:53.540 --> 00:10:02.160
APIs in discreet ways to make
requests and get responses.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.570
And the examples come
in two parts.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.140
So there's the simple examples,
which are really

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.850
focusing on how to make a single
request to a service

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.520
and back again.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.790
And they cover most
of the endpoints--

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.330
certainly the most
popular ones.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.760
And they show you how to
construct a request and send

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.570
it to the services and how
to process the response.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.550
And then there's the advanced
examples, which cover slightly

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.550
more in-depth.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.400
They sort of go over a bunch of
different services to help

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.020
you achieve a bigger
objective.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.690
So, for instance, if you wanted
to interact with the

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.930
feed services, there's about
four different endpoints--

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.070
four different services
you want to talk to.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.800
And this shows you how to
construct a request talking to

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.130
each of those services to link
them all together and to

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.240
interact and create a feed.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.740
And they're very worthwhile.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.490
And there are examples in each
of the client libraries.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.588
And they're definitely
worth a look.

00:10:48.588 --> 00:10:50.950
MARK BOWYER: So MCCs, developer

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.370
tokens, and test accounts.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.220
Now, MCC stands for My Client
Center, which is a tool for

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.000
larger advertisers so they can
manage multiple client

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.200
customer accounts that would
normally be seen in AdWords.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.270
So with an MCC account, you
can see the many client

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.050
advertiser accounts.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.960
But you can also have
sub-MCC accounts.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.760
And you can therefore have a
hierarchy of managers over

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.240
account managers and each having
different levels of

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.660
access over different numbers
of advertisers.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.220
Developer tokens are there to
grant your application access

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.770
to the AdWords system.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.410
This is just for the
application.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.730
This isn't how you access
as a log in

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.800
specific areas of AdWords.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.900
You get one in your
AdWords account.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.250
And you use it with
every request that

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.020
you send in to AdWords.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.210
It's in the header.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.280
Whether you're doing any SOAP
endpoint-- any reporting--

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.060
you need to have a developer
token in there to authenticate

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.110
that this application is allowed
to make this request.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.990
The client libraries do some of
the leg work here for you.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.500
So you can just put your
developer token into your

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.300
properties file, and it
will try and do the

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.716
rest of that for you.

00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:10.450
You need to apply for the
developer token and have

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.390
approval of it.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.570
As you go on through the process
of developing your

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.470
application, you will need
to have a fully approved

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.790
developer token for your
application to have full

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.730
access to live data
in AdWords.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.670
And that process requires you
to go through a compliance

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.780
test with our terms
and conditions.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.340
And it is, please remember, tied
to the application and

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.600
not to you logging into the
system as an account.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.390
Say, it's authorizing your
application, whereas you have

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.470
other login information for
saying where you're allowed to

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.635
view with your application.

00:12:42.635 --> 00:12:45.450
PAUL MATTHEWS: I guess also
on that point, we strongly

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.340
recommend that you do not give
your developer token to

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.010
anybody else.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.580
Because if that does happen,
then it will appear to us as

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.540
though you are making
these requests.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.180
So do not put it
in any forums.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.040
Do not put it in any
communications

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.470
to any other users.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.710
And try not to send it to us
over emails or anything like

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.020
that, either, just for
security's sake.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.620
So that brings us neatly
on to test accounts.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.770
Test accounts are essentially
accounts there to help you

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.930
develop your application.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.330
So they are safe accounts.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.110
They are not going to
cost you money.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.540
So you can test your
application.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.730
You can try out new API requests
to them with no fear

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.760
of any financial implications
of that.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.830
So, for instance, they won't
serve to the display networks

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.040
or to the Google network.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.010
You will just be able to
interact with them, set up

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.740
campaigns and everything the
way that you would in your

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.360
application.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.840
But then they won't serve.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.640
So this is really useful for
testing manipulation and

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.350
requests and retrieval
requests.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.000
However, for things like
reporting, though you'll get

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.860
reports back, you won't
necessarily get the useful

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.390
information there.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.580
So, for instance, they're not
going to tell you a lot of

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.800
information about what you paid
cost per click, because

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.190
essentially, they haven't
been displayed.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.810
Test accounts, again, require
a developer token.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.960
You can't just call
it a test account

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.900
without a developer token.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.210
But during the approval process,
you'll be granted a

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.410
test account should
you be successful.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.420
And then you can interact with
a test account before you

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:27.850
necessarily go ahead and create
requests that would

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.700
otherwise cost you money.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.310
So, for instance, if you wanted
to up the bids or

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.686
something like that.

00:14:31.686 --> 00:14:32.670
And there's some more

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.440
information about test accounts.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.930
We strongly recommend
you go to that link.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.991
MARK BOWYER: So, reporting.

00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:41.000
PAUL MATTHEWS: So, reporting.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.660
We talked about this briefly.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.010
So basically, what reporting
offers you is performance

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:47.770
statistics.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.000
So, reporting allows you to get
information about how your

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.080
ads have been displayed during
and also ads that

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.980
have not yet displayed.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.680
So, obviously, they're going
to be coming back with much

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.000
less useful information.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.640
But they will still appear.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.910
So you'll be able to get
information about what you

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.890
paid cost per click and also how
you're spending overall.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.250
They also come with resource
statistics, or more to the

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.320
point, resource data.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.475
So, for instance, if you've got
text that you want to find

00:15:15.475 --> 00:15:17.690
out about, if you want to just
retrieve all the information

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.750
about your keywords that are
there, then you get that

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.750
information back.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.510
How you make requests on the
reporting services is two

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.020
simple ways.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.500
So, firstly, there's the SOAP
requests, as you do similar to

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.040
the other services.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.900
And they're very simple
to construct.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.565
You just construct a request,
and then you

00:15:36.565 --> 00:15:37.250
send it to our service.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.280
And we respond, in either
CSV or XML.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.570
Or you can use this tool called
AWQL, or AdWords Query

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.810
Language, which Mark is going
to talk about in a second.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.650
And the main purpose for
reporting and the main benefit

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.020
for reporting is it's
very, very fast.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.980
It's also very easy to use.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.600
So it's a really good starting
point for anybody who's trying

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.970
to get information from
their campaigns

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.380
or from their accounts.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.050
It's a really good
way to understand

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.500
the data that's available.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.470
And below is a link to the
reports and the different kind

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.620
of reports available to you and
what information you can

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.880
get from them.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.460
MARK BOWYER: So, AdWords Query
Language, or AWQL.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.740
This is a very lightweight,
SQL-like interface that allows

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.210
you to just send a string with
an SQL looking request to our

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:24.765
report systems.

00:16:24.765 --> 00:16:28.225
And that will then feed you back
the same kind of output

00:16:28.225 --> 00:16:31.380
that you would get from the
report definition system.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.420
It can be CSV.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.400
It can be XML.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.220
You can request that the file
that comes back, is gzipped up

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.900
to make it as small
as possible.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.820
We have a guide on
how to do this.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.490
And you can see that
at the link at the

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.490
bottom of this page.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.420
PAUL MATTHEWS: So now that we
know how to talk to the

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.760
reports, what are the different

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.155
uses besides the obvious?

00:16:49.155 --> 00:16:52.660
So the obvious one is maybe
requesting performance

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.670
statistics-- so, getting
information about how your ads

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:02.140
are displaying, what your CPC
is and that sort of thing.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.099
So the other main use for
reporting is to get structural

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:05.640
information.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.280
So if you're trying to build a
local representation of your

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.950
ads, of your campaigns, of all
those different entities, then

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.420
quite often, you can find
that the reports are

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.589
there to help you.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.780
So they're very quick.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.520
And they respond.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.030
And they're very easy to
integrate with, so you can get

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.800
a full account overview
very quickly.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.130
And you can store that perhaps
locally and do processing on

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.870
it and use it for other means.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.150
Then as I said before, so
monitoring performance is the

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.010
main use for reporting.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.660
MARK BOWYER: There is also a
link here to a guide on how to

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.170
gather the structural
information from reports and

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.320
build a local SQL database that
you can then run your own

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.740
requests on.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.460
PAUL MATTHEWS: So, AdWords
API scripts.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.040
So AdWords Scripts is a
really useful tool to

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.990
be used with AdWords.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.710
Essentially, it's similar to
the app script interface in

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.210
that it comes with a web IDE and
allows you to write your

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.520
scripts online, hosted
on our service.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.090
So, for instance, if you don't
currently have any

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.600
infrastructure to host an
application to request to our

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.420
service, then perhaps this is
the way forward for you.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.690
So essentially, it offers the
majority of the functionality

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.920
in a simple JavaScript
interface.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.260
But obviously, it's not
integrated with your

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:20.870
applications--

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.870
with your systems.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.630
So this is more for doing things
like, if there's an API

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.570
out there that gives you, for
instance, the weather

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.240
information, and you're a
umbrella salesman, then you

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.720
would set up a script that
perhaps would query for

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.050
weather information, find out
if it's raining, and then up

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.810
your bids because it's
a simple sort

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.990
of standalone script.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.240
And it's a really useful tool.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.360
And I highly recommend
checking it out.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.840
It's actually available inside
your accounts as they are now.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.110
You can just go to
Bulk Options.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.390
And then there's scripts
for you.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.120
And you can start to
test it there.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.290
MARK BOWYER: So, the
reference manual.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.690
Inside there, you'll initially
find information about the

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.590
client libraries that we've just
been telling you about.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.880
This also includes the source
of the examples for each of

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.350
those different languages to
show you how to use these

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.820
client libraries.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.650
Full documentation is also
there for those.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.420
Then there are the guides.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.310
These have more information
on each of the topics.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.490
Talk you through how to use
the services that are

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.940
available to do various
different use cases that you

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:32.730
may have need for to
use with AdWords.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.530
For instance, we have stuff
in there on how to use

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.410
reporting--

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.080
the structured reporting
we discussed earlier.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.500
And the scripts situation that
Paul was talking about, about

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.500
checking the weather and upping
and downing your bids

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.690
for umbrellas or maybe sun oil
or whatever to get the right

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.810
things appearing on pages
when you need them to.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.880
We're frequently adding new
guides to these as well.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.090
As new features are added to
AdWords, we write guides to

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.340
show you how to use
the new features.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.510
Then there's the reference
section, which gives you all

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.320
the information about the
services and the WSDL files

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.530
for each of those services.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.760
So you can go in, and you can
read about the objects, the

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.910
inheritance, or hierarchy, the
parameters in the return info

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.590
that are available from each
of those services, possible

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.370
error messages that you
can get from them.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.560
These work well with
the guides.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.400
Once you've got the general idea
of what you want to do,

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.800
you can dig into the reference
manuals for the services you

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.190
found out about and see
exactly what they make

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.656
available to you.

00:20:26.656 --> 00:20:29.970
There are release notes for each
of the current versions

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.760
of the API that we have out
there for you to use and also

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.650
the sunset dates.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.980
As we continually replace them
with newer and better

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.520
versions, we let you know how
long the current version is

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.010
going to last and when you're
going to need to update to a

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.680
newer release.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.980
Finally, there's a resources
section that gives you system

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.950
specific information about
each of the areas.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.310
For instance, there's migration
guides in there that

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.500
tell you what's changed from
when we released to the next--

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.150
so, what changes you need to
make to your code so that it

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.610
can run with the new
version of the API.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.000
There's also type
information--

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.020
report types--

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.350
what you can request and which
fields are available in those

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.540
reports for you to
make use of.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.800
And there are also system codes
in there-- so, various

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.070
bits of explanatory data about
how the API works.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.230
Again, there is a link at the
bottom of this page, which

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.750
will take you in to show you
those documentation pages.

00:21:23.378 --> 00:21:25.690
PAUL MATTHEWS: So we've been
talking about the AdWords API.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:26.800
But what have we actually
covered?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.910
So we discussed what the AdWords
API is and what it can

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:31.950
do for you.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.820
We discussed how you interact
with the AdWords API.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.560
And we've looked at making a
first request with the client

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.310
libraries, for instance.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.100
Then there's the reporting
aspects and what that offers

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.410
for you, and the tools, such as
AdWords scripts, and then

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.280
we've been looking at the manual
on how to make sense of

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.710
the AdWords API user manual.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.280
And now we're going to just talk
briefly about the support

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.230
that we offer and how
you can contact us.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.900
MARK BOWYER: So, there is a blog
on Blogspot specifically

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.960
about Google's Ads developer
program.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.270
There's also, of course, a
+ page that has similar

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.330
information.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.300
We have more depth on the blog
page and more news-like

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.170
information on the + page.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.170
And finally, there is a forum
where you can go meet other

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.650
people who are also working in
this area and discuss your

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.670
problems and hopefully get
fixes from the developer

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.700
program engineers like Paul.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.420
And you can discuss
any problems

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.960
you're having with them.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.620
PAUL MATTHEWS: So we hope this
video has been useful for you.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.790
We hope you come back and scrub
through it and seek

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.230
through it to find the
particular parts that are of

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.880
most use to you.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.110
And there should be plenty of
links in here that will take

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.580
you to the correct resources
within the AdWords API

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.070
documentation.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.360
And they will help you get to
where you need to go, faster.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:49.610
Thank you.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.860
MARK BOWYER: Thank you.
