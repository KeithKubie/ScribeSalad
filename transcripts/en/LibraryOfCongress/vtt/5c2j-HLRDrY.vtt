00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.200
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: To kick
us off I introduce myself.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.060
I'm Betsy Peterson,
I'm the director

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.270
of the American Folklife Center.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.820
And on behalf of
the staff I want

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.060
to welcome everyone here today.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.240
This is the latest and
actually the last event

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.030
of the fiscal year in our
Botkin Lecture series.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.350
And it's a very special
one I think.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.610
It's called Since '68: Cultural
Organizations Programming

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.790
Documentation and
Community Enrichment.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.170
And we've done a few events
throughout the year focusing

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.370
on events and movements, etc.,
related to 1968 and beyond.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.370
And so this is one of them.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.970
The Botkin series is
an opportunity for us

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.860
to present the very best
in folk life scholarship,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.400
ethnomusicology, oral history,
and other related fields.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.830
And to share them with you.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.640
It's also an opportunity for
us to enrich our own archives.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.330
All of these events
are tape recorded,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.460
or video recorded I should
say, and will make their way

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.160
into our archives and also make
their way online eventually.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.500
So with that said, please turn
off cell phones, if you would.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.350
I'd appreciate it.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.120
And one last thing, I just
want to say I'm so happy

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.270
that this is happening.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.340
We have three organizations,
nonprofits,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.160
started in the late 1960's.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.070
Icons of cultural programming
of cultural work at a time

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.780
when nonprofits were just really
kind of getting their foothold.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.590
And before the 1970's
when nonprofits,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.180
cultural nonprofits all
nonprofits exploded.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.620
It tripled, quadrupled
in the United States.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.430
These folks were
there at the beginning

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.500
and these folks were figuring
out what the templates were.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.020
Figuring out how to
work with communities

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.990
and present what they
needed and wanted.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.640
And so I'm really pleased

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.720
that we have these
organizations with us today.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.650
They deserve our thanks.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.540
And so to tell you
a little bit more

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.920
about what this is I'm going to
turn this over to John Fen now.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.090
But mainly I just
wanted to get up here

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.250
and say I think it's really
great that it's happening.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.870
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Thank
you very much, Betsy.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.760
So greetings and
welcome to everyone.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.060
My name is John Fen.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.460
I'm the head of research
and programs

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.990
for the American Folklife Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.000
I'd like to extend thanks to
all of you in the audience,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.390
all the staff at the library
who are working in support

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.920
of this event, and of
course our panelists.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.380
Across these two panels we'll
hear from individuals involved

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.590
with three cultural
organizations that launched in

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.070
or shortly thereafter 1968.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.030
Each of these organizations
anchor their activities

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.170
in community, culture,
and identity.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.250
Rooting their menus of
programs and services

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.610
in the places stories and
heritages that surrounded them.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.040
The idea for these panels
took shape via broader staff

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.250
discussions about 1968 and the
watershed of cultural activity

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.300
that emerged from that time.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.930
Noting that the Center
for Traditional Music

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.070
and Dance celebrating
its 50th year

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.390
and that Appalshop is
getting ready to do the same.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.310
We began thinking about
the roles of organizations

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.840
and what they've done in terms
of supporting cultural heritage.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.480
From documenting to presenting,
training to advocating.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.200
During the past 50 years
cultural organizations have

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.260
operated as vital resources
and spaces for communities.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.380
Such organizations have
taken a range of shapes

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.210
and the three we'll
explore today began

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.140
as an ethnic art center, a media
collective, and a bookstore.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.570
CTMD, Appalshop, and Drum
and Spear respectively.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.600
The structure of each panel
is going to be the same.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.410
We'll hear from individuals
representing the three

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.420
organizations, move into
a facilitated conversation

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.700
with across the full panel,
and then spend some time

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.280
with questions from
the audience.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.050
There will be a short break
between panels at 2:30

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.520
and then we'll come
back together at 3:00.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.980
I'll now introduce
those we've invited

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.280
to be part of the first panel.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.420
And this panel is subtitled 50
Years of Cultural Programming

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.720
and Documentation: The Center

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.520
for Traditional Music
Advance and Appalshop.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.940
From the center we have
Ethel Raim and Martin Koenig,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.440
co-founders, joined
with Peter Rushefsky,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.890
the executive director.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.080
And then from Appalshop
we have Herb E. Smith,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.380
one of the co-founders,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.320
Alexander Gibson the
current executive director.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.710
So I'm going to turn
it over to them.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.440
I'm going to stay on stage as
the timekeeper and moderator.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.500
CTMD will fill us in.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.620
So please join me in
welcoming everyone.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.110
Martin Koenig: You
know, it was --

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.550
the 60's were such a
different time in the states.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.500
I guess in the world.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.800
But here, the whole emerging art
scene really started taking off.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.900
And it is so different
from today.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.680
So for instance, the concept

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.830
of a Balkan Arts
Center occurred prior

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.020
to its technical launching.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.000
So Ethel and I are
constantly arm wrestling

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.410
about when the Balkan
Arts Center started

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.490
because there is no specific
date that it technically --

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.650
well yes, there is a technical
date, which is in 1973.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.530
That was the time that
we went to a lawyer

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.420
and they drew up the papers.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.060
But part of that is because
even the federal government just

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.990
started funding the arts
through NEA in the mid 60's.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.430
New York State started funding
in later than that, I believe,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.840
or approximately the same time.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.060
Folk arts divisions
got started even later.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.560
So it wasn't on either
my radar screen,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.690
or I think Ethel's,
anything about that.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.930
But the concept of Balkan
Arts Center started earlier.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.190
For me, I went to Bulgaria and
the Balkans to do research.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.560
I fell in love with
the dance form.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.480
And basically the first time
of the Balkan Arts Center,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.570
the first stage of
the Balkan Art Center,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:49.770
was devoted to research
and documentation,

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.660
and ultimately presentation
and publication,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.320
which is what we
basically have always done,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.240
but it was directed
towards Balkan dancing.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.630
And for that I had a 501C3,
which was Margaret Mead,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.260
the Institute for
Intercultural Studies.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.790
So is Margaret Mead who
somebody wanted to give me $200

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.310
to help me on my
research in Bulgaria.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.540
They made a contribution
to the Institute

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.440
for Intercultural Studies

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.130
and then Margaret Mead would
send me a check for $200.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.590
And that happened through 1973.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.920
And in 1973 -- or in
1972 I think it was,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:38.160
the expansion arts program from
NEA gave, not Balkan Art Center,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.460
but the Institute

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.610
for Intercultural
Studies a $5,000 grant,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.060
which was then subcontracted
to the Balkan Arts Center.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.440
And she said, "Well you've got

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.140
to form your own organization
now because your money is going

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.820
to be coming in and you're
going to expand your program."

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.240
So the first stage of the
Balkan Arts Center was devoted

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.830
towards dance.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:07.340
And I can say from the very
beginning to where it's at now

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.350
that -- and I am
no longer working

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.870
with the Balkan Arts
Center but I'd been

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.610
on the board all the way
through, which is now the CTMD.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.280
That it changed in 1970
when Ethel and I --

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.100
Ethel invited me to join
her to work with her

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.540
at the Smithsonian Institution
Festival American Folklife.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:37.570
And that was where it expanded
from dance into communities.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.830
And I had been doing five years
of field research in communities

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.510
in the Balkans, coming back
to the states and meeting

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.410
with families who were
hyphenated Americans here

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.880
in New York City,
and getting a sense

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.910
of what the communities
were here.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.820
And coming with the sense
where the organization,

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.010
from the beginning,
was about community.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.870
Was about building community.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.420
Was about strengthening
community.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.060
And the cement of all that
was the music the songs

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.150
and the dances.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:20.590
And I think those four years
between '70 and '75, '74 we --

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.490
I think would not
be an exaggeration

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.310
that we spent seven
days a week together.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.910
Sometimes up to 18 hours
a day together constantly

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.530
in these conversations.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.580
Constantly working
in different cities.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.440
Constantly working with
different families.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.160
Constantly being in
church basements.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.390
Constantly in traveling and
the Smithsonian was really

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.440
that gave us the opportunity.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.230
That festival gave us the
opportunity to develop a model

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.740
that was serviceable for the
Balkan Art Center and we took it

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.810
and we kept going with that
model in how to do this work.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.090
I think the next stage from
that would be in the late 70's

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.300
where we started doing
some tours and performances

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.260
with Jewish, Italian, Irish.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.420
And we'd be asked,
"Balkan Art Center?

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.240
What does that got
to do with me?"

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.630
And we've been struggling
with names all along the way,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.800
and that's where he came up
with the Ethnic Folk Art Center.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.160
And eventually we came
-- still trying to --

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.250
that didn't quite
say it where CTMD,

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.450
Center for Traditional
Music and Dance came in.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.100
And the next stage.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.490
So the the stage in the 70's
and early 80's, mid 80's was

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.640
that it was still dealing with
European ethnic traditions.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:49.080
And then there was a change in
the terrain that we were able

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.360
to go and work with all ethnic
communities, which is something

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.800
that we always wanted to do.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.920
But the thinking was it could
happen at that point and I think

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.550
that really represents
the center which Pete

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.690
and Ethel will talk about.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.650
That all ethnic communities
were embraced by the center

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.260
because the story is basically
the same with variations.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.420
Anyway, I just wanted to
frame it in that way .

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.080
And I think the other
interesting thing

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.490
about this is Ethel and I are
both children of immigrants.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.950
And immigrant music,
immigrant societies here,

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:34.120
we thought in the same way
politically with a small pea

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.010
to embrace and champion
those forms.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.270
And it is interesting, we were
talking last night well nobody

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.000
really worked with
that up until the 60's.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.250
So what we did with this
organization and are still doing

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:58.240
under Pete's leadership is
continuing to broaden the scope

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.860
of what's being done
and creating a model.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.580
Because there was no model for
us in the work that we did.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.710
And the reason we spent all
that time was there was nobody

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.750
to refer to and we were
creating something.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.950
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Go ahead.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.250
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: I think that --

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.070
that really is a wonderful
frame for what we did.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.400
Just concerned about the
time and 20 minutes and going

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.120
through these slides
and continuing.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.520
So how are we on time?

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.880
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: About 13 minutes.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.590
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: 13 minutes.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.120
Let's let's start
with the slides

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.200
because the slides really
tell the story visually

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.800
and give you a sense of the
communities that we worked with.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.970
The first slide, most of
the slides are by Martin,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.830
who was a marvelous
wonderful photographer.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.510
And we were incredibly
lucky that he had this skill

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.740
that he exercised the entire
time he was with the center.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.530
This is a bride in
the Albanian community

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.660
and I would assume it's in
Brooklyn even though the church

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.560
at that time was on Park
Avenue in the Bronx.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.880
So here we are at a wedding
with the bride well covered.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.180
And this is dancing.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.110
This is probably a
circumcision celebration

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.030
in the Albanian community
in Brooklyn.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.070
And so the documentation
was to really capture life

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.810
in the community, and how the
community celebrates itself,

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.750
and how they go through
the calendar year.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.370
And here's a woman outside and
this might be the Bronx now.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.980
It looks like the Bronx.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.920
I mean, you have to be
from the Bronx to know

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.620
that it looks like
from the Bronx.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.970
And I'm from the Bronx and
Martin is from the Bronx.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.300
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig:
And so is Ethel.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.600
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: I said I'm.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.320
Okay and this is
[inaudible], wonderful singer

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.490
in the Albanian community,
playing not a [inaudible],

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.550
it's the one that's larger.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.850
[Inaudible].

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:10.860
Yes. And so at this time we're
talking about the mid 70's here

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.340
through the -- just --
yeah, into the mid 70's.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.710
This is the Bonnet
Romanian group.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:22.130
Some of whom are
no longer with us.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.230
The middle man is
not with us anymore.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.890
[Inaudible], beautiful,
beautiful drummer

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.980
and person playing
music from the Bonnet.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:36.160
Which was an independent region
in the former Yugoslavia.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.700
And these musicians, the fella

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.840
with the accordion is
[inaudible], he was Serbian.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.650
And Makkah wonderful singer.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.010
And there is a [inaudible].

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.310
Not [inaudible].

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.590
[inaudible] and there's
[inaudible] at the end.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.890
They call themselves
[inaudible].

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.850
I have to tell you there were
many groups in that community

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.810
that called themselves
[inaudible], Black Pearl.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:09.030
And this is [inaudible]
if I'm not mistaken.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.510
The Macedonian piper,
beautiful musician.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.930
He was a dishwasher.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.420
This photo was in the New
York Times and he came

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.530
in with the photo and
people said, "That's you?"

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.620
So I mean, the kind
of affirmation that,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:30.610
and recognition that the
activities of the center did

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.820
with community people
was just marvelous.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.650
And this is one of our most
favorite people in the world.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.290
[Inaudible], he's no longer
with us a [inaudible].

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.510
He came in '74.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.130
Martin and I met him and we
walked into a church in Yonkers.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:54.430
And [inaudible], who was close
to six foot, wife [inaudible],

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.630
and his daughter and two sons.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.590
An elegant family
walked into the church

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.880
and they were an elegant family.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.180
Just incredible.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.840
He was a marvelous musician.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.260
Spoke Russian, and
Turkish, and Greek.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.140
And here we are with
an archival --

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.990
and was a Heritage
Award winner yes.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.590
And here's an archival
photo of Dave Terrace

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.000
on the right playing clarinet.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.540
Martin, do you remember
which band this was.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.920
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: No.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.220
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: No.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.520
Pete might know which
band it was.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.970
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky: I don't.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.290
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: Anyone
in the audience?

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.820
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky: I'm
not sure [inaudible] was.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.930
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: It is Gratz on
the drums, yeah it is Irving.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:43.150
Okay and here's Terrace when
he was -- I hate these words.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.450
Rediscovered.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.340
I mean. [inaudible]
music kind of with the --

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:54.130
with World War II and following
post war years [inaudible] was

00:16:54.130 --> 00:17:01.290
not only in decline, it
wasn't happening at all.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.630
Interestingly enough, it still
was happening in small quarters

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.690
in Europe which we
only found out,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.060
you know, in the 50's and 60's.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.790
So that was Dave coming
out of retirement.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:19.520
And that program really was
a catalyst for revival --

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.830
revitalization, a better
word, of [inaudible] music in,

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.420
actually internationally.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.720
This is [inaudible]

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.040
and a beautiful traditional
muted singer who used to perform

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.540
on the concerts that
we did with Dave.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.600
And this is [inaudible]
playing a pisco.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.920
Albanian Roma musician.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.710
And he and his brother
played together.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.270
They were marvelous,
marvelous musicians.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.910
And they were up in
Waterbury, Connecticut.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.430
And here we -- this
is when Martin talked

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:57.670
about the tour starting
about 1981.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:03.340
Was our first tour of Italian
musicians and [inaudible] worked

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.500
with us and we actually
got money

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.680
from the Italian government

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.710
to pay the artists' lost work
wages which was wonderful.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:18.460
And these are two guys from
Sicily and a guy on the right is

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.850
from Rhode Island, Angelo.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:26.470
And this is Cherish the Ladies.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.890
A very early photograph --

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.590
Eliene Ivra right there in
the middle Joni Madam right

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.920
in the back in the
center, and the dancers.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.250
And Mary Coogan is there

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:40.190
who played the Heritage Festival
this year at Lincoln Center.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:46.460
And this photo was probably
just after the concert in 1985.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.490
And Joni, who came up with the
name of the group, she said,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.160
"Ethel Noes going
to come to see us."

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.800
We turned 400 people
away from that concert.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.860
And I don't know his name,
the Garifuna community.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.230
Martin, you took this photo?

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.120
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: I took
the photo [inaudible].

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.420
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: No.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.750
Okay. Oh and this
is early [inaudible]

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:12.670
and there is Juan Gutierrez
on the right, sitting.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.810
[inaudible], who's
no longer this us.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.110
A beautiful dancer.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.680
And Roberto Cepeda in
the middle on the drum.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.240
Just gorgeous musicians.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.820
And Juan started his
own organization.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.450
And his daughter is very active
in that organization, Julia.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.250
And this is Manny
Ocenda and we're

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.510
at Harbor Festival
which was 1986.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.490
Celebration of the centennial
of the Statue of Liberty.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.300
And we've programmed four
stages for over four days.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:51.210
And this is Nidhi Horta,
beautiful Puerto Rican musician.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.910
Part of a group called
El [inaudible].

00:19:54.910 --> 00:20:00.530
And this is our first matters
on our -- five minutes.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.710
I better go faster.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.080
At Brooklyn Museum --
Brooklyn Arts Museum.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.170
And one of the things that
we realized we needed to do,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.620
even though it was, it had its
own tension, was to be able

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.700
to collaborate with larger
institutions and find venues.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.270
And of course the newspaper
would give the institution the

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.810
credit and no mention of CTMD,
but those are the shakes.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.010
Can you go back just
one quickly.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.850
Right, so this is
still [inaudible].

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:41.280
These are three brothers from,
[inaudible] brothers from Iraq.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.580

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.880
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: Yemen.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.180
Thank you.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.480
And this is Middle Eastern

Youssef Qassab on [inaudible]

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.790

people aren't with us anymore.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.010
This is Pedro.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.450
This is at El Museo
del Barrio and this is

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.010
from the Dominican
community and part

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.890
of the Dominican cultural
initiative that we did.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.990
We did about 12 or 13 of
those where we would work

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.820
for five years at a time within
a community to help foster,

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.010
and sustain, and
promote traditional arts

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.350
within the community.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.880
This is dance India that
was at Hunter College.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.220
That's [inaudible]
in the middle.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.190
And the next slide is DJ Rica

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.830
who had this fortress incredible
career after this program

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.600
with SOB and her
basement Bhangra.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.740
Here we are at Heritage
Sunday Lincoln Center

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.110
and that's Nina Paolina
on the left.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.050
That was part of the
Dominican initiative

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:40.750
and this is part of
the West African.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.230
If I'm talking fast, sorry.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:48.270
This is -- that was [inaudible]
and that was an initiative

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.340
that went on for five years.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.240
And this is [inaudible] and this
is Lincoln Center out of doors,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.250
our Heritage Festival.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.810
And then this was a time that we
were doing a program called Folk

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.070
Parks, which grew out of our
Queens Ethnic Music Dance

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.820
Festival, which grew out
of the Winter Folk Festival

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.350
and the Spring Folk Festival.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.260
And these are Korean artists
also at Lincoln Center.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.980
This is Thunderbird Dancers
whom we've been working with,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.980
probably, I don't know,
20 years at least by now.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.160
Maureen, correct
me if I'm wrong.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.880
And this is producer
[inaudible],

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.520
a wonderful Bukharian
dancer and very active.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.640
She ran a restaurant
in Manhattan for years.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.250
Beautiful dancer.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:37.020
And this is [inaudible] from
Bulgaria, part of the movement

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.630
of Bulgarian wedding music.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.030
And that's Katherine
Foster up there on clarinet,

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.710
Lauren Brodie off to the left.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.720
And Jerry, just stay on
the slide for a minute

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.080
because this is indicative
of musicians who come

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.220
when the community is not here
yet and so they find Americans

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.070
who play their music and that's
exactly what happened here.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.420
So three are unaffiliated
Americans.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.020
[Inaudible], Bulgarian
on accordion.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:08.110
Okay and this is
-- oh, two minutes.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.660
Okay give or take.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.550
I like the give.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.710
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: Or take.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.010
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: Or the take.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.740
Ramon Ponce Sr. and this is the
Mariachi Academy of New York.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.280
An organization that was spawned

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.150
out of Community
Cultural Initiative

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.860
in the Mexican community.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.780
And Ramon is now running three
academies in New York City,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.850
in Brooklyn and New Jersey.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.200
Well he's trying for
one in New Jersey.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.900
One in Queens and
one in Manhattan.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.800
Okay. And this is our
Peruvian arts program,

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.930
Pachamama Peruvian Arts.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.990
And this is one of the
children that participate.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.800
And the nice thing about some

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.310
of the more recent
cultural initiatives is

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.600
that we've started teaching
programs and that is really

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.400
in response to what the
community wants in terms of,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.830
we want our children
to know our culture and

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.490
and all they're getting
is this other stuff.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.130
And you can fill in the
other stuff yourself.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:10.480
This is music from China,
Susan Chang there on the left.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.700
Whom we worked with and also
did a sharing traditions

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.830
program with.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.530
And there's [inaudible] teaching
kids to play [inaudible].

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.210
And at [inaudible] Center,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:30.160
which is another Chinese
initiative in New York City.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.270
And can we have [inaudible],
Colombian.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.100
And that was probably our 11th

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.950
or 12th community
cultural initiative.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.130
And this is Maurice Canate,

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.300
beautiful drummer
and beautiful person.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.280
Very active in the
Colombian initiative.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.330
This is [inaudible]
Augustine, Haitian drummer

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:59.510
who also won a national heritage
fellowship many years ago.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.280
And one says the
[inaudible] festival

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.850
that happens pretty
independently

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.770
in Prospect Park in Brooklyn.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:15.140
And is a very important
sacred celebration

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.910
that happens every August.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.970
And Sri Lanka.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.340
Now this is probably from
this year, right, Maureen?

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.700
And these are the Sri
Lankan Dance Academy

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.170
and I -- in Staten Island.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.470
And that's where one

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.070
of the largest Sri Lankan
communities resides,

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.190
is in Staten Island.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.110
Okay. Finished with the -- I'm
going turn this over to Pete

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.140
so he can do something
in the next 30 seconds.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.450
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky:
I'll swap out --

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.880
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: I'll punt.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:55.640
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky:
I do have some time.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.330
Okay. Well I don't -- I don't
have too much to offer on top

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.150
of that introduction other
than everyday we really feel,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.550
in the office that we're sort
of walking on the shoulders

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.140
of giants of the two
individuals to my right who's,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.660
you know the the things they had
to build from scratch we sort

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.190
of take that take advantage.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.100
And I can't say we take for
granted because we do remember,

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.860
but you know, it's just
remarkable how a lot of things

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.100
that we do every day are
really, you know, the same kind

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.350
of things, the same
kind of conversations,

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.890
the same issues you were dealing
with 50 years ago, 40 years ago,

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.290
30 years ago we're
doing it today.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.420
We have new tools to work with.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.720
We have new technologies.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.020
The people are different.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.260
I just want to thank Maureen
Walker and our deputy director

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.820
who has been wonderful to work
with over the last two years.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.770
But Maureen and I
are having a lot

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.350
of the same conversations
every day that Marty

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:54.480
and Ethel had 45 years ago
and it's and it's a pleasure.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.610
It's a it's a really -- it's
a real privilege for us.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.970
So.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.270
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Great.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.570
So, thank you CTM.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.390
We are going to pivot the
Appalshop over to Kentucky

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.300
and then come back
together and cover some

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.600
of those overlapping questions.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.090
So I'm going to turn it
over to Herb E. Smith

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.900
and Alexander Gibson.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.450
You guys are going.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.480
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: I
agreed to be first

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.600
since I'm 66 years
old and Alex isn't.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.520
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: It
creeps up on you, though.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.310
It creeps up on you.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.490
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: So
in 1969, I was a senior

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.790
at Whiteburg High School.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.610
A 17-year old student.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.990
And this guy arrived
in our town.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.170
I think the sign
said 1,400 people

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.540
at that time, kind
of small town.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.080
And he had this film
like an equipment.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.810
And we were just like
fascinated, you know,

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.110
what could we do
with this stuff.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.100
It was more about
learning the technology

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.570
than anything else at first.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.370
You know, you ever seen the
kids that have never been

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.150
around a computer and then
they got get a hold of it

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.790
and then they go see
what they can do with.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.980
That's kind of the way we were.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.910
And so it turns out there
was this outfit based

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:24.330
in New York City that had
sent this equipment our way.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.430
It's called Community
Film Workshop Council

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.240
and it had been started by
the American Film Institute,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.010
which had been started
in the offices

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.410
of the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:45.830
So we were like two or three
steps down from the beginning

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.510
of the arts endowment,
which I think starting '65.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:55.690
And I think AFI was
'67 and we were '69.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:00.230
And -- but we kind of had --

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:04.450
they had this idea of
vocational education.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.310
And there was a realization
that the range

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:11.960
of people behind the
cameras was too narrow

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.050
to represent the country, right.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.030
And we've got a big
country out there with a lot

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:20.560
of different people in it and
there was a very narrow slice

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.860
of that population that was

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.640
in the production
rooms recording sound,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.110
shooting the cameras, editing.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.410
You know, all of the
work that it took

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:41.300
to make the films were mainly
urban people in big cities.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.270
And we were in this
small town which I've --

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.290
okay we got this
equipment, now what can we do

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.590
with that that's different

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.350
from what those other
people were doing with it.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.650
And of course one of the things

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:59.020
that became obvious right
off the bat was that we felt

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:06.730
like somehow the television
portrayals of us were wrong.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.480
Like when Appalshop started
there was Beverly Hillbillies

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.320
on the television, Hee
Haw, Green Acres, you know,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.470
all of the Hollywood stuff.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.950
Li'l Abner, all the cartoons.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.110
And there was just
a open ridicule

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:25.330
of our people in the media.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:31.930
And so we thought, "Well
we have a job to do.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.780
We got to set this right."

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:39.580
So we -- so they started calling
it Community Film Workshop

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.880
Council of Appalachian.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.180
And we said, "No, no, no.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.050
We'll call it Appalachian
Film Workshop."

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.770
And then we did that
for a few months

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.950
and then we said,
"That's too long.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.540
We'll just leave out the
achian, the film, and the work.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.000
And we're kind of
like Appalshop."

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.570
And that's what we did.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:05.720
And so we formed our own
little Board of Directors

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.130
and then sure enough -- so what
had happened was Community Film

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.750
Workshop Council was
funded by the Office

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.040
of Economic Opportunity.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.230
So who's got that?

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.900
Office of Economic Opportunity.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.540
OEO. You all have heard of that?

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.440
So it was the war on poverty.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.980
There's the agency
created by LBJ

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.040
to spearhead the war
on poverty, right.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:36.920
And so start thinking
for a second.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.030
We started in '69.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.230
LBJ is not the president
anymore, right.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.060
Nixon's elected in ,68.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.650
Takes office in January '69.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.120
Well they start putting
pressure,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.690
the Nixon administration on
Community Film Workshop Council

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.150
in New York City
saying, "We are okay

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.980
with the vocational
education side of this

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.520
but this community based
expression stuff, we don't like.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.580
And who knows, they
might be making films

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.990
against strip mining, or
they might want to kind

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.620
of like have mine
safety, or they want

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.270
to prevent black lung disease,
or all this other stuff

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.860
that they'd be making
films about."

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.370
So Nixon administration
wasn't going to have it.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.940
So then we split off with the
New York people and we said,

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.600
"We'll just go our
own separate way."

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.900
Which we did in '71.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.000
Anyway, that's kind
of how we started.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.380
It was kind of a wild ride

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.050
but we were pretty political
right off the bat in the sense

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.430
of knowing that we were
in a tumultuous time.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:46.740
People getting killed, city's
going up in smoke, Vietnam War.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.650
And we felt like there
should be a voice

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.260
from the coal fields
of Appalachia.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.890
And we tried to be that.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.190
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: Yeah

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.800
and I think there's a
couple other unique pieces

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.190
of the beginning of Appalshop.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.490
My name is Alex.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:08.220
I've been with Appalshop
for about four years now.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.590
I come from eastern Kentucky
from tobacco country.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:17.050
Which is about an hour and a
half, probably 45 minutes away

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.470
from Whitesburg if we
could sprout wings.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.680
But because the way the
mountains go, it takes probably

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.760
about two hours to get there.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.010
And it's tobacco country
instead of coal country,

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:32.170
which doesn't seem significant
if you're not from the area

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:37.080
but it's pretty big culturally
different sort of thing.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.610
There's a couple other pieces
about Appalshop's founding

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.160
that I find unique
because it's, you know,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.460
it's been here for 50 years.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.640
So when Appalshop moved
in and Herb E. mentioned

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.160
if I forget something,

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.390
Whitesburg had a
pretty strong economy.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.720
It had U.S. Steel,
RC Cola, Coca Cola.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.540
Am I forgetting anything
else big?

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.680
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: The
schools are the biggest

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.980
employers probably.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.280
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson:
The schools.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.820
And you know, all that except
for schools is gone now.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.610
And Appalshop is still there.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.840
Coal, you know, was the
largest employer in the region

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.980
and the largest moneymaking
force in the state.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.440
In that part of the
country, in fact.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.890
And had incredible
political power.

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:26.250
Still has incredible
political power everywhere

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.350
that mining still occurs.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.420
And Appalshop the, you
know, plunky artists

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.480
that don't really impact
the economy, quote unquote,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.510
grew while everything
else shrank.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.880
And I think there's some
reasons why that's the case.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.670
And some of them are
wrapped up in the founding.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:49.840
And so, two I think, interesting
elements came together.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.100
One if the kind of -- the nature
of Appalachian folks as well

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.340
as people of low
income everywhere to try

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.460
and scrap together what you
need to get the job done.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.320
And that maybe duct tape, it
may be you fix your own thing.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.940
You make your own widget.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:13.560
It may be buying widgets
from D.C. Hitchhiking up here

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.740
to raise money like Herb
E. did some years ago.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.520
And the other thing was the
background of the founder.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.820
The first person.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.860
Bill Richardson came down from
Yale, he was an architect.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.540
That's an interesting background
to come into film making.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.470
And at the architecture school
at Yale he was introduced

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.480
to the importance
of other art forms.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.080
Radio, photography.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.900
He had to take these courses.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.850
He had to integrate
that into his work

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.880
in the architecture school.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.520
And so then Apple shop started
as a, like we mentioned,

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.540
a documentary film workshop
meant to document and talk about

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:55.900
and explore the area as well
as provide real job training

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.900
for young people in the
mountains that was different

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.520
than the majority for
what was readily available

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.380
which at the time was cold.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.330
Well as anybody here
who is involved

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.830
in nonprofit fundraising, you
know that there were cycles.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.060
You know, there will be
buzzwords that are useful

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.830
for 10 years and then,
like vocational training,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:23.310
workforce development,
etc. And these are cycles

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.020
that impact some
arts organizations

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.620
in an existential way, you know.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:35.970
If you if you orient yourself
around workforce development

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.200
for whatever ethnic group
or population sector

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.540
that you want to, you know,
could be 10 years from now

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.660
that some new think
tank has decided

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.960
that that's not the way to go.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.930
Instead you need
technological training

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.290
or something else well
Appalshop and the fact

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:54.460
that we had this kind of
background meant that,

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.150
you know, we started in '69.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:37:00.410
We added a radio station
not that long after.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.710
Youth media training.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.150
I think AMI was the
first, wasn't it?

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.110
It's a youth media training

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:08.020
where we basically recreated
the Appalshop process

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.200
where you had the
filmmaker come and hand

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.500
out cameras to young people.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.070
Well we created an
organization with an Appalshop

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.580
to do this same thing
and it's been going now.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.920
It's still going.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.980
We added music education,
traditional music education.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:26.110
We've had many different
programs over the years.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:34.860
And as those cycles of
funding went, we had the,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.130
this sort of Appalachian
-- it's not --

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.290
again, it's not just Appalachian

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.690
but I'm just describing
a situation

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.850
where people have less income
and they need to figure

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.060
out a way to get things to work.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.570
Well you know, if our
radio was well funded

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.520
than our radio we try to
partner with our filmmakers

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.120
and do projects like that.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.130
And so we could survive
funding cycles

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:00.990
because we were big
enough, we were diversified

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.960
in our portfolio to be able

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.790
to absorb some losses
in the market, right.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:09.570
And the rest of the
organization could rise.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.660
So I think that is pretty
unique about Appalshop

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.620
and how it's been
able to survive.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.920
I think the other piece is

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.500
that our fundamental
mission is not satisfied

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.990
and it won't be until,
you know --

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.590
so, into into what we
do, like Herb E. said.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:32.190
What's the -- what --
how am I doing on time?

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.660
Okay. So baked in -- and
I'm not going to talk

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.960
about slides by the way.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.140
So just enjoy them
on your own time.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.320
But baked into our idea is
this idea of ridicule, right.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.180
It was part -- Herb E. spoke
about it in the past tense

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.480
and of course all of you know

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.500
that that's not a
past tense question.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.030
We're ridiculed practically
every time we're on television.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.190
Is just to find some new
way to make the point

00:38:55.190 --> 00:39:01.210
that we are racist or a
misogynist or backward or angry

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:06.960
about international trade or
immigrants or no one really.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.260
But in fact we all know,

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.010
all of all of the
educated folks here know

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.990
that all those things
are just silly.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.960
That there is no
job competition.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.990
That that's just imaginary.

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:19.760
That there is no --
again, I grew up on a farm.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:26.530
So my background of seeing labor
change is in my actual history.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:32.310
So I think that the lack of
communication back and forth

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.150
between these sorts of sectors

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:40.140
of our society is what gives
rise to the stereotypes.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.660
And Appalshop has been
focused on addressing

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.050
that for a long time

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:51.200
and unfortunately there's not
more media that comes out of

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.240
that part of the country and
the problems seem to persist.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.940
The divide seems to not subside

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.740
and I think our country
suffers for that fact.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.580
So you know, really baked
into the concept of Appalshop

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.320
to go back to the phrase I
used earlier, is this idea

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:16.620
of differences in power
and differences in access.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:22.860
And so how do you
reset the stage?

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.210
How do you provide that access?

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.580
How do you provide opportunities
to people who, you know,

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:33.700
wouldn't have the
best museum access,

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:39.130
or after school programs, or
private schools, or you know,

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.280
what do you do to a
historically ignored population.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:49.130
What's the method to amplify?

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:54.010
And the biggest damage that's
done there is not political,

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.530
it's very personal.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.080
You know, people
grow up like me.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.590
Like most people in the region.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.120
Most young people who grow
up and they hate the region.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.990
You know, they see the
television and they think

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.560
of themselves through that lens.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.270
And so part of the work that
we do is to explore that.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.760
And so you'll see people
at the end of, you know,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.060
we take young people
and we give them

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.300
that youth media education
program I was discussing

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.500
and you'll see them go
through the process of thinking

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.270
about the region,
debating the region,

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:24.830
thinking about them they're
placed in the region,

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:29.430
and then sort of coming to
some sort of cathartic moment

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.450
at the end .So all
these things, you know,

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.260
the problems still persist

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:41.360
and in a similar way
caused by similar problems.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.200
And part of Appalshops work, the
final piece that I'll mention

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.480
that I think adds to this
and then I'll pass it back

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:55.510
over to Herb E., is you know,
a very early understanding

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.170
that our problems
shared commonality

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.500
with poor folks across
the world.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.800
And particularly, communities

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.240
that where extraction
takes place.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:12.000
But it's not it's not limited
to a sort of mineral extraction.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.830
But it's the idea that in order
for, you know, economic systems

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.780
as we currently understand them
to run, they need to be fueled

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:25.180
by low cost labor for
minerals that can then turn

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.840
into second order products
in some urban center

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.320
or manufacturing place and
then maybe into a third

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.330
or fourth order product
and sold.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:34.630
Well we're the first, right.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.440
We're the first line in that.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.960
We're the coal, we're the
timber, we're there --

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.320
and so bauxite in
Jamaica, right.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.390
Coal and Wales.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.180
Gold in West Africa.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.640
Diamonds in Central
and East Africa.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:55.700
I mean, the nature of
extractive processes power

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.810
and then the people that extract
is almost identical everywhere.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.830
And it depends on, you know,
it seems to be the limit

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.870
as what is the company
allowed to get away with

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.170
and that's the point
that they'll go to.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.840
That seems to be my experience

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.680
and so Appalshop understanding
this kind of commonality,

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.210
put us into a much
bigger partnership pool

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:22.880
than we otherwise would deserve
given our location, you know.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.940
So we have partners
all over the world

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.040
of all different ethnic groups.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.240
And that's really been an
informative process to our work

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.640
and I think has helped to
keep us agile and current.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.260
And again, I just,
I feel very similar

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.540
to if -- Paul, is that right?

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.840
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky: Pete.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.140
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: Pete.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.440
Sorry. I feel very similar
to Pete that, you know,

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.740
I'm here talking about
stuff that everyone,

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.220
that other people
around me have done.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.990
And so it's a very
humbling experience to be

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.310
in the presence of people.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.670
You know, my first encounter
with Appalshop was 16 years old.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.300
I was at Berea College
in Kentucky

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.990
for a summer program
with Upward Bound.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.030
And people were so familiar
with this self-hatred

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.010
of the Appalachian young
person that you had --

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:13.040
we did this entire week of
education on Appalachia.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.040
And it was, okay, what
does Appalachian mean?

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.040
Let's do a sort of in depth --
let's look at this construct.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.700
Let's look at the
geographical region

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.470
and does the geography
match the culture

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.520
and so then where's the cultural
region and what are we talking

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.820
about when we talk Appalachia?

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.630
Are we talking about the
New York Appalachian range?

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.040
Are we talking about
the southern parts?

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.460
Are we thought my
Georgia, Birmingham?

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.760
What does this mean?

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.470
What's this concept?

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.550
And so that week was
a sort of deep dive.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.560
And you could have -- that
week was called something

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.580
like Appalachian
Orientation Week.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.030
It could have been called
Appalshop Orientation Week

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.330
because it was Appalshop film,

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.800
after Appalshop film,
after Appalshop film.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.350
And you know, in that region
there's really not a lot else.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:45:00.080
So, like Herb E. said, there's
a lot of negative medium

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.660
and it was the first time in my
life that I was asked to think

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:08.470
about these complicated
questions about the region.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.580
And then by doing that, I was
sort of able to go outside

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.450
of myself and look at the region

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:17.650
as a constructive
part of an economy.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:22.100
A constructive part
of an economy.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.770
That sort of eye opening I
think is what a lot of people go

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.750
through when they go
through Appalshop programs

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:30.210
or when they're exposed
to our materials.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:36.180
It's to think broader
than your background.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:41.070
And to explore these really
difficult complex projects

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:50.030
to tell stories that amplify,
educate folks around us.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:54.310
And I'll pass it back to Herb
E. now for the final piece.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:46:03.290
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: I wanted
to just say a word or two

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:11.700
about the importance of
scholars in our work.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.650
You grow up in a place and you
know a certain amount of --

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.940
you know, you get some
stuff by osmosis, right.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.340
You didn't -- you're not going
to learn it from your brothers

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:25.200
and sisters and cousins
and aunts and uncles

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.020
and grandparents and, you know
just the network of friendship

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.770
and kinship in a given place.

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.890
You found out some
things about a place.

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:40.310
But then there's a whole bunch
of stuff that you don't know.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.470
And we began to find out that
there were people who were

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:47.290
like going back and
reading all these documents.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.120
Like when the deeds
got signed over,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.470
and how did the coal
companies ended

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:56.540
up with the mineral rights,
and how did the building

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.580
of these towns happen, and
who's owning the place.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.590
And for us, we were like whoa.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:06.520
And then there was a guy named
Archie Green you had just

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:11.030
written a book a few years
earlier called Only a Minor.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:15.030
And Archie came into
Whitesburg and he's like sitting

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.520
down with us and
talking about how we had

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.900
to like listen to
those scholars.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.390
And we were like, "They
don't know nothing.

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:27.000
They got it all wrong, Archie."

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.800
And he's -- Archie says,
"Hold on a second, Herb E..

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.690
Just go slow here."

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:41.330
And I remember we were visiting
a small college in the region.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.360
And there was a folklorist
there.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.340
And the folklore said
something about, "Archie,

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.790
why is it that you're always
intervening in these processes.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.490
That there's a natural
process that happens

00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:00.030
as traditions change."

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.530
And Art says, "What
are you talking about?"

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:07.420
And he said, There's two buck
deers fighting in the woods.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.740
Are you going to take sides
with one or the other?"

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:14.730
And Archie said, "If the
woods on fire I'm going to go

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:18.370
out there and try to
put the fire out."

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.300
And that's what we thought
we were we were trying to do.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:26.120
We were trying to
put the fire out.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.940
&gt;&gt;John Fenn: Thank
you very much.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:33.930
So a round for all
of our speakers.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.590
Now we'll shift here and as
I'm trying to connect some

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:40.070
of those themes that have
come up in both presentations

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.370
with individual organizations
looking -- oh wait.

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.980
Maybe I should have --
Maureen, could you hit

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.400
that screen darkener button?

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:53.940
That worked seamlessly before.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.240
Oh okay. Just keep trying.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:03.940
Whatever. So there's
some framing questions

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:10.400
that I had given to the
panelists before and a lot

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.820
of them are going to, I
think, push us to think

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.870
about some specific examples
of some of the things

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.170
that you've all discussed.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.470
So I'll pitch the
first one out here

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.570
and then we can think about it.

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:22.940
So looking back over
the past five decades,

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.040
how has either organization
shifted activities in response

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.760
to changing cultural
environments?

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.480
And I think as you were going
through the decades, Ethel,

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.540
some things were kind
of beared in there

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.840
as you guys were pivoting.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.140
And I'd like you guys
to think about that too.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.320
So which -- who wants
to go first?

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.890
Who wants to take that one?

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.720
&gt;&gt;Alexander Gibson: I
could just say that --

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.960
I mean, I'd be interested
in Ethel and Marty on this.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.260
What they have to say obviously.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.620
But you know, our, we just
did a series of programs back

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.640
in New York on the, it
was the 50th anniversary

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.450
of the Heart Cellar Act, which
changed immigration patterns

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:02.140
in this country in
a fundamental way.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.750
And I think now almost half

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:08.160
of Americans can directly
relate their family narratives

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.880
to immigration stories
to that act.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.910
Which changed immigration from
being basically just from parts,

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.930
certain parts of Western Europe.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.180
Or if you had family
members who are already

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.900
in this country it
opened up the immigration

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:27.020
to the hemispheric quota --
new atmospheric quota systems.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.520
So all of a sudden we're
seeing people come from places

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.190
in large numbers that
you hadn't seen before.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:37.950
So like for instance, the
Balkans and then, you know,

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:39.250
expanding out from there.

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:40.550
I don't know.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.690
Ethel and Marty, does that
sort of resonate with you?

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:47.490
The -- was there something new
going on back in 19, the period,

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:53.050
the mid sixties, immigration
wise that inspired your work?

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.350
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: Absolutely.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:55.650
I mean, that was a time.

00:50:55.650 --> 00:51:00.600
1965, the Balkan Art Center,
Ethnic Folk Art Center,

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.420
Center for Traditional
Music and Dance.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:07.760
I mean, I totally benefited
from that immigration

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.440
and the work was cut out for us.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:15.110
We were working primarily with
first-generation Americans

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:20.160
who were spectacular
carriers of their traditions.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:26.030
Musicians, dancers, I mean,
you went to a community event

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:31.330
and it was an organism
that was working in concert

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:35.030
and in synchrony that
was pretty extraordinary

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:37.730
and that was community.

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:42.150
And the biggest changes
that I see, really,

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:44.780
is working with second, third,

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:49.570
and fourth generation
immigrant population as well

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:52.780
as new immigration
is still happening.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:57.420
And as immigration is one of the
top issues in the world today.

00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:02.200
I mean, the amount of displaced
people and and transference

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.200
and population movement.

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.580
I mean, I don't think we -- I
mean, there was huge movement,

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.880
of course, after World War I.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.670
And I don't know how
that compares to that.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:17.150
This period of movement
to that but it's huge.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:23.380
And people need to be grounded
and be given the opportunity.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.360
And so issues of access are

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.240
across both of our
organizations.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.280
Access, power structure, I mean,
one of the things that Martin

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.930
and I always talked
about was, you know,

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:39.700
there were no immigrant
artists on TV, you know,

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.660
or in concerts or anywhere.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:48.070
And so we didn't -- many, many
concerts, and concert series,

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:50.730
and tours of concerts,
and festivals.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:56.640
And lo and behold, 20 years
later, BAM has ethnic arts,

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.270
and the immigrant arts,
and Lincoln Center,

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.340
and Carnegie Hall, and
it's wonderful, you know.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.150
So that -- we were the
incubator, so to speak.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.450
Or the catalyst.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:07.890
Both actually.

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:12.850
And other institutions became
responsive and carried forward.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:14.800
But it's still going
to be an issue.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.750
And again, it's how to work
with immigrant populations

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.990
that are now in third
and fourth generation.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:24.770
That's one of the major
issues that I see, and change.

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.600
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: Well if I
can just piggyback on that.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.270
And I must say, when we first
started receiving our grants

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:41.250
from NEA, Appalshop
was always referred to.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:44.010
And an Appalshop
would always be spoken

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.020
about in the same sentence

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.910
that the Balkan Art
Center is spoken about.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.930
And hearing you speak.

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.690
I'm very moved.

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:58.680
Because your mission
was our mission.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:06.080
As Ethel spoke, we didn't
see ourselves on TV.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.980
We didn't hear our
music on the radio.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.280
And that's very difficult now

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.840
because now you've got
world music, the ethnic pop.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:21.070
You've got all these forms out
that's very fashionable to go

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:24.770
into a club and you hear
music from around the world.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:29.790
But in 1960's America,
we weren't there.

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.720
We knew that immigrants
built this country

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:37.170
but immigrant music was not --
there was no exposure to it.

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:44.330
And if timing is everything,
we benefited from the timing

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:47.870
of the bicentennial
coming up in 1976.

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:50.240
So the federal government
was putting money out there

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.800
to have a big party to
celebrate ourselves.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:58.330
And the Smithsonian was
supported and was given a budget

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:04.700
to prepare this great
celebration of our greatness.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.610
And today it's a
very different world.

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.990
And I don't know where
it's going, quite frankly.

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:14.420
It's -- I'm totally
confused by it.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.040
Well I don't think
I'm the only one.

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:25.800
I would also like to say that
we've been a distant supporter,

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.100
if I could say the word.

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:32.860
I just always admired what
work you all have done.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.630
And you know, it's a
big country out there.

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:39.740
And there's -- even within
the Appalachian region,

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:44.100
there's a lot of diversity that
doesn't go recognized often.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.860
And you know, these
mining towns,

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.720
they have all kinds
of people in them.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:55.120
And some sense that there's
this remote enclave of people

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.690
who are somehow not a part
of the rest of the country.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.080
I think, you know, you just

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:06.790
at some point realize how
completely wrong it is.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:12.730
These ideas about who we are and
the places that we're a part of.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:17.500
So I think -- another thing I
wanted to mention for us was

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:25.930
that we also saw it
as a economic task

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:33.710
that we weren't just
about making films

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:36.280
or supplying a certain,
you know.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.790
We ended up with radio station,
theatre company, and so forth.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:44.680
And -- but we thought
that if we were going

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:50.870
to revitalize the homeland, that
we had to model best practices.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:59.410
And that today, we have about
a million dollars in payroll

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:04.890
in a town of 2,000,
2,500 people.

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:08.680
And it shows up on
the map in Whiteburg.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:13.930
And to us, that's really, really
important because it's not

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.280
that we're going to lie.

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.240
It's a plant in the
coal industry.

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:24.210
But we can figure out ways
to live in those mountains

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:31.290
and not be subservient
to those powerful forces.

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:34.460
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: So picking
up on this theme of change.

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.140
I'm going to jump one
of the other questions.

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.820
And again, you've each sort
of addressed this somewhat,

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.080
especially with the
community music initiatives.

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.070
But how is it each organization
integrated community

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.340
perspectives into
documentation projects

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.730
and cultural programming
initiatives?

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.970
So not just necessarily
presenting them representing

00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:52.960
them, but hearing feedback
from the communities

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.540
and the constituents
who are working with

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:01.710
and then rolling with it?

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:03.010
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: Okay.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:06.090
Well, all of our
programs at Center

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:07.390
for Traditional Music and Dance.

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:14.620
I mean, all are really
based in creating a process

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.880
for a dialogue to happen
between the organization,

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.520
and different immigrant
communities, or you know,

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.610
whatever sort of community
we're dealing with.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.190
Usually immigrant in
ethnic communities.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:31.550
And so for most of our projects
we have, you know, we jump --

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:35.470
we don't just jump in with
programs of documentation.

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:37.670
We're doing, you
know, eight months

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:39.290
to a year of field research.

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.400
So folks on our staff,

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.250
or we work with consulting
folklorists,

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:48.940
and people who have done
work in the community.

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.650
You know, we -- that's
usually the --

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:54.890
the way we find out
about what's emerging

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:56.190
in different communities.

00:58:56.190 --> 00:59:00.270
And you know, as well as a lot
of research, you know, with,

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.540
you know, looking at, you know
what the New York Times is

00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.110
reporting on different
communities, looking at census,

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:07.050
statistics, and things
like that.

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:09.250
Finding out from our friends
what new restaurants are

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:11.220
out in Jackson Heights
and things like that

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:14.220
that we should go check out.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:18.220
But you know, it's really, you
know, we're spending a good deal

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:22.130
of time, really, you know, diet,
you know, ultimately meeting

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.430
with community members.

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:24.990
Interviewing them.

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:26.800
Finding out what's
important to them.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.140
Finding out, you know,
what scholarships been done

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.940
on a particular community.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.360
And then once that's --

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.260
that sort of baseline
research has happened,

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.120
we create project committees.

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.180
So we've had these community
cultural initiatives now we've

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:43.270
rebranded them as program
called Sustaining Cultures

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:46.950
but it's very, you know, on
the same theme where we're --

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.940
we have a -- bring together
groups of anywhere from eight

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.420
to 12 community members
who are meeting regularly.

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:57.070
And so the curation of the
programs, the identification

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.670
of what needs to be
documented and how it needs

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.620
to be documented
and disseminated.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.920
That's really coming --

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.220
it's coming from the
community members

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.720
and we provide a toolkit.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.670
We -- because we've done
this work in, you know, 15,

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:13.100
20 different ethnic communities
and so we have a, you know,

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:17.010
a track record and know how
about the things that work.

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.920
And how to get funding
for it of course.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.780
And -- but they're really
telling us, you know,

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.870
how to kind of direct
those resources.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.970
And that's the -- I mean,
that's what's wonderful

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.620
and the greatest
pleasure of the work.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.210
I mean, our you know,
when we put on a concert,

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.190
the concert is just
the tip of the iceberg.

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:38.380
It's really what underpins that
is often years of research years

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.770
of building relationships
with community members.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:45.420
And you know, and Marty
and Ethel and I often talk,

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.990
you know, some of the some
of the musicians that Marty

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:51.500
and Ethel were working back in
the late 60's and early 70's.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.980
We're working with the
grandchildren of those musicians

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.200
who are now great musicians
and artists in their own right.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.150
So to have that sort

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.450
of longitudinal
inter-generational dialogue

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.750
about, you know,

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:09.050
with communities it's what
makes the work so, I think,

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:13.110
so important, so rooted in the
expressions of the community.

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:16.640
And just such a pleasure
to work with, you know,

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.250
as a folk arts professional
working in this field.

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:22.550
So.

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:23.850
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: Well one of
the things that I would say is

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:26.540
that Appalshop is largely
an organization of people

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.280
who are making things.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.450
So there's filmmakers,
there's people

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:32.530
who are producing
radio programs.

01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:38.200
We have live DJ's that broadcast
24/7 on our radio station.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.110
We have a theater company
that's producing new plays.

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:44.250
We have a youth media
program that's producing five

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:49.230
or six short videos that the
youth have chosen the topics

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:52.610
and making short
pieces about the place.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.110
And one of the things
about making stuff is

01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:58.590
that there's a pleasure to that.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.980
That it's kind of like
the guy at the foul line.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.470
You know what he really wants?

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.730
Is the pleasure of seeing
the ball go through the net.

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:09.650
You just, you know, he's
like, I pulled it off.

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:11.840
I took -- undertook
this hard thing.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.820
The crowds yelling, you
know, and you're kind

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.120
of trying to win the game.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.900
But you what you really
like is when the ball goes

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.550
through the net and you're
like, I did it, you know.

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:23.710
I was able to accomplish
something that was difficult.

01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:29.010
Now that has to be
in the context

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:31.130
of some community
support and blah, blah,

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:32.770
blahs in response to you.

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.070
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson:
But I think it's also

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:36.470
that it accomplishes something
with communities [inaudible].

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:37.770
&gt;&gt;Martin Koenig: Exactly.

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:39.070
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson:
It's not easy.

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:40.370
It takes years.

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:41.670
&gt;&gt;Martin Koenig: That's right.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:42.970
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson:
And multi --

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:44.270
I mean, the notion of
multi-generational contact

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.920
and presence has come up
across both organizations too.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.110
Which I think is the
key to longevity.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:52.040
&gt;&gt;Martin Koenig: Now it makes
sense to me that before she got

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.730
into folk arts, a little
known fact, Ethel Raim was

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:58.520
with the CCNY City College
of New York basketball team.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.410
Believe it or not.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.800
I think she played center too.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.910
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: And
the community piece is very

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.840
important in Appalshop's
background in history,

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.050
given coal was the, you
know, a big force --

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:21.070
you know, I'm trying to
think of a good metaphor.

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:22.530
Elephant in the blah,
blah, blah.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:23.830
You know, you get the point.

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.130
It was big.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:26.430
It's big, and important,
and powerful .

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:30.010
And it was the context
for a lot of our work.

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:34.200
And you know, that sort of
thing as well as growing

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.440
up the color I am and
the place I grew up,

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.180
made me think quite a bit about
the concepts of community.

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.290
And that's sort of what I
meant when I was saying,

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.030
how do you draw Appalachia?

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:49.580
Right? It's an interesting
question.

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.860
Are the coal companies
part of our community?

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.550
You know, we've integrated
their perspectives.

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:59.330
It doesn't mean that we
agree with their perspectives

01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:00.940
and that's true across
the board.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.330
So and you know, is racism part

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:04.000
of our cultural heritage
in Appalachia?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.810
Yes. I would say it's also true
in D.C. but that being said,

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:10.890
it's part of our
cultural heritage.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.680
Women leading and and women
being kept from leadership.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.840
Both of which are part
of our cultural heritage.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.930
And we'll have people that
we work with who hold beliefs

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.340
that we don't necessarily
agree with.

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:25.500
And our question -- the
challenge for us always is,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.260
okay if we're going to
address a particular topic,

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.060
we're to pretend that
these people don't exist.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.770
And further, we're not going
to create a documentary

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:36.430
where the purpose is to be God

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:37.820
and tell you what to
think and believe.

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.620
Nor are we going to
make a documentary

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.430
that ridicules our own people.

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.380
So how do you do
all those things?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:49.870
How do you get a sympathetic
coal position into a piece

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:52.150
without cutting them up and
making them look foolish

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:54.600
and then creating a piece
that's honest to the region.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.340
Maybe doing that is what creates
the honesty to the region.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.030
Maybe not having the voice
over telling you what

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:00.810
to think is what
creates the honesty.

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:04.240
But all of these artistic
questions are asked

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.370
because of the democratic
questions underneath.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:09.010
Because what we're
doing here is democracy.

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:11.020
That's what we see
ourself, as participating

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.680
in a fundamental
piece of democracy

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.210
and that's what we see the --

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:16.840
the reason that we
were created was

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.610
because something was broken.

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:25.170
And community is just
really, it's really tough --

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:27.540
it's one of the reasons I
didn't want to not answer any

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.780
of these questions but
it's a tough one for me

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:34.460
because I don't know whether I
think community is an arbitrary

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:40.060
line we draw or whether it's
something that's immovable

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:45.080
yet -- you know, is the Bronx a
distinct community from Queens

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.710
or is it one particular street.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.720
I mean, at what point -- if
you're Irish were you part

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.660
of it -- were you always part
of it and people just didn't

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.410
like it or -- so those are
difficult questions for me.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:00.560
But there's no doubt that the
whatever community is it's

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.860
fundamental to what we do.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.520
And that's a very
awkward phraseology

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.050
but we an Appalshop will debate
these questions all the time.

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:09.350
What is our community?

01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:11.560
What's our obligations
to our community?

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.570
Yeah. Sounds like we're
the same organization.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.340
We just do.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.230
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: It's
variations on the theme.

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:19.010
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: But it's
a large network, yeah.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.310
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: Yeah.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.910
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Okay I'll pitch
just one more framing question

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:25.390
then maybe see what
things haven't come

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:28.020
up that you guys have
been listening to.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.290
So the futures has come
up a little bit here.

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:34.800
Looking ahead ,what do you see
as the kinds of programming,

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.320
documentation projects, training
projects your organization

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.620
should be pursuing?

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.570
So if we're looking ahead for
the next 10 years or 50 years,

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:45.620
you know, you can choose
your own time frame.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:49.290
But I know Ethel's hit on some
things like the changing nature

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.750
of demographics and
my great, you know,

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:53.260
immigration patterns
is something key.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.690
But what are some other things

01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:57.300
that either organization is
looking at right now coming

01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:02.060
out of this sort of 50
year-ish celebration?

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:06.490
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky: Back to me.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.790
All right.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.090
I'll take it.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.570
Which reminds me actually,
Ethel always, you know, says,

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:15.680
poses the question, you have
two ways to learn to operate

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.530
in the present in your own
present and plan for the future.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:20.890
One is, you can forget the past

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:23.290
or you could actually
learn about the past.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:27.430
And that doesn't mean you
live your present and build

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:29.680
to your future in a
backwards looking way

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.020
but you can use an informed way.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:36.570
And we find that that
creates a rich creativity

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.130
to draw upon for the future.

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.840
So I think the things

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.410
that what's wonderful are
the things about, that Ethel

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:48.220
and Marty and other folks,
you know, like at Appalshop

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.790
who built these organizations
at across the country.

01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:54.180
Folk arts organizations like us.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:58.210
They built the process
that that grows and changed

01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:00.050
like the U.S. Constitution.

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:01.730
You know, the things
you hear about that.

01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:06.320
But it really is a process
and a model that, you know,

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.810
it's very malleable
into the future.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:11.760
So I mean CTMD will
continue to do a lot

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.010
of field research
in communities.

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:18.130
We will continue to create
dialogue with communities,

01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:21.150
community members and that
dialogue might be involved

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:23.180
different technologies
and things like that

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.520
but we're still going
to be talking.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.500
Okay. We're still going to
be doing public programs.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.650
We're still going to be doing
documentation of those programs

01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:33.210
and finding ways,
innovative ways

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.520
to disseminate that
documentation.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.400
You know, in ways that, you
know, serves the community

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.270
and serves the goal of creating
inter community dialogue

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.570
and things like that.

01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:46.870
So I don't know.

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:49.950
I think it's sort of,
it's hard to project.

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:52.940
I mean a lot of what we do is,
you know, we plan, you know,

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:54.730
and Maureen and I, we plan

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.980
or have planning
meetings all the time

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.890
and then something happens in
the world and, you know, we're,

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:03.190
you know, riding the tides
that everybody else is.

01:09:03.190 --> 01:09:05.480
But you know, I think there's
going to be we'll continue

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.680
to do more and more
partnerships with small

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.230
and community based
organizations.

01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:11.270
Some of those organizations
we may have started 20,

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:15.370
30 years ago and they've created
their own independent paths.

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:18.350
And others are, you
know, newly emerging.

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:23.450
I think, you know, with
technology there's, you know,

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:25.940
new and better ways to
engage with community members

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:28.000
and the general public.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.620
New ways to disseminate
archival materials.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.710
And you know, with especially
getting back a little bit

01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:37.340
to archives because I
think that's why we're

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.640
here originally.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.050
It's you know, there's, I think,
when you're creating archives

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:46.570
and documentation it's always
important to think about,

01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:49.080
well who's the audience
of those materials?

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.200
What's going to be the purpose
of those materials, you know?

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.670
How do you want the audience
member -- and what are the,

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:56.050
I guess the most -- how do
you make them accessible

01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:57.350
in the easiest way.

01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:59.620
So our boards been talking.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.120
I'm thinking about that
alongside, you know,

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.080
increasing conversations
with our board about how

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.900
to get more sophisticated
about segmenting

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.140
and targeting particular
audiences.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:15.070
Finding better ways to create
programs and documentation

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:19.020
that would serve maybe
more targeted portions

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.520
of the audience.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.860
And you know, defining
audiences is always interesting.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:27.760
It's you know, we're serving
community based audiences and,

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.310
you know, and there's a
whole diverse spectrum

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.740
of folks within communities.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.480
And well, as we're
trying to create programs

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.100
that cross bridges
into the general public

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.930
or across to other communities.

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:41.620
I mean, I think Marty and Ethel
have always talked about some

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.650
of the best projects
and programs

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:45.250
that we've done in our history.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:47.700
Our programs where half the
audience is from the community

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.310
and the other half
is from outside.

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:52.110
Because for the community
members, they get a sense

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:55.030
of validation that all these
outside folks are interested

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:57.660
in what we do and
in our narratives.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:02.090
And for the outsiders, it's a
great way when you critical mass

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.850
of community insiders.

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.930
I mean, then you can
really get a window

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:09.780
of how the traditions the,
whether performing arts

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.610
or whatever arts,
really fit into a context

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.060
within that community.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.280
So that's a great
balance to look at.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.080
But you know, I think, I mean,
looking even farther down.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.720
I mean, I think, there's some
really interesting things

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.150
with media technology,
augmented reality.

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:28.750
I mean, you know, now we have
the technology and some of,

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:31.180
a lot of you probably have apps
on your phone where if you hold

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.470
up your cell phone to
something being played

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.080
over a head it can
actually identify the song.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.830
Well you know, it doesn't go, it
doesn't take too much to connect

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:42.890
that to -- well you can put
lyrics attached to that.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:45.650
So if you're watching a
performance of Albanian music

01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:49.980
in a club and, you know,
in the Bronx or Tirana.

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.160
You can hold up your
cell phone and all

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.670
of a sudden get a
live translation

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:55.540
of the lyrics and
things like that.

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.020
There's all sorts
of, you know --

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.950
or get bios of the
performers just

01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:01.630
from hearing their voice
and things like that.

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:05.200
So there's going to be a lot of
interesting ways that, I think,

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.010
live programming and
documentation are going

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:12.130
to get more and more
integrated in the future.

01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:15.870
And through, you know,
different media technologies.

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:19.300
And this this stuff is not
very far away, you know.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.640
And people are already
thinking about this.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.600
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: What do you
guys think about the future?

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.900
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson:
Unfortunate --

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.900
so there's two things I could
politician my way out of this

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.880
and answer a different
question than the one was asked.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.210
I could say ditto
because I agree

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:37.870
with everything that
was just said.

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:41.100
But I'll take the third which
I think is just add a couple

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.400
other things.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.690
But everything he said I
agree with, I think is true.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:49.070
I think with Appalshop, you
know, our mission is not

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:52.640
yet satisfied and
is still strong.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.520
It's still applicable,
as applicable today

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.600
as it was when it started.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.070
And that's sad in a lot
of ways but expected.

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:06.610
Again, we're just now getting
out of the coal industry which,

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:10.880
you know, politically
marginalizes those that extract

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.380
because you need to keep
the cost as low as possible.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:17.310
So you know, we may
see a new horizon

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.750
of Appalachia coming forward.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.810
I don't know that that's true.

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.080
I hope that it is.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.910
Economically is what I mean.

01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:27.310
And Herb E. and I, we're looking

01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:31.550
over the questions before
we came and I was thinking,

01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:33.780
you know, seems to
me the only way

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.560
that our mission would no longer
-- would need to be revised --

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.490
or perhaps Appalshop would
need to close because all

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:43.930
of our staff would not
be oriented in this way.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:46.630
Would be if Appalachia somehow,

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:49.410
let's say kudzu is this
is this invasive crop.

01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:53.430
Let's say kudzu turns
into this delicious wine

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:59.670
that everyone loves and
now -- so if Appalachia,

01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:03.740
if that region turned in a
Napa Valley economically,

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.460
the context for our work
would be gone, you know,

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.960
because of course someone
living in a winery in that part

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.440
of the country can
hire their own media

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.500
and tell their own story
and other people want

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.220
to tell their stories.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.740
So it's fundamentally
about the piece.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.780
It's about being
politically invisible.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.980
Politically marginalized, low
income, and all the effects

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:26.870
and issues that come with that.

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:29.460
So that's really
central to how we think

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.280
about our work and
that may change.

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.270
Again, we're all hopeful that
it will change but there's

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:41.070
so many barriers at the moment.

01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.650
And so we try our best
and I'm really hopeful

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:49.360
with this new generation of
young people coming up that are,

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.170
again, that may be that
may always be true.

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:55.800
But really politically engaged.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:00.400
Not as interested in
questions of race and religion.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.270
And they're more interested
in doing work and trying

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:07.400
to create the place that
they want to live in.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.050
So, you know, we just try
to provide the best road

01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:14.600
to that destination we can at
Appalshop for the young people

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.420
that -- for the most number
of young people that we can.

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.620
And it's really -- it's
-- you know, it's --

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.280
there's not a lot of
competition in that area,

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.990
which is good for
our fundraising.

01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:30.020
It's bad for the state, for
the effect that we're seeking.

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.320
Yeah.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.050
&gt;&gt; I want to turn it
over to some questions

01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.350
from the audience now.

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:35.930
We have a little bit of time
here to take any as well

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.300
as if you guys have questions
that sort of come up,

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.600
we can pitch those as well.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.040
And there are microphones
that are going to be walking

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.470
around so we can make sure

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:45.320
that the questions are
captured on the video.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.790
&gt;&gt; So yeah.

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:52.490
I think across the spectrum,
you mentioned the mockery

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:57.760
and the stereotyping, and I know
that was true for my culture,

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.000
Yiddish language was just
the stuff of buffoonery.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.330
How do you deal generationally
with the internalized shame

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:13.160
of generation one wanting
to transform their children

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.090
into sort of vanilla,
you know, whatever,

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:20.820
and distance themselves
from their own culture?

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.810
And I know what you're
talking about.

01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:27.720
What you're doing is the
affirming and the validation,

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:32.050
but you almost sometimes have
to fight a generation in order

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:34.500
to get that to happen.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.240
So that's my question.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.120
How do you do that?

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.420
Or what do you think about that?

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.720
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: Well,
I think it's the --

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.570
I think it's the deepest, most
enduring challenge that we have

01:16:46.570 --> 01:16:52.080
in Appalachian region today,
is how we free ourselves

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.560
from this internalized
oppression.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.130
And the sense of
having to apologize

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:01.740
for who your people are,
how you dress, how you talk,

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:08.160
how your family makes a living
or maybe draws food stamps

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.410
or whatever it takes to
survive in those mountains.

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:20.400
Often, there's, with
the survival,

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.230
a sense of failure often.

01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:28.320
And I want to get past that.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.620
I really do.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:34.070
I think this sense
of -- I think what --

01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:39.650
if there is a consistent goal
for 50 years at Appalshop,

01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:43.480
it's trying to deal with that.

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:51.670
&gt;&gt; I have a question also
for Herb E. I'm wondering,

01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:57.260
what brought the American Film
Institute to Whitesburg in 1969?

01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:00.540
I think George Stevens
Jr. was the head of AFI.

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.350
I don't know that he had
a particular interest.

01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:05.480
I'm also wondering whether
the Whitesburg Eagle.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.230
It screams, you know, that
was well known at the time.

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:13.960
Did that have anything to do
with why AFI chose Whitesburg?

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.260
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: Yeah.

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:17.590
Actually, community
film works --

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:21.100
the AFI [inaudible] community
film workshop Council,

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:25.130
they basically chose
Appalachian one of their places.

01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.810
At first they didn't choose
Whitesburg but you're right.

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:29.750
The fact that the
Gish's were there and had

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:36.060
that amazing newspaper
was a huge factor in Bill

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.550
and Josephine deciding
to move to Whitesburg.

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:46.120
But I think the --
in the larger sense,

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:53.070
I think there was a
realization that we are

01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:56.510
in this large diverse country

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:59.180
that we aren't always
recognizing

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:05.090
and that we had a lot
of work to do in terms

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:11.300
of documenting the realities
of life in eastern Kentucky

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.480
and southwestern
Virginia and that

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.990
that central Appalachian region.

01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:21.120
So I think there was an
acknowledgement of that need

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.020
that ended up meaning that
people would locate that.

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.670
I don't think the
impetus was from AFI.

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:32.070
I think what was happening with
AFI was that they were applying

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:34.370
for funding from the National
Endowment for the Arts

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:40.440
and they needed to show
a more diverse activity

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:48.930
than basically the AFI
staff were, you know,

01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:54.640
reflected the reality behind
the cameras at that time,

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.450
which was this very
narrow range of people

01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:00.620
in the country being represented

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.460
in the production
side of things.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.320
And so AFI realized in order --

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.970
if you're going to keep getting
federal dollars, you're going

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:10.930
to have to train some
different people to assume some

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:18.120
of the roles in producing
media in this country.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:23.150
&gt;&gt; Marty mentioned that
at one time at NEA,

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:27.350
the two organizations you
represent were often mentioned

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:28.650
in the same sentence.

01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:31.600
And the reality is there
were very few not-for-profits

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.000
at that time and that
was indeed the case.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.420
Something that hadn't been
brought up but I think

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.750
that was a factor
is that at NEA,

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:44.820
Amy Spelman started an expansion
arts program there and they --

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.990
it was mainly to serve
communities of color first

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:52.120
and then expanded to
serve rural organizations.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.750
So that was a factor.

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:56.770
And then at NEA, the
advancement program

01:20:56.770 --> 01:21:00.210
and the challenge program
both were put in place

01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:07.430
to help organizations develop
and develop funding as well.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:11.290
Those programs have
disappeared today

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:13.740
and I wondered what your
thinking is in terms

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.670
of funding sources

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:18.300
for infrastructure today
for not-for-profits.

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:25.000
Where do you find your money and
what funding streams are there

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.940
or not today when you're
looking for support?

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:35.170
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky: I'm the
guy who still wears a tie.

01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:36.490
Yeah. No. Barry, right on.

01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:41.620
I mean, so much of the sort
of support that was, you know,

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:45.910
either for general operations
or, you know, for infrastructure

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:49.750
like the challenge grants helped
us establish a New York Cultural

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:51.830
Heritage Fund, which is
not a huge endowment,

01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:54.160
but at least we have, you
know, some money in the bank.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.460
Go ahead, Ethel.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.910
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: Barry was talking
about something even earlier

01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.520
which was the institutional
advancement grant

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.690
which was so crucial.

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:07.020
We had Peggy Delaney
working with us

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.000
and talking about,
what are the goals?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.370
What does the organization
look like in ten years?

01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:12.670
What are you needs?

01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:15.520
I mean, and that was 1979,

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.010
and then the first private
foundation support we got was

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.590
in '84 from Ford Foundation
because there was someone

01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:25.950
who was interested in
what we were doing.

01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:27.250
But, Pete, keep going.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:28.550
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky: Yeah.

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:30.650
And that was Lynn
[inaudible] who supported both.

01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:33.770
&gt;&gt; Also funded Appalshop.

01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:35.070
Lynn [inaudible]

01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:36.370
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky:
Lynn continues

01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:37.670
to be on our board too.

01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:38.970
So but right.

01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:40.270
And so, I mean, so much

01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:42.600
of the funding now is really
project-based funding,

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.850
and it makes it very tough
when you're, you know,

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:47.880
spinning through a whole
bunch of different, you know,

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.380
projects to make sure that
there's enough money carved

01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:56.590
out of those, you know, those
not -- never enough grants to,

01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:59.300
you know, support operations,
support the development

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.650
of the organization, support
things like your website,

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:07.120
support, you know, your office,
you know, whatever support staff

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.420
and things like that

01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:11.080
and building an archive
until tomorrow.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.400
So it's -- you know, it's --

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.640
that's the sort of
conversation we have

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.100
with funders all
the time but it's --

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.210
you know, I think our field --

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:23.630
I think public folklore in
general could do a better job,

01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:27.520
I think, representing
itself as a field

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.820
to the funding community.

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.430
I think there's a lot of funders
who really don't know what folk

01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:34.330
and traditional arts
are really all about.

01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:40.630
So I know, you know, NEA is one
great advocate I think we have

01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:44.850
to, I think, getting the
word out about, you know,

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:46.150
what the what the field does.

01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:48.970
And Cliff has, you know,
been carrying on that

01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:50.270
that message very well.

01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:51.770
But it's something
we need to keep --

01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:55.140
continue to work on
and I think really kind

01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:00.890
of get a wider community of
funders to understand not just,

01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:04.380
you know, not just -- there's
an urgency to the work because,

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.050
you know, a lot of times
we're dealing with traditions

01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:10.320
or that may not be around in
another generation unless work

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.550
is done in partnership
with the communities

01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:16.350
that have helped them
preserve the work --

01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:20.750
preserve the artistic
work that they do.

01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:23.470
&gt;&gt; Martin Koenig: You
know, after being married

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:26.590
to this organization for so many
years, I finally got married

01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:32.190
to a person and it
altered my life.

01:24:32.190 --> 01:24:35.490
And, ultimately, what
often happens was I got --

01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:39.910
I have three children
and twins came along,

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:43.040
and anyone who knows
anything about twins, I mean,

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:46.220
you're underwater until
they get old enough.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:50.790
And my wife agreed to have
children if I would spend 50%

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:53.790
of my time bringing them up.

01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:56.220
She wasn't going to
do it by herself.

01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.490
So I left the organization
about 25 years ago,

01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:05.610
and once my kids got old enough,
I have gotten back into the work

01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:10.150
and I'm working with
the Smithsonian in terms

01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:12.460
of doing some publishing
of material

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:17.340
that I had recorded separately
in those first five years

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:23.640
when Margaret Mead supported
the work that I was doing.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.720
So here I am approaching 80

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.370
and I forgot what I was
about to talk about.

01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:36.730
I didn't mean to --
oh, I know what it is.

01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:39.230
Okay. One of the
problems, folks.

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:44.540
So I live on an island
off of Seattle,

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:51.030
and to do this work now, for
Folkways, I have to raise money.

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:55.420
And I made a little 501c3
organization not to burden them

01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:59.410
with taking on an additional
thing of what I'm doing

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:03.100
from the other side
of the country.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:07.060
I am fundraising in a
totally different way.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:10.680
&gt;&gt; Ethel Raim: It was so
much in my life and not

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.980
in the rest of the world, right?

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:16.040
So that was a huge motivation.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:20.390
You know, and when people start
writing my bios now, they say,

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:23.320
she was at a meeting at
the Newport Foundation

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.800
and she said it was a wonderful
festival but I didn't hear any

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.500
of the accents that
she grew up with,

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.500
that I grew up with,
and it's true.

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:36.220
I didn't. You know, so that was
a big piece of my motivation,

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.830
was to really get that kind
of representation and get

01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:42.480
that access for those
communities that was

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:47.310
so hidden and now less hidden.

01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:50.210
&gt;&gt; I said something
pretty quick.

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:56.330
I had occasion to travel into
some coal mines in Russia,

01:26:56.330 --> 01:27:02.670
and what I noticed was
that it was like the 1950s

01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:05.000
in those Russian coal mines.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.260
And what became clear
was there was no dissent.

01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:13.160
There was nobody challenging
the coal industry in Russia

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.850
to change their practices.

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:20.550
They would send 2,000 people
into a Russian coal mine

01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:24.320
and we would send 200 people
and we would mine more

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.280
than those 2,000 Russian miners.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.730
I said, "What do
they do all day?

01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:29.030
They had the same equipment."

01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:35.450
And they said, "Well we
-- everybody needs a job."

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:38.280
But, you know, at some point,
you don't want to send everybody

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:41.780
into an underground coal mine
just because they need a job,

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:44.320
so I think this idea

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:50.500
of challenging the prevailing
powers-that-be is really,

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:55.660
really important as we deal
with the realities of a place

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.540
that is facing hard times.

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:02.340
&gt;&gt; Is it a short
question, Cliff?

01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.520
&gt;&gt; Cliff: I'll make it short.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.820
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:08.420
&gt;&gt; Cliff: So [inaudible] I'd
love just to say congratulations

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.020
to Ethel on receiving the
National Heritage Fellowship

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.510
and I --

01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:17.830
[ Applause ]

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:21.010
And in watching the
slideshow, seeing the number

01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:23.930
of National Heritage fellows
that you've advocated,

01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:25.270
that your organization
has advocated

01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:27.330
for over the years
really is a testament

01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:32.270
to your incredible work
on behalf of others.

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:35.210
So thank you for that.

01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:38.590
I would say, you
know, just to add

01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:40.890
to what Barry Burgee
mentioned earlier,

01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:45.550
people still name-check CTMD
and Appalshop at the NEA

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:47.710
when they're talking
about organizations

01:28:47.710 --> 01:28:50.400
that they aspire
to be like, right?

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.700
In the traditional arts.

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:58.020
And it gets me thinking, you
know, I wonder 50 years in,

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:01.020
right, you could -- if you
were a building, you could be

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.820
on the National Register
of Historic Places.

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:06.510
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: I don't
want to be a building.

01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:07.810
&gt;&gt; Cliff: So right.

01:29:07.810 --> 01:29:12.860
So how is it -- right, see,
there must be a perception.

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.810
If people name check you,
they have a perception

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:17.130
of what your organization
is all about in how you work

01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:19.040
and who you represent
and how you do it.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.500
And I imagine you must face that
in the communities that you work

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.760
in and have been
working in for so long.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.940
So how do you stay nimble?

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:31.260
How do you keep your identity
from ossifying in a way

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:33.940
that enables you to work
with so many different types

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.760
of people and perspectives?

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.500
Is that a short question?

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.250
&gt;&gt; Yes but the answer is long.

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:44.330
&gt;&gt; I mean, you know I said it's
come up in a couple of her ways

01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:46.420
and you guys, but
they both hit on it.

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:48.750
The founders established a
process for working the people

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.030
and I think that process has
allowed agility is what I've

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:53.500
been hearing across the panels.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.690
And so it's not like you
set out with the blueprint

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.180
if you're just going to
do this and you do it

01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:58.480
through thick or thin.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.780
You -- is that it?

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.080
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky:
Right, right.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.380
Well, I mean, luckily
there's been no shortage

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:05.410
of new communities moving to
New York City and great artists

01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:08.750
that nobody knows that
may be driving taxis

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:12.810
or working restaurant shifts
late at night or tending bar or,

01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:16.540
you know, doing what we've got,
you know, wonderful artists

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.180
who are grave diggers
during the day.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:23.450
And so anytime we start worrying
about that, we just open

01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:26.930
up our eyes and ears realize
that there's just new --

01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:29.710
more and more folks who
are continuing to come

01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:32.000
to the country, coming
to the city.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.110
But, you know, also, you know,
the organizations are adapting.

01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:38.210
I mean, some of the
artists we work with now,

01:30:38.210 --> 01:30:41.480
they're way more sophisticated
with social media than we --

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.020
anybody on our staff is.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.450
I mean, and so I think the
dialogues that get created

01:30:46.450 --> 01:30:49.590
with the artists and the
community members were --

01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:54.340
I mean, they're the most
invigorating thing we can do

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:57.320
as an organization is just have
those dialogues because it's

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.890
through them that we find
out about great new ways

01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:01.610
that they're applying
their artistry,

01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:04.030
things that are changing
in the communities

01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:06.590
that we never imagined,
you know, how the --

01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:09.330
a lot of the communities
are really --

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:12.210
it's very much post diasporic,
I guess, or whatever you --

01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:13.860
however you want to call it.

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.530
But there's -- they're
not just --

01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:18.890
they're no longer separated
from their home communities.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.190
They're very much --

01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:21.490
&gt;&gt; They're transnational.

01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:22.790
&gt;&gt; Peter Rushefsky:

01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:24.090
Transnational and
things like that.

01:31:24.090 --> 01:31:26.750
So I think it's --
I mean, we're --

01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:28.830
as much as we're creating
a lot of these programs,

01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:30.130
we're sort of --

01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:32.460
we're benefiting from the
creativity that's already there

01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:35.500
and already existing in these
communities and we're, you know,

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.110
trying to channel
that into, you know,

01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:40.920
in ways that we hope
serves the community

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:45.220
and serves the greater
public in creating dialogue.

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.520
&gt;&gt; You guys have something?

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.820
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: Yeah.

01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.120
Because of the work
that folks like Herb E.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.660
and the founders did, you
know, Appalshop, when it puts

01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:54.300
out a call for a new
job, gets applications

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:55.940
from all over the country.

01:31:55.940 --> 01:32:00.590
And so we were able to get a lot
of people that help diversify

01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:02.700
and rejuvenate our practice.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.370
One example of that -- and
that's part of the process.

01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:08.100
And the other thing I would say
before I give the example is

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.640
that we've always had
community members.

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.940
We've never had a
professional board.

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:14.080
It's always been a mix of
workers and community members.

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.930
I think that's been
really important.

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:23.720
Our current board chair is a
longtime advocate for justice

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.240
in the region and so she --

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.830
and she's also never
worked at Appalshop

01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:29.400
so it's very interesting.

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.250
And her brother is a -- also
works now with Appalshop

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:35.980
and is very conservative and --

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:39.030
anyway, so it's always been
an interesting balance.

01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:43.910
So the example I'll give is
that we have a person who came

01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:46.880
and interviewed for a community
development job and his job was

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.090
to go around and
organize basically.

01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:51.730
I didn't give him
the title organizer

01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:54.520
because that title makes me
nervous, but fundamentally,

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.160
that's what he's doing.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.520
And it's in this context of
wealth and power and control

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.190
and new future and where's
coal and where are we

01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:05.470
and are we deciding and can we
partner in new power structures,

01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:08.380
can we create new
economic linkages?

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:12.910
So during the interview,
the guy struck me

01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:15.320
as perhaps having
some challenges.

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.830
Now, we had a lot of
interviews for this.

01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:18.370
He came from Connecticut.

01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:19.970
He was very different.

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:22.640
He had pocket -- he
had things on his --

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.510
elbow patches, you know,
like professors have.

01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:26.820
He had a doctorate
in organizing.

01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:32.810
He quoted Saul Alinsky all the
time and he opens his meetings

01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:35.270
by saying, "I'm a
communist Jew from New York

01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:37.660
and I'm here to work."

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.560
And then when he's
challenged on it, he says,

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.970
"Well, that's not true.

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:43.730
There are no good communist
parties in Kentucky."

01:33:43.730 --> 01:33:46.160
And he's been incredibly
successful

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.700
as an organizer in the region.

01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.000
Incredibly successful.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.020
I think he's more
well-liked then most anybody

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.090
and by the community, and that's
how he opens up his meetings.

01:33:57.090 --> 01:33:59.180
It's interesting.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:03.130
But Appalshop, by, I think,
by continual, you know,

01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:04.430
bringing in new people.

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:06.270
Like I said, we don't
pay them enough,

01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:08.640
so at some point they
go off somewhere else.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.130
But that's been the way that
I think we've most been able

01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:15.980
to stay agile is the integration
of new people with new ideas

01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.810
and the particular mentality of
Appalachian people which, again,

01:34:19.810 --> 01:34:22.230
if we get in -- if we got into
a big discussion of racism,

01:34:22.230 --> 01:34:23.530
I could go into,

01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:26.340
but fundamentally there's
this kind of, you know,

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:28.260
you prove yourself
to me through time.

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:29.560
I can count on you.

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.310
You show up when you say
you're going to show up.

01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:34.530
You're good.

01:34:34.530 --> 01:34:36.780
Versus this this
initial, you know,

01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.260
I haven't seen someone
like you before.

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:40.540
You have things on your pockets.

01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:41.840
You know, now you need to show

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.440
up a couple times
before I trust you

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.700
or maybe your skin's too
dark or maybe you're a woman

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.680
or maybe you're Muslim.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.450
So these are the challenges
that, you know, that we face,

01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:53.750
but I think that's
how we've been able

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:56.760
to maintain agility is one
in the structure and then two

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.790
in the recruitment of new
and interesting people

01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:01.340
that bring different approaches.

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.810
&gt;&gt; Herb E. Smith: And I must
say, we did realize as elders

01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:10.630
that we had to stay
out of their way.

01:35:10.630 --> 01:35:14.590
&gt;&gt; Alexander Gibson: Most
of them have realized that.

01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:15.890
Yeah.

01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:17.240
&gt;&gt; Well, on that note,
we're going to get

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.540
out of the way of
the next panelist.

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:20.340
I want to thank you all.

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.430
[ Applause ]

01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:25.940
And I'm going to suggest we'll
start the next panel five

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:28.590
minutes later than we planned,
so it'll be like 3:05 just

01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:31.460
to give to people time
to reboot and refresh.

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.760
So thank you very much.
