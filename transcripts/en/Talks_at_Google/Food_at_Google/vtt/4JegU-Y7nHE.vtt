00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome to
Talks at Google in Singapore.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.740
We're live here but
there's people also dialing

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.500
in from live stream.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.960
And today we're going
to have chef Andre

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.465
Chung from Restaurant
Andre to be here with us.

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:22.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.920
Chef Andre's new book,
"Octaphilosophy,"

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.650
just released this week.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.860
So we're one the first
readers to get a copy.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.800
And he's also going to
share a lot of the secrets

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.710
from this book during this talk.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.390
Chef Andre has been trained by
many of the world's top chefs,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.320
and he is also among
the best chefs.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.990
And he mainly learned his
culinary skills in France,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.820
and he has brought the
taste of south France

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.920
back to Singapore in his
restaurant Andre in Chinatown.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.540
Yes.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.600
And Restaurant Andre has been
one of the top 50 restaurants

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.500
in the world, and one of
the top three in Asia.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.290
Before we start the
talk, we're going

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.920
to play that creative
process from restaurant Andre

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.490
again, just for us to have
a look at how he creates

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.249
some of the famous dishes.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:49.123
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:57.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.274
-It's kind of a traditional
fine dining sequence that

00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:01.440
happends in the main course.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.390
You've got have
the cheese course.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840
When it first
arrived in Singapore,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.430
I realize that at the
beginning, although you

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.220
have the best French
artisan cheese,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.490
not everybody appreciates it.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.480
Everyone enjoys every single
course until the cheese.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.170
The cheese course seems
like one of the courses

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.390
where we can not do anything.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.720
In respect of the French
tradition and sequence,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.950
we would like to keep it.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.610
But how can I inject something
that really belongs here?

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:44.250
So I decided to do
a look-alike cheese

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.635
course of dehydrated milk
bavarois in the dry aging room.

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.750
It's exactly like cheese making.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.460
So we put it on the grill so
it had the nice ventilation

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.500
and it dries it slowly.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.810
And I would flip it
on different sides

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.640
until it half dehyrdrated and
created the crust over it.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.030
The inside is milky,
like a Camembert.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.755
We see ourselves
as like an artisan

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:14.250
because we're making
our own cheese, which

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.330
is something very farmer style.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.690
So we get the hay from
France-- really nice hay

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.410
with a lot of
different herbs inside.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.500
And then we dry
them and roast it.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.010
And then we make a hay ice
cream served the Camembert.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.680
For those that don't appreciate
the traditional artisan cheese,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.090
they could have something
that is similar-- very light,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.110
very refreshing, very
sweet and totally unique.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.550
I spend most of my time in the
south of France, Medditeranean.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.350
I want to create that
really, very classy--

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.230
or you can say Medditeranean
on Spanish dish.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.900
You have a charcoal grill squid
with piquillos smoked pepper

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.925
and olive oil.

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:08.850
A very simple dish.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.010
When I was thinking of the
dish, what makes you remember?

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.700
Is it the squid itself
or it's the combination

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.120
of the squid and the
piquillos or what is it?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.700
It's that smokiness.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.570
It's that burning edge that
makes the whole dish to life

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.700
Nothing can be replaced
with that burning

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.830
flavor from the charcoal.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.360
So what about if I want to have
an ultimate dish, that I just

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.086
eat the charcoal.

00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:50.690
And that's where I start
to really work on it.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.600
And we make fried
charcoal dough.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.810
So we serve burning charcoal
with the friend charcoal dough.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.610
And then we serve a piquillos
dip with the charcoal squid.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.560
In fact, the squid, or
the piquillos in a dish

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.780
they are just
accessories in a way.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.750
We designed that in
the middle of the menu.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.330
So sometimes when you see a
normal menu, you start it small

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.870
and the portion gets bigger, and
bigger, and bigger, and bigger.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.180
For a long menu, sometimes
half way through it,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.670
it's getting heavy.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.300
You're getting tired.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.586
If half way, we can
have a break or we

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:42.280
can have something fun--
that kind of lightening

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.550
up, freshening up a little bit.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.800
And then we restart again.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.860
Every night, we have a
guest finish very late.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.870
Most of the time they finish
at 11:00, 11:30, 12:00,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.880
or even the later sometimes.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.300
I just feel that I want to
serve something like breakfast,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.322
and then say, hey guys.

00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:06.030
You've got to go.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.210
You know, it's breakfast time.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.930
Kaya toast is the
breakfast in Singapore.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.400
It's white toast--
grilled white toast.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.780
And then you have kaya, which
is a coconut and pandan.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.090
Then you have one slice
of cold salted butter.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.040
And that's it.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.390
That's kaya toast.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.960
Well, at the end of the meal,
you serve coffee of course.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.150
So coffee served
with the kaya toast--

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.440
that's kind of the
ending or a beginning.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.795
But yet I don't
want to just serve

00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:45.160
kaya toast like anywhere else.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.400
I still want to keep
my French background.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.520
I started to make white
toast look like macaroons.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.060
We do it exactly the same way.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.890
We grill it, make our own kaya.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:10.700
And then you must have one
icy cold salted butter inside.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.060
If you're eating with your eyes
open, it's kind of a macaroon.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.030
But if you're eating
with your eyes closed,

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.520
it's exactly the
same kaya toast.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.995
[END  PLAYBACK]

00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:30.995
ANDRE CHIANG: All right.

00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:37.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.142
So OK.

00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:45.270
Good afternoon, guys.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.080
So today I'll be here to talk
about Octaphilosophy and also

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.130
why we're doing
everything and what's

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:57.570
behind it or our
thinking process.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.550
So the video that you saw just
now, it's just a few dishes

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.510
is that is why we do it.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.600
And I guess a lot of you have
already been to the restaurant

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.020
and you know what we do.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.744
Some of you don't know.

00:08:13.744 --> 00:08:15.450
But that doesn't matter.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.560
So today we're going to go
start from the beginning.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.500
As you can see, the
Octaphilosophy--

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.710
what is Octaphilosophy?

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.280
Why the octagon is
so important to us

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.300
and why did everything
come from it?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.450
So just starting with
Octaphilosophy-- Octaphilosophy

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.613
is something that when I
first started-- before I

00:08:38.613 --> 00:08:41.430
started Restaurant Andre.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.690
My parents are Taiwanese.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.740
I was born in Taiwan.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.690
And I grew up in France.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.030
I arrived in Singapore
eight years ago.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.460
That's how everything started.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.550
And we wanted to
come back to Asia

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.180
and start up our own business.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.620
So I was thinking, OK.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.960
So how to tell people that
this is Andre's cuisine--

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.660
this is not Taiwanese cuisine.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.730
This is not French cuisine.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.580
This is something
that belongs to me

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.630
and it collects everything
everywhere I go.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.810
And it becomes my
own style of cuisine.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.290
So I started going back to
look at everything that I did,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.710
that I created
the past 20 years.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.930
And I realized I don't
have anything fixed.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.160
Everywhere I go,
I collect ideas.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.520
It becomes.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.310
I get inspired by
different things.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.390
I grew up in an artist family.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.530
My mom was a chef.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.920
My father is a
Chinese calligrapher.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.340
My brother is an actor.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.460
My sister is a
clothing designer.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.600
And I'm very into
pottery and sculpture.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.355
So in a way, we were
trained since we

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:53.420
were little to appreciate
each other's work--

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.610
to appreciate the
beautiful things in life

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.730
in different forms.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.290
So that means a lot to me.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.480
And so I look at
everything that I've

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.110
created in the past 20 years.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:10.320
And I realized
these eight elements

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:19.280
that are constantly repeating
in my creations-- it's

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.400
just like, OK.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.940
Our hairstyle, our
makeup-- if you

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.740
look at what your picture was
five years or 10 years ago,

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.910
you'll say, oh my God.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.120
I got a hairstyle like that.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.510
And my make up is horrible.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.630
But at that time, you
feel so good about it.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.170
Yeah?

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.740
So same thing for me.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:44.390
I said, you know I constantly
change my style or taste.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.860
But the one thing that
never changed probably

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.400
is my favorite color.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:48.900
Yeah.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.560
So that's the essence.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.300
So when I look at everything
that I've created,

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.510
these eight elements
are constantly

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:00.260
repeating in my creation.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.610
So I said, yeah.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.700
So how to tell people that
this is Andre's cuisine--

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.620
these eight elements
become so important.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.310
Because no matter where I
go, no matter what I create,

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.370
or when I create, these
elements-- eight elements

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.320
are always there.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.020
So that's Andre.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.520
So we just try to give
it a name and give it

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.430
a reason so people can
understand it easily,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.400
that this is Octo-philosphy--
that this is what we do.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.280
So when we first started,
I always was constantly

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.650
asking myself the
question, all the time,

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.240
are we moving forward or
are we moving backwards?

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.385
Oh by the way, you guys can
have a lunch [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:45.385 --> 00:11:46.000
while eating.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.946
It was so cool.

00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:51.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.420
I like it here.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.020
Yeah.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.190
So where were we at?

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.740
I should have one
too, like, you know.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.460
So yeah, when I first
started, I constantly

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.170
asked myself questions--
are we moving forward

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.730
or are we moving backwards
with everything that we create?

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.820
Yeah.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.320
So if you think about
a dining experience,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.900
if you go to a casual
restaurant, and you go.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.470
You sit down.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.160
And you order.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.804
And you eat.

00:12:27.804 --> 00:12:29.970
If you're at a fine dining
restaurant, you sit down.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.260
And then they're going to ask
you 50 questions before you

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.400
reach your first course.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.680
Oh you have to select
this, and select that.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.263
You want this.

00:12:38.263 --> 00:12:39.013
You want one that.

00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:44.580
We have 250 selections
of teas and things.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.271
So can I start?

00:12:48.271 --> 00:12:48.770
OK.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.050
And every dish, there were
so many things in the there.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.320
And the menu, it's so
beautifully written.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.520
So what is that?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.410
Is that the ultimate
dining experience?

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.680
Or are we just forcing the
guests to catch all that?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.960
Can we just keep
everything simple,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.120
and leave this space
for imagination?

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.060
Not giving you the
whole book and say, OK.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.837
You have to read through it.

00:13:20.837 --> 00:13:22.670
Can we leave this space
for the imagination,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.610
for the creativity?

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.060
So that's what I
think-- that if I just

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.080
put these eight
words on my menu,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.030
and I leave the rest to
the guests to discover.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.080
It's not empty.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.220
It just leaves a room for you
to put in your imagination,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.350
or you feel that
your answer to that

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.030
question-- you filled in
the space of your dining

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.020
experience.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.450
And only the dining
experience that fits you

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.190
is the ultimate
dining experience.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.745
So that's how I started
out the philosophy.

00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:03.120
So these eight elements, later
we're going to go through.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.960
Today I just took eight
pictures inside the book.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.340
So we can just go through it.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:15.320
And I'll just show you
what it is roughly.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.140
So we've got these
eight elements.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:23.140
So how do I create every dish?

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.770
So for me, the eight
elements, the eight dishes,

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.860
it's like a movie.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.320
It's like a movie you have.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.720
You sit down for two and
a half hours for a movie.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.860
And it's exactly the same
time for a dining experience.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.090
So I'm the director.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.510
And how am I going
to create this

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:47.290
two and a half hours that
you feel this excitement,

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.430
that you have good
guys and bad guys,

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.280
and the other
funny guy came out.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:58.730
So how do I prepare this script
so that this two and a half

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.460
hours aren't bored?

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.920
It's always up the beat.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.960
So eight elemnts-- they are
all different characters.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.120
So nothing is related
to each other.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.590
And there's no
particular sequence.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.730
So you have a good guy.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.521
You have a bad guy.

00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:16.590
You have these eight
different characters.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.900
How do you create these
eight different characters?

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.850
In one of the pages
of the book, you

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.870
have the sketch, this
octagon analysis.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.790
So what is the octagon analysis?

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:32.860
We look at every dish and
then we give them a DNA.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.080
OK?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.630
So I prepared something
just real quick just now.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.500
So you the eight elements.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.260
Maybe I'll put it here.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:47.990
OK.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.770
So I just drew an octagon.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.840
And this is what we do.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.551
We give a DNA for
every single dish.

00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:56.050
OK.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.430
You see originality,
imagination, craft, taste,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:06.480
character, simplicity,
emotion, and structure.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:06.980
OK.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:12.610
So you will have a dish
that focuses on structure.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.180
Or you have a certain dish that
focuses on-- sometimes it's

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.007
you have to eat it
with hands and this

00:16:18.007 --> 00:16:19.090
is one of the experiences.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.410
Or this dish is inspired
by my mom's salad.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:29.880
Or this is a dish that focuses
on textures or art design.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.200
So every dish comes
from a different source

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.910
of inspiration.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.490
Yeah.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:41.770
So we identified every
single dish with a DNA.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.270
OK.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:47.590
So that's that octagon
is the DNA for the dish.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:56.630
And so if we have eight of
them, to put them together,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.120
they should become
a complete octagon.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.920
That means every dish that
gives a different angle--

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.960
some dish focuses on structures,
some focus on imagination.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.970
You see how they overlapped.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.760
Yeah?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:25.780
So I guess as a chef, or not--
or any one of you-- sometimes

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.040
we never look at what we do.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.110
We thought that, OK.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.756
This is cool.

00:17:30.756 --> 00:17:31.380
This I created.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.340
And every single
dish is perfect.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.610
But if you analyze it and
give every dish a DNA,

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.190
you realize that they
are all towards one side.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.460
They are all very structural.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.870
Or they are all very emotional.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.790
But it's kind of
lacking something.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:56.320
So some movies are very
consistent, at the same pace.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.640
And some movies you have
different characters inside.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.900
You have a very good pace.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.430
Why?

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.590
Because we have to look inside.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.250
What do we have?

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.350
Why is this so important?

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.710
Sometimes you have
a dish come in.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.750
It's very visual.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.630
It's very detailed.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.950
And everything is
so perfectly done.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.980
And the next course
can be so rustic

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.962
that you open the
husk of the corn

00:18:24.962 --> 00:18:27.250
and you just eat it with hands.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.460
And then the next course
can be something else--

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.760
totally simple.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.560
So that's what I think-- that's
the ultimate dining experience.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.770
And everything is
calculated, but that's only

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.550
behind the kitchen door.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.060
We don't want to tell the
guests everything that I just

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.870
told you just now.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.810
We want them to have
these eight words,

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.710
and just sit down and relax.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.000
And they realize why
everything is so connected.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.720
So yeah, it's been more than
what a chef's supposed to do.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.380
And I don't know if
you respect this.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.880
But--

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.180
I'll just continue.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.820
So we're going to go into
the Octaphilosophy, so

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.090
the eight elements.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.050
And it goes random.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.170
So one of the
elements is unique.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.560
OK So you might not
know what is this,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.160
but I'm sure
everybody should know.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.010
This is a carrot heart.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.510
OK.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.660
It's a heart of carrot.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.960
So if we cut a carrot
length-wise, and then you see

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.350
there is one thin
yellow part inside.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.130
And this is the carrot heart.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.720
But we never knew that a carrot
heart could look like this.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.360
So what is unique?

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.880
There is no such
thing as unique.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.250
If you have a white sheep in
a whole bunch of black sheep,

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.170
the white sheep is unique.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.710
And the black sheep
gets into the bunch

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.640
up white sheep-- it's unique.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.370
And sometimes the uniqueness
comes to the right place

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.860
at the right time.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.960
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:27.640
So this picture in the book--
I want to show you that a lot

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.940
of the things that we think
we know, but we don't.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:37.390
We always peel or cut the
carrots like that-- peel

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.360
it with a peeler.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:48.720
But if you cook the carrot,
the entire carrot by itself,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.615
and then you open
it, you peel it

00:20:51.615 --> 00:20:55.350
like you peel an orange skin.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.840
And you will see this.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.130
So change another
way of thinking.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:05.916
And change a different
way to process a food,

00:21:05.916 --> 00:21:07.540
and then you see it
in a different way.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.740
And that's unique.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.750
So there's nothing
really unique or not.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.650
It's just how you do it.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.370
We get used to the way
that we work all the time.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.730
This has to be like that.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.130
A carrot has to be like that.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.500
You have to cut it in a way.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.780
And you never see the
beauty of a carrot heart.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.500
Then we use it.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.490
We cure it.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.770
And then we just show it.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:30.770
And everybody says, wow.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.090
Where did you get this carrot?

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.052
And it's from the
[INAUDIBLE] Market.

00:21:34.052 --> 00:21:35.835
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:38.450
You know?

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.223
So it's brainless.

00:21:42.223 --> 00:21:48.940
But that's how I want
to show that it's

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.230
how we see this differently.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.160
Second-- artisan.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:01.490
So artisan is an
interesting element.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.100
This one day that I went over
to Japan to see my friend.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.290
He's a three Michelin Star,
one of the top restaurants

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.170
in Tokyo.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.972
And he took me to see
this aubergine farmer.

00:22:12.972 --> 00:22:14.430
And you know, the
Japanese are very

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.880
famous for their aubergines.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.940
So then he said,
this guy is the best.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.440
OK?

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.550
You gotta get the
vegetable from this guy.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.870
So I went to see this guy.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:28.800
And speechless-- his
produce is top notch.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.500
And I said, can I buy this?

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.581
And he said no.

00:22:31.581 --> 00:22:33.080
I said, then why
are you selling it?

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:41.050
He said my aubergine can
only be charcoal grilled

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.600
and served with a pinch of
salt. So he's telling me

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.320
how to cook the aubergine.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.120
And I'm like, OK.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.340
So if I say yes,
and then I come back

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.790
and I cook it a different
way, you would not know.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.450
But one thing very
important is that at the end

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.510
I didn't manage to
get the aubergine.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.180
Because I think the
saw it in my eyes

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.630
that this guy's not going to
cook it the way that I asked.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.817
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:07.817 --> 00:23:08.400
So he said no.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.440
And then I go back and say, OK.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.530
Oh my god.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:19.330
You know one thing that
strikes me is a chef,

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:24.270
we never think about
what the farmer thinks.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.820
They spend months,
maybe every day,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.080
they go flip the vegetable.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.905
They give them water.

00:23:31.905 --> 00:23:32.780
They take care of it.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.470
They say OK.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.750
The weather is not good.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:40.240
And then we cover it with
something you keep them warm.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.395
It takes so much care
of every produce.

00:23:43.395 --> 00:23:44.990
And they're so proud of it.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:50.830
And what we do is, today I'm
going to do a carrot jelly.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.730
And I just buy the carrot,
the best carrot I can get.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.260
And I just squeeze
them into juice.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.700
And I make a jelly.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.620
So everything's gone.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.190
All the work is gone.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:06.290
And we never thought about it
as a chef because of our ego--

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.170
because we're so selfish.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.000
We think that, I know
how to handle it.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.800
But we never think of it in
a perspective of an artisan--

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.410
that they want to
do deliver-- they're

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.680
so proud of their produce.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.470
And they want to make sure
they deliver all the way,

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.960
from the moment that
it grows until the end,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.670
that it can be served perfectly.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.880
We never thought about it.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.020
We just think that we're
good at what we do.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.420
And I'm going to
take care of it.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:45.620
So that gave me an idea,
that every day and every menu

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:51.650
that I serve, I want to have one
dish that doesn't belong to me.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.840
I want to have one dish that's
dedicated to the artisan.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.500
So I want them to tell me
how you want to cook it,

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.110
how I can deliver
the best out of it.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.255
If he said that I'm going
to grill it and then give

00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:06.150
a pinch of salt, then that
will be my foundation.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.700
I will see how I can deliver
the way that he wants to.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.940
Or if he says that just
slice them and dip it

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:19.100
in a bit of vinegar and just
eat it with hands or whatever.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.510
So can I just have
one dish that doesn't

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:26.270
belong to Andre in a menu
that's dedicated to the artisan?

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.550
At least that's
something that I can do,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:35.860
and not to forget all the
hard work from the artisan.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:41.580
So that's how I want to have
one of the elements that's

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.030
dedicated to the artisan.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.990
And so in this picture,
you see the artisan's hand

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.110
and he's holding something.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.790
It should be a carrot.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.480
It should be an orange.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.270
It should be an aubergine.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:06.300
But we cannot identify what it
is already because it's been

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.000
processed.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.240
So in this picture, I want
to say that a lot of chefs

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.170
that we say, OK.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.500
We are natural.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.660
We use organic products.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:23.290
We try to preserve
it as much as we can.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.600
We cook it as light as we can.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.810
But are we really natural?

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:28.710
Yeah.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.890
Are we really delivering
what the farmer's message is?

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:40.241
Or are you just
pretentiously natural?

00:26:40.241 --> 00:26:40.740
Yeah.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.420
So that's the picture.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.700
In fact, that is
watermelon skin.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.160
So we cure the watermelon
skin and it becomes

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.900
one of the dishes in the menu.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.620
So yeah, that's that
elements of artisan.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.515
Next element-- south.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:06.450
South is an interesting element.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:12.440
It refers to the south of France
because I spent most of my time

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.620
in France.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.960
I arrived in the south
of France in Mont Pelier.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.660
That's where I spent 10 years of
my time in the south of France.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.770
So in the south of France,
what I learned is not only OK.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.320
We use a lot of seafood.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:35.860
We rarely use meat-- very light
cooking, acidity, freshness.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.810
People are generous.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:45.210
So that's what I learned--
not only how to cook,

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.040
but how to live my life.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.040
Mont Pelier-- where I lived
is just about 40 minutes

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.820
to the Mediterranean Sea.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.940
So that's where I spent my time
learning about the culture.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.200
And you will see that the people
from the south of France, they

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.450
never think about-- OK.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:10.370
My chef never taught me
or said this is what I do.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.960
This is what I like.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.260
Or this is what
I want you to do.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.690
He would tell me this
is the south of France.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.130
This is how we eat in
the south of France.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.340
And this is when
we have to eat it.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.550
This is how we eat it
in the south of France.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.430
This is how we cook it
in the south of France.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.305
So it's not about him,
it's about the whole south

00:28:33.305 --> 00:28:34.270
of French cuisine.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.290
So for this picture,
it's the fish

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.530
that we pitched on every--
this is one of the pictures

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.600
that you'll see in the book.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.360
Every ticket is when we bid
in the [INAUDIBLE] market

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.340
in Japan.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.600
So you have to pick the fish.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.930
And then after you got the
fish, you put a ticket on it.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.890
And they list a ticket
of [INAUDIBLE] Andre.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.160
So that's 632, that's our fish.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.920
That's our ticket.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.907
So when we picked fish,
the best fish that we want,

00:29:09.907 --> 00:29:11.282
we would put the
ticket on there.

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:12.891
So that's becomes yours.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.750
So we use a lot of seafood
in the south of France.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:26.980
This picture-- I just want to
show that-- everybody asks me,

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.480
oh Andre, is that
French cuisine?

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.680
Is that Japanese cuisine?

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:37.810
Is that a Taiwanese
Asian twist or what?

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.480
For me, it's really
difficult for me

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:45.560
to categorize what
we do, what I do.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.980
But it does not matter.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.000
For me, if you look
at the fish, we

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.650
saw we got our fish from Japan,
from the [INAUDIBLE] market.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.810
And we give them a ticket.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.390
But there is no
border in the sea.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.957
They just happened
to swim to Japan.

00:30:03.957 --> 00:30:04.790
And you pick it out.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.220
And then that's a Japanese fish.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:12.120
Or that should be-- pick it out
an the Mediterranean Sea, then

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.820
that's a Mediterranean fish.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.530
That's a French fish.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.030
OK.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:21.925
So am I Taiwanese, French,
Singaporean, or what?

00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:24.670
It does not matter for me.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.020
I don't know how to categorize
the thing that I cook.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.766
But I want people to enjoy
it, enjoy the experience.

00:30:32.766 --> 00:30:42.690
It doesn't matter where you
come from-- south of France.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.150
Texture.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.730
For me, when you
talk about texture,

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.780
most of the time
we talk about one

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.710
produce in a different
dimension, different process,

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.160
that focuses on one dish.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:03.810
So in this case, this dish is
a frozen white truffle bisque.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.734
And for me, what is texture?

00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:07.900
How do you create a texture?

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.910
When you look at a piece
of stone, and then you say,

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.580
oh that's texture.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.020
But how do you feel the texture?

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.190
Only when you have a
contrast-- only when you

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.230
have a smooth surface or
you have a smooth hand.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.010
And then you touch the stone.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:31.810
Only when you have a
contract, you have texture.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.780
Only when you have
a very soft surface

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.170
and you touch a
very rough surface,

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.840
and then you feel the texture.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.540
Or hot and cold.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.800
So how do you feel cold?

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.930
Only when your
temperature is warmer.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.670
So there's always a contrast.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.570
So contrast is texture.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:56.260
And another meaning for me
for texture is time traveling.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:03.150
So we create-- how to
create a texture is time.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.650
So maybe you leave it under
the sun, the same produce,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.630
you leave it under
the sun for 24 hours.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.240
And that changed the texture.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.910
Or you leave it for three months
and that changed the texture.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.010
You bake it in the
oven for 10 minutes

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.490
at 250 degrees, that
changes the texture.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.154
So texture is time traveling.

00:32:24.154 --> 00:32:24.820
It's about time.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.170
So this is the
dish where you can

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:34.000
see-- it's a handcrafted
wooden ball by an artisan.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.240
And on the top is an
ultra-modern capsule.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:43.850
And he's trying to capture that
contrast, and also the time

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.570
traveling.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:51.519
And inside you have the
ultramodern frozen bisque

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:52.310
of a white truffle.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:58.630
And you have an original truffle
that's just right next to it.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:03.680
So for me that contrast tells
you what is texture about.

00:33:07.111 --> 00:33:07.610
Pure.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:18.130
So this is one of the
dishes-- it's a finished dish.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:18.651
Yeah.

00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:19.900
It's supposed to be like that.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:27.020
So white on white-- obviously
that's pure-- white on white.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.750
So here we have two
messages for you.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:36.630
First is that purely pretentious
or pretentiously pure?

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.125
Sometimes when we
have an image, we

00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:45.150
have something
really really simple.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.310
And we though yeah, that's pure.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.440
That's simplicity.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.710
Just like a beautiful
white t-shirt,

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.660
and you think that it's
very pure and simple.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.590
But behind that white
t-shirt that you bought,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:09.790
there might be a huge, gigantic,
dirty factory behind it.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.210
So are we pure?

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:15.300
Or it's potentially pure--
for everything that we do.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.909
For me, pure is you leave
a space, message to unfold.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.949
So it is a complete picture.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:26.309
It's not an empty space.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.929
For example, in
our restaurant, we

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.409
do this pure element of a dish.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:41.170
I was thinking that nowadays we
use everything with seasoning.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.420
We season everything.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.230
You need a pinch of
salt. You need a dip.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.900
You need a dressing,
a sauce, a puree.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.620
Everything needs a seasoning.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:57.110
We've been eating seasonings
more than the produce itself.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.670
Even when we think we're
healthy-- we're having salads.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.530
We're having a carrot stick.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.290
Even a carrot stick,
you need a dip.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.980
So are we eating the dip or are
we eating the carrot itself?

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.480
We can't even identify
what is the flavor

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.840
of the carrot itself.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.960
We need something to go with it.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:22.060
But what is a complete-- so
if you're having a carrot

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:27.900
stick by itself, it doesn't mean
that you are missing something.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.130
It's still a complete flavor.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:34.190
It's just our brain tells
us we need something.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:38.530
If you look at this
dish, if you're like

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:41.620
do you need a sauce or
something to go with it?

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.880
Why?

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.310
It is a complete dish.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:47.010
It is a complete flavor.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.390
You don't need seasoning.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:55.650
So it's a reflection for us
to think when we have a space,

00:35:55.650 --> 00:36:00.850
and we need that space
to leave it as it is.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.215
And we're asked to put
in our imagination, put

00:36:03.215 --> 00:36:07.040
in our creativity--
to fill up the space.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.200
There's nothing missing here.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.420
So for me, that's a purity.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.320
That's a purity.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.390
So in our restaurant we do have
a dish that uses no seasoning,

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:30.230
no-- just purely a combination
of the produce itself.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:38.540
No electric consumptions,
no fire, no cooking.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.810
So this is one dish--
elements of salt.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:44.499
OK.

00:36:44.499 --> 00:36:45.540
This is very interesting.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:52.710
Salvation, salary, salad--
salt is the key to life.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:59.250
In the old times we used salt
to keep us away from demons.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:04.410
We used salt as
currency to exchange.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:09.060
And we used salt
to preserve food.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.990
So salt is the
beginning of everything.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.980
That's how important salt is.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.340
And turn black and
white into color.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.625
The first seasoning
that we know-- so salt

00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:25.320
has been very important.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.110
For me, we are always thinking
that can we have a flavor

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.390
that everybody understands?

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:39.620
Whether it's lemongrass, or
it's chili, or it's curry--

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.190
I don't know-- a cheese.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.870
Somehow it's trapped
in a certain boundary.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:50.490
But can we have one dish
that everybody understands?

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.490
So I was thinking salt.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:57.160
It's not just the physical salt,
but the depth of saltiness.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:05.970
What I mean is for example,
soy sauce, fish sauce, ham,

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:11.830
anchovy, and sea
water or seaweed.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:16.250
They are all different
depths of saltiness.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:25.257
So that means that if you
have a piece of carrot--

00:38:25.257 --> 00:38:26.840
why do I keep talking
about carrots?--

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.703
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.040
OK.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.030
Anyway, you have
another piece of carrot.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:38.685
You use a different depth
of-- let's stop looking

00:38:38.685 --> 00:38:42.080
at seasoning horizontally.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.690
Let's look at it vertically.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.850
So a different
depth of saltiness.

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:49.750
So if you season a
carrot with the things

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.030
that I just mentioned--
different depths of saltiness.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.770
You put all these
things to the carrot.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.600
You still taste
the carrot itself,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.410
but the flavor changes complete.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.700
And I think that's
the beauty of it--

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.700
that you can still taste
the produce itself,

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.780
but in a different dimension.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.680
And I think it's really sexy--
that people will understand

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.210
the meaning of the depth.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:18.250
If you put these five
ingredients-- fish sauce,

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:24.180
ham, anchovy, seaweed--
we put them in one place.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:28.980
You still taste the five
different depths of saltiness.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.730
They won't cancel each other.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:37.430
And so that is my
source of inspiration

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:42.040
for the elements of salt.
And we use no salt added.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.620
So that's a dish that we
don't use the physical salt.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:50.080
Instead we use different
depths of saltiness

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.050
to enhance the produce that
we're trying to highlight.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.130
Terroir.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:05.490
So terroir is about
the land, the soil,

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:15.050
the character from a particular
space-- time of produce.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:25.640
So in our restaurant, we have
one dish that we try to-- we're

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.760
trying to portray the
character of terroir--

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.290
the soil, the stone, the
character, the nature.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:40.270
So we buried our meat
inside a soil of bitterness.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:45.109
So we have coffee
beans, cacao, licorice,

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.400
and you put a hot stone inside.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.570
And we cover it.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.810
And we bake it in the oven.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:55.190
So in a very old school
pressure cooker--

00:40:55.190 --> 00:41:00.280
instead of cooking every meat
in a plastic bag, nowadays

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.580
you see.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.280
So for me, that is trying
to reflect that question

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.430
that I said at the beginning.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:12.020
One day, I was just
betting with my team.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.030
And I said, are
we moving forward

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.090
or are we moving backwards?

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.300
Nowadays we cook our
meat in a plastic bag

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.990
and then we say
that is super cool.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:25.915
But are we giving any
flavor to the meat itself?

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:36.040
If you look at the old times,
how people cooked their meat--

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.570
they charcoal grilled it.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.605
And then they cook
it in a pastry.

00:41:39.605 --> 00:41:43.520
They cook it in
the dough of bread.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.080
Or they cook it in some crust.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.460
And it gives so much flavor.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.790
Even just frying in a
frying pan with butter,

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.240
garlic, and rosemary gives so
much flavor to the meat itself.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.050
And nowadays we just
cook it like that.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.260
So are we really moving forward?

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.350
Sometimes we just never
look closely at the things

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.150
that we do.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.160
And we think that are we
moving forward or backwards?

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.770
It doesn't give any
flavor to meat itself.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.030
So terroir is a
dish that I always

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:25.350
want to go back to the
original place where we are,

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:29.350
where the flavor belongs to.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:39.540
Then memory-- so this is a very
famous dish in our restaurant.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:45.158
So one day, one of the guests
asked me, Andre-- Every night,

00:42:45.158 --> 00:42:46.616
after I serve the
main course, I go

00:42:46.616 --> 00:42:50.720
to see the guests at the table
and see how are they doing.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.850
One of the guests one
day asked me, so Andre,

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.900
what's your childhood
memory of sweets?

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.960
And I stood there for 10
seconds and I said, nothing.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.250
Nothing-- I couldn't think
of anything that I liked.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:06.900
Oh my god.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.160
I have no childhood memories.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:09.552 --> 00:43:10.135
It's horrible.

00:43:10.135 --> 00:43:14.690
I couldn't think of
anything that I liked.

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.240
And that kind of
stuck on my chest

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.910
for a very, very long time.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:21.950
And so one day I was with my
wife and we were watching TV.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.790
And I said, hey, you know,
this is one thing I really

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:30.440
like is the raw cake dough.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.950
I don't like cake.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.740
I don't like
pancakes, or ganache,

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:38.730
or cupcakes or anything.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.480
I'm a very savory person.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.300
So even sometimes my
dessert is savory.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.200
Like we use green pea.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.992
We use beet root, celery--
are very savory person.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.290
So I say, yeah.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:59.360
Every time a family member
when the prepared a cake,

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.870
and there's always the last
bit of the raw cake dough.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:06.031
And that's my favorite part.

00:44:06.031 --> 00:44:11.240
And I don't want to the final
result. So I said, yeah.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.640
So that's my childhood memory.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.180
OK?

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.471
So I'm going to tell people
that's my childhood memory.

00:44:15.471 --> 00:44:19.700
So I will prepare-- I want
to do a raw cake batter

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.330
preparation just like that.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.810
Oh by the way, that's
the final product.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:26.065
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.065 --> 00:44:29.660
That's what we serve on
the table, seriously.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.310
This is not just an image.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.210
This is how we serve
in Restaurant Andre.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.550
And you have it like that.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:39.460
So I want people to just
put the egg in the milk.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.690
And then you have butter, flour.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.875
And you mix everything
together and eat it.

00:44:44.875 --> 00:44:46.340
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Are you serious?

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.090
ANDRE CHIANG: Yes.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:47.828
I'm very serious.

00:44:47.828 --> 00:44:52.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.790
It's called a DIY cake.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.140
That's what we serve.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.220
So I say-- you know,
that I can tell people

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.990
that that's the process.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:04.166
That's the thing that I
like in my childhood memory.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:13.410
So I went back and I did the
cake batter-- a real cake

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.410
batter-- and I try it.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:19.450
And try to catch my childhood
memorr-- my favorite part

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:23.090
of my memory when I was a kid.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.960
And I tried the raw cake dough.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.360
And I said, it doesn't
taste good at all.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.726
It tastes horrible.

00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:35.640
But why I cached that
memory as my child memory--

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.810
is that because of
the raw cake dough?

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:40.970
Maybe not.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.360
Is that the favorite
taste that I like?

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.100
No.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:48.242
But why is that something
that stuck on my mind

00:45:48.242 --> 00:45:52.080
and is something I remember--
is that's the moment when

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.040
my family gets together.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.082
And they will prepare the cake.

00:45:56.082 --> 00:45:58.040
And then I'll wait here
until they're finished.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.120
And I see the last bit
and I'll steal the tongs.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.630
And then I eat it.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.630
So what is memory?

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:08.880
Sometimes it might not be
the best thing in a world.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.050
But that's something that
is stuck on your memory.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:16.300
And every time you think about
it, that's this sweetest part.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.140
That's the best
part of the meal.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:27.560
So that's why we decided
to keep this dessert.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.077
Of course everything
is well-prepared.

00:46:31.077 --> 00:46:32.660
You're not going to
have a rotten egg,

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:38.700
and with the milk, and cook
the thing on the table.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.420
But yeah.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.570
That's one of the things
we do in our restaurants--

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:50.100
one of the very popular
dessert in our restaurant.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.820
So I guess that's
about Octaphilosophy.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:59.500
So at the end-- I want to
say this is what we do.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:05.360
And I hope that you all find
want your eight elements that

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.390
mean a lot to you.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:11.070
Maybe not eight--
12, 16, anything.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:18.470
But most important is we don't
travel and look for ideas.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.270
We don't look at what other
people do and look for ideas.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.270
The idea is in you.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.060
It's in everything that you do.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.530
And find the essence.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:28.335
It can be eight.

00:47:28.335 --> 00:47:29.140
It can be six.

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:34.310
It can be-- maybe your
idea came from oh my god.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.380
I got out and have a smoke.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.900
That's your Octaphilosophy.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.740
Find you eight elements
that means of lot to you.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.250
And the rest I think
will just come naturally.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:52.010
So discover your Octaphilosophy
and I hope your enjoy the book.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.921
Thank you very much.

00:47:52.921 --> 00:47:53.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:02.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: And now we
can have maybe one or two Q&amp;A.

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:06.910
And then afterwards,
if you got the book,

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.545
Chef Andre will be here
for signing the book.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.512
ANDRE CHIANG: Yes.

00:48:13.512 --> 00:48:14.470
Do you have a question?

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.840
AUDIENCE: So I've been to
your restaurant many times.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.180
I celebrate most of my beautiful
moments at your restaurant.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.120
So when you talk
about your dish,

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.100
I think it's time traveling
is the fois gras dish that you

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.552
make-- [INAUDIBLE] every day.

00:48:36.552 --> 00:48:39.460
And I saw the uniqueness
in your experience

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.800
with the black strip.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.000
I think the decor in your
restaurant-- and [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.510
star and the big mirror
on your third floor.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.330
And I also know
your wife as well.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:57.078
ANDRE CHIANG: Uh.

00:48:57.078 --> 00:48:57.578
OK.

00:48:57.578 --> 00:48:59.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.660
AUDIENCE: I've been to
your restaurant many times.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.250
I try to understand
how you view a brand.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.590
Are you going to
continue to stay unique?

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:13.750
Or are you going to be another
Joel Robuchon or Daniel Boulud.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.930
Are you going to
franchise your restaurant?

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.324
ANDRE CHIANG: OK.

00:49:17.324 --> 00:49:18.490
That's a very good question.

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.060
Definitely not.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.950
There's only one Andre.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.420
And Andre has to be Andre.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.060
Right?

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.210
So it's hard to--
personally, I'm

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:35.330
someone that is very, very
against that kind of pace.

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:39.490
So although we have--
along the way in my career,

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.200
I've come across so
many great talents.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.570
So many great chefs--
that just like

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.110
when we were I first started,
and no one knows who Andre is,

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.430
but you have someone,
good friends that say,

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:54.560
Andre you're really talented.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.315
You should have
your own restaurant.

00:49:58.315 --> 00:50:02.870
I'll lend you money and you
open your own restaurant.

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:05.608
When you have money, you
return it back to me.

00:50:05.608 --> 00:50:06.610
That's how I started.

00:50:09.681 --> 00:50:13.020
Along the way I met so
many great talents--

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:19.450
so many great chefs-- that I
think that they shouldn't just

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.290
work for me under Andre.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:25.490
So I want them to open
their own restaurants

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:27.820
and they have their
own brand that

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.930
has nothing to do with Andre.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.070
So for us, we started
six years ago.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.720
We have Restaurant Andre.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.320
And now we have in total
three other restaurants

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.610
in Singapore-- one in
Paris, on in Teipei.

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:45.460
But none of them are
under the name of Andre.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:49.140
And my card doesn't have
all these restaurants name.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.880
You don't find it
on the website.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.650
None of the restaurants
serve the same dish,

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:58.660
the same crockery, the same
design, the same pricing.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.190
Everything is completely fresh.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:03.590
And I think that's
something important of us--

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.210
is every restaurant
needs to have

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.610
their own DNA,
their own concept.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.840
And it's always the
chef is in front.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.650
For me, I'm just the supporter.

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:14.620
And I think they should
do their own thing

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:18.680
and they should be the
man of their own concept.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.070
That's actually
the least thing I

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:24.430
can do that to support
his great talent.

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:26.090
So there will be only one Andre.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.910
And you won't see Andre
Sydney, Andre Istanbul.

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.730
Thank you.

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any
other questions?

00:51:43.189 --> 00:51:43.730
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:44.990
My name is Lionel.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:46.790
Thank you for sharing with us.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:50.640
I've been to your restaurant
once, not as many times as him.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.460
And I really like the
way that you think.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.760
And just from hearing
you share this,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.150
I can see the passion
that you have.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:02.170
I'm curious on your journey, how
did you know from the start--

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:04.670
or did you know from the start
that you wanted to be a chef?

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:06.430
And how did know this
was your calling?

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.490
Tell us a little bit of
more about that journey.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.080
ANDRE CHIANG: OK.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.780
So as you know, I grew
up in an artist family.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.270
So I didn't know that
I would become a chef.

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:17.840
I wanted to be a potter.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.080
I wanted to be a potter
and I want to do sculpture.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.580
That's what I liked
when I was little.

00:52:25.466 --> 00:52:29.510
My brother and my sister, they
are much-- seven years apart

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.010
from me-- so they are
much older than I.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.680
So they already found
what they want to do.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.890
And so my mom was running
a restaurant in Japan--

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:41.170
a Chinese restaurant--
and so she was like,

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:44.420
that's the last
kid that probably

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.930
will take over my business.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.340
I'd better try to
guide him somehow.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:53.170
And make sure he doesn't
go in the other direction.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:54.420
So yeah.

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.370
That's how I thought OK.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:59.800
I'll be the one to take
up my mom's business.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.950
And I kind of liked cooking.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:05.100
So I left Taiwan when I was 13.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.850
And I stayed two
years with my mom.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.260
And I learned the
things from her.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:14.400
And so I can eventually
take over the restaurant.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.330
And after two years I decided
to learn something different.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:18.000
And I said, OK.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.740
I'm going to learn
French cuisine.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.900
So in fact I don't know-- I
don't have an idea that I want

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.555
to be best chef in the world.

00:53:27.555 --> 00:53:29.780
I want to do French cuisine.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.490
I don't have an idea.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:33.304
I just said OK.

00:53:33.304 --> 00:53:34.970
I want to take over
my mom's restaurant.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:37.670
And I better learn
something-- not only from her,

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:40.850
but from the best of the best.

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:44.480
So I can bring back different
idea and try to help my mom

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.590
and change the concept and
learn how to be better.

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:51.580
Once I arrived in France--
it's completely different.

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:56.550
It's totally opposite of
what I learned from my mom.

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.890
First, that's my mom.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:01.430
Second it's a
Chinese restaurant.

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:06.990
So she'll teach you how
to make things crispy,

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:14.550
how to make that skin shiny and
how to make it crispy and hot.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:18.730
So it's very, very
technical, very technical.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.880
And second thing is
she said, OK Andre.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.380
don't?

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.485
Try to be creative.

00:54:23.485 --> 00:54:25.200
Don't try to be funny.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.956
Just do the thing that
I asked you to do.

00:54:27.956 --> 00:54:29.720
This is the recipe.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.220
OK.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.560
So I don't want you
to change anything.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.590
I want you to continue.

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.320
I don't want you
to change anything.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.670
And I went to France.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:39.620
And it's a totally opposite way.

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.251
My chef asked me, so
what do you think?

00:54:43.251 --> 00:54:44.000
What do you think?

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.190
You like it?

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.833
You don't?

00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:47.330
Why?

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.110
And when you receive the
vegetables and you smell it.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:53.084
And he said tomorrow, I'll
take you to see the farmer.

00:54:53.084 --> 00:54:54.000
You'll see the farmer.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.900
And you say, OK this
is Uncle Gilbert

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.670
And this his vegetables.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.860
And he lives with
his two daughters.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.170
And it's so emotional.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:06.090
Everything is so emotional.

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:08.700
So when you create a dish,
you think about Uncle Gilbert

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.616
and his two daughters.

00:55:09.616 --> 00:55:13.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.207
So it's very different.

00:55:15.207 --> 00:55:16.290
It's very, very different.

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.110
So I say, wow.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.330
That's the heart I
delved into-- all

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:26.300
of the process, all the creative
process of French cooking.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.035
The culture, the history--
everything is connected.

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.330
So I talked to my mom, I said
that's something I want to do.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:38.200
That's really-- I feel so free.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.660
I feel I can tell
people what I think.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.240
I can put my
imagination in the dish.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.820
And it's all connected
to everything.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.370
So my mom said OK.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:52.010
If you like it, just continue.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.260
And so that's how
I just continued

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.060
my path of French cuisine.

00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:01.620
And I just stayed
there for 17 years.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:08.370
So I never really planned
like five years, 10 years down

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:12.890
the road, what am I going to do.

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:17.830
So I'm still doing what I do.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:22.160
Right now I never think
of doing other things.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.840
[INAUDIBLE] I like it.

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:31.410
Everybody has one thing that he
does better than other people.

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:32.840
For me, it's cooking.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:38.430
So I wanted to continue and do
what I do, and share my idea.

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:42.190
And sometimes I feel
I think differently.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:46.460
So I need my team
to balance me out.

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.070
So yeah.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:52.220
Thank you.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.010
OK?

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:54.035
Another one?

00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:56.240
AUDIENCE: Is your mom's
restaurant still running?

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.875
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:57.875 --> 00:56:59.700
ANDRE CHIANG: No,
because they're

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.900
looking for a head chef.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:02.451
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:02.451 --> 00:57:02.950
No.

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:05.840
My mom retired.

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.290
Once she knows that the
son is not coming back

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:11.120
to take over the restaurant.

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:17.142
And so she said--
the three of us, me,

00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:18.600
my brother, and my
sister-- they're

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.090
all good at what they do.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:22.510
So my mom can retire.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:26.690
There's no need to--
and then she said, OK.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:28.160
Then I'll just retire.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:34.560
She left but she was here
for my lunch yesterday.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.880
And then she went back
to Taipei this morning

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.720
before I came here.

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:48.048
FEMALE SPEAKER: One
last question, please.

00:57:48.048 --> 00:57:49.173
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Andre.

00:57:49.173 --> 00:57:50.672
I've been to your
restaurant before.

00:57:50.672 --> 00:57:52.566
And it's fantastic.

00:57:52.566 --> 00:57:55.980
So today is the
highlight of my day.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:59.670
And my question is really
around your creative process.

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.795
Your food is amazingly created.

00:58:01.795 --> 00:58:04.010
Have there been
times where you must

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:05.372
stuck in the creative process?

00:58:05.372 --> 00:58:08.590
And what do you do to
get out of that rut?

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.880
ANDRE CHIANG: OK.

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.500
Just a quick story-- this
one day, a couple of years

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:19.230
back-- I think it's the second
year that the Restaurant

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.290
Andre opened.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:23.450
So one day, we have
the guests arrive.

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:25.310
And the restaurant is packed.

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:29.460
And more than half
of the restaurant

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.900
is all repeated guests.

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.750
So all of repeated
guests are always

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.410
wanting to try a few new
dishes and different things.

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.160
As I start to do--
and I said oh my god.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.760
Everybody's a repeated
guest in this room.

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.100
So I was said, OK.

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.640
The kitchen is
running like crazy.

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.110
And everybody is running around.

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:50.660
And I said stop.

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:53.757
We're going to change
the entire menu tonight.

00:58:53.757 --> 00:58:54.840
And everybody's like what?

00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:00.470
Because we are in the middle
of the service and everyone's

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.570
running.

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:07.580
I said we're going to change the
entire menu because we have to.

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.180
And everybody stopped for
four five seconds-- OK.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.710
And they run the other way.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:15.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:20.610
That's the moment that--
before I always think back

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:21.830
I can do everything.

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:24.820
I can create.

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:27.680
I can execute everything
the way I want it.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:32.960
And I can do it 100%
But that was the moment

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.150
that I suddenly realized
that with my team,

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:39.790
we can reach 120%.

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:44.030
It's something that I cannot
do without their support.

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.310
I can have thousands of ideas.

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:49.120
But I need good execution.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.760
And that's how fast-- they
can come in and say, OK.

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.700
Chef, later we're
going to do this.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.300
And we're going to do that.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.842
And later, OK you
want the duck dish.

00:59:56.842 --> 00:59:57.341
OK.

00:59:57.341 --> 00:59:59.220
Then we can do this
and we can do that.

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.000
And that's when we put
everything together.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.980
And I feel so powerful.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.520
The moment that I
feel so powerful

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.740
is when I'm in the
kitchen because I

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.990
have my whole team with me.

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:14.400
And they're more
critical than I do.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400
They say chef, no.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.560
I don't like this.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.980
We should best do this.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.810
They're more critical than I do.

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.400
They give me a lot of pressure.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.300
That's how I enjoy it.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.305
For me, it's really
the teamwork.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.860
I work a lot with me team.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.790
We sit down.

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:38.620
We talk about it.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.870
We talk about different ideas.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:43.900
So it's not just Andre.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.070
We have a good team that
supports every idea that I do.

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:51.810
We're not the hierarchy.

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:54.990
We're not the on man
show and say I want this.

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:56.120
And get it done.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.000
No.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.200
We discuss.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.670
In our kitchen, we have
one small white board.

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:04.670
It's probably this size.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:13.230
And everybody can write
a unique combination

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.730
of flavors or anything on it.

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:22.220
So we pass by that white
board 300 times a day.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.560
So every time you walk
by you'll see someone

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:30.150
wrote duck egg and
vanilla and lobster.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.050
So you're like whoa.

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:33.003
What is that?

01:01:33.003 --> 01:01:35.320
It makes you think
Is that a dessert?

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.030
Is that a dish?

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:41.420
So I think maybe
is an appetizer.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.600
And he might thinks
it's a main course.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.650
So everybody can write
the ideas that they have,

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:54.190
or just three components, not
detail on the white board.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:58.280
And so that's how we
get all the ideas.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.500
And we pass by that
white board every day.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:06.295
And in a book, there is one
picture on the white board--

01:02:06.295 --> 01:02:07.890
a dirty white board.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:12.180
And we all put our idea
as we pass by every day.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:18.400
And that's where I get
our inspiration from.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:18.950
Thank you.

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:23.500
[APPLAUSE]
