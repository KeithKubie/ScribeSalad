00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.656
Voiecover:One angle whose tangent is half

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:05.544
is 0.46 radians.

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:09.113
So we're saying that the
tangent right over here is...

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:10.896
So the tangent...

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:12.169
So we're gonna write this down.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.945
So we're saying that the
tangent of 0.46 radians

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:18.417
is equal to half.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.217
And another way of
thinking about the tangent

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:22.104
of an angle is that's the slope of

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:23.520
that angle's terminal ray.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.409
So it's the slope of
this ray right over here.

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:26.800
Yeah that makes sense

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.879
that that slope is about half.

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:32.663
Now what other angles
have a tangent of 1 half?

00:00:32.663 --> 00:00:33.759
So let's look at these choices.

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:37.448
So this is our original
angle, 0.46 radians,

00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:39.001
plus pi over 2.

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.414
If you think in degrees, pi is 180.

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:43.568
pi over 2 is 90 degrees.

00:00:43.568 --> 00:00:45.782
So this one...

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:47.374
Actually let me do in a color

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:48.246
you're more likely to see.

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:53.670
This one is gonna look like this.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.982
Where this is an angle of pi over 2.

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:00.254
And just eyeballing it,

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:02.214
you immediately see that
the slope of this ray

00:01:02.214 --> 00:01:04.845
is very different than
the slope of this ray

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:06.349
right over here.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.022
In fact they look like they are.

00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:09.813
They are perpendicular
because they have an angle

00:01:09.813 --> 00:01:11.541
of pi over 2 between them.

00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.285
But they're definitely not

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:15.876
going to have the same tangent.

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.626
They don't have the same slope.

00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:21.449
Let's think about pi minus 0.46.

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:23.064
So that's essentially pi is going

00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:24.721
along the positive x axis.

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:26.201
You go all the way around.

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:28.573
Or half way around to your pi radians.

00:01:28.573 --> 00:01:30.819
But then we're gonna subtract 0.46.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.963
So it's gonna look something like this.

00:01:33.963 --> 00:01:36.219
It's gonna look something like that

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.347
where this is 0.46 that
we have subtracted.

00:01:40.347 --> 00:01:41.299
Another way to think about it,

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.370
if we take our original terminal ray

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.139
and we flip it over the y axis,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.147
we get to this terminal
ray right over here.

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:51.106
And you could immediately
see that the slope

00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:53.110
of the terminal ray is not the same

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.406
as the slope of this one,

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:55.746
of our first one, of our original,

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:58.998
in fact they look like the
negatives of each other.

00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:01.984
So we can rule that one out as well.

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:05.936
0.46 plus pi or pi plus 0.46.

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:08.624
So that's going to take us...

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:11.025
If you add pi to this you're essentially

00:02:11.025 --> 00:02:12.592
going half way around the unit circle

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:14.752
and you're getting to a point that is...

00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:17.097
Or you're forming a ray that is collinear

00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:19.096
with the original ray.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:22.112
So that's that angle right over here.

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:28.456
So pi plus 0.46 is this
entire angle right over there.

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:30.273
And when you just look at this ray,

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:31.896
you see its collinear is going to have the

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:35.459
exact same slope as the terminal ray for

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.665
the 0.46 radion.

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:40.184
So just that tells you that the tangent

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:41.528
is going to be the same.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.057
So I could check that there.

00:02:43.057 --> 00:02:45.281
And in previous videos when we explore

00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:47.089
the symmetries of the tangent function,

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:48.465
we in fact saw that.

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:50.849
That if you took an angle
and you add pi to it,

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.633
you're going to have the same tangent.

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:53.841
And if you wanna dig a little bit deeper,

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.097
I encourage you to look at that video

00:02:55.097 --> 00:02:58.249
on the symmetries of
unit circle symmetries

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.349
for the tangent function.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.969
So let's look at these other choices.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.664
2 pi minus 0.46.

00:03:04.664 --> 00:03:07.073
So 2 pi...

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:09.033
If this is 0 degrees,

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:13.665
2 pi gets you back to the positive x axis

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:16.185
and then you're going to subtract 0.46.

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:19.992
So that's going to be this
angle right over here.

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.529
And that looks like it
has the negative slope

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.976
of this original ray right up here.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:28.745
So these aren't going to
have the same tangent.

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:29.663
Now this one,

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:32.991
you're taking 0.46 and
you're adding 2 pi.

00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:38.440
So you're taking 0.46 and
then you're adding 2 pi

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.463
which essentially is just going

00:03:39.463 --> 00:03:40.751
around the unit circle once

00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:42.679
and you get to the exact same point.

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.232
So you add 2 pi to any angle measure,

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:46.151
you're going to not only have the

00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:47.743
same tangent value,

00:03:47.743 --> 00:03:49.952
you're gonna have the same
sine value, cosine value

00:03:49.952 --> 00:03:51.847
because you're essentially
going back around

00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:54.705
to the exact same angle
when you add 2 pi.

00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:58.705
So this is definitely
also going to be true.
