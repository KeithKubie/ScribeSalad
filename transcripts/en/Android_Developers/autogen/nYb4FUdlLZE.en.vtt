to just give you a brief overview layer

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
to just give you a brief overview layer
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760
to just give you a brief overview layer
the land of the designer to give you an

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
the land of the designer to give you an
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.350

so one of the things you can do is in
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.289
so one of the things you can do is in
Dracula mode

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
Dracula mode
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359
Dracula mode
I'm sure a lot of people are like the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
I'm sure a lot of people are like the
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.969
I'm sure a lot of people are like the
ocular mode and we could go back to the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
ocular mode and we could go back to the
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.420
ocular mode and we could go back to the
other one now we have on the left hand

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
other one now we have on the left hand
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.479
other one now we have on the left hand
side the palette that's basically where

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
side the palette that's basically where
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.040
side the palette that's basically where
you can just drag and drop your your

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
you can just drag and drop your your
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.280
you can just drag and drop your your
widgets onto your design surface

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
widgets onto your design surface
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.119
widgets onto your design surface
then the componentry the then comes the

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129
then the componentry the then comes the
 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.009
then the componentry the then comes the
inspector and we'll have much more about

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019
inspector and we'll have much more about
 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.280
inspector and we'll have much more about
that later

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290
that later
 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.140
that later
then the core design surface and there's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150
then the core design surface and there's
 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.960
then the core design surface and there's
a toolbar we also have a right-click

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
a toolbar we also have a right-click
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.349
a toolbar we also have a right-click
menu so people a lot of people kind of

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359
menu so people a lot of people kind of
 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.940
menu so people a lot of people kind of
forget that there's a right-click menu

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
forget that there's a right-click menu
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.460
forget that there's a right-click menu
if you select an object you can click on

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470
if you select an object you can click on
 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.649
if you select an object you can click on
it and right-click

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659
it and right-click
 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.069
it and right-click
you'll get useful actions associated

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079
you'll get useful actions associated
 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.740
you'll get useful actions associated
with what you've selected the other

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
with what you've selected the other
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.899
with what you've selected the other
thing that can you can switch to is

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909
thing that can you can switch to is
 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.710
thing that can you can switch to is
blueprint mode you can also switch to

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
blueprint mode you can also switch to
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.879
blueprint mode you can also switch to
two screens at once the blueprint mode

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889
two screens at once the blueprint mode
 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.140
two screens at once the blueprint mode
is is kind of a a blueprint as a rough

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
is is kind of a a blueprint as a rough
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.339
is is kind of a a blueprint as a rough
outline a sketch of your UI the design

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349
outline a sketch of your UI the design
 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.210
outline a sketch of your UI the design
surface is actually being rendered in

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
surface is actually being rendered in
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.300
surface is actually being rendered in
layout Lib which is a sort of emulator

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310
layout Lib which is a sort of emulator
 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.110
layout Lib which is a sort of emulator
of Android so one of the things that we

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
of Android so one of the things that we
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.920
of Android so one of the things that we
we also can do is use loupe use the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930
we also can do is use loupe use the
 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.390
we also can do is use loupe use the
designer in the XML editor mode so if

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400
designer in the XML editor mode so if
 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.259
designer in the XML editor mode so if
you are in the XML editor and you press

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269
you are in the XML editor and you press
 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.569
you are in the XML editor and you press
the preview you get essentially a full

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579
the preview you get essentially a full
 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.610
the preview you get essentially a full
design mode right there notice if you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620
design mode right there notice if you
 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.460
design mode right there notice if you
select it'll actually navigate you to

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
select it'll actually navigate you to
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.280
select it'll actually navigate you to
the right elements in the XML you can

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290
the right elements in the XML you can
 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.539
the right elements in the XML you can
switch to sleep design or blueprint you

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549
switch to sleep design or blueprint you
 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.849
switch to sleep design or blueprint you
can also expand it a little bit pull out

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859
can also expand it a little bit pull out
 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.319
can also expand it a little bit pull out
the palette and you can actually just

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329
the palette and you can actually just
 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.879
the palette and you can actually just
drag a element right there on the screen

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889
drag a element right there on the screen
 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.649
drag a element right there on the screen
notice this actually created the XML at

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659
notice this actually created the XML at
 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.610
notice this actually created the XML at
the bottom and in fact if you edit the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
the bottom and in fact if you edit the
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.619
the bottom and in fact if you edit the
XML in this case I'll just delete the

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629
XML in this case I'll just delete the
 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.210
XML in this case I'll just delete the
XML it goes from the design service

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220
XML it goes from the design service
 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.550
XML it goes from the design service
instantly so you get a real-time

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560
instantly so you get a real-time
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.670
instantly so you get a real-time
feedback in both directions simply like

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680
feedback in both directions simply like
 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.149
feedback in both directions simply like
that so that's just a brief introduction

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159
that so that's just a brief introduction
 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.310
that so that's just a brief introduction
just to give you some of the concepts

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
just to give you some of the concepts

had to reemployment a custom view just
 

00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:34.819
had to reemployment a custom view just
to implement a ratio well we just added

00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:34.829
to implement a ratio well we just added
 

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:37.689

it in constructed from the get-go

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:37.699
it in constructed from the get-go
 

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:42.949
it in constructed from the get-go
and last but not least we introduced

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959
and last but not least we introduced
 

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.350
and last but not least we introduced
constraint set the idea with constraint

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360
constraint set the idea with constraint
 

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.309
constraint set the idea with constraint
set is that now we we have layout that

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:49.319
set is that now we we have layout that
 

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:51.799
set is that now we we have layout that
is flat there is no Yaqui necessary to

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:51.809
is flat there is no Yaqui necessary to
 

00:09:51.809 --> 00:09:54.739
is flat there is no Yaqui necessary to
create your layout in a sense you end up

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:54.749
create your layout in a sense you end up
 

00:09:54.749 --> 00:09:57.199
create your layout in a sense you end up
with a bunch of widgets at the same

00:09:57.199 --> 00:09:57.209
with a bunch of widgets at the same
 

00:09:57.209 --> 00:10:01.009
with a bunch of widgets at the same
level and we apply in order to create

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019
level and we apply in order to create
 

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:02.840
level and we apply in order to create
the layout so to get the result that you

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:02.850
the layout so to get the result that you
 

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.989
the layout so to get the result that you
want to apply those constraints so

00:10:05.989 --> 00:10:05.999
want to apply those constraints so
 

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:09.619
want to apply those constraints so
constraint set the idea is simply that

00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:09.629
constraint set the idea is simply that
 

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:13.160
constraint set the idea is simply that
we gather all those constraints and put

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.170
we gather all those constraints and put
 

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.350
we gather all those constraints and put
them into that object into a constraint

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360
them into that object into a constraint
 

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.730
them into that object into a constraint
set object so you can create a

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740
set object so you can create a
 

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.939
set object so you can create a
constraint set that embed all the

00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:19.949
constraint set that embed all the
 

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:22.009
constraint set that embed all the
constraints of your layout you can embed

00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019
constraints of your layout you can embed
 

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:23.660
constraints of your layout you can embed
you can create it from a layout file

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:23.670
you can create it from a layout file
 

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.410
you can create it from a layout file
from the live view hierarchy and the

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420
from the live view hierarchy and the
 

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.389
from the live view hierarchy and the
fact that you can do that is actually

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399
fact that you can do that is actually
 

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:32.869
fact that you can do that is actually
really really powerful because I just

00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:32.879
really really powerful because I just
 

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:35.359
really really powerful because I just
give you a simple example you can simply

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:35.369
give you a simple example you can simply
 

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.210
give you a simple example you can simply
just you know toggle one set of

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220
just you know toggle one set of
 

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.460
just you know toggle one set of
constraints with another one so it's

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:40.470
constraints with another one so it's
 

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.129
constraints with another one so it's
very easy to tweak your UI at runtime

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:43.139
very easy to tweak your UI at runtime
 

00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:46.819
very easy to tweak your UI at runtime
and even more you can specify and create

00:10:46.819 --> 00:10:46.829
and even more you can specify and create
 

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:49.429
and even more you can specify and create
your layers in the comfort of the layout

00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:49.439
your layers in the comfort of the layout
 

00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:52.759

editor graphically and at runtime in

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:52.769
editor graphically and at runtime in
 

00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:54.739
editor graphically and at runtime in
your program you can decide which layout

00:10:54.739 --> 00:10:54.749
your program you can decide which layout
 

00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:56.900
your program you can decide which layout
you want so this is a very powerful

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:56.910
you want so this is a very powerful
 

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.230
you want so this is a very powerful
concept and we'll come back to that and

00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.240
concept and we'll come back to that and
 

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.409
concept and we'll come back to that and
finally today we just released 1.1 beta

00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:03.419

and decided about a neighbor so should

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440
and decided about a neighbor so should
 

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.870

be very easy for you to integrate in

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880
be very easy for you to integrate in
 

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.000
be very easy for you to integrate in
your workflow so what did we add in 1.1

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.010
your workflow so what did we add in 1.1
 

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.930
your workflow so what did we add in 1.1
we did first the concept of barriers and

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:16.940
we did first the concept of barriers and
 

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.090
we did first the concept of barriers and
barrier in essence is a way to say just

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100
barrier in essence is a way to say just
 

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.730
barrier in essence is a way to say just
stack on a set of widgets take the

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740
stack on a set of widgets take the
 

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.190
stack on a set of widgets take the
maximum or the minimum of an edge and

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200
maximum or the minimum of an edge and
 

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.870
maximum or the minimum of an edge and
that allows you to create a lot of UI

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880
that allows you to create a lot of UI
 

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.210
that allows you to create a lot of UI
that previously with construct layout

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220
that previously with construct layout
 

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.500
that previously with construct layout
1.0 would have been tricky to do we also

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.510
1.0 would have been tricky to do we also
 

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.860
1.0 would have been tricky to do we also
added another helper class that's called

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:39.870
added another helper class that's called
 

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.870
added another helper class that's called
the group which follow is relatively

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880
the group which follow is relatively
 

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.670
the group which follow is relatively
limited but we have some ideas on how to

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680
limited but we have some ideas on how to
 

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.920
limited but we have some ideas on how to
improve it but the concept is basically

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:45.930
improve it but the concept is basically
 

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.310
improve it but the concept is basically
you can have a set of widgets that are

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320
you can have a set of widgets that are
 

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.590
you can have a set of widgets that are
you know stored into that group and you

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600
you know stored into that group and you
 

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.500
you know stored into that group and you
can set for example the visibility of

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:54.510
can set for example the visibility of
 

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.020
can set for example the visibility of
the group so you don't have any more to

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.030
the group so you don't have any more to
 

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.480
the group so you don't have any more to
maintain yourself a list of widgets just

00:11:59.480 --> 00:11:59.490
maintain yourself a list of widgets just
 

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.310
maintain yourself a list of widgets just
so that you can you know toggle the

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320
so that you can you know toggle the
 

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.380
so that you can you know toggle the
visibility in one go you can just

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:03.390
visibility in one go you can just
 

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.120
visibility in one go you can just
specify that in XML and you know any

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.130
specify that in XML and you know any
 

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.970
specify that in XML and you know any
visibility state on the group will

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980
visibility state on the group will
 

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.520
visibility state on the group will
basically be applied to the elements in

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:13.530
basically be applied to the elements in
 

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:18.110
basically be applied to the elements in
the group we also have a new concept the

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120
the group we also have a new concept the
 

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.450
the group we also have a new concept the
placeholder concept and we'll cover that

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:20.460
placeholder concept and we'll cover that
 

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.960
placeholder concept and we'll cover that
in in more details later but I think

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:23.970
in in more details later but I think
 

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.380
in in more details later but I think
you'll like it

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:24.390
you'll like it
 

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.960
you'll like it
and finally we added a couple of tweaks

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:26.970
and finally we added a couple of tweaks
 

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.210
and finally we added a couple of tweaks
in the way we deal with constraints on

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220
in the way we deal with constraints on
 

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.640
in the way we deal with constraints on
dimensions so if you ever wanted to

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:31.650
dimensions so if you ever wanted to
 

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.480
dimensions so if you ever wanted to
create a view with we'd was 30% of the

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:35.490
create a view with we'd was 30% of the
 

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.670
create a view with we'd was 30% of the
screen you could do that but it was a

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680
screen you could do that but it was a
 

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.380
screen you could do that but it was a
little complex with guidelines because

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:39.390
little complex with guidelines because
 

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.830
little complex with guidelines because
guidelines are a low current positioning

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:42.840
guidelines are a low current positioning
 

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.420
guidelines are a low current positioning
but now you can just do it simply

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:44.430
but now you can just do it simply
 

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:49.670
but now you can just do it simply
directly on the widget and now we're

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680
directly on the widget and now we're
 

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.040
directly on the widget and now we're
going to cover a little bit of the new

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.050
going to cover a little bit of the new
 

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.200
going to cover a little bit of the new
features in Android studio itself yeah

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.210
features in Android studio itself yeah
 

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.330
features in Android studio itself yeah
so it essentially to give you a kind of

00:12:59.330 --> 00:12:59.340
so it essentially to give you a kind of
 

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.600
so it essentially to give you a kind of
more detail inside of Android studios we

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:02.610
more detail inside of Android studios we
 

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.440
more detail inside of Android studios we
have a set of tools some of them we'll

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:06.450
have a set of tools some of them we'll
 

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.540
have a set of tools some of them we'll
talk a little bit more about in later

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:08.550
talk a little bit more about in later
 

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.670
talk a little bit more about in later
but we have a series of them that are

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680
but we have a series of them that are
 

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.930
but we have a series of them that are
alignment type tools and arrangement I

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940
alignment type tools and arrangement I
 

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.570
alignment type tools and arrangement I
tools and we have some stuff to add

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:20.580
tools and we have some stuff to add
 

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.750
tools and we have some stuff to add
guidelines and we'll see more on those

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:22.760
guidelines and we'll see more on those
 

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.150
guidelines and we'll see more on those
here's also exist the right-click menu

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160
here's also exist the right-click menu
 

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.730
here's also exist the right-click menu
which is actually a lot of them are

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740
which is actually a lot of them are
 

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.020
which is actually a lot of them are
existing tools now here's a little

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.030
existing tools now here's a little
 

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.730
existing tools now here's a little
example of what you can do with the

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740
example of what you can do with the
 

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.950
example of what you can do with the
tools so in this particular example I

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:36.960
tools so in this particular example I
 

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.570
tools so in this particular example I
create a chain I Center align all of

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:41.580
create a chain I Center align all of
 

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.030
create a chain I Center align all of
them and then I use the inference to

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040
them and then I use the inference to
 

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.580
them and then I use the inference to
automatically connect them so in three

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:46.590
automatically connect them so in three
 

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.920
automatically connect them so in three
clicks I have just essentially made like

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:48.930
clicks I have just essentially made like
 

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:54.950
clicks I have just essentially made like
a top layer layout now one of the other

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:54.960
a top layer layout now one of the other
 

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.900
a top layer layout now one of the other
things that has we've done a lot of work

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:56.910
things that has we've done a lot of work
 

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.300
things that has we've done a lot of work
on is the inspector those little pluses

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.310
on is the inspector those little pluses
 

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.280
on is the inspector those little pluses
you see I'm clicking on they

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:03.290
you see I'm clicking on they
 

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.140

automatically cast array and connect to

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:06.150
automatically cast array and connect to
 

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.140
automatically cast array and connect to
the to the adjacent surface so it's a

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:09.150
the to the adjacent surface so it's a
 

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.820
the to the adjacent surface so it's a
quick handy way of just making the

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:10.830
quick handy way of just making the
 

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.650
quick handy way of just making the
connections without actually having to

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660
connections without actually having to
 

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.650
connections without actually having to
drag out little lines it can really

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660
drag out little lines it can really
 

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.600
drag out little lines it can really
speed up a lot of connections and then

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.610
speed up a lot of connections and then
 

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.150
speed up a lot of connections and then
playing with all the other features of

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160
playing with all the other features of
 

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.190
playing with all the other features of
the inspector I can change the bias I

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.200
the inspector I can change the bias I
 

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.200
the inspector I can change the bias I
can then go and kill connections all

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:27.210
can then go and kill connections all
 

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.500
can then go and kill connections all
over again

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:29.510
over again
 

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.210
over again
and it doesn't if they both work

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220
and it doesn't if they both work
 

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.370
and it doesn't if they both work
together so I'll just move it back over

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380
together so I'll just move it back over
 

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.200
together so I'll just move it back over
and the loop starts all over again

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.210
and the loop starts all over again
 

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.570
and the loop starts all over again
the inference I you so let me do a

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:38.580
the inference I you so let me do a
 

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.410
the inference I you so let me do a
little bit of the inference before it's

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420
little bit of the inference before it's
 

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.780
little bit of the inference before it's
essentially based on a probabilistic

what is the most likely thing it would
want to connect to if they're lined

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:53.700
want to connect to if they're lined
 

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.700
want to connect to if they're lined
above each other it's more likely to

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:55.710
above each other it's more likely to
 

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.220
above each other it's more likely to
align that way if it's directly on the

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.230
align that way if it's directly on the
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.450
align that way if it's directly on the
center the little icon is it will it

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:02.460
center the little icon is it will it
 

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.630
center the little icon is it will it
will want to connect it one of the cool

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:05.640
will want to connect it one of the cool
 

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.060
will want to connect it one of the cool
things about it is that you'll notice I

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:08.070
things about it is that you'll notice I
 

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.890
things about it is that you'll notice I
can make connections and then use

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:09.900
can make connections and then use
 

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.630
can make connections and then use
inference to finish it off and

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:11.640
inference to finish it off and
 

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.560
inference to finish it off and
essentially complete my UI so the the

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:15.570
essentially complete my UI so the the
 

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.580
essentially complete my UI so the the
ones that I care about a lot I do by

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:19.590
ones that I care about a lot I do by
 

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.100
ones that I care about a lot I do by

that we talked about that they don't

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.170
that we talked about that they don't

design design features but as those

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680
design design features but as those
 

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.280
design design features but as those
features become stable I will work on

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:36.290
features become stable I will work on
 

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.580
features become stable I will work on
bring them into the inference engine so

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:39.590
bring them into the inference engine so
 

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.280
bring them into the inference engine so
here is an example it inferred and as

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:42.290
here is an example it inferred and as
 

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.610
here is an example it inferred and as
you can see it detected that it was

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:45.620
you can see it detected that it was
 

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.270
you can see it detected that it was
centered and attached there it changes

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:48.280
centered and attached there it changes
 

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:54.210
centered and attached there it changes

things like that it just try so fix it
now one of the other things to remember

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:58.520
now one of the other things to remember
 

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.810
now one of the other things to remember
here is it's not a beautifier it is not

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:01.820
here is it's not a beautifier it is not
 

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.840
here is it's not a beautifier it is not
going to align things for you and

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:04.850
going to align things for you and
 

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.960
going to align things for you and
arrange say it tries very hard to keep

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:07.970
arrange say it tries very hard to keep

arrange say it tries very hard to keep
exactly where you put things so I've

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:10.490
exactly where you put things so I've
 

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.670
exactly where you put things so I've
seen a few cases where people just

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680
seen a few cases where people just
 

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.120
seen a few cases where people just
sloppy put things on this on the UI and

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.130
sloppy put things on this on the UI and
 

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.280
sloppy put things on this on the UI and
then hit inference and they get bad

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:18.290
then hit inference and they get bad
 

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:23.530
then hit inference and they get bad
results because it's not organized so

just remember to do that when you're

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:25.550
just remember to do that when you're
 

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.670
just remember to do that when you're
you're thinking about it what are the

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680
you're thinking about it what are the
 

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.940
you're thinking about it what are the
things that we like and we used is the

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:30.950
things that we like and we used is the
 

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.180
things that we like and we used is the
inspector just so me use it there's

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:34.190
inspector just so me use it there's
 

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.460
inspector just so me use it there's
another mode that you can get if you hit

another mode that you can get if you hit
 

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.960
another mode that you can get if you hit
the little arrow at the top which is

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:37.970
the little arrow at the top which is

this which is all the constraints that's
 

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.790
this which is all the constraints that's
kind of a pain to use quite frankly so

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800
kind of a pain to use quite frankly so
 

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.620
kind of a pain to use quite frankly so
we've been working on something to try

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:47.630
we've been working on something to try
 

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.900
we've been working on something to try
and make that a little easier and how

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:49.910
and make that a little easier and how
 

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.430
and make that a little easier and how
you would use it and how we would

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440
you would use it and how we would
 

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.170
you would use it and how we would
interact with it and we call it

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:55.180
interact with it and we call it
 

00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:01.300
interact with it and we call it
internally we call it slice so imagine

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:01.310
internally we call it slice so imagine
 

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.310
internally we call it slice so imagine
you whenever you have a layout you will

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:03.320
you whenever you have a layout you will
 

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.280
you whenever you have a layout you will
actually have associated with the layout

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:06.290
actually have associated with the layout
 

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.250
actually have associated with the layout
you'll have a dimensions a strings file

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:09.260
you'll have a dimensions a strings file
 

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.190
you'll have a dimensions a strings file
a few files and the information you're

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:12.200
a few files and the information you're
 

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.270
a few files and the information you're
trying to work with is mapped across all

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280
trying to work with is mapped across all
 

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.329
trying to work with is mapped across all
of these different files so it becomes a

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:19.339
of these different files so it becomes a
 

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.130
of these different files so it becomes a
sort of hopping around game where you're

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:21.140
sort of hopping around game where you're
 

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.890
sort of hopping around game where you're
trying to figure out oh I've got to go

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:23.900
trying to figure out oh I've got to go
 

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.870
trying to figure out oh I've got to go
and adjust the dimensions here I got to

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880
and adjust the dimensions here I got to
 

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.940
and adjust the dimensions here I got to
go and set the string in this file and I

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:27.950
go and set the string in this file and I
 

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:28.600
go and set the string in this file and I
got it

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:28.610
got it
 

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:33.310
got it
and I have no easy simple navigation so

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320
and I have no easy simple navigation so
 

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.340

is this in layout the person's the

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.090
is this in layout the person's the
 

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.660
is this in layout the person's the
dimensions that uses the strings that

is and all the other things it's

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:45.560
is and all the other things it's
 

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.700
is and all the other things it's
referring to and we sort of combine them

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:48.710
referring to and we sort of combine them
 

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.180
referring to and we sort of combine them
into one user interface it appears on

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:52.190
into one user interface it appears on
 

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.160
into one user interface it appears on
the right and we gave it a look that

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:54.170
the right and we gave it a look that
 

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.880
the right and we gave it a look that
it's kind of like an XML file so if

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:57.890
it's kind of like an XML file so if
 

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.610
it's kind of like an XML file so if
you're used to the XML you can

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:00.620
you're used to the XML you can
 

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.240
you're used to the XML you can
understand what it does and how it works

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.250
understand what it does and how it works
 

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.520
understand what it does and how it works
you can sort of see the the files that

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:06.530
you can sort of see the the files that
 

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.320
you can sort of see the the files that
are coming from all the other parameters

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:08.330
are coming from all the other parameters
 

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.710
are coming from all the other parameters
for example the drawable is a picture of

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720
for example the drawable is a picture of
 

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:19.750
for example the drawable is a picture of
me the values is some number and in fact

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760
me the values is some number and in fact
 

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.690
me the values is some number and in fact
you can go edit and even create new

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:22.700
you can go edit and even create new
 

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.080
you can go edit and even create new
elements directly in that user interface

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.090
elements directly in that user interface
 

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.690
elements directly in that user interface
so it's a quick fast way to work within

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:28.700
so it's a quick fast way to work within
 

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.510
so it's a quick fast way to work within
the designer and do all the other little

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520
the designer and do all the other little
 

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.400
the designer and do all the other little
things you would like to do typically a

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:35.410
things you would like to do typically a
 

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.390
things you would like to do typically a
little bit about the tools attribute so

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400
little bit about the tools attribute so
 

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.530
little bit about the tools attribute so
so the idea we're showing you all of

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:41.540
so the idea we're showing you all of
 

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.880
so the idea we're showing you all of
this is also that you could of course

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:45.890
this is also that you could of course
 

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.580
this is also that you could of course
use all the layouts in XML right I mean

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:48.590
use all the layouts in XML right I mean
 

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.380
use all the layouts in XML right I mean
they are normal Android layouts you can

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:50.390
they are normal Android layouts you can
 

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.550
they are normal Android layouts you can
use the old layers you can use

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:51.560
use the old layers you can use
 

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.560
use the old layers you can use
constantly up everything is perfectly

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:53.570
constantly up everything is perfectly
 

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.960
constantly up everything is perfectly
visible in XML but the idea and this is

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:55.970
visible in XML but the idea and this is
 

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.600
visible in XML but the idea and this is
what we strongly believe is that with

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:58.610
what we strongly believe is that with
 

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.450
what we strongly believe is that with
the designer we've got great opportunity

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:01.460
the designer we've got great opportunity
 

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.580
the designer we've got great opportunity
to really make your life easier I think

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:03.590
to really make your life easier I think
 

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.230
to really make your life easier I think
you could see with some of those tools

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240
you could see with some of those tools
 

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.510
you could see with some of those tools
that we presented doing the same thing

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520
that we presented doing the same thing
 

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.210
that we presented doing the same thing
in XML line-by-line is certainly doable

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:10.220
in XML line-by-line is certainly doable
 

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.360
in XML line-by-line is certainly doable
but I think you'll be much faster by by

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.370
but I think you'll be much faster by by
 

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.180
but I think you'll be much faster by by
using those tools so the two top

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:16.190
using those tools so the two top
 

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.860
using those tools so the two top
tributes it's something you may human

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:17.870
tributes it's something you may human
 

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.710
tributes it's something you may human
already right see the general problem is

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720
already right see the general problem is
 

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.780
already right see the general problem is
that we have we have something in the

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:22.790
that we have we have something in the
 

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.820
that we have we have something in the
editor that's not executing your code

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:24.830
editor that's not executing your code
 

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.270
editor that's not executing your code
directly so sometimes what you what we

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280
directly so sometimes what you what we
 

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.020
directly so sometimes what you what we
show you in the layout editor is not

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:32.030
show you in the layout editor is not
 

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.220
show you in the layout editor is not
going to be exactly the same as what you

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:33.230
going to be exactly the same as what you
 

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.400
going to be exactly the same as what you
have on your device so because for

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:36.410
have on your device so because for
 

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.410
have on your device so because for
example some of it is just determined by

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:38.420
example some of it is just determined by
 

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.170
example some of it is just determined by
your program it strings computed at

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:41.180
your program it strings computed at
 

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.000
your program it strings computed at
runtime so we had this idea of having

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.010
runtime so we had this idea of having
 

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.240
runtime so we had this idea of having
tool attributes where you can specify

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:45.250
tool attributes where you can specify
 

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.530
tool attributes where you can specify
behavior that will only be applied in

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:47.540
behavior that will only be applied in
 

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.780
behavior that will only be applied in
the layout editor so in those attributes

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:49.790
the layout editor so in those attributes
 

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.220
the layout editor so in those attributes
are not going to be there when you

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.230
are not going to be there when you
 

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.780
are not going to be there when you
publish your application when you push

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:52.790
publish your application when you push
 

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.520
publish your application when you push
it on a device they are just stripped

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:54.530
it on a device they are just stripped
 

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.250
it on a device they are just stripped
out but in the designer that allows you

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:57.260
out but in the designer that allows you
 

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.169
out but in the designer that allows you
quite a lot of flexibility in how you

00:19:59.169 --> 00:19:59.179
quite a lot of flexibility in how you
 

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:02.020
quite a lot of flexibility in how you
want to render things

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.030
want to render things
 

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.820
want to render things
so we got like showing for instance is

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:03.830
so we got like showing for instance is
 

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.100
so we got like showing for instance is
pretty useful please take them you know

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:06.110
pretty useful please take them you know
 

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.350
pretty useful please take them you know
to set up something in a recycle view

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360
to set up something in a recycle view
 

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.880
to set up something in a recycle view
and things like that so just the generic

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:12.890
and things like that so just the generic
 

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.610
and things like that so just the generic
problem right of how do you want to show

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:15.620
problem right of how do you want to show
 

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.400
problem right of how do you want to show
layout when we don't really want to

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:18.410
layout when we don't really want to
 

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.130
layout when we don't really want to
agree with the code and you should try

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:21.140
agree with the code and you should try
 

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.830
agree with the code and you should try
to drag a recycle view all these do in

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840
to drag a recycle view all these do in
 

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.659
to drag a recycle view all these do in
the layout editor body what you saw

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:25.669
the layout editor body what you saw
 

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:28.690
the layout editor body what you saw
because we we automatically generate the

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:28.700
because we we automatically generate the

because we we automatically generate the
default adapter that is pretty limited

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:31.340
default adapter that is pretty limited
 

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.100
default adapter that is pretty limited
you know and by default that's what you

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:33.110
you know and by default that's what you
 

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.630
you know and by default that's what you
see this is probably not how your

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640
see this is probably not how your
 

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.450
see this is probably not how your
application looks like so if you have

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:37.460
application looks like so if you have
 

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.250
application looks like so if you have
some contents let's say I created a role

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:39.260
some contents let's say I created a role
 

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.390
some contents let's say I created a role
you can specify it and you you'll be

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400
you can specify it and you you'll be
 

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.320
you can specify it and you you'll be
able to see that being replicated better

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.330
able to see that being replicated better
 

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.480
able to see that being replicated better
but clearly not what your applications

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:49.490
but clearly not what your applications
 

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.860
but clearly not what your applications
going to look like right chuckling of

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:50.870
going to look like right chuckling of
 

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.940
going to look like right chuckling of
course you're going to have different

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:51.950
course you're going to have different
 

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.230
course you're going to have different
data so and that's for example data

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240
data so and that's for example data
 

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.750
data so and that's for example data
comes in you could specify new

00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760
comes in you could specify new
 

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.970
comes in you could specify new
attributes and this is going to be

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:00.980
attributes and this is going to be

attributes and this is going to be
available in 3.0 where by default we

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:04.160
available in 3.0 where by default we
 

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.530
available in 3.0 where by default we
have pre baked attributes like for

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:05.540
have pre baked attributes like for
 

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.780
have pre baked attributes like for
example names or phone numbers and

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:07.790
example names or phone numbers and
 

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.360
example names or phone numbers and
you'll be able to reference that instead

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:10.370
you'll be able to reference that instead
 

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.630
you'll be able to reference that instead
of you know other attributes and that

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640
of you know other attributes and that
 

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.490
of you know other attributes and that
will be replicated in the designer so

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:15.500
will be replicated in the designer so

get something like that and you have
 

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.090
get something like that and you have
more sample data capabilities you can

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.100

automatically apply the constraints so

00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059
automatically apply the constraints so
 

00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:08.239
automatically apply the constraints so
it won't go further and so that's just a

00:23:08.239 --> 00:23:08.249
it won't go further and so that's just a
 

00:23:08.249 --> 00:23:09.949
it won't go further and so that's just a
quick example of how you can use chain

it's not just oh I want to spread with
data path you can do much more complex

00:23:15.199 --> 00:23:15.209
data path you can do much more complex
 

00:23:15.209 --> 00:23:21.169
data path you can do much more complex
and powerful combination there's another

that case my center button gets collapse

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:32.249
that case my center button gets collapse
 

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:34.430
that case my center button gets collapse
little as a single point and that gave

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440
little as a single point and that gave

that's probably what I want sometimes

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:38.570
that's probably what I want sometimes

included and then the rest of my buttons

00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:49.229
included and then the rest of my buttons
 

00:23:49.229 --> 00:23:51.949
included and then the rest of my buttons
are moving so that you have another

that case we'll use those values for the
 

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:01.549
that case we'll use those values for the
margin so the second button I'd

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559
margin so the second button I'd

XML file so as you can see it's randomly
 

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.150
XML file so as you can see it's randomly
switching but the fact that you can

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:23.160
switching but the fact that you can
 

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.060
switching but the fact that you can
actually have a placeholder a place

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:26.070
actually have a placeholder a place
 

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.130
actually have a placeholder a place
where you can move a widget may seem

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140
where you can move a widget may seem
 

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.049
where you can move a widget may seem
like ok what what else can you do with

00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059
like ok what what else can you do with
 

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:36.100
like ok what what else can you do with
that well if I design a placeholder

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:36.110
that well if I design a placeholder
 

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:41.540
that well if I design a placeholder
based UI with merge tag essentially I've

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:41.550
based UI with merge tag essentially I've
 

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:46.280
based UI with merge tag essentially I've
defined an in constraint layout make

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:46.290
defined an in constraint layout make
 

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.870
defined an in constraint layout make
sure to use the parent tag if you want

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880
sure to use the parent tag if you want
 

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.860
sure to use the parent tag if you want
to see the UI while you're doing it it

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:51.870
to see the UI while you're doing it it
 

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.320
to see the UI while you're doing it it
essentially gives you a fixed layout

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.330
essentially gives you a fixed layout
 

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.960
essentially gives you a fixed layout
which you can then use in another file

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:56.970
which you can then use in another file
 

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:01.120
which you can then use in another file
so in this case I've decided to have one

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.130
so in this case I've decided to have one
 

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.560
so in this case I've decided to have one
placeholder that's going to be my top

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:03.570
placeholder that's going to be my top
 

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.380
placeholder that's going to be my top
image a big image and then a second

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:06.390
image a big image and then a second
 

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.750
image a big image and then a second
placeholder that's going to be my action

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760
placeholder that's going to be my action
 

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.610
placeholder that's going to be my action
button but I can actually make the

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620
button but I can actually make the
 

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:16.280
button but I can actually make the
second place holder with now using for

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.290
second place holder with now using for
 

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.640
second place holder with now using for
landscape mode and this one I arranged

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:19.650
landscape mode and this one I arranged
 

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.110
landscape mode and this one I arranged
it's a little bit different I use a

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120
it's a little bit different I use a
 

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.730
it's a little bit different I use a
different slightly different set of

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740
different slightly different set of
 

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.600
different slightly different set of
constraints

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:24.610
constraints
 

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.330
constraints
and now in the main layout I just

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:28.340
and now in the main layout I just
 

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.600
and now in the main layout I just
declare it to UI elements and include

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:31.610
declare it to UI elements and include
 

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.299
declare it to UI elements and include
the place hold the the template

00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:34.309
the place hold the the template
 

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:37.389
the place hold the the template
essentially it produces a template the

00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399
essentially it produces a template the
 

00:26:37.399 --> 00:26:38.080
essentially it produces a template the
design

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.090
design
 

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.560
design
decides on how you do your layout and

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:40.570
decides on how you do your layout and
 

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.380
decides on how you do your layout and
because there in fact two of these

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:44.390
because there in fact two of these
 

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.100
because there in fact two of these
templates one in different ones when I

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:48.110
templates one in different ones when I
 

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.519
templates one in different ones when I
rotate the the screen it would actually

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:51.529
rotate the the screen it would actually
 

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:56.200
rotate the the screen it would actually
take the other template so now I can lay

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.210
take the other template so now I can lay
 

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.049
take the other template so now I can lay
out my views and separate out the layout

00:26:59.049 --> 00:26:59.059
out my views and separate out the layout
 

00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:01.810
out my views and separate out the layout
from it but I can actually do more than

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:01.820
from it but I can actually do more than
 

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.500
from it but I can actually do more than
just that one of the things that you can

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:05.510
just that one of the things that you can
 

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.100
just that one of the things that you can
do with with this structure is what is

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:09.110
do with with this structure is what is
 

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.580
do with with this structure is what is
instead of the image button the second

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:12.590
instead of the image button the second
 

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.430
instead of the image button the second
image button I could decide to put an

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440
image button I could decide to put an
 

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.879
image button I could decide to put an
entire include file with something else

00:27:18.879 --> 00:27:18.889
entire include file with something else
 

00:27:18.889 --> 00:27:24.810
entire include file with something else
in it so in this particular case I have

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:24.820
 
 

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.549
 
I don't know why that in this particular

00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559
I don't know why that in this particular
 

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:31.090
I don't know why that in this particular
case I have an entire include with a

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:31.100
case I have an entire include with a
 

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.909
case I have an entire include with a
bunch of different layout elements and

00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919
bunch of different layout elements and
 

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:35.889
bunch of different layout elements and
it's actually being warped into that

00:27:35.889 --> 00:27:35.899
it's actually being warped into that
 

00:27:35.899 --> 00:27:38.529
it's actually being warped into that
space so it's a constraint layout within

00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:38.539
space so it's a constraint layout within
 

00:27:38.539 --> 00:27:40.930
space so it's a constraint layout within
a constraint layouts it's nested in that

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:40.940
a constraint layouts it's nested in that
 

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.039
a constraint layouts it's nested in that
context but this is a very simple and

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:45.049
context but this is a very simple and
 

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:47.919
context but this is a very simple and
almost stupid I example but you could

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:47.929
almost stupid I example but you could
 

00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:50.139
almost stupid I example but you could
imagine where you decide how you want

00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:50.149
imagine where you decide how you want
 

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:52.210
imagine where you decide how you want
the top and the bottom the left and the

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:52.220
the top and the bottom the left and the
 

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.850
the top and the bottom the left and the
right and and behaviors and lay them out

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:54.860
right and and behaviors and lay them out
 

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.490
right and and behaviors and lay them out
and design them as templates and then

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:57.500
and design them as templates and then
 

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.419
and design them as templates and then
when you're ready to to produce your

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:01.429
when you're ready to to produce your
 

00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:04.720
when you're ready to to produce your
main stuff you just go and do it in a

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:04.730
main stuff you just go and do it in a
 

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.480
main stuff you just go and do it in a
completely separate file you could have

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:07.490
completely separate file you could have
 

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.879
completely separate file you could have
designers help you design templates the

00:28:09.879 --> 00:28:09.889
designers help you design templates the
 

00:28:09.889 --> 00:28:12.430
designers help you design templates the
things like that one of the things that

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440
things like that one of the things that
 

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.139
things like that one of the things that
that we wanted to do it with constraint

00:28:17.139 --> 00:28:17.149
that we wanted to do it with constraint
 

00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:19.149
that we wanted to do it with constraint
set and I'll talk a little bit about how

00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159
set and I'll talk a little bit about how
 

00:28:19.159 --> 00:28:23.350
set and I'll talk a little bit about how
you use constraint set is you can

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360
you use constraint set is you can
 

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.930
you use constraint set is you can
separate the views completely from how

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:25.940
separate the views completely from how
 

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.310
separate the views completely from how
you do the layouts so essentially you

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320
you do the layouts so essentially you
 

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.010
you do the layouts so essentially you
can another way of doing things to

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:33.020
can another way of doing things to
 

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.680
can another way of doing things to
encapsulate your entire layout as a

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:35.690
encapsulate your entire layout as a
 

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.390
encapsulate your entire layout as a
separate constraint set

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:37.400
separate constraint set
 

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.350
separate constraint set
and then you apply it to a layout so you

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360
and then you apply it to a layout so you
 

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.130
and then you apply it to a layout so you
might kind of wonder what would you want

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:45.140
might kind of wonder what would you want
 

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.080
might kind of wonder what would you want
to do with that well you can use you can

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.090
to do with that well you can use you can
 

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.060
to do with that well you can use you can
switch between two constraint sets on

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.070
switch between two constraint sets on
 

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:53.380
switch between two constraint sets on
the fly no views get reloaded it's not

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:53.390
the fly no views get reloaded it's not
 

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.180
the fly no views get reloaded it's not
like switching a layout you're actually

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:55.190
like switching a layout you're actually
 

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.400
like switching a layout you're actually
just moving the layout the widgets

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:57.410
just moving the layout the widgets
 

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.620
just moving the layout the widgets
around by applying different sets of

00:28:59.620 --> 00:28:59.630
around by applying different sets of
 

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:03.700
around by applying different sets of
constraints so in this example I create

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:03.710
constraints so in this example I create
 

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:10.660
constraints so in this example I create
two constraint set I grab a constraint

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:10.670
two constraint set I grab a constraint
 

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:16.660
two constraint set I grab a constraint
set from a layout file and I put another

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:16.670
set from a layout file and I put another
 

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.150
set from a layout file and I put another
layout on the screen with set content

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:19.160
layout on the screen with set content
 

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:24.610
layout on the screen with set content
view then I actually get that one and

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:24.620
view then I actually get that one and
 

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.440
view then I actually get that one and
grab its constraint settings constraint

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:26.450
grab its constraint settings constraint
 

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.370
grab its constraint settings constraint
set two now to switch between the two

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:30.380
set two now to switch between the two
 

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.070
set two now to switch between the two
constraint set all I have to do is call

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080
constraint set all I have to do is call
 

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.799
constraint set all I have to do is call
the constraint set and apply to the

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:35.809
the constraint set and apply to the
 

00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:38.560
the constraint set and apply to the
constraint layout and that will allow me

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:38.570
constraint layout and that will allow me
 

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:42.549
constraint layout and that will allow me
to switch so I can produce lots of

00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559
to switch so I can produce lots of
 

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:46.750
to switch so I can produce lots of
clever animations that way so one simple

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760
clever animations that way so one simple
 

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.070
clever animations that way so one simple
example is if I have a dialog and this

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080
example is if I have a dialog and this
 

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.350
example is if I have a dialog and this
is a normal constraint set with my

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360
is a normal constraint set with my
 

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.410
is a normal constraint set with my
picture on it and I can do another one

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:56.420
picture on it and I can do another one
 

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.799
picture on it and I can do another one
in landscape now instead of of creating

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:01.809
in landscape now instead of of creating
 

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:04.660
in landscape now instead of of creating
two separate layouts and inflating them

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:04.670
two separate layouts and inflating them
 

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.700
two separate layouts and inflating them
when you rotate you can take over the

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:06.710
when you rotate you can take over the
 

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:11.080
when you rotate you can take over the
rotation yourself and you can perform

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.090
rotation yourself and you can perform
 

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.080
rotation yourself and you can perform
the constraint set switch yourself and

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.090
the constraint set switch yourself and
 

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.440
the constraint set switch yourself and
that way you have a lot less going on

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:17.450
that way you have a lot less going on
 

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.250
that way you have a lot less going on
during rotation so if you if you have an

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:21.260
during rotation so if you if you have an
 

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.280
during rotation so if you if you have an
app that likes to rotate its a lot you

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:24.290
app that likes to rotate its a lot you
 

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.820
app that likes to rotate its a lot you
can do it that way and save some speed

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:26.830
can do it that way and save some speed
 

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.470
can do it that way and save some speed
well the other thing that important to

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480
well the other thing that important to
 

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.120
well the other thing that important to
keep in mind with a constraint set is

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:31.130
keep in mind with a constraint set is
 

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.919
keep in mind with a constraint set is
the a nice example of rotation is

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:32.929
the a nice example of rotation is
 

00:30:32.929 --> 00:30:35.680
the a nice example of rotation is
interesting of course you can use the

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:35.690
interesting of course you can use the
 

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.630
interesting of course you can use the
normal system on average and let the

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640
normal system on average and let the
 

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.830
normal system on average and let the
resource being loaded in at runtime the

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840
resource being loaded in at runtime the
 

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.760
resource being loaded in at runtime the
thing with constraint set is that you

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:42.770
thing with constraint set is that you
 

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.010
thing with constraint set is that you
actually in complete control of when you

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.020
actually in complete control of when you
 

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.830
actually in complete control of when you
create the constraint set so often in

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840
create the constraint set so often in
 

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.220
create the constraint set so often in
mobile it's not so much about trying to

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:51.230
mobile it's not so much about trying to
 

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.690
mobile it's not so much about trying to
not do the work that you need to do

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:52.700
not do the work that you need to do
 

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.280
not do the work that you need to do
because you need to do it so sometimes

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:54.290
because you need to do it so sometimes
 

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.780
because you need to do it so sometimes
if the walk is costly you still have to

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:55.790
if the walk is costly you still have to
 

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.060
if the walk is costly you still have to
do it it's more matter of trying to find

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:58.070
do it it's more matter of trying to find
 

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.720
do it it's more matter of trying to find
the right time on what to do it and to

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:01.730
the right time on what to do it and to
 

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.100
the right time on what to do it and to
me that's what constraints are residue

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:03.110
me that's what constraints are residue
 

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.690
me that's what constraints are residue
to do you can basically

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:04.700
to do you can basically
 

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.600
to do you can basically
pre-baked all those constraints and not

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:07.610
pre-baked all those constraints and not
 

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.720
pre-baked all those constraints and not
them before and so you don't have to

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:10.730
them before and so you don't have to
 

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.220
them before and so you don't have to
incur registers or anything like that

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:12.230
incur registers or anything like that
 

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.630
incur registers or anything like that
because suddenly you have to pull the

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:13.640
because suddenly you have to pull the
 

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:19.030
because suddenly you have to pull the
entire set of resources so concert set

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:19.040
entire set of resources so concert set
 

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.000
entire set of resources so concert set
is also pretty useful when we want to do

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.010
is also pretty useful when we want to do
 

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.420
is also pretty useful when we want to do

manager will animate all of that so you

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:34.700
manager will animate all of that so you

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:14.730
custom widgets if you want that's you
 

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:19.669
custom widgets if you want that's you
know as simple so here's another example

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679
know as simple so here's another example
 

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.330
know as simple so here's another example
of the world constraint set slash

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:22.340
of the world constraint set slash
 

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.550
of the world constraint set slash
transition animation so we define two

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560
transition animation so we define two
 

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.880
transition animation so we define two
states like the previous examples and

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:27.890
states like the previous examples and
 

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:30.710
states like the previous examples and
you see like the shadows are applied the

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720
you see like the shadows are applied the
 

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.810
you see like the shadows are applied the
elevation changes and all of that is

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820
elevation changes and all of that is
 

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.020
elevation changes and all of that is
done graphically the only problem with

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:36.030
done graphically the only problem with
 

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.970
done graphically the only problem with
this animation is that it's little stage

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980
this animation is that it's little stage
 

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.190
this animation is that it's little stage
I mean doesn't do anything special there

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200
I mean doesn't do anything special there
 

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.520
I mean doesn't do anything special there
is no movement but we could do a lot

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:43.530
is no movement but we could do a lot
 

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:47.930
is no movement but we could do a lot
more than that and with custom

00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940
more than that and with custom
 

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.030
more than that and with custom
transitions you could simply define

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040
transitions you could simply define
 

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.430
transitions you could simply define
whatever you want so recently it was a

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440
whatever you want so recently it was a
 

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.800

you could easily create your own custom

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:57.450
you could easily create your own custom
 

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:59.120
you could easily create your own custom
transition plug them in to the system

00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.130
transition plug them in to the system
 

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.910
transition plug them in to the system
and do whatever you want I would not

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920
and do whatever you want I would not
