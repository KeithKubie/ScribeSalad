THAT ARE NATIVE TO
SOUTH-CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA.

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:11.968
IN FACT, "PECAN" IS
AN ALGONQUIN WORD

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:15.067
THAT MEANS "A NUT THAT TAKES
A STONE TO CRACK."

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:19.901
TODAY, COMPUTERIZED SHELLING

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:25.300
PECANS ADD FLAVOR

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.868
THEY CAN ALSO BE A SATISFYING
TREAT ON THEIR OWN.

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:33.634
BUT MANUFACTURING PECANS IS AN
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT NUT TO CRACK.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.767
AT HARVEST TIME, THE HUSKS THAT
CONTAIN THE NUTS START TO OPEN.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:41.267
AT THIS ORCHARD,

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:43.133

A HARVESTER WITH PADDLE WHEELS

ONCE ON THE HARVESTER,
THE PECANS RIDE CHAIN CONVEYORS

AS VACUUMS REMOVE

AFTER MORE PROCESSING,

00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:57.868
PICTURES OF THE NUTS

STILL ATTACHED TO THE PECANS.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.868
IF ANY ARE IDENTIFIED,

00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:09.868
THE COMPUTER ACTIVATES
A BLOWER TO REMOVE THEM.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:15.400
WITH THE HUSKS REMOVED,
HARVESTERS SORT OUT

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.000
ANY OF THE PECANS THAT
ARE CRACKED OR SPLIT OPEN.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.767
AT THIS POINT, THE PECANS
CONTAIN ABOUT 12% MOISTURE,

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:29.567
WHICH IS HIGH ENOUGH
TO CAUSE DETERIORATION.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:33.601
SO HARVESTERS LEAVE THE PECANS
TO DRY FOR 24 HOURS,

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:37.133
TO LOWER THEIR MOISTURE CONTENT
TO 4%.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.968
ONCE DRYING IS COMPLETE,

00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:41.968
THE PECANS ARE TRANSFERRED
TO THE SHELLING PLANT,

00:02:41.968 --> 00:02:45.167
WHERE THEY ARE PLUNGED INTO
A CHLORINE-AND-WATER BATH.

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:48.200
THIS BOTH CLEANS THEM
AND REHYDRATES THEM.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.000
WITHOUT SUFFICIENT MOISTURE,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.033
THE PECANS WILL BREAK INTO BITS
DURING CRACKING,

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:58.100
AND THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EXTRACT
INTACT HALVES FOR RETAIL.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.067
THE PECANS ARE RINSED IN WATER

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:03.033
AT A TEMPERATURE
OF 180 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.767
THIS STEP
REMOVES CHLORINE RESIDUE,

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:07.934
SANITIZES THE PECANS,

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:12.467
AND RAISES THE MOISTURE CONTENT
TO 7.5%.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.234
NOW IT'S TIME TO GET CRACKING

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:18.167

AUTOMATED PROCESS.

THAT SORTS THEM BY SIZE.

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:34.834
THEN THE PECANS FALL IN FRONT
OF AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM,

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.033
WHICH RELEASES A BLAST OF AIR

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:40.000

SHELL PIECES.

SMALL PECAN BITS.
