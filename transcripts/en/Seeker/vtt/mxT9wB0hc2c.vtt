00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.990
I’m going to start this episode by bumming
you out: everybody dies eventually.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.269
Even if you manage to avoid bear attacks or
grievous bodily harm, something in your own

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.009
body will go wrong sooner or later.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.799
Usually later though, since age is the single
biggest risk factor for disease.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.900
Strangely, we don’t really understand why
our bodies deteriorate as we age, and so we

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.670
don’t know how to prevent it.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.849
But there are a few scientists who think they
know how to stop the relentless march of time,

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240
and they figured it out by accident.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.670
The researchers in question were studying
why some cells in our bodies become cancerous.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.960
They believed turning off a gene called BubR1
could be the culprit, so they genetically

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.180
engineered mice with BubR1 deactivated.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.629
But the mice didn’t develop tumors as expected.

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.020
Instead they aged rapidly, and by the time
they were just three months old they had thinning

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.620
hair and cataracts.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.230
The mice lost weight, developed heart problems,
and died much earlier than normal.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.449
When the scientists examined their bodies,
they noticed that the mice had accumulated

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.180
a particular type of cell called “senescent
cells.”

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.220
Senescent cells were once healthy normal cells,
but they’ve been damaged or their DNA has

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.230
mutated.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.130
To avoid passing that damage onto their daughter
cells, they stop replicating and start putting

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.050
out signals for the immune system to come
and clean them up.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.970
They’re not exactly dead, but they’re
not doing anything either.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.720
Unless you count putting those chemical signals
out, which you should because it turns out

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.490
they can affect nearby cells and cause inflammation.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
If the immune system cleans up these cells,
it's no big deal, but it appears that over

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
time, the immune system stops responding and
the senescent cells build up.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.640
Some people liken these cells to zombies but
to me they seem more like grumpy retirees.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.430
They’ve done their job at the plant until
they can’t work anymore, so they sit on

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.840
their porch yelling and hollering for the
police to come and take them away.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
The police come a couple times but eventually
they stop, and soon none of the neighbors

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.640
can sleep anymore.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.140
Eventually those neighbors retire too and
they sit on their porch screaming and the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.160
neighborhood becomes a terrible place to live.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.781
The researchers found that when they regularly
removed these cells from normal mice, the

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:03.260
mice stayed healthier and lived 25% longer.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.110
So the researchers think that clearing out
these cells could improve longevity in humans

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.260
as well.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.030
But of course, it’s not so simple.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.840
It’s never simple.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.170
First and foremost is the problem that senescent
cells vary from one tissue to another.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.070
There’s no one distinct marker for all of
them that a treatment can target.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.260
So the researchers are working on treatments
that can target multiple markers at once.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.100
But even if you could totally cleanse out
all the senescent cells in your body at once,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.310
you might not want to.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.430
There’s evidence that senescent cells play
a role in helping you recover from injury.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.170
The same researchers that found all these
benefits of removing the cells found that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.610
wounded mice healed slower without them.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.260
So scientists and doctors will have to be
careful how they apply this treatment if it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.280
ever turns out to be effective in humans too.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.950
Aging is something we just can’t escape,
but with continued research maybe one day

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.480
we’ll think of old age as a treatable disease
rather than an inevitable fate.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.560

We’re friendly, I promise.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.670
We’ve come up with all sorts of kooky ideas
to stop aging, like infusing young blood into

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.670
our veins.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.680
Julia covers that, here.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.830
When scientists first discovered senescent
cells in 1961 and suggested it might be aging

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.060
on a cellular level, people called them
idiots.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.480
Funny.
