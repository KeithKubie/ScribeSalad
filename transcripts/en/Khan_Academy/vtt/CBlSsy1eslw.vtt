00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:02.199
- [Voiceover] So we have a
nice, little equation here

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:04.451
that has some rational expressions in it

00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:06.033
and like always, pause the video

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.497
and see if you can figure out

00:00:07.497 --> 00:00:10.720
which x's satisfy this equation.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.105
All right. Let's work through it together.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.448
Now, when I see things at
the denominator like this,

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.768
my instinct is to try to not
have denominators like this.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.811
And so what we could do is to
get rid of this x minus one

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:23.243
in the denominator on the left-hand side.

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:25.909
We can multiply both sides of the equation

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.324
times x minus one,

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:30.009
x minus one.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.977
We're gonna multiply both
sides by x minus one.

00:00:33.977 --> 00:00:37.140
And once again, the
whole point of doing that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.952
is so that we get rid of this x minus one

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:40.854
in the denominator right over here.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.996
And then to get rid of this x plus one

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:44.911
in the denominator over here,

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.308
we can multiply both sides of
the equation times x plus one.

00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:53.026
So, x plus one.

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:56.156
Multiply both sides times x plus one.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.945
And so what is that going to give us?

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:03.163
Well, on the left-hand
side, that is going to,

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.229
x minus one divided by x
minus one is just gonna be one

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.781
for the x's where that's defined,

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.967
for x not being equal to one.

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:13.620
And so, we're gonna have x plus one

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.425
times negative two x plus four.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.770
So let me write that down.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.282
So we have x plus,

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:20.413
I'm gonna need some space,

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.569
so let me make sure I don't write too big.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.924
x plus one times negative two x,

00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:29.796
negative two x plus four

00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:31.778
is going to be equal to.

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:34.404
Now, if we multiply both of these

00:01:34.404 --> 00:01:36.950
times three over x plus one,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.339
the x plus one is going to
cancel with the x plus one

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:42.805
and we're gonna be left with
three times x minus one.

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:46.005
So that is going to be
three x minus three,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.514
three x minus three,

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:51.845
and then minus,

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.698
minus one times both of these.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:59.409
So one times x minus one times x plus one.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.278
So, minus one times

00:02:02.278 --> 00:02:05.508
x minus one times x plus one.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:06.706
All I did is I multiplied,

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:08.268
took the x minus one times x plus one,

00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:10.440
multiplied times each of these terms.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.392
When I multiply it times this first term,

00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:14.584
the x plus one and the
x plus one canceled,

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:17.557
so I just have to multiply
three times x minus one.

00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:18.782
And then for the second term,

00:02:18.782 --> 00:02:20.814
I just multiply times both of these.

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:22.265
And now you might recognize,

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:25.428
if you have something x
plus one times x minus one,

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:28.281
that's going to be x squared minus one.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.917
So I could rewrite all
of this right over here

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.782
as being equal to...

00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:36.712
as being equal to

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:38.822
x squared minus one,

00:02:38.822 --> 00:02:41.215
and once again, that's
because this is the same thing

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:43.663
as x squared minus one.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.506
And since I'm subtracting
an x squared minus one,

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:49.802
actually, let me just, I don't
wanna do too much on one step

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.271
so let's go to the next step.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.807
So, I could multiply this out.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:58.281
So I could multiply x times negative two x

00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:01.224
which would give us
negative two x squared.

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:03.503
x times four,

00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:07.143
which is going to give us plus four x

00:03:07.143 --> 00:03:09.542
and I could multiply one
times negative two x.

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:11.494
I'm gonna subtract two x.

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:15.755
And then one times four,
which is gonna be plus four,

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:18.445
and then that is going to be equal to,

00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:20.433
that is going to be equal to,

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:24.511
we have three x minus three

00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:26.293
and then we can distribute
this negative sign.

00:03:26.293 --> 00:03:30.453
So we can say minus x squared plus one.

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:32.926
And over here, we can
simplify it a little bit.

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:37.497
This is going to be, that
is four x minus two x

00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:39.598
is going to be,

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:40.960
I'm gonna try to write over, yep,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.823
four x minus two x, so
that would be two x.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.594
And so this is simplified to, let's see,

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.446
well this is, we have a
negative three and a one,

00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:52.799
so those two together
are going to be equal to,

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.423
subtracting at two.

00:03:54.423 --> 00:03:56.469
So we can rewrite everything as,

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.434
do the neutral color now,

00:03:58.434 --> 00:04:01.170
negative two x squared

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.170
plus two x plus four

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.475
is equal to negative x squared

00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:12.899
plus three x minus two.

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.755
Now we can try to get all of this business

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.540
onto the right-hand side,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.172
so let's subtract it from both sides.

00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:20.083
So we're gonna subtract,

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:23.605
or we'll say we'll add
x squared to both sides,

00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:25.150
add x squared,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.780
that gets rid of this
white negative x squared.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.002
We subtract three x from both sides,

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:33.224
subtract three x from both sides,

00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:36.112
add two to both sides, add two,

00:04:36.112 --> 00:04:38.945
and we will be left with,

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.591
we are going to end up with.

00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.503
See, negative two x squared plus x squared

00:04:43.503 --> 00:04:46.015
is negative x squared.

00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:48.608
Two x minus three x is negative x.

00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:52.095
And then four plus two is six,

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.583
is going to be equal to,

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:56.436
well that's going to
cancel that, that, that,

00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:58.138
is equal to zero.

00:04:58.138 --> 00:05:00.000
I don't like having this
negative on the x squared,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.842
so let's multiply both
sides times negative one.

00:05:02.842 --> 00:05:04.197
And so if I do that,

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:08.087
so if I just take the
negative on both sides,

00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:10.513
so I just multiply that
times negative one.

00:05:10.513 --> 00:05:12.605
Same thing, it's taking
the negative on both sides.

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:17.587
I'm gonna get positive x squared plus x

00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:20.713
minus six is equal to zero.

00:05:20.713 --> 00:05:22.522
And we're making some good progress here.

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.023
So we can factor this.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.475
And actually, let me just
do it right over here

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:28.585
so that we can see the original problem.

00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:31.398
So, if I were to factor
this, what two numbers,

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:33.199
their product is negative six,

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.261
they're gonna have different signs

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:35.823
since their product is negative.

00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:37.504
And they add up to one,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.316
the coefficient on the first degree term.

00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:43.626
Well, positive three
and negative two work,

00:05:43.626 --> 00:05:47.360
so I can rewrite this as x plus three

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.313
times x minus two

00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:53.493
is equal to zero.

00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:54.554
Did I do that write? Yeah.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.646
Three times negative two is negative six.

00:05:56.646 --> 00:06:00.593
Three x minus two x is positive x.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:03.407
All right. So, I just wrote this

00:06:03.407 --> 00:06:05.798
in this quadratic in factored form.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.410
And so the way that you
get this equaling to zero

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.162
is if either one of those equals zero.

00:06:09.162 --> 00:06:12.363
x plus three equals zero

00:06:12.363 --> 00:06:15.585
or x minus two is equal to zero.

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:16.597
Well, this is going to happen

00:06:16.597 --> 00:06:18.406
if you subtract three from both sides.

00:06:18.406 --> 00:06:20.900
That's gonna happen if x
is equal to negative three

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.726
or over here, if you
add two to both sides,

00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:25.942
x is equal to two.

00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:27.444
So either one of these will satisfy,

00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:28.585
but we wanna be careful.

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:30.900
We wanna make sure that
our original equation

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.143
isn't going to be undefined
for either one of these.

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:35.755
And negative three does not make

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:40.359
either of the denominators
equal to zero, so that's cool.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.941
And positive two does not make

00:06:41.941 --> 00:06:44.473
either of the denominators equal to zero.

00:06:44.473 --> 00:06:45.845
So it looks like we're in good shape.

00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:47.373
There's two solutions

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:50.540
to that equation.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.613
If one of them made any of the
denominators equal to zero,

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:56.319
then they would have been
extraneous solutions.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.180
It would have been solutions

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.902
for some of our intermediate steps,

00:06:58.902 --> 00:07:01.424
but not for the actual original equations

00:07:01.424 --> 00:07:03.066
with the expressions as they're written.

00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:05.448
But this, we can feel good
about because neither of these

00:07:05.448 --> 00:07:09.781
make any of these
denominators equal to zero.
