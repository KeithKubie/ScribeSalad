ROMERO BRITTO &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Romero. I'm here
at the world economic forum 2009 and-ah-I

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.340
think it's pretty special in a time-you know-today
when we have the forum in Davos and especially

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.900
what's happening in America. Having Obama
as the President, I think, is pretty inspiring

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.579
to have like him over there. Um-people know
him in the U.S. but people around the world

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.279
and-ah-I think it's a great moment in the
history of this planet basically.
