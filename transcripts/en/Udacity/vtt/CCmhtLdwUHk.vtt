00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.750
So now we are going to look at non-parametric models formally.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.560
We defined a derived feature which is x equal to the absolute

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.360
value of the difference between f-nought and f 1 divided by f-nought.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.825
What this means in practice is that the ratio of the submitted charge,

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:25.090
f-nought, to the difference between the submitted charge, and

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.660
the payment amount by Medicare.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.890
When you're making a derived feature,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.590
make sure what that represents makes sense in your given problem.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.160
Next, we're going to look at a distribution of values of x.
