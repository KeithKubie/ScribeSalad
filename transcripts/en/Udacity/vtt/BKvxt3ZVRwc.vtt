00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.969
Alright, so, I'm going to go to set times, to try and test this out.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.230
&gt;&gt; Before we go to test it out, don't forget to click

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.740
Activate. I always forget to do that, especially on work flows and approvals.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.298
&gt;&gt; After activating, you cannot add or remove that's fine. Okay, we

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:18.510
are activated. Set times. So should I create a new set time?

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.190
&gt;&gt; So you could create a new set time, or,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.000
we could just use one of the ones we already created.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Okay. Send it for approval?

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.260
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.690
Alright, so there we see it. So in the

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.460
Approval History, we saw when you submitted it for approval,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.920
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.650
&gt;&gt; Who its assigned to. And then they can come here and

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.170
approve, reject or possibly reassign it to someone else to approve it.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.080
&gt;&gt; And this is just visible to me because

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.470
I happen to be, the approval, the approver as well?

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.740
&gt;&gt; So depending on your security settings.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.134
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:51.530
&gt;&gt; You might not be able to see it, but honestly, if you can see this record,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.000
anyone should be able to see where this is at in the Approval Flow.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.870
&gt;&gt; Okay. Gotcha. Okay so now, I should have

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.850
gotten a notification, and now I can approve it, right?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.290
&gt;&gt; Right. So first, look at the status.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.790
&gt;&gt; In Review.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.700
&gt;&gt; It moved into Review.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.769
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's pretty cool.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.180
&gt;&gt; So sweet.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.820
&gt;&gt; So now, should I go to Home?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.470
&gt;&gt; Well, you can improve it right from here.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.310
&gt;&gt; Oh, right. Here?

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.170
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.810
&gt;&gt; So you can leave some comments with it. Do you approve the set time?

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.510
&gt;&gt; I approve.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.710
&gt;&gt; So you can see the Record's still locked. Now

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.660
that it's confirmed, you can unlock it whenever you want.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.250
&gt;&gt; Very cool. Alright. I don't want to unlock it.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.800
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.560
&gt;&gt; I want it to be a secret.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.940
&gt;&gt; Lock it up.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.290
&gt;&gt; Okay.
