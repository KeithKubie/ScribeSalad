00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
- [Instructor] This is
the type of question

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.690
that you might see on
an AP Economics exam,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.600
and it's talking about
perfectly competitive markets.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.900
So it says, a typical
profit-maximizing firm

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.690
in a perfectly competitive
constant-cost industry

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.550
is earning a positive economic profit.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220
So the first question they ask us is,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.150
is the market price
greater than, less than,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.250
or equal to the firm's price?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.880
Explain.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.620
So pause this video and
see if you can answer

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.170
this on your own before we do it together.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.410
All right now let's do it together.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.890
So remember, we are talking

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.730
about a perfectly competitive market.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.660
So in a perfectly competitive market,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.100
all of the players in that
market have to be price takers.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.230
They have no pricing power.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.230
So the market price has to
be equal to the firm's price.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.440
So market, market price

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.400
equal, equal to firm price, firm price

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.943
because in perfectly,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.490
perfectly competitive market, market,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.770
firms are price takers,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.530
firms are price takers.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960
They have no pricing power.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.770
All right, part b.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.780
Draw correctly labeled
side-by-side graphs for both

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.030
the market and a typical firm

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.350
and show each of the following.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.390
And they ask us to do
a bunch of stuff here.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.210
So once again, pause this video
and actually get out paper.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.928
This will be very valuable
for you to have a go at this.

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:40.170
All right, so let's see we wanna do

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.870
these side-by-side graphs,
and we wanna think about

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.670
the market and the firm.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.140
And we've done this in
multiple videos before.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.090
So let's think about what
they're talking about is,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.103
so this is the market right over here.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.513
That's the market.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
And this is, on this axis
is going to be price.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.483
On this axis is going to be quantity.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.110
And then let me do a similar
thing for a firm here.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.697
So that would be the
firm's price axis, price.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.093
And then this would be quantity
for the firm, quantity.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.720
Let me make it clear, this is the market,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.720
and then this right over here is the firm.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.190
And let's see, they say,
market price and quantity.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.800
So the equilibrium price
and quantity in the market.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.540
So we could draw the supply
curve for the market.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.040
It might look something like this,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.970
upward-sloping, we've
seen that multiple times.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.230
We could do the demand
curve for the market.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.950
It would look something like that.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.670
And then we have the
equilibrium price in the market,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.840
which they want us to
use P sub m, so P sub m.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.370
And then we have the equilibrium
quantity in the market,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.220
which they want us to use Q sub m.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.900
So we've done this first part.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.490
All right now let's see
what else they want.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.950
The firm's quantity, labeled Q sub f,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.530
the firm's average
revenue curve, labeled AR,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.598
the firm's average total
cost curve, labeled ATC,

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:14.780
the area representing total
cost shaded completely.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.330
So in order to do this first part,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.350
the quantity that it would be rational

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.138
for this profit-seeking firm
or the profit-maximizing firm

00:03:22.138 --> 00:03:24.210
to produce, to think about that,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.340
we'd actually also have to think about

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.170
the firm's average revenue.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.000
And the average revenue, which
is going to be the same thing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.620
as the demand curve for that firm,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.240
is going to be based on this market price.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.390
Remember, the firm, in this
perfectly competitive market,

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.350
has to be a price taker.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.170
So this horizontal line right over there,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.010
that is the firm's average revenue, AR,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.690
which is equal to its marginal revenue,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.860
which is equal to its demand curve,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.750
which is equal to this market price.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.010
And the quantity that it's
rational for this firm

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.770
to produce is where this
marginal revenue curve,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.260
which is also the average
revenue curve in this case,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.170
intersects our marginal cost curve.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.780
So the marginal cost curve
might look something,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.800
something like this.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.263
So marginal cost.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.190
And so this right over
here is our Q sub f.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.280
So we've done this part and this part.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.878
The firm's average total cost curve,

00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:28.700
well the average total
cost at this quantity

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.567
needs to be below the marginal revenue

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:33.450
and the average revenue at that quantity

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.120
because we know that the firm is earning

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.010
a positive economic profit.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.530
So we are dealing with
a situation that likely

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.470
looks like this.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.470
So the average total cost
might look something like this.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.900
And I drew it that way to
ensure that at this quantity,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.060
Q sub f, our marginal revenue
and our average revenue

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.680
is above our average total cost.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.030
That tells us that we're
earning economic profit

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.360
in this situation.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.180
So I've done part iv.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.800
The area representing total
cost shaded completely,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.413
well the area representing
total cost would be

00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:14.030
the cost per unit, the
average cost per unit,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.495
which is that much, times
the total number of units.

00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:21.930
And the total number of units
is going to be this length,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.690
which is equal to Q sub f.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.340
And so your total cost is
going to be this shaded area.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.860
If they were asking us
our total economic profit,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.540
then we would be talking
about this area up here,

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.373
but they're not.

00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:36.780
They're talking about our total cost,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.370
which is this area right over there.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.050
So we have done those parts.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.758
Now let's go to part c.

00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:46.490
If one firm in the market
were to raise its price,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.060
what would happen to its total revenue?

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.893
Explain.

00:05:48.893 --> 00:05:50.188
Pause this video, see
if you can answer that.

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:52.590
Well remember, we're dealing

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.000
with a perfectly competitive market,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.530
a perfectly competitive industry.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.810
There's no differentiation
between anyone's products.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.430
So if all of a sudden, someone
were to stick their head out

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.890
and try to raise price, no one would buy

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.606
their product anymore
because people can get

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:09.210
identical products from other
people for a lower price.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.333
And so, its total revenue,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.750
its total revenue

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.090
would go to zero

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.100
since product is undifferentiated,
undifferentiated,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
and consumers could

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.480
buy from others

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.240
at lower price,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.310
at lower price.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.865
And this is another way to think about it.

00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:51.280
They have to be price takers

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.523
in a perfectly competitive market.
