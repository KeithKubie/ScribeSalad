 when another baby arrived I 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.300
 realized that these problems could not 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.760
 not find a surgical solution 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.780
 but we had to fight against 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.970
 root causes of these atrocities 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.629

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.120

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.780
 world was afraid of him because he was 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.540
 member of the provincial parliament and 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.120
 enjoyed absolute power over the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.860
 population 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.709

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.480
 a style and fear years you have a 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.410
 human rights defender who had 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.579
 had the courage to denounce the facts 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.019
 the deputies escaped without 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.700
 consequence his parliamentary immunity 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.090
 allowed him to abuse in any 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.090
 impunity 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.130
 these two babies were followed by 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.900
 dozens of other children raped when 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:26.190
 the 48th victim arrived we were 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.789

 we seized a military court 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.740
 finally these games they were 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.050
 prosecuted and tried as a crime against

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:03.809
 many other villages in Congo such 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.349
 that rapes and massacres to be blessed and 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:09.919
 Kasai was made possible by 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:13.009
 the absence of a state of law 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.759
 the foundation of traditional values 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:20.279
 it reigns impunity in particular 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:24.529

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:37.649
 unprecedented violence 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:41.460
 the balance sheets of these cases to the perverts and 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:45.629
 organized was hundreds of 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.509

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:53.129
 millions of displaced people to 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:59.060
 the interior of the country and the loss of 6 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:06:01.469
 millions of visuals to imagine 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.499
 the equivalent of the entire province of

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:55.840
 break the spiral of violence and we 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.970
 all have the power to change the 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.230

 new information technologies and 

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.750
 of communication 

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:54.940
 no one can say I did not know 

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:59.090
 not with these Nobel Peace Prizes 

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:02.330
 I call the world to be less and 

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:05.480
 I urge you to join us 

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:09.070
 to put an end to this suffering that 

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.780
 shame on our common humanity 

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:16.820
 the inhabitants of my country have 

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:19.850
 desperate for peace but 

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.480
 how to build peace on 

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.940
 mass graves 

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.150
 how to build peace without truth 

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:31.170
 nor reconciliation 

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:34.500
 how to build peace without justice 

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:39.400
 neither repair 

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:43.540
 at the moment I'm talking to you report to 

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.420
 the selfish mildew in the drawers of a 

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:48.900
 office in new york 

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:53.350
 it was written after an investigation 

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:55.750
 professional and rigorous on 

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:59.290
 war crimes and violations of 

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:03.160
 human rights perpetrated in the congo 

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:08.170
 this survey explicitly name 

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:13.060
 victims of dates places but elite 

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:15.520
 the authors it is report of the project 

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:18.420

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:22.990
 united nations human rights 

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:24.810
 describes no less than 617 war crimes 

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:30.030
 and crimes against humanity 

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:33.040
 and maybe even crimes of genocide 

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:35.100
 what is the world waiting for them to be 

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:39.370
 taken into account 

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:44.290
 there is no lasting peace without justice 

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:46.120
 but justice is not negotiated 

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.510
 let's have the courage to take a look 

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:52.660
 unbiased criticism of events 

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:54.420

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.240
 the Great Lakes Region 

00:14:54.420 --> 00:15:01.170
 let's have the courage to reveal the names of 

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.210
 perpetrators of crimes against humanity 

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.520
 to simply avoid them 

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:10.360
 continue to mourn this region 

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:12.150
 martyrdom let us have the courage to recognize 

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.730

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:19.199

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:17.780
 to tell you the story of sarah 

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:21.980
 sarah was transferred to the hospital 

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:24.140

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.550
 village had been attacked by a group 

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:32.960

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:36.940

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:42.620

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:45.320
 naked sarah every day were undergoing 

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.470
 gang rapes until she 

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.130
 lost consciousness 

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:54.440
 b2c rape used as a weapon of war 

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:57.380
 and destroy of course sarah but 

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.570
 also his family his community brief 

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:03.520
 simply destroy the tucistes 

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:07.060
 on arrival at the hospital 

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:10.810
 sarah could not walk or even 

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:15.680
 hold up and could not hold back 

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:17.079
 nor her nice urine and that because of 

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.480
 the severity of his injuries 

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:23.360
 urinary genitals and digestive coupled with 

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.880
 an infection on added nobody 

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:29.710
 could imagine she would be a day 

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:33.920
 able to get back on his feet 

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:36.500
 yet every day that passes and the 

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.510
 desires to continue to live shine in 

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.030
 their eyes 

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:44.450
 every day that passes and it was she 

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:46.670
 who encouraged the nursing staff to 

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.550
 is not losing hope 

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:52.370
 every day that passes and sarah it's 

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:57.590
 was beating for his survival 

00:17:52.370 --> 00:18:03.659
 today that's a beautiful woman 

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:06.120
 smiling strong charming sarah stood 

00:18:03.659 --> 00:18:08.990
 committed to helping people and a lived 

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:13.320
 a story similar to his 

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:15.809
 it received 5 in US dollars a 

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.019
 allowance that our house transits 

00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:21.690
 dorcas gives women wishing 

00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:23.399
 rebuild their lives on the socio 

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.799
 economic 

00:18:23.399 --> 00:18:26.509
 today sarah runs her little 

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:29.639
 business 

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:31.649
 she bought a small lot the 

00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:34.289
 mozilla foundation ideas with tons 

00:18:31.649 --> 00:18:35.539
 to make a roof she could get 

00:18:34.289 --> 00:18:39.440
 to build a home 

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:43.379
 she is autonomous and very proud 

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.590
 to be autonomous his story shows that 

00:18:43.379 --> 00:18:49.980
 even if a situation is difficult and 

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.179
 it despairs me and the determination with 

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.730
 the determination 

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:55.350
 there is always hope at the end of 

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:59.779
 tunnel 

00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:04.980
 if a woman like sarah does not give up 

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:07.649
 what are we doing to do this and 

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.919
 of course the story says it stops 

00:19:07.649 --> 00:19:14.340
 Congolese but there is sahara in 

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:18.509
 Central African Republic in Colombia in 

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:22.879
 bosnia oniam to anne iraq and in well 

00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:26.220
 other countries in conflict in the world 

00:19:22.879 --> 00:19:28.409
 at panzi our care program 

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:32.429
 holistic that includes support 

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:35.460
 psychological medical this economic sky 

00:19:32.429 --> 00:19:37.470
 and legal watch worried even though the 

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.250
 road to healing is long 

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.250
 difficult 

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:44.210
 victims have the potential to 

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:47.370
 transform their suffering into power 

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:50.600
 they can become actresses of 

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:54.000
 positive change in society 

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:57.300
 this is the case already the city of joy 

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.390
 our rehabilitation center in bukavu 

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:04.770
 where women are helped to spread 

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:07.470
 their destiny to hand however they do not 

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:11.420
 can not do it alone and our role 

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:16.860
 is to listen to them like today 

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:20.880
 we are listening to madam nadia mourad 

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:25.740
 nadia your courage your daring 

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:28.050
 your ability to give me hope 

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:33.390
 a source of inspiration for the world 

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:35.160
 whole but for me especially the 

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:38.760
 Nobel Peace Prize which is ours 

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.880
 awarded today laura of value 

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.650
 real who if he can change 

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.490
 concretely the lives of the victims of 

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.970
 sexual violence 

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:51.680
 departure the world and helped bring back 

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.680
 peace in our countries 

00:20:53.130 --> 00:21:01.620
 so what can we do 

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:05.350
 or what can you do 

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:10.270
 firstly it's our responsibility 

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:15.010
 everyone to act in this way and to act is 

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:18.730
 a choice is a choice to stop or not 

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:21.250
 violence against women 

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:25.270
 whether there is masculinity or not 

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:27.940
 positive that promotes gender equality 

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.630
 in times of peace as in times of 

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.380
 war 

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:35.620
 [Applause] 

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:42.190
 [Music] 

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:42.190
 [Applause] 

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:56.440
 to act is a choice to support or not 

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:59.620
 a woman of the protected where we defend 

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:02.230
 give up right to fight or not to his 

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.910
 sides in the ravaged country by 

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:06.130
 Conflicts 

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:10.110
 finally it's a choice to build 

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:13.150
 or not peace in the countries in conflict 

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.970
 to act is simply refused 

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.890
 indifference 

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:20.320
 if it is necessary to make war it is the 

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:23.520
 war against indifference that gnaws 

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.980
 our societies today 

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:30.070
 secondly we are all would be 

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:33.430
 vabs with these women and 

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:36.220
 their loved ones and we all have to 

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:39.220
 appropriate these fights including the 

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:43.680
 states that have to stop hosting 

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:46.300
 the leaders who tolerated or worse 

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.660
 use sexual violence to 

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:52.350
 access to power 

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.350
 states must 

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:58.500
 [Music] 

00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:08.529
 states must stop them 

00:23:06.729 --> 00:23:11.139
 welcome with the red carpets 

00:23:08.529 --> 00:23:14.499
 and then all states must trace 

00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:17.909
 a red line against the use of 

00:23:14.499 --> 00:23:17.909
 rape as a weapon of war 

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:27.070
 a red line that would be synonymous with 

00:23:23.229 --> 00:23:30.450
 political economic sanctions and 

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.450
 prosecution 

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:37.820
 to do an act is just not 

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.740
 difficult 

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:44.990
 to do a right act is not difficult 

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:48.090
 it's a question of political will 

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:52.770
 thirdly we must recognize 

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:54.260
 the sufferings of the survivors of 

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:57.600
 all violence against women 

00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:00.810
 in armed conflicts and support them 

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.850
 holistically in their process 

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:05.750
 of healing 

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:09.570
 here I insisted on repairs 

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:13.320
 these measures that gives them compensation 

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:15.080
 and satisfaction the air allow to be 

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:19.800
 start a new life 

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:23.670
 that's a human right I call them 

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:26.670
 states to support the initiative of the 

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:28.290
 creation of a global fund for 

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.660
 repairs for victims of 

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:33.370
 sexual violence in conflict 

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.630
 armed
