00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:01.790
States is coal-fired power plants and so
 

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.770
States is coal-fired power plants and so
a regulation of those has become an

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:05.780
a regulation of those has become an
 

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.770
a regulation of those has become an
extremely important issue EPA was taking

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:11.780
extremely important issue EPA was taking
 

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.870
extremely important issue EPA was taking
more time to come up with these

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880
more time to come up with these
 

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.540
more time to come up with these
standards than some in the environmental

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:16.550
standards than some in the environmental
 

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.300
standards than some in the environmental
community wanted it to take and so they

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.310
community wanted it to take and so they
 

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.870
community wanted it to take and so they
started a lawsuit to try to put EPA

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880
started a lawsuit to try to put EPA
 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.720
started a lawsuit to try to put EPA
under a deadline and that is a very

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:25.730
under a deadline and that is a very
 

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.750
under a deadline and that is a very
typical situation with us environmental

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760
typical situation with us environmental
 

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.520
typical situation with us environmental
laws EPA takes a long time and people

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:32.530
laws EPA takes a long time and people
 

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.040
laws EPA takes a long time and people
sue them to try to speed them up and

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.050
sue them to try to speed them up and
 

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.680
sue them to try to speed them up and
they end up reaching an agreement on a

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:38.690
they end up reaching an agreement on a
 

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.270
they end up reaching an agreement on a
new schedule so that is a very common

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:42.280
new schedule so that is a very common
 

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.510
new schedule so that is a very common
kind of event that happened here and the

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:46.520
kind of event that happened here and the
 

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.540
kind of event that happened here and the
deadline for the

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:48.550
deadline for the
 

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.009
deadline for the
new source performance standards for

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019
new source performance standards for
 

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:56.579
new source performance standards for
utility boilers was June of 2011 so they

00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:56.589
utility boilers was June of 2011 so they
 

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:59.490
utility boilers was June of 2011 so they
were supposed to come out this past June

00:10:59.490 --> 00:10:59.500
were supposed to come out this past June
 

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.600
were supposed to come out this past June
and then they were extended till the end

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:03.610
and then they were extended till the end
 

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.340
and then they were extended till the end
of September to just you know a few days

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:08.350
of September to just you know a few days
 

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.560
of September to just you know a few days
ago and then EPA said they still need

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.570
ago and then EPA said they still need
 

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.590
ago and then EPA said they still need
more time and they didn't announce when

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600
more time and they didn't announce when
 

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.880
more time and they didn't announce when
they are going to come out with their

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:17.890
they are going to come out with their
 

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.490
they are going to come out with their
new standards they are being sued again

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:20.500
new standards they are being sued again
 

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.090
new standards they are being sued again
and so we'll go back and forth and again

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:24.100
and so we'll go back and forth and again
 

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.949
and so we'll go back and forth and again
there's this typical pattern so we don't

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:25.959
there's this typical pattern so we don't
 

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:30.060
there's this typical pattern so we don't
know when EPA is going to come out with

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.070
know when EPA is going to come out with
 

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.460
know when EPA is going to come out with
these standards for the allowable

these standards for the allowable
 

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.430
these standards for the allowable
greenhouse gas emissions from from new

power plants so that's that's one set of

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940
power plants so that's that's one set of
 

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.889
power plants so that's that's one set of
rules another set of standards are what

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:46.899
rules another set of standards are what
 

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:49.110
rules another set of standards are what
is called best available control

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120
is called best available control

is called best available control
technology bact that and those are

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:54.670
technology bact that and those are
 

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.490
technology bact that and those are
issued by the states since much of the

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500
issued by the states since much of the
 

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.900
issued by the states since much of the
environmental regulation in the US is

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:00.910
environmental regulation in the US is
 

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.480
environmental regulation in the US is
carried out by the states acting under a

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:03.490
carried out by the states acting under a
 

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.319
carried out by the states acting under a
federal mandate so the states come out

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:07.329
federal mandate so the states come out
 

00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:09.540
federal mandate so the states come out
with that that's still in the early

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:09.550
with that that's still in the early
 

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.360
with that that's still in the early
stages so far it looks like many of the

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.370
stages so far it looks like many of the
 

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.650
stages so far it looks like many of the
requirements with respect to greenhouse

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:16.660
requirements with respect to greenhouse
 

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.740
requirements with respect to greenhouse
gases will require energy efficiency

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:19.750
gases will require energy efficiency
 

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.530

to control greenhouse gas emissions

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.520
to control greenhouse gas emissions
 

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.240
to control greenhouse gas emissions
directly many of the utilities will

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.250
directly many of the utilities will
 

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.610
directly many of the utilities will
probably be required to spend more money

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:29.620
probably be required to spend more money
 

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.949
probably be required to spend more money
on energy efficiency to reduce the

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959
on energy efficiency to reduce the
 

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:34.530
on energy efficiency to reduce the
amount of electricity they generate and

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:34.540
amount of electricity they generate and
 

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.740
amount of electricity they generate and
therefore the amount of greenhouse gases

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:36.750
therefore the amount of greenhouse gases
 

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.170
therefore the amount of greenhouse gases

another existing law in the US that
 

00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:22.209
another existing law in the US that
already has a cap-and-trade program and

already has a cap-and-trade program and
 

00:20:22.219 --> 00:20:23.709
already has a cap-and-trade program and
that's called the Regional Greenhouse

00:20:23.709 --> 00:20:23.719
that's called the Regional Greenhouse
 

00:20:23.719 --> 00:20:29.259
that's called the Regional Greenhouse
Gas Initiative called Reggie RGGI it

00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:29.269
Gas Initiative called Reggie RGGI it
 

00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:32.940
Gas Initiative called Reggie RGGI it
covers it covered ten states in the

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:32.950
covers it covered ten states in the

northeastern united states including New
 

00:20:37.489 --> 00:20:40.449
northeastern united states including New
York and New Jersey but the Governor of

00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:40.459
York and New Jersey but the Governor of
 

00:20:40.459 --> 00:20:42.699
York and New Jersey but the Governor of
New Jersey chris Christie just took New

00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:42.709
New Jersey chris Christie just took New
 

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:44.589
New Jersey chris Christie just took New
Jersey out of the program so it now has

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:44.599
Jersey out of the program so it now has
 

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:46.869
Jersey out of the program so it now has
nine states but Reggie is a

00:20:46.869 --> 00:20:46.879
nine states but Reggie is a
 

00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:50.349
nine states but Reggie is a
cap-and-trade program in these states it

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:50.359
cap-and-trade program in these states it
 

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:53.169
cap-and-trade program in these states it
only applies to carbon dioxide emissions

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:53.179
only applies to carbon dioxide emissions
 

00:20:53.179 --> 00:20:57.039
only applies to carbon dioxide emissions
and it only applies to power plants of

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:57.049
and it only applies to power plants of
 

00:20:57.049 --> 00:21:01.599
and it only applies to power plants of
more than 25 megawatts of capacity so

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:01.609
more than 25 megawatts of capacity so
 

00:21:01.609 --> 00:21:05.919
more than 25 megawatts of capacity so
it's been operating about two years when

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:05.929
it's been operating about two years when
 

00:21:05.929 --> 00:21:12.639
it's been operating about two years when
it was set up they they gave away a

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:12.649
it was set up they they gave away a
 

00:21:12.649 --> 00:21:14.979
it was set up they they gave away a
large number they provided for a large

00:21:14.979 --> 00:21:14.989
large number they provided for a large
 

00:21:14.989 --> 00:21:18.940
large number they provided for a large
number of allowances allowed a large

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:18.950
number of allowances allowed a large
 

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.810
number of allowances allowed a large
quantity of carbon dioxide to be emitted

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:22.820
quantity of carbon dioxide to be emitted
 

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.789
quantity of carbon dioxide to be emitted
and it turned out they allowed too much

00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799
and it turned out they allowed too much
 

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:28.029
and it turned out they allowed too much
it's similar to what happened in some of

00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039
it's similar to what happened in some of
 

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:28.540
it's similar to what happened in some of
the

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:28.550
the
 

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.280
the
beginning years of the European

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:30.290
beginning years of the European
 

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.680
beginning years of the European
emissions trading system and as a result

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:32.690
emissions trading system and as a result
 

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:37.480
emissions trading system and as a result
of that sorry and as a result of that

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:37.490
of that sorry and as a result of that
 

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.410
of that sorry and as a result of that
the price is very low and so the the

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:41.420
the price is very low and so the the
 

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.440
the price is very low and so the the
price of allowance is so low that it is

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:44.450
price of allowance is so low that it is
 

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.590
price of allowance is so low that it is
not really having much effect on

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600
not really having much effect on
 

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.940
not really having much effect on
emissions but it is generating a lot of

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:48.950
emissions but it is generating a lot of
 

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:54.000
emissions but it is generating a lot of
money that the states have did you ever

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.010
 
 

00:21:54.010 --> 00:22:01.810
 
which is important for all of us I think

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:01.820
which is important for all of us I think
 

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.820
which is important for all of us I think
we have a hard time understanding how

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:03.830
we have a hard time understanding how
 

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:09.370
we have a hard time understanding how
the levels of regulation interact in

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:09.380
the levels of regulation interact in
 

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.260
the levels of regulation interact in
such a way that things that happen or

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:11.270
such a way that things that happen or
 

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.780
such a way that things that happen or
seem to be for us cause higher priority

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:13.790
seem to be for us cause higher priority
 

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.600
seem to be for us cause higher priority
would be developed at a lower level of

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:16.610
would be developed at a lower level of
 

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.480
would be developed at a lower level of
regulation or a state level that's going

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:19.490
regulation or a state level that's going
 

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.300
regulation or a state level that's going
to think and I think I mean I'd like to

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:22.310
to think and I think I mean I'd like to
 

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:28.500
to think and I think I mean I'd like to
have you you know that for us Europeans

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:28.510
have you you know that for us Europeans
 

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.490
have you you know that for us Europeans
you always have a hard time

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:30.500
you always have a hard time
 

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.380
you always have a hard time
understanding that regulation loss would

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:35.390
understanding that regulation loss would
 

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.210
understanding that regulation loss would
start by the lower level of the United

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.220
start by the lower level of the United
 

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.830
start by the lower level of the United
States and not by your federal level

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840
States and not by your federal level
 

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:45.260
States and not by your federal level
which is the common European you know

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:45.270
 
 

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.850
 
well that's a very good point and and

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:47.860
well that's a very good point and and
 

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.600
well that's a very good point and and
Americans are amazed to see the European

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:51.610
Americans are amazed to see the European
 

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.540
Americans are amazed to see the European
Commission and the idea that there is

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:54.550
Commission and the idea that there is
 

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.490
Commission and the idea that there is
this body sitting in Brussels that is

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:56.500
this body sitting in Brussels that is
 

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.860
this body sitting in Brussels that is
telling the country's what to do which

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:58.870
telling the country's what to do which
 

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:04.200
telling the country's what to do which
would be unheard of in the u.s. I mean I

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.210
would be unheard of in the u.s. I mean I
 

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.700
would be unheard of in the u.s. I mean I
think it was it was part of the grand

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:05.710
think it was it was part of the grand
 

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.270
think it was it was part of the grand
bargain that was struck in the United

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280
bargain that was struck in the United
 

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.450
bargain that was struck in the United
States in 1789 when our Constitution was

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:12.460
States in 1789 when our Constitution was
 

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.020
States in 1789 when our Constitution was
formed that we had started out with 13

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:16.030
formed that we had started out with 13
 

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.290
formed that we had started out with 13
colonies and in the American Revolution

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:19.300
colonies and in the American Revolution
 

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.560
colonies and in the American Revolution
the each of those colonies became a

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:22.570
the each of those colonies became a
 

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.620
the each of those colonies became a
state and and had very important

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:25.630
state and and had very important
 

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.470
state and and had very important
sovereign roles and so this grand

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480
sovereign roles and so this grand
 

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.990
sovereign roles and so this grand
bargain was struck by the founding

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000
bargain was struck by the founding
 

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.070
bargain was struck by the founding
fathers that each of the states now 50

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080
fathers that each of the states now 50
 

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.610
fathers that each of the states now 50
of them have had major powers and and

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:38.620
of them have had major powers and and
 

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.940
of them have had major powers and and
can go off and do their own in many ways

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:41.950
can go off and do their own in many ways
 

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.580
can go off and do their own in many ways
the US Congress does have the authority

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:44.590
the US Congress does have the authority
 

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.440
the US Congress does have the authority
to preempt state law it's under the

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:49.450
to preempt state law it's under the
 

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:53.220
to preempt state law it's under the
Constitution Congress can do that but

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.230
Constitution Congress can do that but
 

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.670
Constitution Congress can do that but
the members of Congress are all elected

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:56.680
the members of Congress are all elected
 

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.940
the members of Congress are all elected
by their local constituencies many of

00:23:59.940 --> 00:23:59.950
by their local constituencies many of
 

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.700
by their local constituencies many of
them used to be governors of their

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:02.710
them used to be governors of their
 

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:06.090
them used to be governors of their
states their local constituencies remain

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:06.100
states their local constituencies remain
 

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.190
states their local constituencies remain
very important and so Congress in the

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200
very important and so Congress in the
 

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.410
very important and so Congress in the
environmental area has left a very

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:13.420
environmental area has left a very
 

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.690
environmental area has left a very
important role for the states and the

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:15.700
important role for the states and the
 

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.210
important role for the states and the
Clean Air Act is is one example of that

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:18.220
Clean Air Act is is one example of that
 

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.120
Clean Air Act is is one example of that
and so here you see states with

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.130
and so here you see states with
 

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.040
and so here you see states with
radically different policies

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.050
radically different policies
 

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.830
radically different policies
California's policy and the policy of

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840
California's policy and the policy of
 

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.020
California's policy and the policy of
Texas are much different and that's okay

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.030
Texas are much different and that's okay
 

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:49.620
Texas are much different and that's okay
that's allowed

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:49.630
 
 

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.419
 
so states had their own ability to

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:52.429
so states had their own ability to
 

00:24:52.429 --> 00:24:57.909
so states had their own ability to
impose taxes and here with the Regional

00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919
impose taxes and here with the Regional
 

00:24:57.919 --> 00:24:59.950
impose taxes and here with the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative for example

00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960
Greenhouse Gas Initiative for example
 

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.700
Greenhouse Gas Initiative for example
these ten states from the Northeast got

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:03.710
these ten states from the Northeast got
 

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.350
these ten states from the Northeast got
together and they decided they were

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360
together and they decided they were
 

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.560
together and they decided they were
going to impose this charge on the

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:08.570
going to impose this charge on the
 

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.649
going to impose this charge on the
electric utilities operating in that

00:25:11.649 --> 00:25:11.659
electric utilities operating in that
 

00:25:11.659 --> 00:25:15.639
electric utilities operating in that
area so the ten states assess the

00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:15.649
area so the ten states assess the
 

00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:17.769
area so the ten states assess the
charges against the electric utilities

00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:17.779
charges against the electric utilities
 

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:20.289
charges against the electric utilities
the electric utilities pay in the money

00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:20.299
the electric utilities pay in the money
 

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:22.240
the electric utilities pay in the money
and the federal government has nothing

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.250
and the federal government has nothing
 

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:52.910
and the federal government has nothing
to do about it

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:52.920
 
 

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.110
 
that's a very good question and the

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120
that's a very good question and the
 

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.930
that's a very good question and the

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.480
answer to that question is it has done
very little to reduce the emissions of

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:00.490
very little to reduce the emissions of
 

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.910
very little to reduce the emissions of
carbon dioxide because the price is so

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:02.920
carbon dioxide because the price is so
 

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.580
carbon dioxide because the price is so
low the price is so low that it does not

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:05.590
low the price is so low that it does not
 

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.280

several hundred million dollars which
the states have received and most of

the states have received and most of
 

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.870
the states have received and most of
that money has been put into energy

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880

that in our session in our discussions
 

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.610
that in our session in our discussions
but that's really an important step in

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:06.620
but that's really an important step in
 

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.110
but that's really an important step in
your presentation that I wanted to

your presentation that I wanted to
 

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.540
your presentation that I wanted to

matters more intense them well that's
 

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.420
matters more intense them well that's
that's a very good point and in recent

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:16.430
that's a very good point and in recent
 

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:23.310
that's a very good point and in recent
years many politicians running for some

well we don't agree with your comment
okay I mean well so whilst the details

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120
okay I mean well so whilst the details
 

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.910
okay I mean well so whilst the details
of the system might be different I think

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:33.920
of the system might be different I think
 

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.640

the sentences are very very similar
there's a feeling that centralized power

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:37.940
there's a feeling that centralized power
 

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.420
there's a feeling that centralized power
is not necessarily a positive thing when

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:40.430
is not necessarily a positive thing when
 

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.160

feeling to have the centralized power of
courses overs and I expect it's very

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:48.470
courses overs and I expect it's very
 

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.860
courses overs and I expect it's very
similar if you sit at state level and I

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:50.870
similar if you sit at state level and I
 

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.170

what happens but but the fact that
 

00:40:13.999 --> 00:40:16.180
what happens but but the fact that
President Obama did that for the ozone

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:16.190
President Obama did that for the ozone
 

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.960

about resigning but she's still there
 

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:53.410
about resigning but she's still there
and so of course we don't have a

if the government does not bite then
 

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.230
if the government does not bite then
citizens can go to court and they can

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240
citizens can go to court and they can
 

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.100
citizens can go to court and they can
obtain a court order to the plant to

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:14.110
obtain a court order to the plant to
 

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:17.970
obtain a court order to the plant to
clean up and significant fines can be

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:17.980
clean up and significant fines can be
 

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:22.800
clean up and significant fines can be
imposed and the citizens get paid their

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:22.810
imposed and the citizens get paid their
 

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:27.180
imposed and the citizens get paid their
attorneys fees and so that's an

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:27.190
attorneys fees and so that's an
 

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:44.870
attorneys fees and so that's an

they would get the discharge monitoring

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:17.190
they would get the discharge monitoring
 

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:19.280
they would get the discharge monitoring
report and they would compare it to the

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:19.290
report and they would compare it to the
 

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.320
report and they would compare it to the
permit and if there was a permit

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:21.330
permit and if there was a permit
 

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.390
permit and if there was a permit
violation they would sue and they would

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400
violation they would sue and they would
 

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.040
violation they would sue and they would
always win and they would get their

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.050
always win and they would get their
 

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.140
always win and they would get their
attorneys fees and it's a very nice way

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:27.150
attorneys fees and it's a very nice way
 

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:34.100
attorneys fees and it's a very nice way
to make a living no and a class action

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:34.110
to make a living no and a class action
 

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:37.400
to make a living no and a class action
would not be helpful here I use a class

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:37.410
would not be helpful here I use a class
 

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:41.360
would not be helpful here I use a class
action as a way for many people to sue

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:41.370
action as a way for many people to sue
 

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.570
action as a way for many people to sue
if there are individual money damages

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:44.580
if there are individual money damages
 

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.880
if there are individual money damages
that you have and let's say you have a

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:46.890
that you have and let's say you have a
 

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.100
that you have and let's say you have a
million people each of whom suffered

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:49.110
million people each of whom suffered
 

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:52.340
million people each of whom suffered
five dollars in damage then it makes

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:52.350
five dollars in damage then it makes
 

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.380
five dollars in damage then it makes
sense to bring a class action but that

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:54.390
sense to bring a class action but that
 

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.600
sense to bring a class action but that
is seldom the case in the environmental

is seldom the case in the environmental
 

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.420
is seldom the case in the environmental
area here what the what the attorneys

00:48:59.420 --> 00:48:59.430
area here what the what the attorneys
 

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:05.030
area here what the what the attorneys
want is the they want punishment of the

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040
want is the they want punishment of the

themselves personally got sick yeah they
 

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.810

work well well that's a big difference

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:43.820
work well well that's a big difference
 

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.060
work well well that's a big difference
between big shaker being exposed to the

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.070
between big shaker being exposed to the
 

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.920
between big shaker being exposed to the
water lots of people can show that they

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:47.930
water lots of people can show that they
 

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:50.680
water lots of people can show that they
were exposed it's much harder to show

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:50.690
were exposed it's much harder to show
 

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.340
were exposed it's much harder to show
you because of the exposure and so is it

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:54.350
you because of the exposure and so is it
 

00:49:54.350 --> 00:50:12.970
you because of the exposure and so is it
both affects more than

I see well so we only have class at in
 

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.130
I see well so we only have class at in
class actions you have to show you

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:21.140
class actions you have to show you
 

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:27.849
class actions you have to show you
you're injured not just exposed so we

00:50:27.849 --> 00:50:27.859
you're injured not just exposed so we
 

00:50:27.859 --> 00:50:30.280
you're injured not just exposed so we

are similar laws in Europe so the the

are similar laws in Europe so the the

are similar laws in Europe so the the
issue that EPA is now considering is

00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:24.109
issue that EPA is now considering is
 

00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:25.780
issue that EPA is now considering is
whether to

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:25.790
whether to

to leave kool ass ash regulation as it
 

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.270
to leave kool ass ash regulation as it
is now which is unlikely or to regulate

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280
is now which is unlikely or to regulate
 

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.370
is now which is unlikely or to regulate
it like hazardous waste which would make

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:36.380
it like hazardous waste which would make
 

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.190
it like hazardous waste which would make
it far more expensive or to come up with

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200
it far more expensive or to come up with
 

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.550
it far more expensive or to come up with
something in between I think most people

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:42.560
something in between I think most people
 

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.560
something in between I think most people
think that they are likely to come up

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:44.570
think that they are likely to come up
 

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.690
think that they are likely to come up
with in something in between they won't

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:46.700
with in something in between they won't
 

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:51.160
with in something in between they won't
require it to be handled in the same way

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:51.170
require it to be handled in the same way
 

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:55.930

that dioxin or some some other really
 

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.300
that dioxin or some some other really
dangerous chemical would be handled but

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:58.310
dangerous chemical would be handled but
 

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.360
dangerous chemical would be handled but
they won't just let it as it is so so

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:01.370
they won't just let it as it is so so

so there's a major controversy now a

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:27.290
so there's a major controversy now a
 

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:30.220
so there's a major controversy now a
major dispute about the effect that all

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:30.230
major dispute about the effect that all

major dispute about the effect that all
of these regulations if they were to

of these regulations if they were to
 

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.970
of these regulations if they were to
take effect will have on the reliability

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:36.980
take effect will have on the reliability
 

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:40.390
take effect will have on the reliability
of the electric system in the u.s. there

are many an industry who are saying that

as a result of these rules many of the

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:46.490
as a result of these rules many of the
 

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:50.410
as a result of these rules many of the
existing generating facilities will shut

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:50.420
existing generating facilities will shut
 

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.780
existing generating facilities will shut
down because it's too expensive to

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:52.790
down because it's too expensive to
 

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:56.590
down because it's too expensive to
comply with these new rules others are

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:56.600
comply with these new rules others are
 

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.590
comply with these new rules others are
saying no that won't happen the power

00:53:59.590 --> 00:53:59.600
saying no that won't happen the power

plants that may shut down are getting

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:02.450
plants that may shut down are getting
 

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:05.250
plants that may shut down are getting
very old and are already on economic and

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:05.260
very old and are already on economic and
 

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.590
very old and are already on economic and
probably would be shut down anyway so

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:08.600
probably would be shut down anyway so
 

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.170
probably would be shut down anyway so
that that's a major battle right now and

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:11.180
that that's a major battle right now and
 

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.100
that that's a major battle right now and
you have

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:12.110
you have
 

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:24.990
you have
the cost of these these additional

the cost of these these additional
 

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.280
the cost of these these additional
proportion of these additional costs

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:27.290
proportion of these additional costs
 

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:33.480
proportion of these additional costs
might might be paid for by the customer

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:33.490
 
 

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:37.270

companies won't be able to plants won't
be able to sell their power because it

be able to sell their power because it
 

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.730
be able to sell their power because it
will be too expensive and because of the

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:48.740
will be too expensive and because of the
 

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.640
will be too expensive and because of the
operation of the electricity markets and

that they will only be able to sell

that they will only be able to sell

that they will only be able to sell
their power during the peak periods and

their power during the peak periods and
 

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.700
their power during the peak periods and
so they'll still operate but but only

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:12.710
so they'll still operate but but only
 

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:15.310
so they'll still operate but but only
they'll still stay alive but only a few

they'll still stay alive but only a few
 

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.960
they'll still stay alive but only a few
hours a year will they be able to sell

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:16.970
hours a year will they be able to sell
 

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:19.600
hours a year will they be able to sell
their power but that of course doesn't

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:19.610
their power but that of course doesn't
 

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.580

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:23.290
work if you have to install a cooling
tower because the cooling towers they're

all around the year and suddenly what
 

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.410
all around the year and suddenly what
would be here so so that right so yeah

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:32.420
would be here so so that right so yeah

subject to all these rules with the
single exception again of Texas and and

01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:53.540
single exception again of Texas and and
 

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.559
single exception again of Texas and and
Texas is mostly I don't know if you

01:08:56.559 --> 01:08:56.569
Texas is mostly I don't know if you
 

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:58.620
Texas is mostly I don't know if you
heard about that

01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:58.630
heard about that
 

01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:01.600
heard about that
Texas has mostly disconnected itself

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:01.610
Texas has mostly disconnected itself
 

01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:03.130
Texas has mostly disconnected itself
from the rest of the country they

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:03.140
from the rest of the country they
 

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.010
from the rest of the country they
generate their own electricity they

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:06.020
generate their own electricity they
 

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.630
generate their own electricity they
transmit it within the state there are

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640
transmit it within the state there are
 

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.490
transmit it within the state there are
there's very little transmission

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:12.500
there's very little transmission
 

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.280
there's very little transmission
capacity between Texas and the other

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:15.290
capacity between Texas and the other
 

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.970
capacity between Texas and the other
states and and therefore they're largely

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:18.980
states and and therefore they're largely
 

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.430
states and and therefore they're largely
independent and since they're self

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440
independent and since they're self
 

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.380
independent and since they're self
contained that are not subject to

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:23.390
contained that are not subject to
 

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.450
contained that are not subject to
federal regulation in the same way that

01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:25.460
federal regulation in the same way that
 

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:41.020
federal regulation in the same way that
the rest of the country is well

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:41.030
the rest of the country is well
 

01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.210
the rest of the country is well
politically you know they're the biggest

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:43.220
politically you know they're the biggest
 

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.870
politically you know they're the biggest
state other than Alaska they think

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:45.880
state other than Alaska they think
 

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.910
state other than Alaska they think
differently than many other parts of the

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920
differently than many other parts of the
 

01:09:48.920 --> 01:10:01.930
differently than many other parts of the
country

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:01.940
 
 

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:08.209
 
I don't think so yeah they're a state

01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219
I don't think so yeah they're a state
 

01:10:08.219 --> 01:10:10.910
I don't think so yeah they're a state
like everybody else they may not accept

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920
like everybody else they may not accept
 

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:17.570
like everybody else they may not accept
that well legally what they did is they

01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580
that well legally what they did is they
 

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.520
that well legally what they did is they
organized their electric system so

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:19.530
organized their electric system so
 

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.100
organized their electric system so
they're not subject to FERC authority by

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:22.110
they're not subject to FERC authority by
 

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:28.340
they're not subject to FERC authority by
being isolated which is which is very

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:28.350
being isolated which is which is very
 

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:33.040
being isolated which is which is very
unusual but they're happy with it and so

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.050
unusual but they're happy with it and so
 

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.660
unusual but they're happy with it and so
so they're the exception but everybody

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:35.670
so they're the exception but everybody
 

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:37.910
so they're the exception but everybody
else is is subject to it and you have

01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920
else is is subject to it and you have
 

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.990
else is is subject to it and you have
all these regional transmission

01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000
all these regional transmission
 

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.290
all these regional transmission
organizations around the country that

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:41.300
organizations around the country that
 

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:45.320
organizations around the country that
that help dictate when power lines are

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:45.330
that help dictate when power lines are
 

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:48.860
that help dictate when power lines are
built that has only been operating for

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:48.870
built that has only been operating for
 

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.660
built that has only been operating for
the last several years and people think

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:50.670
the last several years and people think
 

01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:53.689
the last several years and people think
that it still needs a lot of a lot of

01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699
that it still needs a lot of a lot of
 

01:10:53.699 --> 01:10:56.750
that it still needs a lot of a lot of
reforms there was also a law passed to

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760
reforms there was also a law passed to
 

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:02.300
reforms there was also a law passed to
try to allow federal preemption if a

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:02.310
try to allow federal preemption if a
 

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:05.930
try to allow federal preemption if a
state was going to slowly and allowing

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940
state was going to slowly and allowing
 

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.700
state was going to slowly and allowing
the transmitted the construction of a

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:07.710
the transmitted the construction of a
 

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.939
the transmitted the construction of a
new transmission line there was a law

01:11:10.939 --> 01:11:10.949
new transmission line there was a law
 

01:11:10.949 --> 01:11:13.700
new transmission line there was a law
that allowed FERC to go in and override

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:13.710
that allowed FERC to go in and override
 

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:17.870
that allowed FERC to go in and override
it and to preempt state authority that

01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880
it and to preempt state authority that
 

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.120
it and to preempt state authority that
has not been very effective and so there

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:20.130
has not been very effective and so there
 

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:22.780
has not been very effective and so there
now efforts to try to

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:22.790
now efforts to try to
 

01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:27.090
now efforts to try to
to strengthen that federal authority

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:27.100
to strengthen that federal authority
 

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:31.000
to strengthen that federal authority
another important set of rules that FERC

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.010
another important set of rules that FERC
 

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:33.940
another important set of rules that FERC
is now developing is on integration of

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:33.950
is now developing is on integration of
 

01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:37.270
is now developing is on integration of
renewables into the into the system to

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280
renewables into the into the system to
 

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.780
renewables into the into the system to
make it easier for generators of wind

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:40.790
make it easier for generators of wind
 

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:43.480
make it easier for generators of wind
and solar and other renewable energy to

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:43.490
and solar and other renewable energy to
 

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:47.830
and solar and other renewable energy to
tie into the the grid and to sell their

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840
tie into the the grid and to sell their
 

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.110
tie into the the grid and to sell their
power and obviously there's a major

01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120
power and obviously there's a major
 

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.180
power and obviously there's a major
issue that's wind and solar are

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:52.190
issue that's wind and solar are
 

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:54.400
issue that's wind and solar are
intermittent and the Sun doesn't always

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:54.410
intermittent and the Sun doesn't always
 

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:57.070
intermittent and the Sun doesn't always
shine and the wind doesn't always blow

01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080
shine and the wind doesn't always blow
 

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.440
shine and the wind doesn't always blow
so there are different characteristics

01:11:59.440 --> 01:11:59.450
so there are different characteristics
 

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:02.170
so there are different characteristics
that make it harder for them to sell

01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:02.180
that make it harder for them to sell
 

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.930
that make it harder for them to sell
electricity into the system and so FERC

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:04.940
electricity into the system and so FERC
 

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.570
electricity into the system and so FERC
is working on finding ways to make that

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:07.580
is working on finding ways to make that
 

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:11.620
is working on finding ways to make that
easier there are also they also issued a

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:11.630
easier there are also they also issued a
 

01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:15.430
easier there are also they also issued a
recent rule on on paying for demand

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440
recent rule on on paying for demand
 

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.880
recent rule on on paying for demand
response as you know with demand

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:18.890
response as you know with demand
 

01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:22.350
response as you know with demand
response a large consumer of electricity

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360
response a large consumer of electricity
 

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.690
response a large consumer of electricity
agrees with the power company not to not

01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:25.700
agrees with the power company not to not
 

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.550
agrees with the power company not to not
to use electricity during peak periods

01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:27.560
to use electricity during peak periods
 

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.190
to use electricity during peak periods
and they get an economic benefit for it

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:30.200
and they get an economic benefit for it
 

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.800
and they get an economic benefit for it
so FERC has new regulations on how that

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:35.810
so FERC has new regulations on how that
 

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:41.550
so FERC has new regulations on how that
is paid for and is designed so that a

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560
is paid for and is designed so that a
 

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.770
is paid for and is designed so that a
consumer of electricity is paid as much

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:46.780
consumer of electricity is paid as much
 

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:53.320
consumer of electricity is paid as much
for agreeing to it to a demand response

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:53.330
for agreeing to it to a demand response
 

01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:56.350
for agreeing to it to a demand response
program as the electric company would

01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360
program as the electric company would
 

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.480
program as the electric company would
pay to buy electricity from a generator

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:58.490
pay to buy electricity from a generator
 

01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:02.830
pay to buy electricity from a generator
and so that's that's an important new

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840
and so that's that's an important new
 

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:09.310
and so that's that's an important new
rule that that has been issued and there

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:09.320
rule that that has been issued and there
 

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.220
rule that that has been issued and there
are also a great many rules that are

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:12.230
are also a great many rules that are
 

01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:14.290
are also a great many rules that are
being issued now on the smart grid on

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:14.300
being issued now on the smart grid on
 

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.900
being issued now on the smart grid on
trying to encourage that and a lot of

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:16.910
trying to encourage that and a lot of
 

01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:19.030
trying to encourage that and a lot of
federal research-and-development money

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040
federal research-and-development money
 

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.140
federal research-and-development money
is going into development of more Smart

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:23.150
is going into development of more Smart
 

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:29.620
is going into development of more Smart
Grid technologies the final item on my

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:29.630
Grid technologies the final item on my
 

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:32.430
Grid technologies the final item on my
agenda let me just say a few words about

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440
agenda let me just say a few words about
 

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.930
agenda let me just say a few words about
what's happening with

01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:34.940
what's happening with
 

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:37.720
what's happening with
nuclear technology in the US and what's

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:37.730
nuclear technology in the US and what's
 

01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:42.520
nuclear technology in the US and what's
happening with shale gas extraction in

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:42.530
happening with shale gas extraction in
 

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:48.160
happening with shale gas extraction in
the u.s. so as you all know no nuclear

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:48.170
the u.s. so as you all know no nuclear
 

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:50.410
the u.s. so as you all know no nuclear
no new nuclear power plants have been

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:50.420
no new nuclear power plants have been
 

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:53.620
no new nuclear power plants have been
ordered in the United States since the

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:53.630
ordered in the United States since the
 

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:58.660
ordered in the United States since the
three mile island accident of 1979 so we

01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:58.670
three mile island accident of 1979 so we
 

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:02.470
three mile island accident of 1979 so we
have all of the nuclear power plants we

01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480
have all of the nuclear power plants we
 

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.729
have all of the nuclear power plants we
have operating in the United States

01:14:03.729 --> 01:14:03.739
have operating in the United States
 

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:07.120
have operating in the United States
which is about 100 of them are getting

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:07.130
which is about 100 of them are getting
 

01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:11.490
which is about 100 of them are getting
old and are approaching relicensing

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:11.500
old and are approaching relicensing
 

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:16.150
old and are approaching relicensing
there are a lot of fights going on

01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:16.160
there are a lot of fights going on
 

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.280
there are a lot of fights going on
around the United States about whether

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:18.290
around the United States about whether
 

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:20.650

canceled the Yucca Mountain project and

01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800
canceled the Yucca Mountain project and
 

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.940
canceled the Yucca Mountain project and
many people think that a major reason he

many people think that a major reason he
 

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:39.730
many people think that a major reason he
did that is that a very there's a very

whether the administration had the power
 

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.500
whether the administration had the power
to cancel the Yucca Mountain plant and I

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:56.510
to cancel the Yucca Mountain plant and I
 

01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:58.300
to cancel the Yucca Mountain plant and I
don't know how it will turn out some

don't know how it will turn out some
people think that the cancellation of

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:00.950
people think that the cancellation of
 

01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:03.070
people think that the cancellation of
the of the Yucca Mountain project may be

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:03.080
the of the Yucca Mountain project may be
 

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.070
the of the Yucca Mountain project may be
rescinded and they will they make oh

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080
rescinded and they will they make oh
 

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:10.570
rescinded and they will they make oh
back there's also now renewed talk of

what to do with spent fuel and obviously

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880
what to do with spent fuel and obviously
 

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.910
what to do with spent fuel and obviously
that's a difficulty for the growth of

01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920
that's a difficulty for the growth of
 

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.210
that's a difficulty for the growth of
the nuclear industry if we don't have a

the nuclear industry if we don't have a
 

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.790
the nuclear industry if we don't have a
clear solution for what to do with spent

clear solution for what to do with spent
 

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.730
clear solution for what to do with spent
fuel for now it's it's almost all stored

01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:31.740

some perils with doing that over a long
 

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:47.570
some perils with doing that over a long
term so we'll see what happens the final

01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580
term so we'll see what happens the final
 

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.730

there's very little federal regulation
of it and a lot of differences in the

it just a few weeks ago New York State

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:20.130
it just a few weeks ago New York State
 

01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:23.390
it just a few weeks ago New York State
announced that it was going forward with

01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400
announced that it was going forward with
 

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.580
announced that it was going forward with
the idea of allowing

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:25.590
the idea of allowing
 

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:28.790
the idea of allowing
hydrofracking in many parts of the state

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800
hydrofracking in many parts of the state
 

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.280
hydrofracking in many parts of the state
not all of the state but many parts of

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:31.290
not all of the state but many parts of
 

01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:35.450
not all of the state but many parts of
this day many people think that one of

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460
this day many people think that one of
 

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.910
this day many people think that one of
the reasons for that is Governor Cuomo

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920
the reasons for that is Governor Cuomo
 

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.729
the reasons for that is Governor Cuomo
is so eager to shut down the Indian

Point nuclear power plant but he

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780
Point nuclear power plant but he
 

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.390
Point nuclear power plant but he
realizes there has to be an alternative

01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400
realizes there has to be an alternative
 

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.209
realizes there has to be an alternative
source for the electricity that the

01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219
source for the electricity that the
 

01:22:47.219 --> 01:22:51.229
source for the electricity that the
Indian Point plant now generates and

01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239
Indian Point plant now generates and
 

01:22:51.239 --> 01:22:54.680
Indian Point plant now generates and
that is likely to be new new natural

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:54.690
that is likely to be new new natural
 

01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:57.200
that is likely to be new new natural
gas-fired power plants and if you're

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:57.210
gas-fired power plants and if you're
 

01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:58.879
gas-fired power plants and if you're
going to allow new net and natural

01:22:58.879 --> 01:22:58.889
going to allow new net and natural
 

01:22:58.889 --> 01:23:00.560
going to allow new net and natural
gas-fired power plants you probably

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:00.570
gas-fired power plants you probably
 

01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:02.689
gas-fired power plants you probably
ought to allow someone to extract

01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:02.699
ought to allow someone to extract
 

01:23:02.699 --> 01:23:05.930
ought to allow someone to extract
natural gas for those plants so I don't

01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:05.940
natural gas for those plants so I don't
 

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:07.850
natural gas for those plants so I don't
know but that may be one factor that

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860
know but that may be one factor that
 

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.220
know but that may be one factor that
went into New York's decision and

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:10.230
went into New York's decision and
 

01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:13.879
went into New York's decision and
another important factor is that in some

01:23:13.879 --> 01:23:13.889
another important factor is that in some
 

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:15.470
another important factor is that in some
parts of New York State not here in

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480
parts of New York State not here in
 

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.859
parts of New York State not here in
Manhattan but in upstate New York this

01:23:18.859 --> 01:23:18.869
Manhattan but in upstate New York this
 

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:21.800
Manhattan but in upstate New York this
gas development seemed to be a major way

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:21.810
gas development seemed to be a major way
 

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:24.770
gas development seemed to be a major way
to generate new jobs and new local taxes

01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780
to generate new jobs and new local taxes
 

01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:27.080
to generate new jobs and new local taxes
and so forth so a lot of political

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:27.090
and so forth so a lot of political
 

01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:28.959
and so forth so a lot of political
support in some parts of the state in

01:23:28.959 --> 01:23:28.969
support in some parts of the state in
 

01:23:28.969 --> 01:23:31.100
support in some parts of the state in
opposition in other parts of the state

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:31.110
opposition in other parts of the state
 

01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:33.770
opposition in other parts of the state
but clearly the new development of shale

01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780
but clearly the new development of shale
 

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:37.370
but clearly the new development of shale
gas is a is another major development in

01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380
gas is a is another major development in
 

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.520
gas is a is another major development in
the US energy picture
