00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:02.586
- [Instructor] We are told that pentagon

00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:03.503
A'B'C'D'E',

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.650
which is in red right over here,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.761
is the image of pentagon ABCDE

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:11.387
under a dilation.

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:12.720
So that's ABCDE.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.517
What is the scale factor of the dilation?

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.862
So they don't even tell us
the center of the dilation,

00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:21.905
but in order to figure
out the scale factor

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:23.972
you just have to realize
when you do a dilation,

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:26.433
the distance between corresponding points

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.127
will change according to the scale factor.

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:31.124
So for example we could
look at the distance

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:35.164
between point A and
point B right over here.

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.207
What is our change in y?

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:39.924
Our change in, or even
what is our distance?

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:41.387
Our change in y is our distance

00:00:41.387 --> 00:00:43.059
because we don't have a change in x.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.777
Well this is one, two, three,

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.611
four, five, six.

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:48.632
So this length right over here

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:50.628
is equal to six.

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:52.045
Now what about the corresponding side

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:53.212
from A' to B'?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.385
Well this length right
over here is equal to two,

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:59.104
and so you can see we went from having

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:01.170
a length of six to a length of two,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.492
so you would have to multiply by 1/3.

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:05.536
So our scale factor right over here

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:07.834
is 1/3.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.669
Now you might be saying okay
that was pretty straightforward

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.178
because we had a very clear,

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:13.430
you could just see the
distance between A and B.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.311
How would you do it if
you didn't have a vertical

00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:17.424
or a horizontal line?

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:19.468
Well one way to think about it is,

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:22.092
the changes in y and the changes in x

00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:23.601
would scale accordingly.

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:24.599
So if you looked at the distance

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.480
between point A and point E,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.706
our change in y is negative
three right over here,

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:33.887
and our change in x is
positive three right over here.

00:01:33.887 --> 00:01:36.302
And you can see over
here between A' and E',

00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:38.485
our change in y is negative one,

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:40.760
which is 1/3 of negative three,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.432
and our change in x is one,

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:44.476
which is 1/3 of three.

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:46.101
So once again you see our scale factor

00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:48.655
being 1/3.

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.738
Let's do another example.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.270
So we are told that pentagon A'B'C'D'E'

00:01:58.454 --> 00:01:59.801
is the image, and they don't,

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.055
they haven't drawn that here,

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:03.469
is the image of pentagon ABCDE

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.045
under a dilation with
a scale factor of 5/2.

00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:08.764
So they're giving us our scale factor.

00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:11.681
What is the length of segment A'E'?

00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:15.056
So as I was mentioning while I read it,

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:19.120
they didn't actually draw this one out.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.256
So how do we figure out
the length of a segment?

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:23.253
Well I encourage you to pause the video

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:25.598
and try to think about it.

00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:27.107
Well they give us the scale factor,

00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:28.686
and so what it tells us,

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:30.614
the scale factor is 5/2.

00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:34.213
That means that the
corresponding lengths will change

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.535
by a factor of 5/2.

00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:40.436
So to figure out the
length of segment A'E',

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:41.991
this is going to be,

00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:44.035
you could think of it as the image

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:45.202
of segment AE.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.702
And so you can see that

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.035
the length of AE

00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:52.357
is equal to two.

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.172
And so the length of A'E'

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:00.312
is going to be equal to

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:03.540
AE which is two times the scale factor,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.766
times 5/2, this is our scale
factor right over here.

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:09.832
And of course what's two times 5/2?

00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:12.711
Well it is going to be equal to five,

00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:15.196
five of these units right over here.

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.589
So in this case we
didn't even have to draw

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:17.506
A'B'C'D'E'.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.885
In fact they haven't even
given us enough information.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:23.393
I could draw the scale of that,

00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:24.693
but I actually don't know where to put it

00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:26.086
because they didn't even give us

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:27.874
our center of dilation.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.289
But we know that corresponding sides,

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:32.402
or the lengths between
corresponding points,

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:36.210
are going to be scaled
by the scale factor.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.232
Now with that in mind,

00:03:37.232 --> 00:03:39.315
let's do another example.

00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:45.939
So we are told that triangle A'B'C',

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.657
which they depicted right over here,

00:03:47.657 --> 00:03:49.933
is the image of triangle ABC,

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:51.187
which they did not depict,

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:55.157
under a dilation with
a scale factor of two.

00:03:55.157 --> 00:03:57.897
What is the length of segment AB?

00:03:57.897 --> 00:03:59.639
Once again they haven't drawn AB here,

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.730
how do we figure it out?

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.331
Well it's gonna be a similar
way as the last example,

00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:05.142
but here they've given us the image

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:06.489
and they didn't give us the original.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.323
So how do we do it?

00:04:08.323 --> 00:04:09.902
Well the key, and pause the video again

00:04:09.902 --> 00:04:12.433
and try to do it on your own.

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:15.103
Well the key realization here is

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:18.702
that if you take the length of segment AB

00:04:18.702 --> 00:04:21.001
and you were to multiply
by the scale factor,

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:22.882
so you multiply it by two,

00:04:22.882 --> 00:04:24.066
then you're going to get the length

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:25.399
of segment A'B'.

00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:32.031
The image's length is
equal to the scale factor

00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:36.373
times the corresponding length
on our original triangle.

00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:38.695
So what is the length of A'B'?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.390
Well this is straightforward
to figure out.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.851
It is one, two, three, four,

00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:45.429
five, six, seven, eight.

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:47.054
So this right over here is eight,

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:50.189
so we have two times
the length of segment AB

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.814
is equal to eight.

00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:53.881
And then you get the length of segment AB,

00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:55.645
just divide both sides by two,

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:57.224
is equal to four.

00:04:57.224 --> 00:04:58.474
And we're done.
