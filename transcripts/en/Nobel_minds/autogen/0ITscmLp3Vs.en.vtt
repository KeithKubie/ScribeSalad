GCSE<00:00:03.000><c> and</c><00:00:03.300><c> I</c><00:00:03.360><c> want</c><00:00:03.600><c> to</c><00:00:03.689><c> know</c><00:00:03.840><c> what</c><00:00:04.500><c> caused</c><00:00:04.710><c> the</c>

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 align:start position:0%
GCSE and I want to know what caused the
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.570 align:start position:0%
GCSE and I want to know what caused the
Big<00:00:05.009><c> Bang</c>

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
Big Bang
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.970 align:start position:0%
Big Bang
well<00:00:06.450><c> James</c><00:00:06.720><c> you're</c><00:00:07.170><c> studying</c><00:00:07.410><c> there</c><00:00:07.710><c> for</c><00:00:07.919><c> the</c>

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
well James you're studying there for the
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.650 align:start position:0%
well James you're studying there for the
GCSE<00:00:08.639><c> and</c><00:00:08.670><c> you</c><00:00:08.880><c> want</c><00:00:09.059><c> to</c><00:00:09.150><c> know</c><00:00:09.269><c> what</c><00:00:09.420><c> caused</c>

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
GCSE and you want to know what caused
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.100 align:start position:0%
GCSE and you want to know what caused
the<00:00:09.809><c> Big</c><00:00:09.960><c> Bang</c><00:00:10.170><c> or</c><00:00:10.440><c> I</c><00:00:10.710><c> would</c><00:00:11.130><c> like</c><00:00:11.280><c> to</c><00:00:11.400><c> know</c><00:00:11.519><c> who</c>

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 align:start position:0%
the Big Bang or I would like to know who
 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
the Big Bang or I would like to know who
so<00:00:13.110><c> obviously</c><00:00:13.710><c> I</c><00:00:13.830><c> can't</c><00:00:14.130><c> really</c><00:00:14.370><c> tell</c><00:00:14.580><c> you</c><00:00:14.690><c> we</c>

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 align:start position:0%
so obviously I can't really tell you we
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.019 align:start position:0%
so obviously I can't really tell you we
imagine<00:00:16.170><c> that</c><00:00:16.379><c> there</c><00:00:16.590><c> was</c><00:00:16.740><c> some</c><00:00:17.029><c> original</c>

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 align:start position:0%
imagine that there was some original
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849 align:start position:0%
imagine that there was some original
material<00:00:18.480><c> maybe</c><00:00:18.810><c> a</c><00:00:18.900><c> small</c><00:00:19.289><c> volume</c><00:00:19.470><c> of</c>

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
material maybe a small volume of
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
material maybe a small volume of
material<00:00:20.310><c> that</c><00:00:20.630><c> started</c><00:00:21.630><c> to</c><00:00:21.720><c> expand</c><00:00:22.140><c> but</c>

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 align:start position:0%
material that started to expand but
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
material that started to expand but
we're<00:00:23.160><c> guessing</c><00:00:23.430><c> what</c><00:00:23.820><c> made</c><00:00:24.029><c> it</c><00:00:24.060><c> do</c><00:00:24.300><c> that</c><00:00:24.480><c> now</c>

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 align:start position:0%
we're guessing what made it do that now
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
we're guessing what made it do that now
the<00:00:25.710><c> evidence</c><00:00:26.130><c> that</c><00:00:26.310><c> we</c><00:00:26.430><c> have</c><00:00:26.640><c> is</c><00:00:26.849><c> that</c><00:00:27.000><c> the</c>

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 align:start position:0%
the evidence that we have is that the
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
the evidence that we have is that the
universe<00:00:27.390><c> is</c><00:00:27.510><c> expanding</c><00:00:27.750><c> and</c><00:00:28.289><c> we</c><00:00:28.470><c> have</c><00:00:28.680><c> ideas</c>

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 align:start position:0%
universe is expanding and we have ideas
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.089 align:start position:0%
universe is expanding and we have ideas
about<00:00:29.609><c> how</c><00:00:29.880><c> the</c><00:00:30.060><c> forces</c><00:00:30.449><c> of</c><00:00:30.660><c> nature</c><00:00:30.689><c> work</c><00:00:31.140><c> but</c>

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
about how the forces of nature work but
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.530 align:start position:0%
about how the forces of nature work but
so<00:00:32.279><c> far</c><00:00:32.460><c> there's</c><00:00:32.730><c> an</c><00:00:32.820><c> awful</c><00:00:33.030><c> lot</c><00:00:33.059><c> of</c><00:00:33.180><c> guesswork</c>

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
so far there's an awful lot of guesswork
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 align:start position:0%
so far there's an awful lot of guesswork
here<00:00:33.930><c> and</c><00:00:34.200><c> it's</c><00:00:34.440><c> certainly</c><00:00:34.739><c> not</c><00:00:34.800><c> conclusive</c>

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 align:start position:0%
here and it's certainly not conclusive
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 align:start position:0%
here and it's certainly not conclusive
maybe<00:00:36.059><c> you'll</c><00:00:36.270><c> figure</c><00:00:36.420><c> this</c><00:00:36.660><c> one</c><00:00:36.809><c> out</c>

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll figure this one out
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.219 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll figure this one out
yourself<00:00:37.320><c> when</c><00:00:37.500><c> you</c><00:00:37.590><c> come</c><00:00:37.770><c> through</c><00:00:37.920><c> school</c>
