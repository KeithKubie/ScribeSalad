00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.865
- So, here is our given rectangle,

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.813
and we want to draw a
rectangle with the same area,

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:15.840
the same area,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.647
so what is the area of this rectangle?

00:00:19.647 --> 00:00:23.230
Area is the amount of
space a shape covers,

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.327
so how much space,

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:29.797
or how many square units
does this shape cover,

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:32.515
does our rectangle cover?

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:34.130
Each of these is one square unit,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.297
so our rectangle covers
one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.963
six, seven, eight square units.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:48.444
It has an area of eight square units.

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:51.434
So, we want to draw another rectangle

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:53.864
that also covers eight square units.

00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:56.293
If it covers eight square units,

00:00:56.293 --> 00:01:00.098
than it has an area of eight square units,

00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:04.331
but we can't just draw
the identical rectangle,

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.350
because we're also told
that it should have,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.517
our rectangle should have
no side lengths the same,

00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:14.266
so what are the side
lengths of our rectangle?

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.349
Over here on the left,

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:16.932
it's one unit long,

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.592
and going across the
top is eight units long.

00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:24.353
This rectangle had eight square units,

00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:28.541
and they were broken up
into one row of eight,

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:31.885
so we need to think of another
way that we can break up

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:34.192
eight square units.

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.192
One idea would be two rows of four,

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:42.404
'cause two rows of four
would also cover eight,

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:43.904
so let's try that.

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:48.238
Let's create a rectangle here,

00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:49.655
two rows of four,

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.004
and we can just spread
this out a little bit

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.004
so it covers the whole square units,

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:02.401
and so this rectangle also
covers one, two, three, four,

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:09.814
five, six, seven, eight square units,

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.992
so the given rectangle,

00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:15.544
and our rectangle have the same area

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:19.211
because they cover the
same amount of space,

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.682
but they have different side lengths,

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:27.753
because our new rectangle is,

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.424
has a side length of two
over here on the side,

00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:33.344
it's two units long,

00:02:33.344 --> 00:02:36.509
and going across the
top is four units long,

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.406
so it has new side lengths,

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:43.385
so here's one way that
we could draw a rectangle

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:44.260
with the same area,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.510
but different side lengths.
