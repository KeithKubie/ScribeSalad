00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.940
Being in that environment
in such close proximity

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.440
to the virus, there's just
a point at which everything

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:12.512
around you, your clothing,
even your own skin,

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.182
begins to feel a
little bit sinister.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.055
My name is Nichole Sobecki.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.523
I'm a photographer.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.625
And I was recently on assignment
for National Geographic

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.560
in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:29.829
[haunting music]

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.568
Since August, the
Democratic Republic of Congo

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:37.937
has been facing the
worst Ebola epidemic

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.706
in the history of the country.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.175
It's also the second
worst Ebola epidemic

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.110
in the history of the world.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.479
And it's all happening
in an active war zone.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.486
You also have a tremendous
amount of distrust

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.488
from the community
that's being treated.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.590
There were several
Ebola treatment centers

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.093
that were attacked in Butembo,
which is the epicenter

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.561
of the crisis at the time.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.730
Since then, there have
been more attacks.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.267
There have been police officers
killed, health workers killed.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.703
And the reason why people
don't trust health workers

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.240
is for reasons that I
find incredibly rational.

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:16.009
They don't trust the
government because this

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:20.380
is a part of the country that
has been neglected for decades.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.582
And that's leading
to people, you

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.552
know, not wanting to be
tested, avoiding treatment,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.087
not following safe
practices around burials.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:32.859
And it's making it incredibly
difficult to contain the virus.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.295
I think it took actually
being there on the ground

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.631
to really understand the
emotional component of that

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:39.833
as well.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.168
The fear that anything
could infect you is there.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.036
And it's not rational.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.504
And I know that.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.207
It helped me to understand
how these falsehoods could

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.675
lead to really real violence.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.777
[haunting music]

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.948
I want people to care
about what's happening

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.151
and to not see
Ebola as something

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:02.121
that only happens far, far
away in parts of Africa

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.357
and has no impact
on their lives.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.060
These are not rural
villages in the way

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.628
that we've seen in
other outbreaks.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:12.465
Beni and Butembo are cities
of more than a million people.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.067
This is a global
issue that I think

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.535
we should all be invested in.
