SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: My name
is Suezette Yasmin Robotham.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.084
And I am the lead for
GBOP Diversity Channels.

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:10.000
And I'm really excited
to have all of you here

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.390
this morning-- go, team
GBOP-- for a very exciting

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.260
conversation with someone.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.250
It feels like bring my brother
to work day, but a really

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.420
exciting conversation
with David Johns, who

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.060
is the executive
director, the White House

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.329
Initiative for
Educational Excellence

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.245
for African-Americans.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:30.820
I did it.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.992
DAVID JOHNS: Gold star.

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:33.200
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: All right.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.460
And so we're going to start
with a very brief video,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.918
and then get into
our conversation.

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:42.070
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.070
-Ponics is hydroponics,
which is this,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.370
which is physically grown by
the ammonia of the fish, nitrite

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.820
which turns into nitrate.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.640
And that is good for the fishes.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.306
It's good for the
fish and the plants.

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:55.910
And the reason why our water
is green, because of the algae.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.480
So we leave it green like
this till it filters out.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.050
And the good thing
about this system

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.557
is it's a closed system, so
all we have to do is feed it.

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:04.140
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.200
DAVID JOHNS: So a
little bit of context.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.680
This young man is-- when
I met him, at the time,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.110
he was a high school senior at
Booker T. Washington in Miami.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.070
Booker T. is one
of two schools that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.985
are really known mostly for
being located near projects.

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:20.360
This one in
particular is located

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.940
near one that produced
Trick Daddy and Trina,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.520
and then sending a significant
number of black boys

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.220
to the NFL every year.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.720
Brandon had been shot on the way
to school earlier in the school

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.500
year and was in
school on his prom day

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.750
to give me a tour of
his senior thesis, which

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.080
was this aquaponics system
that they developed.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.352
And his hypothesis
was that crops grown,

00:01:43.352 --> 00:01:45.060
and a particular,
certain number of crops

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.220
grown, in this aquaponics
system would yield better

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.420
than the seeds that they planted
on a portion of their football

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.890
field.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.760
And I try and share this
for a couple of reasons.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.200
It's in a larger
presentation which is really

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.800
about the importance of,
one, listening to kids,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.640
two, really honoring that
they all have genius.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.172
Asa Hilliard talks
about, I've never

00:02:07.172 --> 00:02:08.880
met a child, in
particular a black child,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.650
who was not a genius.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.620
And there's no secret
to how you support them.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.917
The first thing you do is to
acknowledge them as human.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.750
And Brandon, in particular,
attends a school

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.030
that most people would,
like, roll up their windows,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.949
lock the doors, and just
drive by as fast as possible.

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.490
But through an
innovative partnership

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.500
with Florida International
University and JP Morgan Chase,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.100
he has access to knowledge that
literally has turned a food

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.060
desert into a food forest.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.730
And he has a sophisticated
understanding of agriculture

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.280
that is literally
transferable around the world.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.470
And so he is an
example of what happens

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.290
when we move past a
lot of the stereotypes

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.820
that otherwise prevent us from
showing up from young people

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.320
and really pouring
into them in ways

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.066
that allow them to demonstrate
just how brave they are.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.940
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: Thank
you for that, David.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.156
And so I want to start by just
talking about the journey.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.030
So something that's
really important in terms

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.450
of being a Googler
and being Googly

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.610
is understanding how people
ended up where they are.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.610
And I know that I've had
the opportunity to hear

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.652
your story several times.

00:03:07.652 --> 00:03:09.860
But you didn't know you were
going to be an educator.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.770
And I don't know if
any point in your life

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.276
you imagined that you'd be
working for the White House

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:16.680
under the Obama administration.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.710
So that is amazing.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.762
But how did you get to
your job and your role?

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:22.470
DAVID JOHNS: Yes.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.890
So three things come to mind.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.900
One, this job didn't
exist five years ago.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.560
It was a position
that was created

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.870
by President Obama and
part of the directive

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.640
of the Congressional
Black Caucus.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.710
But we now exist as
one of six White House

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.320
initiatives that
focus on filling

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.590
population-specific gaps.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.551
So prior to this
administration, there

00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.050
were White House
initiatives focused

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.490
on historically black
colleges and universities, one

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.361
focused on educational
access for Hispanics,

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.610
another focused on education
access for Asian-American

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.310
Pacific Islanders, one focused
on Native American, Alaska

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.080
Native, Native
Hawaiians, and then one

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.496
slightly different focused on
faith-based and neighborhood

00:03:57.496 --> 00:03:58.461
partnerships.

00:03:58.461 --> 00:03:59.960
But if you look at
a lot of the data

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.339
around quality of
life indicators,

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.130
black people are often
at the lowest rungs,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.255
particularly with regard
to education and workforce

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:07.396
development.

00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:08.770
And so that was
really important,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.019
in terms of establishing an
office so that there would

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.730
be someone who was unapologetic
and intentional in trying

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.579
to close both opportunity
gaps and achievement gaps.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.492
Specific to the question of
whether or not I saw myself,

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.950
A, being an educator,
or B, working

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.510
for this administration,
the answer is, hell, no.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.605
I'm from Inglewood, California.

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:29.640
I often joke that I didn't
watch "West Wing" until I was

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.160
well into DC a couple of years.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.260
The idea of working in
policy was not something

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.587
that I thought
about, in particular

00:04:36.587 --> 00:04:38.420
because I went to
Columbia University, where

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.170
people are taught to take over
countries and corporations.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.342
So the idea that I
would become a teacher

00:04:43.342 --> 00:04:44.800
was something that
a lot of people,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.730
including myself,
couldn't comprehend.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.550
And so the way that
that happened, I think,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.050
is in part just
natural connections.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.470
A lot of this is grace.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.760
I took a bus ride
an hour each way

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.340
to and from school from
Inglewood, California

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.340
to Pacific Palisades.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.750
I don't know if you guys
know Southern California,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.474
but each way, to
Brentwood Elementary,

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:05.890
then to Paul Revere
Middle School,

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.270
then to Pacific Palisades
High School, sometimes going

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.580
to schools closer to
Inglewood, but always

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.720
at some point returning
back to those schools that

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.130
were the promise of potential.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.780
And then, at
Columbia, the idea was

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.700
to pursue a JD-PhD,
because I like to argue.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.210
When you're black, and in
college, and you like to argue,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.918
and don't want to go
into medical school,

00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:29.540
they say you should be a lawyer.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.380
And so I thought about
that for a while.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.360
But my freshman year somebody
told me about the fact

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.120
that I could pose
a question and then

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.057
be paid to research the answer.

00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:40.015
And I thought that was
the coldest hustle ever.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:41.473
So I was like, sign
me up for that.

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:42.969
I have lots of questions.

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.510
And so the thought
was to really find

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.510
a space where I could theorize
about things that vexed me

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.470
as a person-- why was
that, at Columbia, I

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.270
was one of 5% of students
who attended public schools,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.920
particularly in California?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.420
Why was I often one of
few African-American males

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.490
in the spaces that I existed.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.280
And then, in particular, when I
ended up teaching kindergarten

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.920
on 110th Street
and Broadway, where

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.970
there were 56 kids
in kindergarten,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.660
there was not a
single black boy.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.840
And we are less than 15
blocks away from the center

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.070
of [? Harlem. ?] {}
And I watch my kids,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.250
not just my kids of color, I
had a couple of girls of color,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.260
but play house, and the idea
that they couldn't fathom

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.356
a little version of me in
their picture was problematic,

00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:28.730
and then listening to them
try to make sense of the world

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.840
around them.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.840
One of my students,
Jake, at some point

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.881
asked me, why is it that
only that girls of color

00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:34.640
stay after school?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.890
And then suggested it was
because their mommies didn't

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.890
love them.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.762
So watching kids make sense
of the world around them,

00:06:41.762 --> 00:06:43.220
and then hearing
things that people

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.980
were saying in popular
culture or in their homes,

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.380
I struggled with that.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.699
This is after sort of accepting
that I'd always worked

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.240
with kids, but
thought that I was not

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.690
going to be anybody's teacher.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.350
Just no, don't want anything to
do with it, but everything made

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.110
sense for me when I found myself
teaching, first kindergarten,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.720
then third grade.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.330
And at the time, people were
having lots of conversations

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.656
about No Child Left Behind.

00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:11.530
And so I was in grad
school at the same time,

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.071
to sort of supplement
the fact that I

00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:15.726
didn't prepare to be
a teacher formally,

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.850
and knew that I needed to
do more than just show up

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.690
and meet my kids
where they were.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.180
And everybody was talking
about the promise of policy.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.590
And so after a pretty
vexing conversation

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.990
in which I made a couple
of classmates cry,

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.160
I said that policy
can't be that hard.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.190
I'll move to DC, and
I'll fix it myself.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.902
So I took a pay
cut from teaching.

00:07:33.902 --> 00:07:36.110
I became a fellow with the
Congressional Black Caucus

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.880
foundation.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.670
I worked for Congressman
Rangel for not quite a year,

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.130
and then joined Senator
Kennedy's HELP Committee staff.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.790
The HELP Committee
sees more than 40%

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.105
of legislation introduced
in any given Congress,

00:07:49.105 --> 00:07:51.480
everything related to health,
education, labor, pensions,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.650
and then a bunch of
other things as well.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.650
And I worked for
him until he passed.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.860
Tom Harkin then
inherited the staff.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.430
And then, over maybe
2 and 1/2 years,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.770
the rise of the
Tea Party sentiment

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.490
made it difficult for us to
have bipartisan conversations

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.870
in the Senate.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.400
And before I was escorted out
of the building, I quit my job.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.890
I drove all the way across
the country to Nevada

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.680
and worked to get the
president reelected.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.860
I was then unemployed,
which I never

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.050
thought I would say with
two Ivy League degrees.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.470
But shortly after
the inauguration,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.280
the second inauguration
for the president,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.552
I was then appointed
to this position.

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.510
And in the long way of
answering your question,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.980
I said when I was
appointed that,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.646
to say I have been preparing for
this position my entire life is

00:08:37.646 --> 00:08:39.330
a gross understatement.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.187
So while, again,
clear that I never

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.645
thought that I
would be an educator

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:45.740
or working in Washington, in
hindsight, all of the pieces

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.570
lined up.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.350
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: So what
is the charge of your office?

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.020
And how are you being
tasked with helping

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.660
to, not only close the
achievement gap, but moreso

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.760
the opportunity gap?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.240
DAVID JOHNS: Yeah,
so my office is

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.034
directed by an
eight-page executive

00:09:01.034 --> 00:09:02.450
order in which the
president makes

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.480
us responsible for
restoring the country

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.720
to its right as a
global leader, in part

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.540
by increasing the [? polls-- ?]

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.620
Right?

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.236
Uh-huh.

00:09:10.236 --> 00:09:11.664
Let that sink in.

00:09:11.664 --> 00:09:13.461
Let that sink in.

00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:13.960
Right?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.900
That's at the first-- that's
at the header, the lead-in.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.480
Before you even get to
the numbers and stuff.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.162
So "global leader, in
part, by increasing

00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:23.620
the number of
African-Americans who

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.569
graduate from post-secondary
institutions."

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:29.110
And then it describes the way
that we're supposed to do that,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.680
including everything from
reducing segregation in schools

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.910
to increasing access to early
childhood education programs,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.385
addressing disproportionality,
increasing access to STEM

00:09:39.385 --> 00:09:40.620
and STEAM.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.410
Everything you have
ever heard somebody

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.170
say in relation
to the challenges

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.590
that black students or the
educators that support them

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.752
face, it is included
in our executive order.

00:09:50.752 --> 00:09:53.210
And again, mind you, we were
established in the second term

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.810
of this administration.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.630
And because I know that
there are only 254 days

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.650
left in this
administration, we chose

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.080
to focus our work in three ways.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.970
One is giving a
platform to those

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.640
who are impacted by
the decisions that

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.830
are made in Washington,
to be able to talk

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.670
about that experience.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.150
So I get really annoyed when
invited-- I was just having

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.500
this conversation with
somebody around TFA--

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.530
when I get invited
into spaces where

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.930
the topic is about
opportunities for kids

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.230
and there is not a
single child in the room.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.880
Adults reflect upon what it was
like when we were in school,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.880
and then we design solutions
based on the things

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.770
that we think we would need.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.840
And it's so problematic.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.720
We then go in to implementing
the solutions that we come up

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.600
with, and seldom ask
young people, what

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.250
do you think about this?

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.490
What matters to you?

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.710
And so we have a partnership.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.730
The things that you guys have on
your chair is something we use,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.990
what we call Af-Am Ed summits.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.580
We host them at post-secondary
campuses around the country.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.930
We did one most
recently at UC Davis.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.966
I've done one at Laney
College, U Penn, Morehouse,

00:10:55.966 --> 00:10:57.590
a number of schools
across the country.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.610
But the only rule
for the summits

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.990
is that the only experts who
get to sit on the dais in front

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.830
of the White House, there
are students, elementary age,

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.240
high school, college, and
nontraditional and traditional.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.970
And the one question we ask
them, no matter where we are,

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.150
is, what do you need so that
you are and feel safe, engaged,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.342
and supported?

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.050
Who wants to guess
the answer that always

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:23.090
comes up no matter where we are
or the age of the young person?

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.856
Nobody wants to guess?

00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:26.730
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: It
could be participation.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.792
Anybody want to guess?

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:29.500
AUDIENCE: Ask the
question again, please.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.875
DAVID JOHNS: What's
the-- what do

00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.720
you need so that you
are and feel safe,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.400
engaged, and supported?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.310
AUDIENCE: Food.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.180
DAVID JOHNS: Food.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:36.700
What else?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.599
AUDIENCE: Safety.

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:38.765
MALE SPEAKER: Good teachers.

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:39.390
AUDIENCE: Love.

00:11:39.724 --> 00:11:40.890
DAVID JOHNS: So she said it.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.306
It seldom comes
up, but it's love.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.420
Often, the things that
typically are our answer,

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.110
like money, we need
financial support,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.450
we need access to
curriculum, they

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.160
get to that at a certain point.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.210
But at the core what they
say is that we want love.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:04.110
And not something that is
nebulous, but the love that

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.370
comes from a secure
attachment to an adult

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.090
that you know will be there for
you when you mess up, when you

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.770
make mistakes, when things
don't go the way that they're

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.879
supposed to go.

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:16.420
And so that's really
important to us,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.792
is providing platforms
for young people

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:21.000
to really talk about their
truth and to be celebrated

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.850
for their experience.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.300
The second thing we do is really
highlight promising practices.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.890
So we try and take
away the excuse

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.380
that we don't know
what's working.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.940
And then also try and cut
through a lot of the BS

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.970
that people believe about what
black kids are not capable of.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.346
So an example of
this is the idea

00:12:38.346 --> 00:12:40.803
that people believe that there
are more black men in prison

00:12:40.803 --> 00:12:42.810
than in college, which
is factually inaccurate.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.650
We question whether or not that
statistic has ever been real.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.680
But I taught with people who
believe that, and then they

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.830
use that as a way to let
themselves off the hook

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.427
when they met a student
that they didn't understand.

00:12:53.427 --> 00:12:55.260
He's going to end up
dead or in jail anyway,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.330
so I don't need to do the work.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.280
And the reality is
that right now there

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.159
are more than 800,000 black
men on college campuses

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:03.200
than there are in prison.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.830
We're still disproportionately
represented in prison.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.170
But in spite of the
challenges, we still

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.580
show up and try-- not only
try, but show out in spaces

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.720
that we're not
often supported in.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.040
And so we leverage
things like Twitter.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.340
We host bi-monthly Twitter
chats on Thursdays,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.090
12:00 to 1:00 Eastern
Standard Time, where

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.464
we pick a topic
and invite people

00:13:23.464 --> 00:13:26.300
to talk about it, in part,
because African-Americans

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.450
oversubscribe on social
media, including Twitter.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.014
So we like to slide into the
DMs and disrupt whatever they're

00:13:32.014 --> 00:13:36.500
doing, and otherwise find ways
to make critical connections

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.230
between, again, things that
might not be accessible

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.420
because they're coded in
jargon, whether that's

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:48.240
the tech speak like all these,
the Google acronyms, or policy

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.235
speak that the wonks
in DC understand.

00:13:51.235 --> 00:13:52.610
And the third
thing is supporting

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.160
organizations and
individuals who do that work.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.300
So I am here, in part,
because on Monday, I

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.400
gave a keynote at the Oakland
Unified School District

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.870
African-American Male
Achievement program.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.650
And that was the first
program that any senior leader

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.310
from the administration visited
after President Obama launched

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.510
the My Brother's
Keeper initiative.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.640
On Friday, tomorrow,
I guess, I will

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.980
be at Chabot College for
the Striving Black Brothers

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.620
commencement program.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.470
Again, two organizations
that do the work that

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.450
makes all of what's theorized
in my executive order very real.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.200
And because there
is so little time

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.000
left in this
administration, every day I

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.635
watch the video of
the young girl who

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.010
is told that the president is
leaving at a certain point,

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.650
and she just wilds out.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.970
That's how I feel.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.910
Because that clock is
ever-present in my mind,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.390
so much of our
work is connecting

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.280
with those who have done the
work before this administration

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.249
and will be charged with
continuing it after.

00:14:45.249 --> 00:14:47.790
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: So I want to
go back to something that you

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.970
said in terms of social media.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.250
And we are, of course,
Google, and so technology

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.590
is a very important part of
moving the work and the ball

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.940
forward for our children.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.834
And people can't see your shirt.

00:14:59.834 --> 00:15:01.000
But it says #TeachTheBabies.

00:15:03.884 --> 00:15:05.300
And that's probably
how I met you.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.690
People keep asking
us how we met.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.820
And I can't really give
them a good story yet.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.530
But I know that a
lot of influence

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.860
comes from social media in
terms of building understanding

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.770
and awareness.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.290
Social media was also the
birthplace for the Black Lives

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:19.980
Matter movement.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.190
And so how are you
leveraging social media

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.990
to build more awareness
and advocacy for the work

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.810
that you're doing?

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.560
DAVID JOHNS: Yeah.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.310
Social media has been a
really important tool for us,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.670
in part, because we
don't have the resources

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.160
that, for example,
the president has.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.320
And so we expended
quite a bit of energy

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.000
early on when the
initiative was established,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.930
essentially
establishing profiles

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.970
in spaces where we knew we
could engage with, and otherwise

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.920
give information to, what
we call our stakeholders.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.720
And I tell my team
that when we think

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.127
of who we do our work for, it's
really for people like my mom.

00:15:53.127 --> 00:15:54.793
I'm a first-generation
college graduate.

00:15:54.793 --> 00:15:58.480
So I always think of your friend
who graduated from college,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.630
but their mom who may have
just finished high school.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.290
Our content has
to be appropriate

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.699
for them to be able to
understand it and digest it

00:16:05.699 --> 00:16:07.240
in ways that don't
make them confused

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.365
or otherwise feel like they
don't know enough to be

00:16:09.365 --> 00:16:11.460
able to engage in this space.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.350
And so social media,
in particular Instagram

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.820
and Twitter, allow us to
provide content in ways

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.160
that extremely
easily digestible.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.620
So an example is, we have a
partnership with the Because

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.910
of Them, We Can campaign.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.200
There's another video.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.000
I carry this notebook.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.451
I carry a backpack.

00:16:30.451 --> 00:16:32.200
One of my favorite
things to do in schools

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.930
is to ask teachers to name
the people on this notepad

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.430
or on the backpack.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.307
And surprisingly, most
often, adults can't.

00:16:40.307 --> 00:16:41.140
It's like 10 people.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.556
And that's the
people we sometimes

00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:43.814
celebrate in February.

00:16:43.814 --> 00:16:46.230
And if you think about the
fact that teachers can't do it,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.170
we shouldn't be surprised when
students, then, can't do it,

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.310
right?

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.320
And so in February,
for example, we

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.830
posted an image of, again,
these heroes and sheroes that we

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.450
celebrate sometimes
from our future,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.430
but sometimes from
present as well,

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.308
and then created
easily-digestible activities

00:17:03.308 --> 00:17:04.599
for parents and families to do.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.510
Tell a story.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.260
Create a poem.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.420
Sing a song.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.130
Just find ways to make
meaningful connections.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.904
I have a lot of fun on
Twitter, I think, less now,

00:17:14.904 --> 00:17:17.460
maybe because I'm becoming old.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.170
But one of my
favorite things to do

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.256
was to be disruptive
during TGIT,

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:22.839
when everybody was
watching "Scandal."

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.172
I don't watch "Scandal" anymore.

00:17:24.172 --> 00:17:26.195
But I used to be
really into "Scandal."

00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:27.569
But I would get
a lot of traction

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.902
by saying things like, I know
you broke all kind of laws

00:17:29.902 --> 00:17:32.350
to get home, to get your
wine, to be a gladiator,

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.680
but did you read to
your kids tonight?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.430
So just finding ways
to interrupt spaces

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.510
where sometimes these
conversations don't happen.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.680
And then we think about working
with "Glee," for example,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.160
on a story arc that
included an acknowledgment

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.550
of homeless children.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.910
So there's the Elementary
Secondary Education Act

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.240
that was just recently
reauthorized in TESAA,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.230
The Every Students Achieve Act.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.440
Title X of the previous bill
was McKinney-Vento, policies

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.760
governing just laws
and regulations

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.040
around kids who are homeless.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.360
There was a student who, for a
second on "Glee," was homeless,

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.860
and they mentioned the
McKinney-Vento Act.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.810
It was a way for us to
talk about something

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.267
that is seldom discussed
outside of Washington DC.

00:18:14.267 --> 00:18:16.850
I'm sure most y'all have never
heard of McKinney-Vento or even

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.308
thought about the fact that
there are laws governing things

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:20.620
related to homeless students.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.440
But again, that's an
opportunity of ways

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.820
that we make connections
to try and change things.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.780
One more I'll offer-- a
colleague, Knatokie Ford,

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.480
who works on Office of
Science and Technology policy

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.740
has a social media and media
project that is essentially

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.380
around leveraging popular
culture and media to highlight

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.270
opportunities for minorities,
in particular African-Americans

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.190
and STEM.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.310
So when you think about-- how
many of you guys watch "CIS"?

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.230
No?

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.300
I watch "CIS."

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.720
And a lot of ratchet TV, too.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.440
But you know, there's
data around the increase

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.740
in the number of students
who declare majors related

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.810
to forensic sciences and things
that are connected to "CIS."

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.660
And so the idea is that
if we can take that, draw

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.040
clear connections and
compel other people to make

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.750
meaningful connections,
we can otherwise

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.231
accelerate opportunities.

00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:09.480
If you look at "Black-ish,"
there's been a similar arc

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.320
where Yara's character has had
a lot of work in projects around

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.020
physics.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.050
That's an intentional
connection to get

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.400
us to think about things
that otherwise exist

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.920
as amorphous because
sometimes, if black folks are

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.720
credentialed, them being a
STEM engineer isn't celebrated

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.896
in the same way.

00:19:26.896 --> 00:19:28.270
So we just try
and be disruptive.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.370
And social media is
a tool that helps us.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.411
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: So
let's talk about synergies,

00:19:32.411 --> 00:19:37.675
because I think a lot of what
I keep hearing in your replies

00:19:37.675 --> 00:19:40.631
is, like, the synergies
between technology,

00:19:40.631 --> 00:19:42.380
and the synergies
between our communities,

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.500
and synergies between even
things like social media.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.460
What synergies are we missing
between the education world

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.420
and technology world
that would make this

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.730
a different place for our kids?

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.870
DAVID JOHNS: Good question.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.855
I think three things.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.674
One, we miss opportunities
to make things plain.

00:20:01.674 --> 00:20:03.590
I often say that,
everything you need to know,

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.129
you learned in kindergarten.

00:20:05.129 --> 00:20:07.170
And there's a certain
point when we become adults

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.910
where I think the goal is
to make things complicated.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.530
An example of that
is that adults

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.580
argue about STEM versus
STEAM, science, technology,

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.850
engineering, mathematics
versus science, technology,

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.460
engineering, the arts and
agriculture, or mathematics.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.550
And what I say is, I've
never been in a classroom

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.210
where students have
ever said stop!

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.960
Is this the T or the A?

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.330
Where in the acronym do--
they just want to be engaged.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.620
They don't really care
about the jargon or the ways

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.970
that we talk about
things or create silos

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.770
in spaces where
they don't exist.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.000
And so I think the first thing
is that Google, Googlers,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.920
the all y'all, and whatever
acronyms you belong to, should

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.030
think about ways to
make things simple,

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.020
and things that are often
rendered invisible made plain.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.090
So for example, a
lot of young kids

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.800
are told that they
aren't science-minded,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.540
that they can't be an
engineer, in part because it

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.780
was difficult for the
adults around them.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.330
Think about how many times
you've heard somebody say,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.210
math was hard for me, so it's
going to be impossible for you.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.280
Or, I never got that, so you're
not going to get it either.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.742
Or the reality that some
of y'all have experienced,

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.950
something about the women
in this room in particular,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.137
that the spaces you occupy,
you're often alone or isolated.

00:21:22.137 --> 00:21:23.970
And you just don't want
anybody else to have

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.656
to endure that struggle.

00:21:26.656 --> 00:21:28.780
And so we end up killing
the dreams of young people

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.330
before they ever start to think
about the possibilities that

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.860
exist for them in
spaces like this.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.490
The second thing is
related to the jargon.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.810
We don't often develop the
vocabularies of young people

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.830
so that they can talk
about the stuff that

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.780
happens in these spaces using
the terms that actually exist.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.360
We talk a lot at the initiative
about the importance of using

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.550
actual terms that describe
everyday phenomena so that kids

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.450
can develop vocabulary
before, again,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.660
they're told that they can't.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.850
So that's everything
from the way

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.240
that you observe science
in the natural world

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.920
to the connections
that you guys would

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.781
make because of the things
that you've studied.

00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:10.280
And then I think the third thing
is just sort of showing up.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.030
I've spent a lot of time
now with young people who

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.670
say they want to be engineers.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.420
And then, I ask them,
what does that mean?

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.180
And then they don't know.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.349
It's almost like STEM is the
new green jobs where everybody's

00:22:22.349 --> 00:22:23.890
talking about it,
but very few people

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.410
know exactly what it means.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.690
So the question for you
from me is, how do you

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.837
make your job visible to young
people who are observing you,

00:22:32.837 --> 00:22:34.920
in particular, young people
who are observing you,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.050
and you're not even aware of it?

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.367
How do you show up,
whether you're an engineer

00:22:39.367 --> 00:22:40.950
and you support
engineering functions,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.670
or whatever it is that you
do, in ways that just make

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.140
it accessible for young people?

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.510
Does that answer your question?

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.430
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: That was
perfect. [INAUDIBLE] Of course.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:56.320
So I hear a lot of myth
busting in your job role,

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.750
like, you're constantly
going out, finding the myth,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.880
and then disproving it.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.990
What's the biggest
myth about our kids?

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.830
And what do we
need to be thinking

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.285
about in terms of turning
that around for them?

00:23:08.285 --> 00:23:10.410
DAVID JOHNS: I'm going to
invert that because I try

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.620
not to do the deficit thing.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.290
So I don't want to
reaffirm our deficits.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.010
The thing that
keeps me up at night

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.289
is the reality that in
too many communities

00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:22.580
throughout our country, a
child's access to opportunity

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.530
is predicated by a code, a
genetic code or ZIP code.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.609
And I know, in part, because
I meet kids every day

00:23:29.609 --> 00:23:31.525
that show up in the way
that I just described,

00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:33.410
that Asa Hilliard talks about.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.800
Every child is a genius.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.840
I've never met a child who
asked to be [? birthed. ?]

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.440
And the ones who are most
sensitive to the fact

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.120
that the environments that
they're forced to endure

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.990
aren't conducive
to their well-being

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.490
are the ones who deserve our
love and support the most.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.910
And so what am I saying?

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.290
One, we often neglect
and ignore the kids

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.030
who are most deserving of
our time and attention.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.130
And I'm not just saying
sort of formal educators,

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.510
but I mean the way in
which we also show up

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.780
as mentors, our sources of
support for young people

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.830
that inhabit the
spaces we move through.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:13.280
Two, we miss the fact that young
kids right now face challenges,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.310
sometimes on the way
to or from school,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.010
that would break
the average adult.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.390
There was a moment
when Mike Brown died,

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.010
and we went with the last
Secretary of Education,

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:24.710
Arne Duncan, to Ferguson.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.412
And there were adults who, for
the first time, were thinking,

00:24:27.412 --> 00:24:28.620
oh, this is really traumatic.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.960
These kids are experiencing
death for the first time.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.960
And the kid's like, this
the third friend I done

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.950
lost this school year.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.110
And there was a-- if I remember
correctly-- Mike Brown was

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.480
killed maybe on a Thursday.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.850
The kids were out of school
almost for an entire week.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.470
And they were told during this
break not to talk about it.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.070
And the reality was that
that's all they were doing.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.490
They were group chatting and
snapping and Facebooking.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.110
And they came to
school ready to have

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.735
the conversation in
real time that they

00:24:58.735 --> 00:25:00.440
had been having virtually.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.529
And the adults
who kid themselves

00:25:02.529 --> 00:25:04.820
into thinking that they
weren't going to talk about it,

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.790
or just be at home doing
whatever I think people

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.630
think the kids do
now, just crazy.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.470
And so I think we missed
that, the literal challenges

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.760
that kids face trying to show
up and do the things that we

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.100
demand of them.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.570
And then the third thing is
we miss unique opportunities

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.265
to address specific challenges.

00:25:25.265 --> 00:25:27.140
So the president launched
My Brother's Keeper

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.306
as an initiative to highlight
the fact that we often

00:25:29.306 --> 00:25:32.130
are numb to the challenges
that boys and men of color,

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.090
in particular, face.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.080
The initiative received
a lot of criticism,

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.347
in part from black
feminist groups that

00:25:38.347 --> 00:25:40.680
suggested that the theory
that we're going to fix things

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.140
by focusing on
black men and boys

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.056
was false, that if we're
going to do anything,

00:25:44.056 --> 00:25:46.490
we need to focus on
black women and girls.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.170
And the problem with
this is that both

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.205
are true at the same time.

00:25:51.205 --> 00:25:53.080
There's a data point
now that a lot of people

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.790
are familiar with.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.623
And it's that for every
one white male who's

00:25:55.623 --> 00:25:57.940
suspended or expelled
in K-12, it's

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.602
three times that rate
for black men and boys.

00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:02.060
The thing that most
people miss now

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.590
is that that rate
is six times as

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.430
high for black women and girls.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.130
And in major metropolitan spaces
like Atlanta, Georgia, Oakland,

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.870
California, black
women and girls

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.960
are being pushed out of
schools and their homes,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.550
and being pulled into
things like sex trafficking.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.720
The highest rates
exist in Atlanta.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.070
And that nuance is missed if
you look at the top lines.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.740
The top lines are,
nationally, in the aggregate,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.030
women are doing well.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.570
And they are.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.020
Black women in particular
continue to outstrip black men

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.690
proportionately.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.200
However, for high-performing
black women and girls,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.660
as well as for those who
are academically challenged,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.270
they face a lot of
social challenges

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.030
that are missed unless we
talk about the nuances.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.160
Similarly, there are
unique challenges

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.316
that boys and men of color face.

00:26:46.316 --> 00:26:48.190
I think about what it
was like to be followed

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.930
by a cop leaving
the airport, then

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.640
driving past Fruitvale Station.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.360
There are just things that come
with our lived experience that

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.424
sometimes go missed
and unnoticed.

00:26:57.424 --> 00:26:58.840
The last thing
I'll say about this

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.000
is that sometimes we don't even
think about the trauma that's

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.690
inflicted upon children.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.440
We debate sometimes
in social media

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.690
whether or not
black lives matter.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.890
And there are students
who hear that question,

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.470
and then go into spaces where
people affirm for them whether

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.790
or not it does or doesn't.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.390
Their humanity,
whether or not it

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.420
matters, whether or not
it's of consequence.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:25.459
And when we don't think about
the social and emotional health

00:27:25.459 --> 00:27:27.000
and well-being of
our kids, sometimes

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.170
it becomes too much about
their cognitive growth

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.000
and how well they're doing on
computer science assessments,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.600
or if they're ready
for the AP, when

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.360
we miss the social and
emotional piece, the importance

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.840
of mental health, we do
everyone a huge disservice.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.800
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: So then
what are five concrete things,

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.480
and I'll give you a range.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.740
Give me three to five concrete
things that each of us

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.500
can do to be asset-based
and asset-focused in terms

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.459
of supporting, not only
our schools, because we

00:27:58.459 --> 00:27:59.916
know the unit of
change is actually

00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:02.025
in the school building,
in school communities.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.430
DAVID JOHNS: Interesting.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.340
I'm going to back into this by
highlighting policy areas that

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.790
have been most important
in terms of our work,

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.680
and then try and make
some direct connections

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.350
to the group.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:18.330
So the areas where we
focused our attention--

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.877
and when I say
our, I'm referring

00:28:19.877 --> 00:28:21.460
not only to the
initiative that I run,

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.584
but our work in support of
our President's Advisory

00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:25.930
Commission, of some
27 folks, including

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.320
Freeman Hrabowski, who
is president of UMBC,

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.340
runs the Meyerhoff
Scholars Program,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.830
gets a whole of minority
folks into MD-PhD programs.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.350
They focus their
efforts in three areas.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.820
One is increasing access to
high-quality early learning

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.314
programs.

00:28:40.314 --> 00:28:41.730
So the thing that's
important here

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.060
is that learning
starts at birth.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.500
But the preparation for learning
starts well before birth.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.990
And we spend a
whole lot of time,

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.990
in particular in the
African-American community,

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.530
talking about school
beginning in kindergarten,

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.300
or playing catch-up thereafter.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.120
And the data shows that
African-American students are

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.210
most likely to be
enrolled somewhere,

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.270
whether that's childcare,
Head Start, Early Head Start,

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.430
or some other pre-K program.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.200
But the quality is
always questionable.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.900
The very opposite is true
for our Latino brothers

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.410
and sisters.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.600
And I'm acknowledging
that some of us

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.600
exist in the intersections,
and are Afro-Latino,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.000
and other derivations thereof.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.480
But for the Hispanic
community more

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.469
generally, the tendency
is for the babies

00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:24.510
to be in what we call, FF
and N-- family, friend,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.480
and neighbor care.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.230
But when they are
enrolled in the program,

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.980
it's of high quality.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.510
So we have to do
the work of both,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.160
increasing the number of
black babies and families

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.660
that are in high-quality
early learning programs,

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.320
but then improving the quality
of those at the same time.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.070
So if you all know somebody that
has a child who is under five,

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.350
ask them, are they enrolled
in a high-quality early care

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.050
and education program?

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.410
And if not, there are resources.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.368
There are childcare
resource referral agencies.

00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:50.540
There's Thrive by Five.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.956
There are all kind of things,
in particular in California,

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:55.430
that you can refer them to
to help connect that dot.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.870
The second area that we
focused on increasing access

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.930
to meaningful
pre-K-12 curriculum,

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.071
including by focusing
on STEM and STEAM.

00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:07.320
So what does this mean for us?

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.145
One, access to computer science
as a basic prerequisite.

00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:14.520
We know that there are seven
states in this country where

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.670
you can not take a computer
science course at all.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.110
And then access is also
disproportionate in spaces

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.774
where one can take a
computer science course.

00:30:25.774 --> 00:30:28.190
And so, in addition to talking
about access to curriculum,

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.600
we're working at a
federal level to increase

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.710
the support for
public institutions,

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.660
or institutions that
leverage public resources,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.550
to provide meaningful
experiential opportunities

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.697
for kids to learn STEM skills.

00:30:42.697 --> 00:30:44.280
So sometimes that
looks like, you guys

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.500
might know Upward Bound
programs, or things

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.190
that traditionally cost
a whole lot of money

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.320
and are reserved for
really privileged people.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.470
So that's the second area.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.300
The third area is increasing
college graduation

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.984
or completion.

00:30:56.984 --> 00:30:58.900
And when we say college,
we mean, specifically

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.780
two- and four-year institutions,
credential, certificate,

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.630
or degrees of value.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.440
And we focus
specifically-- bless you--

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.030
on reducing the
need for and time

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.610
spent in developmental
or remedial ed.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.450
So some, more than 60%
of African-Americans

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.940
who begin a
post-secondary program,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.400
don't finish because
they get stuck

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.060
in developmental education or
non-credit-bearing coursework.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.430
So we work with
institutions or systems

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.100
like the University of Texas
to try and change that.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.780
So those are three
policy, programmatic areas

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.539
that I think are worthy of
additional consideration.

00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:32.080
But there are two
things that I think

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.580
everybody can do, no matter
how you show up in this.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.620
One is to support the
learning and development

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.850
of a young person.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.670
So I'll often say
the first thing

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.180
to think about is teaching.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.097
We often don't think about that.

00:31:46.097 --> 00:31:47.680
But teaching-- people
say silly things

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.030
like, teaching isn't
rocket science.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:49.613
They're right.

00:31:49.613 --> 00:31:51.230
It's a lot harder.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:55.550
I have a NASA scientist
who confirms with that.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.551
And so if you can't
teach, you can mentor.

00:31:57.551 --> 00:31:58.800
And you can do that in groups.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.400
You can do it with other
people so that you find ways

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.090
to hold yourself accountable.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.870
But showing up in the
lives of young people

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.015
is critically important.

00:32:07.015 --> 00:32:08.390
And then the second
thing related

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.260
to that is just to listen
to young people, really

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.093
give them opportunities
to talk about what's

00:32:12.093 --> 00:32:14.150
going on in their world
and then to enroll you

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.300
in the process of
supporting them.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.330
How often have you brought
a young person just

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.760
to this campus to imagine
what life could be like

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.676
if they continue to do
the things that they're

00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:24.090
asked to do?

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.234
We sometimes go back
to-- I went to Columbia.

00:32:26.234 --> 00:32:27.650
So we don't really
tailgate there.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.030
But I know some of y'all go to
schools where they tailgate.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:30.220
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: Go Gators.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.810
DAVID JOHNS: You turn
up for the party.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.351
But do you take
young people with you

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.230
to, again, say,
imagine what life

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.920
could be like for
you if you, again,

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.400
do the things that sometimes
can be difficult to do

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.370
because life gets in the way.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.001
I think that's five.

00:32:43.001 --> 00:32:46.000
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: I
mean, you hit the mark.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.610
I'm not disappointed.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.615
So let's go back to David the
man and David the journey.

00:32:51.615 --> 00:32:52.990
So everybody who
knows me knows I

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.290
will toot your horn for you if
you won't toot your own horn.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:01.160
You were recently named a young
alum of valor and distinction

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.530
for Columbia University.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.490
We know that the administration
is coming to an end

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.140
pretty soon.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.830
What are you thinking
about in terms

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:14.360
of just your continued
trajectory within this space?

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.887
And where might David be in
the next five to 10 years?

00:33:17.887 --> 00:33:18.970
DAVID JOHNS: I don't know.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:23.280
But I know that for three
months after January 20, 2017,

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.980
David will be somewhere on
a beach where there's no--

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.830
--no cell phone reception,
no Twitter, no Instagram,

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.369
no nothing.

00:33:30.369 --> 00:33:32.160
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: You
realize that doesn't

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:32.570
work for me, though.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.820
DAVID JOHNS: I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.950
That is-- people
laughing, I'm so serious.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.670
For two reasons,
one again, this job

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.050
didn't exist when
I was an undergrad.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.790
And I had to move
through the process

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.790
of-- I was a kid
who had a plan A,

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.009
and then the back-up
plan just to make sure

00:33:54.009 --> 00:33:56.300
that plan A happened, and
then another one just in case

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.480
that one didn't go through.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.620
I long let go of that and
really abide by the importance

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.010
of walking by faith.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:09.624
So much of my, what
I'm now celebrated for,

00:34:09.624 --> 00:34:11.790
which is still weird-- even
when people read my bio,

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.460
I'm like, oh, that's
kind of crazy.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.159
So much of what I've
done is simply show up

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:23.300
and find ways to leverage
my privilege and purpose

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.400
to do better for others.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.320
And so I don't
really know what I

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.620
will do in terms of employment.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.909
I will likely be unemployed.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:31.839
I'm OK with that.

00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:32.755
Got a good accountant.

00:34:35.879 --> 00:34:37.920
But it's really important
for me to take a break.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.310
I took this job knowing that I
could run as fast as possible

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.580
for a defined number of days.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.790
There are 253 left.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.610
And then, at that point,
take a break, in part,

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.790
because this work
is all-consuming.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.692
To do the work of
advocating on behalf

00:34:53.692 --> 00:34:55.650
of children who are often
neglected and ignored

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.150
is crazy-making.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.100
I often have to travel
and engage with and visit

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.100
with young people to be reminded
that the work is important.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.340
Because when you
sit with adults who

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.610
don't understand that
somebody invested in them

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.190
and that other kids
need the same support,

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.840
it can sometimes
drain you in ways

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.750
that, if you're
not thoughtful of,

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.180
can make it difficult,
if possible at all,

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.416
to do the work.

00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:22.770
So I'm not trying to
be funny or flippant,

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.015
but I'm taking a
break, a real break.

00:35:25.015 --> 00:35:26.640
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM:
I need you to have--

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.210
DAVID JOHNS: You'll
be all right with it.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:27.620
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM:
--cell phone reception.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:27.910
DAVID JOHNS: Nope.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.997
[?

00:35:27.997 --> 00:35:29.660
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: Doesn't
?] [? work for me. ?]

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.160
So awesome.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.910
And how do we find
you on social media?

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.172
DAVID JOHNS: I am
@MrDavidJohns on everything,

00:35:34.172 --> 00:35:35.880
and then use the
hashtag #TeachTheBabies.

00:35:38.524 --> 00:35:39.190
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.181
Hello, everyone.

00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:42.680
I'm Greg Hammons, and I'm with
the Accounting and Compliance

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.495
team.

00:35:43.495 --> 00:35:44.870
Thanks so much
for coming, David.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.703
I just have a question
about, like you said,

00:35:46.703 --> 00:35:51.510
you're going to go and take a
break, the well-deserved trip.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.860
And so I just wonder, as far
as the initiative, what's

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.671
happening?

00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:55.670
Is it going to continue?

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.720
Who's taking your place?

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.835
Or what can we expect?

00:35:57.835 --> 00:35:58.960
DAVID JOHNS: Good question.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.810
So the precedent is
that the initiatives

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.410
continue regardless of the
political party in power.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.610
So the HBCU initiative,
the eldest of them

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.610
was established under
Carter, and it's continued

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.550
via executive order since then.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.410
And the expectation is that
this one will continue as well.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.170
I spent, probably, 90%
of my time on the road,

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.114
in part, supporting stakeholders
that, should anybody

00:36:21.114 --> 00:36:23.530
ever attempt to even try and
change something significant,

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.640
there'll be lots of pushback,
not only from the Black Caucus,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.494
but from the community as well.

00:36:28.494 --> 00:36:30.410
And there is a deputy
director, a young woman,

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.480
she's a PhD Student at the
University of Virginia, who's

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.720
on staff now who is being
groomed to take over

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.657
when I get to take a break.

00:36:38.657 --> 00:36:40.240
AUDIENCE: You know,
so there are a lot

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.614
of African-American
students that

00:36:41.614 --> 00:36:45.560
are in these predominantly,
majority school districts.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.110
What sort of work is being
done for that population?

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.050
Because I do feel
like that population

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.375
tends to be forgotten,
where we're definitely

00:36:52.375 --> 00:36:54.500
focusing in areas that are
obviously very critical.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.480
But what are we doing to support
those students, particularly

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.080
in a place like California,
where there's a lot of suicides

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.930
that are happening
in districts that

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:05.400
are very close to this
location here in Sunnyvale?

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.240
Just curious to
see if you've been

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.090
focused on this issue
at all in your work.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:09.960
DAVID JOHNS: Yes.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.580
So really important,
three things.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.010
One, I talk a lot about
the HBCU initiative,

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.780
in part, because our executive
order includes language

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.010
that essentially mandates that
we supplement, not supplant,

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:22.194
their efforts.

00:37:22.194 --> 00:37:23.860
And so this is a
really important nuance

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.960
because often when people
think about black students

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.100
in post-secondary spaces, they
think about historically black

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.350
college and universities.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:32.280
And they provide an
essential service

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.980
to our country and community.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:38.610
But 90% of black kids in
college are at white schools.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.920
And so we exist,
in part, because we

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.940
need to focus on
all of the places

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.470
where black students are
learning, and/or people are

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.930
entrusted with their
learning and development,

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:51.470
and highlighting
that as one of them.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:55.240
The second thing, I
think-- I guess is two.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.720
One is focusing on
curriculum expansion.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.981
So another thing that comes
up at a lot of our summits

00:37:59.981 --> 00:38:02.230
is the need for everybody,
not just students of color,

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:05.640
but for everybody to be more
aware of the contributions

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.830
that African descendants
have made to American history

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:09.942
or to global history.

00:38:09.942 --> 00:38:11.900
And so we're working now
with the College Board

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.740
to create an AP exam in
African-American history

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.542
because we know, that
which is tested is taught.

00:38:17.542 --> 00:38:19.000
And that will be
a way for us to be

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.580
more thoughtful and
expansive in how

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.100
it is that we educate
everybody and celebrate

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.500
the fact that, when things
are diverse, we all win.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.675
This is also directly
related to the fact

00:38:27.675 --> 00:38:29.050
that there are a
couple of states

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.550
in the South in particular
that are now forcing educators

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.580
to teach things like Confederate
history, which would make

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.871
a lot of the challenges that
we're working through now,

00:38:36.871 --> 00:38:39.530
related to the Black Lives
Matter stuff, more complicated.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.856
Specific to the question
of mental health,

00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:43.230
we have a number
of partnerships,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.563
including with Kappa Alpha
Psi Fraternity, Incorporated,

00:38:45.563 --> 00:38:47.837
the greatest fraternity
known to man.

00:38:47.837 --> 00:38:48.878
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: Right.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.830
DAVID JOHNS: Listen, Linda.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.280
--to focus on mental health.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.460
So what we know is that
the number of suicide

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.500
rates for black boys, in
particular, school-aged,

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.407
has doubled in
the last 20 years.

00:39:05.407 --> 00:39:07.740
And so while we spend a lot
of time focused on-- right--

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.690
we spend a lot of time focused
on state-sanctioned violence,

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.450
we're missing the
fact that we're

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.470
not, again, addressing
the mental health

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.854
needs of our children.

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.270
And so we partnered
with, not only

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:21.190
with Kappa Alpha Psi, but
Susan Taylor's CARES mentoring,

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.510
to talk about the role
of toxic stress, trauma,

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.686
and prolonged
exposure to poverty,

00:39:26.686 --> 00:39:28.060
and really drawing
the connection

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.370
between those physiological
things that sometimes

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.600
are discussed in health
spaces, and their implications

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.470
in education more formally.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.130
So a lot of it for us right
now is, not only gap filling,

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.170
but then highlighting
where we need

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.320
to be focusing more attention.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.750
And that is obviously
one of them.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:43.800
AUDIENCE: So my question
is-- you actually just

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.600
touched on it.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.325
I was wondering about
the ramifications

00:39:47.325 --> 00:39:48.200
you've seen thus far.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.850
I mean, it's only been one term.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:51.924
But as you were talking
about mental health,

00:39:51.924 --> 00:39:54.090
just wondering about the
work that your office might

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.320
be doing with the US Public
Health Service, just in

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.770
regards to things like
access and education.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.290
Because we've seen
that, in this country,

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:04.970
your health outcomes
are most directly

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.344
influenced by your
income, but we

00:40:06.344 --> 00:40:08.820
see that that doesn't apply
to minority communities.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.210
So you have instances of where
white high school dropout

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.130
females have better
birth outcomes

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.040
than college-educated
black women,

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.020
when, in fact, it
should be the opposite.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.420
What kind of work,
or is there any work

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.180
being done between your
office and that initiative

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.850
and the US Public Health
Services in regards

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.664
to tackling economic--

00:40:28.664 --> 00:40:30.070
MALE SPEAKER: That's fine.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:32.350
AUDIENCE: --racial and
ethnic health disparities

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.890
that are being
directly influenced

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:39.060
by economics, poverty,
continued exposure

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.640
to-- like you're
saying-- stress,

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.970
having to, as we
always say, work

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.220
twice as hard to get half
as much, all of those

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.580
things that have real
physical consequences.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.600
Are you seeing any
major strides being

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.920
made in terms of looking
at the physical health

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.290
of our communities as a
direct outcome of the work

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.860
that you all are doing?

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.150
DAVID JOHNS: Yes.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.350
And I try and take
my ego out of it.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:03.520
I don't know how much of
it is a direct relation,

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.121
or is correlated to things
that we've done specifically.

00:41:06.121 --> 00:41:08.620
But I think a lot of it just
has to do with federal movement

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.940
around health care.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.080
So remember first term of
this administration, everybody

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.960
expended energy to get the
Affordable Care Act passed,

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.030
in part, because we use a lot
of that money that was saved

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.900
from taking back the
loan service provision

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.340
that banks did so that the
federal government can do it

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.210
from direct lending.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:28.543
I know some of y'all were
impacted by this thing and got

00:41:28.543 --> 00:41:30.640
a little bit more money
in your bank accounts.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.390
But this was, in part,
because we were also

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.680
able to highlight the role that
schools and institutions could

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.400
play in addressing the health
challenges of communities,

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.174
in particular, that don't access
traditional forms of care.

00:41:42.174 --> 00:41:44.090
So there are three things
that come up for us.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:48.390
One is highlighting the
role that navigators play

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:51.300
and connecting communities that
traditionally are leery of,

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.990
or untrusting of,
health care providers

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.430
so that they can access care, in
particular, preventative care.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.670
Two, we spent a lot
of time highlighting

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.564
the benefits of the
Affordable Care Act

00:42:01.564 --> 00:42:03.980
and the need for families, in
particular, our communities,

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.699
to take advantage of
them, one, the benefits

00:42:06.699 --> 00:42:08.490
that were afforded to
women, in particular,

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.620
around prenatal care and health.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.290
And then, two, the benefits
that were afforded to children

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.920
who might not have previously
been able to get coverage

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.629
because they have
a condition that

00:42:18.629 --> 00:42:20.920
would have made them excluded
under the previous health

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.622
care laws.

00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:23.080
The third thing,
and this goes back

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.252
to the question you just
asked, the two things

00:42:25.252 --> 00:42:26.710
that we spend a
lot of time talking

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.480
about with our stakeholders,
with our communities,

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:34.820
are one, the need for us to move
beyond celebrating resilience.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.990
So this is a personal
thing for me.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.640
And the First Lady
does a wonderful job

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.780
of highlighting the work
required for young people,

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.800
in particular in
communities like mine

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.130
in Inglewood, California,
to show up and be

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.411
successful in spite of.

00:42:50.411 --> 00:42:52.660
But the question I'm now
asking, and this just came up

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.030
when we were AAER, the American
Association of Education

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.626
Research is, at what cost?

00:42:57.626 --> 00:42:59.250
So to go back to
"Scandal" and the line

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.375
that you just mentioned,
second season of "Scandal"

00:43:01.375 --> 00:43:04.060
opened with Liv being at an
airport hangar with Papa Pope.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.101
And he said to her, what's
the one thing I always

00:43:06.101 --> 00:43:07.070
taught you growing up?

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.210
And she couldn't even look
him in the eye and said,

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.159
I have to work twice as hard
just to get half as far.

00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:14.200
And it was like the thing
heard around the world.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.574
What person of
color hasn't heard

00:43:15.574 --> 00:43:17.912
that in some way, shape, or
form, if not multiple times

00:43:17.912 --> 00:43:18.745
over their lifetime.

00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:22.510
And the question for me
is, but at what cost,

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:25.520
mentally, physically,
emotionally, psychologically?

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.900
What is the toll of you
always showing up in spite of,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.560
and what does it
do to young people?

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.460
And so we're now working with
a couple of institutions,

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.100
including the Urban Institute,
to develop a research agenda

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.019
so that we actually have data
to move past the anecdotal.

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:43.560
But if nothing else, I highlight
the fact that it's happening

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.390
and that we need
to be mindful of it

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.230
with regard to
supporting our kids.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.260
This came up at the
AAMA celebration

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.670
of [INAUDIBLE] gospel.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.390
A lot of what they
did was say to kids,

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.931
you all just need to keep going
to school and doing whatever.

00:43:54.931 --> 00:43:57.160
Y'alls need to keep going
and reading these books.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.100
And that's true.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.420
But adults also have
a responsibility

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.570
to change the institution
so that they're welcoming,

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.450
that they're
supportive, but also

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.770
to address things that often
go unacknowledged, which

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.869
is, again, the
implications of having

00:44:11.869 --> 00:44:13.660
to do the kind of work
that happens when we

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.290
don't make these connections.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.494
AUDIENCE: Teachers of color and
school leaders of color, what--

00:44:18.494 --> 00:44:20.660
how your work kind of touches
that, or what you guys

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.510
are looking to, so how to
support those teachers.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.025
DAVID JOHNS: So
that comes up often.

00:44:27.025 --> 00:44:28.400
The thing that we
talk most about

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.920
is the need to address
diversity within the workforce.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.780
Less than 2% of the
teaching workforce

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.297
looks like me, and especially
at the earliest levels.

00:44:37.297 --> 00:44:39.630
The fact that I was a black
man teaching in kindergarten

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.297
was just crazy, in part, because
there's a lot of work that

00:44:43.297 --> 00:44:44.380
needs to be done socially.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.450
People still think that
the work is feminized

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.210
and that men who
are interested in it

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.960
are either pedophiles or
just socially awkward, which

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.980
I try and refute every day.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.882
So that's one.

00:44:56.882 --> 00:44:58.340
But then the second
thing is really

00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.910
to highlight the
importance of it.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.730
So Freeman Hrabowski
talks about the fact

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:03.330
that educators do God's work.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:05.100
But we live in a
society that does not

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.406
value that in the same way.

00:45:06.406 --> 00:45:07.780
And then when
people try and find

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.210
creative approaches
to doing that,

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.230
think about the districts that
have been paying educators

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.271
more than six figures and
all these other things,

00:45:13.271 --> 00:45:15.210
people get criticized for it.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.405
And so what we try to do
is address that by, one,

00:45:18.405 --> 00:45:20.780
highlighting the role that
African-American educators who

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.900
are already in the field play--

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.733
[NOTIFICATION SOUND]

00:45:22.733 --> 00:45:24.100
Hey.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.120
--already in the field
play, that the importance

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.830
of doing this work, two,
talking to young kids.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.580
I say to them,
educators do God's work.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.570
You need to think
about teaching.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.660
I did this talk at
Howard, where I was like,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.550
my goal is to get y'all
to think about-- right.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:37.925
Also did it at
Morehouse as well.

00:45:37.925 --> 00:45:38.716
AUDIENCE: Spellman.

00:45:38.716 --> 00:45:39.520
DAVID JOHNS: OK.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.110
I didn't do it at Spellman--

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:40.480
AUDIENCE: You did.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.410
DAVID JOHNS: --but it was
right across the campus.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:42.243
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.864
But again, going to
these spaces and talking

00:45:50.864 --> 00:45:52.530
about the importance
of doing this work,

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:54.530
and, again, acknowledging that
teaching isn't for everybody.

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.036
But we should all consider the
ways in which we can show up.

00:45:57.036 --> 00:45:58.910
And then, practically
thinking about the ways

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.284
that the federal government
can be helpful or supportive.

00:46:01.284 --> 00:46:03.517
So there was just a week
ago, actually maybe it

00:46:03.517 --> 00:46:04.100
was this-- no.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.516
Last Monday, there
was a convening

00:46:05.516 --> 00:46:07.350
around diversity
in the workforce

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.250
where we leveraged data
around recruitment, retention,

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.544
and advancement of
a diverse workforce.

00:46:12.544 --> 00:46:14.460
And I mean diverse in
every sense of the word,

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.280
not just black.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.950
I'm talking about able-bodied,
not able-bodied, LGBTQ,

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.029
every form of
diversity, in part,

00:46:21.029 --> 00:46:22.820
because the thing that
I always think about

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.892
is we have this
screening and discussion

00:46:24.892 --> 00:46:26.600
series, a partnership
with Motion Picture

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.241
Association of
America and ASPIRE,

00:46:28.241 --> 00:46:29.990
again, show up in
places where people are.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.810
We show films that are only
positive in relation to how

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:34.929
we can support our
kids, things like

00:46:34.929 --> 00:46:36.720
"The Inevitable Defeat
of Mister and Pete,"

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.219
a wonderful film
that you all should

00:46:38.219 --> 00:46:40.517
see about the resilience
of black children

00:46:40.517 --> 00:46:42.600
and what it means for us
to think that they're not

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.016
capable of succeeding in school
when they succeed in life,

00:46:45.016 --> 00:46:46.490
sometimes by themselves.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:48.162
The film that we're
showing in two weeks

00:46:48.162 --> 00:46:49.120
is "3 and 1/2 Minutes."

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.661
It's the film about
Jordan Davis, who

00:46:50.661 --> 00:46:52.780
was murdered in a gas station.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.000
And Lucia McBath, his mom,
and I had this discussion

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.450
on an Essence panel where
she sat next to my mom

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.960
and said that she knew when
the police called and told

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.470
her what transpired that it
had happened in that way,

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:06.109
that somebody said to her
son, you can't do something.

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:07.400
And he said, to hell with that.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.950
I'm going to do it anyway.

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.680
Because she raised him
to advocate for himself.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.260
But the thing that I will go
to my grave fearing and knowing

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.830
is that if Michael Dunn, the
man who shot Jordan Davis,

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:20.920
had a black male teacher
at some point in his life,

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.920
who he saw conspire for
his success, who he felt

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.250
loved him in ways
that were authentic,

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.690
that altercation would
have happened differently.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:32.330
And so sometimes the
conversation around diversity

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.560
becomes very one-dimensional.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.560
And it's often like, black
kids need to see black people.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.740
That's important, too.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.940
We all need to see versions
of ourselves reflected

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:42.990
in the world around us.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:45.910
But the more important
thing is to see

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:51.320
people who don't look like us,
who conspire for our success.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.950
That's why the work
is really important.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.760
So we try and highlight
that now, and then

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.900
work with organizations
that are doing that work.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:02.737
AUDIENCE: My question is, what
can we do, like right now?

00:48:02.737 --> 00:48:05.070
DAVID JOHNS: I have some
projects you all can invest in.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:05.570
No.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:06.310
Let me stop.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.150
I'm serious.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.110
Let's talk about that offline.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.640
What can you do now?

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:17.057
One, find two young people to
carry with you along the way.

00:48:17.057 --> 00:48:19.640
And one should be-- so that the
natural, like the young person

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.765
that you probably now just
conjured up in your mind

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:26.090
because they do backflips down
the library stacks on Saturday.

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:29.420
But the other one should
be one that challenges you,

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.447
one that you want to shake,
in part, because it'll

00:48:34.447 --> 00:48:36.780
be that one which will keep
you honest in doing the work

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.510
required to show up
for a young person.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.970
And when you make
the commitment,

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:46.700
make it knowing that you have
to be honest, in particular

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.501
around the failures that have
allowed you to be successful.

00:48:49.501 --> 00:48:51.000
There's something
else that happens,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.160
I think for adults, where
we become successful,

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.740
and whatever the
hell that means,

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.170
and then we don't talk about
the challenging moments.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.590
And so when it happens
for young people,

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.256
they think that they're
the only one who

00:49:00.256 --> 00:49:01.710
ever has to deal with it.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.510
This is, in part, why
in June of this year

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.200
we're hosting, for
the first time ever,

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.140
a White House Summit on
black LGBTQ students.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.060
Y'all aren't alone.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.650
Y'all been showing up and
showing up for decades.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.550
And we need to be
mindful of what's

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.090
required to create
environments in which you can,

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:21.540
not only exist, but thrive,
the very opposite of addressing

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:25.600
the challenges that go when we
don't talk about toxic stress

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.815
or health implications.

00:49:26.815 --> 00:49:29.510
So find two young people
to carry with you.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:35.600
The second, find ways to make
very transparent and real

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.900
the world that you exist
in for those around you.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.764
So this space is hallowed
ground for most folks.

00:49:41.764 --> 00:49:44.180
People think Google, they think
y'all got like helicopters

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:48.095
flying around and
robots delivering stuff.

00:49:48.095 --> 00:49:50.850
People don't know
what's going on here.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.240
And so the question is,
how do you share the magic,

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.490
the thing that keeps you
here for all of the hour that

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:59.480
y'all are here, all
this food y'all consume?

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.950
How do you share
that with people

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:03.560
in ways that will help them
make meaningful connections?

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.450
Practical example.

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:06.480
We were in Atlanta
at a STEM high school

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.880
and asked an auditorium
of kids, how many of you

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.090
know a STEM professional?

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:11.880
Two kids raised their hands.

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.580
Two.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.070
At a STEM high school.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.850
We then said, how many of you
know somebody that does hair?

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.400
20 of them raised their hand.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.320
How many of you
know somebody that

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.140
owns a business where
they clean something,

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.770
industrial or otherwise?

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:27.320
The lesson for me
there was that we

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.550
had to make real the things that
are often rendered invisible

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.720
when we talk about
credentials and jargon

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.220
in ways that obfuscate the
fact that people show up.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.270
They make innovation.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:38.120
They do things.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.360
So how do you take the
world that you exist in

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.070
and sometimes take
for granted-- how

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:46.120
do you share your privilege is
the simple way of putting it.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.620
Because all of us
have, for the fact

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.470
that we're sitting here right
now having this conversation,

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:50.580
is an indication of that.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.725
So how do you share
that with someone.

00:50:53.725 --> 00:50:55.100
And in particular,
when you think

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:59.459
about the workforce implications
of this, the work that-- DBOP?

00:50:59.459 --> 00:51:00.250
What's y'alls name?

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:00.692
SUEZETTE ROBOTHAM: GBOP.

00:51:00.692 --> 00:51:01.442
DAVID JOHNS: GBOP.

00:51:03.242 --> 00:51:04.950
I'll be getting it by
the end of the day.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:07.630
When you think about
the work that GBOP does,

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.000
how do you unlock the
hidden curriculum?

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.270
Even the fact-- we were
just laughing about this.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:17.236
Suezette said, don't walk
up in here in a suit.

00:51:17.236 --> 00:51:18.860
That's meaningful in
a space like this,

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.380
because y'all might have
thought that I was crazy.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.330
It would have been a fly suit.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.450
But I'm saying, it doesn't
work in this space.

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:25.800
So how did you unlock
the hidden curriculum

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.920
in ways that make the
connection meaningful?

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.310
And then, I think
the third thing

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:37.770
is to be intentional about
finding ways for each of you

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.270
to have uncomfortable
conversation.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:42.100
So I appreciate that
this room is diverse.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:46.445
I don't appreciate, sometimes,
that we have-- it's just

00:51:46.445 --> 00:51:48.820
black folks that want to show
up and talk about black kid

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:49.500
issues.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.500
One thing that I struggled
with taking this job,

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.125
do I want to be the
black man appointed

00:51:53.125 --> 00:51:55.830
by the black president working
on things just for black kids?

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:57.760
And the implications
are larger, in part,

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.950
because we live in a
really diverse society.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.990
And so I'm asking each of you
to not leave all of this here.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.100
We could have had an entirely
separate but related talk

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:12.080
just about intersections of
race and racism and power

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.650
and privilege.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:18.290
A lot of-- to your question
about pathways, why I'm here

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.290
is because I was at a very
privileged institution that

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:25.060
was struggling with a lack of
civility as a result of people

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.740
being really ignorant
and privileged.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:30.174
My senior year at Columbia, my
classmates showed their asses.

00:52:30.174 --> 00:52:32.090
There was an anti-affirmative
action bake sale

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.965
that started at UC
Berkeley and then migrated

00:52:33.965 --> 00:52:35.630
its way to the East Coast.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.130
There was a marching band that
aimed to be offensive and put

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:39.371
up flyers.

00:52:39.371 --> 00:52:41.870
One had Michael Jackson as a
black boy then as a white woman

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.470
and it said, who
needs ethnic studies,

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.720
when there had been a hunger
strike that was on campus

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.420
for the 30 days prior to that.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:52.607
The "Federalist" paper published
a cartoon called "Blacky Fun

00:52:52.607 --> 00:52:54.190
Whitey" starring
Kunta [? Kornelios ?]

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:56.720
and Stepin that said
black people were invented

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.930
in the 1700s as a
cheap form of labor,

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.440
parodied all of
our contributions

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.580
through sports and
entertainment, and that said,

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.560
don't worry, black people do
lots of other wacky things.

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.150
But you don't have to worry
about that until next Black

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.770
History Month.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.640
This was in 2004 at
Columbia University

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:16.100
in the middle of New York,
where, again, the consequences

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:20.340
of us refusing to do the
uncomfortable work of talking

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:24.640
about race and racism and
privilege and ignorance

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.720
continues to show up.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.876
And it often shows up in
really devastating ways

00:53:28.876 --> 00:53:31.250
in the lives of young people
who don't have the privilege

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.110
to take themselves out
of certain spaces are

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.610
to be protected because they've
lived in a certain community

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.740
or can't associate with
a certain community.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:43.900
So I'm asking you
to do that work,

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.470
to really talk about the things
that can often go unstated

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:51.092
when you just focus
in on the technology,

00:53:51.092 --> 00:53:53.300
and to really think about
how it is that you leverage

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.383
the privilege that exists,
not only in each of you

00:53:55.383 --> 00:53:57.560
individually, but
in this institution,

00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.650
to make some of these
meaningful connections

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:02.610
for the children who
you should be preparing

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:05.780
