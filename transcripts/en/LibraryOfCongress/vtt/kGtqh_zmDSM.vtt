&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.910
&gt;&gt; Jessica Flynn: Kaitlyn
Greenidge's complex

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.700
and gripping debut novel, "We
Love You, Charlie Freeman,"

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.180
follows the story of an African
American family, the Freemans,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.690
as they uproot their lives and
move to a research facility

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.900
in a largely white
part of the Berkshires.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.080
The Freemans are fluent in sign
language, and they've been hired

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.830
to live with a chimpanzee named
Charlie to raise him as a member

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.680
of their family and to
teach him sign language.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.380
As the family saga at the institute
unfolds, so does the 1929 story

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.410
of a schoolteacher whose
encounters with a white doctor

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.160
from the institute, painfully
illuminate both the past

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.560
and the present.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.740 position:56%
Released earlier this year to much
acclaim, Publishers Weekly described

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.420
"We Love You, Charlie Freeman," as
ambitious and deftly constructed,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.850
encompassing weighty issues such
as race, language, sexuality,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.840
and the intersections
of religion and science,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.230
and calling it a sobering look at
how we communicate with one another

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.560
and what inevitably gets
lost in translation.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.060
Greenidge was born in Boston,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.350
and received her MFA
from Hunter College.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.670
She's started writing the
novel during her first semester

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.470
of graduate school, during
which time she also worked

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.410
as a historical researcher
at a Black history museum.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.940
Her writing has appeared in The
Believer, American Short Fiction,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.650
The Feminist Wire, Afro-Pot
Magazine, The New York Times,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.650
and many other publications.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.000
And she has received fellowships

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.320
from the Lower Manhattan Community
Council's Workspace Program,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.820
and the Bread Loaf
Writers Conference.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.150
She is also a recent recipient
of a literature fellowship

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.170
from the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.000
This is a highly competitive
fellowship based solely

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.180 position:56%
on artistic excellence and selected
through an anonymous review process.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.250
If you're interested in learning
more about these fellowships,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.590
you can stop by our
table over there.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.510
Please join me in welcoming
Kaitlyn Greenidge.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:12.720
[ Applause ]

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.520
&gt;&gt; Kaitlyn Greenidge: Hi,
so I'm Kaitlyn Greenidge.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.260
Thank you so much for coming today.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.980 position:56%
So I thought that I would first talk
a little bit about how the book came

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.930
to be, because that's usually
people's first question

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.580
when I tell them what
this book is about.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.600
So I thought I'd talk a little bit
about that, and then I might read

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.990
from the first opening pages for
a little bit, and then open it

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.460
up to questions from you guys.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.690 position:56%
And we can kind of have a, hopefully
a group conversation in the room.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.010
So, "We Love You, Charlie Freeman,"
as was very beautifully introduced,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.000
is about a Black family from
Boston that moves to a nearly,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.950
all white town in the
Berkshires in the early 1990s.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.550
And they moved there to
take part in an experiment

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.100
where they're teaching sign
language to a chimpanzee.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.030
So, that idea came
to me kind of as a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.430
like thunderbolt or
a lightning bolt.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.360 position:56%
I was at a bar in Brooklyn that used

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.330
to have a lecture series
called "Adult Education."

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.130
And they would do like quirky
lecture subjects every Saturday.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.650
And you would go and you would have
a drink and listen to these kind

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.540
of strange, interesting pieces
about history and the past.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.190
And one time I went and then theme

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.540
for the night was "Animals
and Deviance."

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.990
And a woman gave a lecture about
this family named the Kelloggs.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.060
Was a married pair of
anthropologists in the 1920s,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.570 position:56%
and they decided to do an experiment

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.040
where they raised their
son alongside a chimpanzee.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.140
They wrote a book about it called,
"The Ape and the Child," that came

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.420
out towards the tail
end of the 1920s.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.100
And you can still find this book.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.590 position:56%
I actually, as soon as I heard about
this, I went to Amazon and I tried

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.850
to find it and I got a copy of it.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.150
The reason why you
can still find it is

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.320
because their studies
was really kind

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.950
of like universally
panned by everybody.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.600
Everybody was kind of like,
"That is a crazy idea.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.540
Why would you ever do
that to your child?"

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.840
kind of thing.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.410
And if you look through
the book, it's fascinating.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.530
They literally took their toddler
and then this young chimpanzee

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.850
and put them side by side
and took photographs of them.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.870
And they do things like they shoot
off a revolver behind their heads

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.600
and see who reacted fastest, the
first, and take a photograph of it.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.200
It just, all these really
interesting and wonderful images

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.600
and really frightening
images are within this book.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.080
And so, when the Kelloggs
published the book in the 1920s,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.080
most of the anthropology
community was horrified,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.380
and so they quickly kind

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.110
of distanced themselves
from this subject.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.400
And they gave the chimpanzee
actually back

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.500
to the research facility
where they got her from.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.320
And then their son, when he
grew up many years later,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.620
he actually committed suicide.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.360
That was kind of like the
very sad coda to the story.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.090
So, I'm sitting in the audience and
I'm about to go into grad school

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.520
for creative writing,
and I'm thinking, "Wow,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.430
that's a really fascinating story.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.790
That could probably be a really
great short story, and let me try

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.980
and make this into what
it could possibly be."

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.540
And at the same time, when
I was thinking about that,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.270
about that story and kind of all
that stuff was just kind of going

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.710
through my brain, as was
said in the introduction,

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.190
I was working as a researcher for
a Black history museum in Brooklyn,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.690
called the Weeksville
Heritage Center.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.740
If you've never been, you
should definitely check it out.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.040
It's in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.410
It's been around since 1968.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.970
Really fascinating museum.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.340
Wonderful resource.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.300
It's dedicated to the history of
the first free Black community

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.070
in Brooklyn that was
founded in 1827.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.280
And it's been a continual
Black neighborhood

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.590
in that area too, till today.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.910
So anyways, I was working
as a researcher there,

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.390
and I had been working probably at
that point for the past ten years

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.170
as a researcher, or some sort
of historical interpreter,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.780
for Black history sites either
in New York City or in Boston.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.550
And while I was doing that
work, a lot of the time,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.960
of what I was doing, was
kind of talking directly

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.490
to people about Black history.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.820 position:56%
And for a little while, when I was
in Boston, I worked as a park ranger

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.620
for the Black Heritage Trail,
which meant that I was kind

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.920
of dressed like Smoky the Bear.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.200
Like I had a park ranger
uniform on, the park ranger hat,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.360
and I would stand in front of
the memorial to the 54th regiment

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.370
which was the first
all-Black regiment to fight

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.910
for the United States army.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.210
They made the movie
Glory about them.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.410
So I'd stand in front of this
memorial which is directly

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.150
across the street from the Boston
State House, for four to five hours

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.390
at a time, in the summertime,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.500
talking to tourists just
walking by, about Black history.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.930
And as you can imagine, those
conversations ranged and varied

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.450
and were really interesting and
sometimes really hard to have.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.530 position:56%
So you would have people -- our tour
started where the Freedom Trail,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.460
which covers Boston's
Revolutionary War history ended.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.270 position:56%
So a lot of times, you'd have people
saying, "Where's the Freedom Trail?"

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.480
And you would say, "It's
not the Freedom Trail.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.780
It's the Black History Trail.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.080
You want to come on it?"

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.380
And then people would
kind of run away.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.430
Or you would say like,
"Are you interested

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.730
in kind of talking about this?"

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.910
And people would want to argue
with you about the causes

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.950
of the Civil War or they'd want to
talk about the merits of slavery

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.890
or who started slavery first.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.880
A lot of times, people wanted
to talk about really just --

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.180
really only certain
moments of Black history.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.000
So, that particular site
that I worked at was talking

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.720 position:56%
about Boston's Black
Abolitionists Movement which started

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.220
like basically at the same
time as the Revolutionary War.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.160
But people would really only kind
of want to talk about this --

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.630
the Civil War for like these
four years of Black history.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.870
If they didn't want to talk about
that then they wanted to talk

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.170
about the Civil Rights Movement.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:57.680
So another kind of very brief
moment in Black history.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.510
And you would -- I would say
to people like, "Oh this is --

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.970
but this other thing happened

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.050
and this person did
this really heroic act

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.950
and this really interesting
thing happened," or whatever.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.870
And people would say, "Yes,
but let's get back to slavery.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.900
Can you tell us again
about slavery?"

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.960
So, as I was in there and I'm kind
of standing there and if you work

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.240
with Black history, these are
kind of arguments that we kind

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.160
of always kind of come up
again, again and again,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.720
when we talk about Black history.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.120
It feels actually really fortuitous
that I'm here the same weekend

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.330
that the museum --
the National Museum

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.060
for African American History is
opening, which is so exciting

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:35.400 position:56%
because all of a sudden, all of this
wonderful information is available

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.510
to us on a much bigger stage

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.240
and in a completely different
way than it has been before.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.280
So it feels, for me, I mean I
think everybody's really excited

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.090
about that museum opening,
but for me,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.750
it just feels like it's a turning
point I think in how we're going

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.110
to be able to process and think
about those things going forward.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:01.430 position:56%
So all of those things were circling
around my mind and I go and I sit

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.540
down and I try and figure out
what are all those things mean

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.890
and what do I actually want
to say about all those things?

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.510
And what are the conversations
that I wish

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.990
that we could have
about all those things?

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.470
And what are the conversations
that I wish

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.950
that we could have
about all those things?

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.610
And what are the questions
that I wish that we could ask

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.680
about all those things that
sometimes we either avoid asking

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.730
or we don't feel like
asking of ourselves?

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.940
And so that's kind of the
impetuous of the book,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.770
where the book came from.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.630
I really wanted to write and talk

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.750
about a Black experience
in the northeast.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.910
So the book takes place
in Boston and in the --

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.570
in western Massachusetts
in the Berkshires region.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.190
A lot of times, when people
talk about Black history

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.680
and Black identity, it's
really centered in the south,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.480
and we know a little bit more
about southern Black experiences,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.500
but of course, Black
identity isn't a monolith.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.110
Black American identity
differs from region to region.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.390
There's rich history
in all of the regions.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.590
And so I got really interested
about that and especially

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:02.660
when I was doing more research and
I came across these photo studies

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:08.680
of -- well, photographs first that
I saw of integrated classrooms

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.080
in the Berkshires in the 1890s.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.520
And Du Bois who of course
was a famous Black scholar,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.950
he actually grew up in Western
Massachusetts in the Berkshires

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.550
and I thought, "Wow,
that's really fascinating.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.370
That has to somehow address that
or talk about that in the book.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.070
And then also finding out that
Du Bois himself did these really

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.150
interesting photographic studies

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.500
of Black people throughout
the United States,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.710
in the 1890s and early 1900s.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.400
And he made a big album
of them and presented it

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.050
at the Paris Exhibition
in the 1900s.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.560
So it feels like there's all these
kind of themes and things that come

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.000
up again and again, kind of
undercurrents, in history,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.810
that I kept getting more and
more interested of talking about

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.430
and thinking about and trying
to work into a narrative.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.780
If you can't tell by now, my
training is to be a researcher.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.290
I'm not really a natural
storyteller.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:06.940
I love finding interesting and
wonderful facts that are hidden

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.630
in archives and other places,
and bringing them up and trying

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.810
to get people to talk about them.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.290
So, getting all of those
interesting bits of information

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.160
into an actual narrative,
was really difficult

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.460
and took a really long time.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.490 position:56%
So I started this book in fall 2008,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.910
and it was published
in March of this year.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.860
So it took a really long
time to figure out how

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.920
to dramatize those things and
make them into a book that --

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.300
in a story that feels natural

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.430
and that you will kind
of want to follow along.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.150
And I think like probably everybody
who's at this book festival,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.310 position:56%
I love novels and I love books, but
for a long time of those eight years

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.720
and before that as well, it felt
like a huge kind of leap to be able

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.630
to get to the point of putting
all those things that I love

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.290
and that I'm interested in, into
an actual novel that's going

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.290
to be readable by somebody else
besides my family, you know?

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.550
So, a lot of that time was
spent doing a lot of research

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.460
on additional parts of the book
that really kind of interested me.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.450
As soon as I knew that I
wanted the family to be fluent

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:16.160
in sign language, I started to
research a lot about that aspect

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.990
and way of communication,
the history of sign language.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.620
I should stop here to say that
I always talk about this book

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.100
as if the idea came from
like a really outside source,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.530
and part of it did, but while I
was doing the research in this book

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.260
and starting to write
about this book,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.100
I remember that there
is this family story.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.100
So my mother knows sign language.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.810
She's been fascinated with that
language from a really young age.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.480
And she, for a little while,
when they lived in this area,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.280
she actually went to
Gallaudet College

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.820
for a little while in the 1970s.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.130
And when she and my father were
living in New York in the 1970s,

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.090
she was taking sign language
classes at Hunter College

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.690
and she actually got asked
to -- if she would --

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.330
to apply for a job at a research
institute in West Chester

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.800
where they did have
chimpanzees and they asked her

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.300
if she would be interested in kind

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.930
of working really closely
with that chimpanzee.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.490
And when they found out that
she had a daughter, a toddler,

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.430
they got super excited and
wanted her to work with it.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.100
And the story in my family
was always that it was kind

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.400
of like a throw away story.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.930
My mom is a really fascinating
person and has millions of stories

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.030
like that where she'll just
kind of drop it in conversation.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.660
And we'll be like, "What
are you talking about?

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.960
[Inaudible]."

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.920
But the story with that is that
she thought about it and was kind

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.270
of horrified with this idea of
bonding with another animal,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.610
and then having to give them
up at the end of the study.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.820
And especially of her child doing
that and having to give it up.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.890
So she said, "Absolutely not,
no, I would never do this."

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.240
And the joke in our family was
always that my dad was really upset

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.610
about it because we would
have gotten a free car

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.930
and a free house in West Chester.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.730
And he's like, "We've could
have saved a lot of money

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.770
for the year," so we
lived in New York.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.930
So, I knew a little bit
about sign language.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.080
My mom used sign language
around the house.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.660
When I went to work with
her, when she was --

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.430 position:56%
she worked for many years at Perkins
School for the Blind in Boston,

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:12.620
and while she was there, she worked
with a program with autistic adults

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.460
and adults without much
access to language.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.730
So she actually used sign language
a lot there and I would to work

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.180
with her and I would
see her use it a lot.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.120
And so I knew a little
bit about the language.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.240
I don't actually know how to use
it myself, but she still does.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.720
But as I was doing
more research about it,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.710
I found out that there was a
dialect of American sign language,

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.230
African American sign language,

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.610
that history of that language
was really fascinating.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.980
And that that the signs
are different

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.020
and that the reason why
they're different is actually

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.910
because you know, if you
know anything about history

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.590 position:56%
of deaf Americans or deaf liberation
movements in this country,

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.940
for a long time sign language was
not allowed in many deaf schools

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.810
because people thought that
it was encouraging deaf people

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.580
to stay amongst themselves.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.400
And so there's this whole
really interesting history

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.260
around the identity around that.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.590
All that is to say that
many schools for the deaf

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.620
for Black children
never had that ban.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.120
So a whole other kind of version
of the language spread up --

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.340 position:56%
spread and grew and that whole
history was really interesting to me

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.830
and something that I tried to bring
out and to talk about in the book.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:29.180
Because for me, the book is really
a lot about the limits of language,

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.790
the limits of language
that we have even

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.710 position:56%
when we have the best intentions for
the words that we're trying to use.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:41.260 position:56%
And how much people use language,
both to explain really uncomfortable

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.980
and really hurtful situations,
and also to try and mask

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.650
or minimize those situations.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:54.100
And I was at a class in Amherst on
Wednesday, I was talking to a class

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.270
at Amherst and [inaudible],
one of the students said, "Oh,

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.010
this book has a lot
of silences in it.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.520
There's a lot of moments where the
characters either don't say things

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.390
to each other that they should say,
or they're just not able to finish

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.120
or get back to a conversation."

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.090
And that's kind of how I
experienced language a lot

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.680
when I was writing this book

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.000
and even before I started
writing this book.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.700
You know, somebody who reads and
loves books and loves writing,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.250
there's still always felt like
there was some sort of limitation,

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.340
that sometimes it seemed like the
books that I was so interested

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.780
in engaging with, only went so far

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.750
and that there were still
other questions to keep going

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.540
and that I wanted answered.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.960
And for a long time, I think and
when I was probably a teenager,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.900
I was really mournful
about that and I got kind

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.520
of like, "Well what can books do?

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.630
Kind of where we got stuck here,
where can they kind of go?"

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.970
And now as an adult and after
reading a little bit more

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.130
and talking to writers
more, I realize that a lot

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.070
of times writers themselves

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.200
when they write books are
aware of those limitations.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.580
And that's actually kind of the
thing that keeps writing alive

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.360
and keeps writing going is that
you read a book and you realize

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.840
that it opens you up
hopefully to 10, or 11, or 12,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.810
or hundreds of more questions.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.720
And that your reading can
actually lead you kind

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.230
of further and further.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.220
And that sense of kind
of never completion,

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.340
kind of language always -- just
getting there but like not enough,

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.270 position:56%
actually became a real strength for
me when I was thinking about writing

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.020
and thinking about books.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.700
And so now I get really
excited when I --

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.210
and when I read a book
and I close it

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.960
and there's more questions
than I have answers.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.940
I always think of that James
Baldwin quote, which I'm going

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.720
to totally butcher because
I did not write it down

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.050
but I think it's something like,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.060
"Art is there to ask questions,
not answer them for us."

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.030
So, that became really interesting
and really important to me

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.960
for this project, for this
book as I was writing it was

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.190
that hopefully this book is a
conversation with the reader.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.860
And hopefully this is
something where you read it

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.430
and you can have additional
questions

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.640
or ask people additional questions.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.310
There's -- I don't know if anyone
of you have seen Junot Diaz speak,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:02.010 position:56%
but he often tells a story when he
does his speeches where he's talking

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:09.900 position:56%
about if he's teaching a complicated
text, when he used to teach

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.440
at a commuter college and he
was teaching a complicated text

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.880
and he would ask the class,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.840
"Does anybody understand
this -- what we just read?"

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.050
Everybody would feel comfortable
raising their hand and saying,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.350
"No, I didn't understand."

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.650
And they would have
a class discussion.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.950
That would be class.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.500
And then he said that when he
got to starting to teach at MIT,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.170
they would -- he would bring a
complicated text and he would say,

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.500
"Does anybody understand
what we just read?"

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.800
and everybody would say "Yes."

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.420
And then he'd say, "Okay,
can anybody explain it?"

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.750
And the room would go silent.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.470
And the conversation was
over because nobody wanted

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.470
to admit what they didn't know

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.920
or where the limits of
their knowledge were.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.890
And he talks also a lot
about kind of the importance

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.510
of books having that ambiguity.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.730
How for him when he was a kid
and he was reading a book,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.600
when he came across a word that
he didn't know, he would assume

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.360
that the writer had put that word
there so that you were supposed

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.070
to close the book and go
ask somebody about it.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.750
And that was a chance for you to
have a conversation with somebody

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.050
about a word that you didn't know

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.350
and that's how you're
supposed to learn it.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.770
So, both of those kind of
ideas were really profound

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.070
and really interesting to me.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.930
And really drive kind of the
way that this book came to be

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.070
and how I hope this book
exists in the world.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.710
I got really worried about,
when I was writing this book,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.800
about halfway through because
there's so many elements in it

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.100
that are strange or
like almost grotesque

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.400
because I like the grotesque.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.880
I mean, I think that's
pretty obvious.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.180
I'm not going to hide it.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.510
But I like those sorts of
things but I got really worried

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.810
when I was writing it about halfway

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.520
through about whether this
book would find an audience

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.360 position:56%
or who the audience would be for it.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.740
But I think keeping that in mind
that books that are kind of --

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.610
that the purpose of books are to
be kind of thorny and to engage

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:53.010
with you and to trouble you a
little bit and to trouble a reader,

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.920
where things have kind
of kept me going.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.110 position:56%
And those are the kind of books that
I turn to or that I turn to again

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.590
and again and get really
excited about.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:08.420
So, the book went through a couple
of different revisions and back

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.830
and forths and a lot of
the research as well,

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.600
I realized at a certain point
that I wanted part of the book

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.950
to take place in 1920s
Belgian Congo.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.410
And so that took a whole bunch of
research and thinking and writing

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.920
and talking about things.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.840
And I realized also at a certain
point that I was going to have

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.630
to do a little bit more research
around what exactly it would be

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.190
like to live with a chimpanzee.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.510
I should say, before --

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.270 position:56%
at this point, that I'm not really a
huge fan of animals, so I wasn't --

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.750
that part of writing about
this was not the thing

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.050
that interested me the most.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.660
The thing that interested
me the most was kind

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.800
of larger discussions
about race and language.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.200
But at a certain point, I was
like, "I have to just buckle down

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.020
and start thinking about
what exactly it means

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.860
to be a chimpanzee."

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.040
And that part of the research
went for a short period of time

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.950
and then it was like, "Let me use
my imagination a little bit more

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.370
to kind of think about this,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:12.860
about how these elements
will all interact."

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.190
A big part of this, of
working on this book,

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.840
and what took so long also
was realizing when to kind

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.090
of stop my research and kind
of let storytelling take over.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:30.910
So a really big and comforting
piece of information or anecdote

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.650
that really helped was I'm a
huge fan of Edward P. Jones.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.180
And when he was writing
"The Known World," he talked

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.710
about when you stop research and
when you keep going with research.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.110
And that you could spend
all day sitting around,

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.340
researching the exact type of
saddle that would have been used

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.510
in 18-whenever in the county
that he's trying to write

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.810
about and that he's making up.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.150
Or at a certain point you could
realize that for the reader,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.410
it's just a saddle, and
for the actual character

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.010
in the scene, it's just a saddle.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.540
And when we think about the things
that we use every day in our life,

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.870
oftentimes we don't necessarily
think of all those kind

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.650
of wealth of research and details.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:14.200
So, it's a fine balance I think for
writers for people who love books

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.040
about where you put all of
that information and all

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.760
of that really kind
of fine detailed eye.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.410
And a lot of writing the book was
trying to figure out those pieces

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.820
of the book and trying to figure
out those things about it.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.420
So, I'm going to take a
break from kind of talking

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.540
about how the book came to be.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.280
I'm going to read from the
opening pages of the book.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.340
I should say that the book switches
perspectives so, the book --

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.220
parts of the book are
told by Charlotte,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.520
who's the oldest daughter
in the family.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.890
And then other parts of the
book explore how her family,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.290
her mother Laurel, her father
Charles, and her sister Callie,

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.230
are experiencing the experiment.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.870
And then two other sections
of the book are told

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.390
from characters in the 1920s.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.650
One of a woman named Nymphadora
who lives in the town that is --

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.760
has this institute that's
running the experiment,

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.530
and the other is Julia Toneybee
Leroy [phonetic] who's a rubber

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.270
heiress and she's actually the
impetuous for the experiment.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.040
She's given the money
to this institute

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.020
and it's the one who's the driving
force behind this experiment.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.460
So, I'm going to start with
reading from Charlotte's section,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.060
and then I'll read a little
bit of the Nymphadora section.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.620
And then I think I'll
open to questions

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:35.500
if anybody has any questions.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.030
Charlotte.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.780
"This car doesn't feel
like ours," I said.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.240
"Well, it is now," my father said
with a sigh, "So get used to it."

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.590
Outside of the car
it was dark and hot

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.950
and early morning August
in Dorchester.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.280
Through the crack of the window, I
could smell every part of the city,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.860
every slab of asphalt, every
rotting plank of wood siding,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.610
every crumbling stucco wall,
every scarred and skinny tree.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.830
I could smell all of
it beginning to sweat.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.470
I sat back in my seat.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.190
I knew I was right.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:18.290
Our old car was a used silver
Chevy sedan, a dubious gift

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.030
from my uncle Lyle, a mechanic.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.850
The Chevy's backseats were
balding, the foam cushions peeling

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.650
with faded stickers from some
long discarded coloring book.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.620
The Chevy's body slumped over
its axis, slung way too low

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.640
to the ground, so that when
you opened the car's doors,

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.960
their bottoms scraped the curb.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:45.190
The new car was a 1991 silver Volvo
station wagon, next year's model.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.200
The Toneybee Institute paid for it.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.640
It had a curt, upturned nose
that looked smug and out

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.190
of place beside the lazing sedans

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.010
and subservient hatchbacks
parked on our block.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.770
Being inside the Volvo felt
like we were in public.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.300
None of us could bring
ourselves to speak.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.990
We were all too humbled
by the leather interiors.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:14.740
My mother, in the driver's seat,
adjusted her rearview mirror.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.960
My younger sister, Callie, kept
playing with the automatic windows

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.670
until my mother told her to stop.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.580
Up in the front seat, my father
tugged on his gers one by one,

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.430
trying to crack his knuckles,
but the cartilage wouldn't break.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.570
I shifted my legs, and the leather
skin of the seat stuck to the backs

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:38.730
of my thighs, made a slow,
painful smack as I leaned forward.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.750
"They know we're no good
with animals, right?"

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.750
I moved again and the
leather creaked beneath me.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.420
"I mean, you told them that?"

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.720
"What are you talking about?"

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.360
My mother rolled down her window,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.240
began to fuss with the
driver's side mirror.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.330
"We're great with animals."

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.630
"We are not.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.900
We're terrible with pets."

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.410
"Well, that's e because
we won't have a pet."

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.590
My mother had been
saying this for weeks.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.440
"Charlie isn't a pet."

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.910
"He's a research monkey,"
my father added.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.290
"He's a chimpanzee."

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.090
This was my sister, Callie.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.260
"He's more than a pet,"
my mother corrected.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.110
"He's going to be like
a brother to you."

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.490
My father said, "That's
going a bit far, Laurel."

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.420
"What I'm trying to say," she
began, "is that we just have

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.300
to treat him like one of us.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.400
Like he's part of our family.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.400
We just have to make
him feel like he's one

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.980
of our own and he'll do e."

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.440
"But all our pets die."

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.740
"Charlotte."

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.170
My mother was scanning
the street now.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.470
"It's true.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.690
That rabbit you bought me when I
was e and Callie was born."

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:41.990
"He was depressed."

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.340
My father turned in his seat.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.750
"It was because we kept him
under the kitchen counter."

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.640 position:56%
My father had a notebook open in his
lap, the pages turned to the start

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.930
of a geometry lesson plan, but
he hadn't written anything yet.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.350
Over his shoulder, I could
see where he'd drawn a grove

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:01.280
of interlocking pineapples
in the sheet's margins.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.700
"In our defense," my mother
said, "we had to keep him there.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.790
We just didn't have the space."

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.320 position:56%
She tugged at her side mirror again.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:14.240 position:56%
She frowned, made an appreciative
"ah," and rolled her window back up.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.550
She touched a button
on the dashboard,

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.160
and the mirror gave a delicate
little shudder and began

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.770
to angle itself toward her.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.600
She glanced over at
my father, grinned.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.710
"Very nice," he said.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.410
I stuck my head in the
space between them.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.400
"That rabbit died because
he ate his own fur.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.700
He choked on it.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.470
He died because he
choked on himself."

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.770
"Is that true?"

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.150
Callie strained against
her seat belt,

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.160 position:56%
trying to catch what we were saying.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.680
"No." My mother swatted at me.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.230
"Charlotte, get back there,
get back in your seat.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.530
Put your seat belt on.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.290
You're upsetting your sister."

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.690
We didn't even have seat
belts in the old car.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:56.220
I ran mine across my chest,
clicked the buckle closed.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.520
I waited. Then I said,
"Dad's h."

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.170
My mother shot me a warning
glance in the rearview mirror.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.300
"Dad was in charge of the
h and it still died."

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.980
No one answered me.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.060
After a while I said,
"And it didn't even die.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.670
It just kind of ked away."

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.470
"I think I'm going to
be sick," Callie moaned.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.770
"He had mange."

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.390
My father turned again in his
seat, trying to catch Callie's eye.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.690
"I've told you this before.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.000
He already had it when we brought
him home from the pet store."

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.360
But I persisted.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.590
"Mom had to take that h out of
the tank and put him in a paper bag

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.250
and bury him at the park
because he was so messed

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.650
up he would have polluted
our toilets.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.360
We made a h too
sick for a toilet, Mom."

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.770
"I'm going to be sick,"
Callie declared.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.190
"Charlotte, no talking."

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.660
My mother leaned forward
and switched on the radio

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.420
and a too deep voice
intoned, "W-I-L-D Boston."

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.900
That station was at the
top of the list of things

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.680
that my mother forbade us.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.080
"Nothing but booty music," she'd
say, a di-missal that made me

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.000
and Callie squirm in embarrassment.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.930
Now, though, she turned the
volume up until the sound buzzed

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.390
over us, drowning out our words.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.370
My last piece of evidence I signed

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.710
to Callie underneath the
stutter of a drum machine.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.130 position:56%
The mice, I explained with my hands.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.830 position:56%
We had mice and they died of heart
attacks because they mated too much.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.180
They fucked, and here I spelled it
out because I didn't know the sign

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.820
for that yet, they
f-u-c-k-e-d to death.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.570
How did they do that?

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.130
Callie signed back.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.240
I shook my head and turned
my face to the window.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.510
Okay, so that's Callie's section.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:44.510
[ Applause ]

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:53.010
And then I'll read from
Nymphadora's section.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:30:01.270
So she is a -- she's living
in the Berkshires in 1929.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.640
And I think that's
all you need to know.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.160
I think it will become
pretty clear as we go on.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.530
My mother was a Star of a Morning.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.310
My father was a sadder night.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:20.480
I was first an infant of delivery
star, and then I was a girl star,

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.830
then a young lady star, and three
years ago, right before mama

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:30.000
and pop drank a jigger of cyanide
each, I became in my own right,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.300
a full-blown star of the
morning, Fifth House,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.100
Second Quadrant Division,
northeastern launch

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.020
of the colored hamlet of
Spring City in the town

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.950
of Cortland County, Massachusetts.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:46.570
After my parents committed suicide,
I declared, if only to myself,

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.470
that I was no longer
a Star of the Morning.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:53.300
But even now, three years on,
I can't stop wearing my pin.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.410
During the day, while
I'm teaching class,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.410
it's hidden under my shirt
collar, pinned right up close

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.320
to the front of my throat.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.620
At night, after I've dressed
my hair and put it in its cap

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.970
after I've rubbed my face
first with cold cream

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:10.790
and then a worn oily piece of
chamois, I do what mama showed me.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:14.570
I stand in front of the mirror,
my skin all greasy and soft,

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.650
and take off the pin while
staring at my reflection.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:22.250 position:56%
A star of the morning is never
allowed to look directly at her pin.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:27.190 position:56%
My pin is a small, brass knot, filed
down to look like a burst of light,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.630
with a rusty garnet in the middle.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:33.290
When I was an infant star, I would
stand in the mirror beside mama,

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:37.200
watching our reflections' fingers
at work unfastening our pins,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.600
and I was filled with love.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.470
I thought it was the most
beautiful thing in the world.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.390
Mama told me it was
better than a diamond.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.340
Stars of the Morning always take
off their pins before they sleep,

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.700
and always before their
evening prayers so as not

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.020
to make a false idol out of it.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.940
Now, when I take off my pin, I
place it on my nightstand and then,

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.300
if I was to follow what mama
taught me, I am supposed to reflect

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.980
on my moral failings during the
day, and recite the Lord's Prayer,

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.900
because Stars of the Morning are
good Christian [inaudible] women.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.930
But no one, if they could read my
thoughts would call me a Christian

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.950
anymore, and besides, I
don't believe in prayer.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:21.140
So during this bit of the routine,
I try to just sit quiet on my bed.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.380
But after years of ritual,
I can't help myself.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.920
Even when I'm dumb, the blood
in my ears pounds out the rhythm

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.400
of "Our Father, who art in heaven."

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.010
To drown out these pious
cadences, in my head,

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.700
I sometimes chant the obscene
version I learned as girl.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.950
"Our Father, who farts in heaven,
Horesch [phonetic] be his name."

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:46.520
I am a 36-year-old, unmarried,
orphaned, negro school teacher,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.250
in charge of a roomful of
impressionable young colored minds,

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.180
and every night, I sing a dirty,

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.580
nursery rhyme to help
me go to sleep.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.390
It is enough to laugh if I did
not always feel like weeping.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.480
The time for prayer
over, ready for bed,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.820
the last thing I do before I
lay down and blow out the light,

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.770
is to stand before the mirror
again, and pinch the pin

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.340
between my fingers, and
very carefully stick it

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.860
to the lace collar of nightgown.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.790
I've slept with the pin for
as long as I can remember.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:19.550
At the base of my neck, just
below the collarbone, is a livid,

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:24.150
red line from its sharpest
end, drawing on me.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.070
My best memory is of initiation.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.950
I was 7 years old.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.340
We stood in front of the
church basement door,

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.650
on a lawn so bright you could
see the green even in dusk.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:40.130 position:56%
My mother was the most powerful star
in Spring City, so I was the head

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:43.280
of the line, even though
I didn't want to be.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.590
I was terrified.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.490
An older girl had once told me
that to become an infant star,

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.100
they set your hair on fire.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.140 position:56%
Her friends said the big women stars
made you shake a dead lady's hand,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.470
the hand of the very
first star who ever lived.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.170
"The big women stars keep it
in a special box," she said,

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.870
"and when you shake
it, the bones crunch

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.880
and the dust gets on your fingers.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.200
The dead lady's dust is
what makes you a star."

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.300
I had asked mama about
all of these rumors

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.400
and she told me they were nonsense,
and those girls were just jealous.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.930
Their mothers were loose women

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:19.490
and the girls had proven
themselves unruly.

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.620
And so they could never
become an infant star like me.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.300
But I remained uneasy
and when I pressed mama,

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.480
she still wouldn't tell me exactly
what happened at initiation.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.990
All my life, I thought we
had no secrets between us.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.250 position:56%
The year before when our tabby Dina,
birthed a litter, she told me frank

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.300
and shrew how cats
and people were made.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.340 position:56%
She told me how the universe came to
be, and where our earth stood in it.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.650
And that God did not live in the
sun, but in the breath and air

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.320
and dust around and within us.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.240
"The sun is just a very bright
ball," she told me, which was more

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.950
than the other mothers
told their children.

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:59.190
But she wouldn't tell me
about becoming a star,

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.020
as many times as I asked her.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.520
For initiation, I wore
a white lace dress

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.410
and patent leather shoes mama
ordered special from Boston.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:12.070
Nine little girls pressed against
my back all breathing heavy.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:16.330
We had to fast for a day and
a night before initiation.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.740
According to the bylaws of
the Stars of the Morning,

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.450
infant stars are supposed to
consume only milk and honey,

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.060
and they have to chant,
"I'm a vessel for the light

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.480
of our Lord," before they drink it.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.440
But no one in Spring City could
afford honey, so we drank our milk

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.920
with raw brown sugar instead.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.950
I breathed the rotten sweetness
of it on the other children's spit

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.250
and in their girlish sweat.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:42.620
I squeezed my eyes shut very
tight and kept them that way

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.900
until I heard the basement
door of the church rumble open.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.710
I heard the girls behind me
breath quicker, talk faster.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.810
I felt something brushing
against my hand.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.140
"The dead woman," I thought, but
the hand that took mine was fat

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.960
and warm, and it led me very
carefully down the steps

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.640
and into the church basement.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.470
Once I was there, it smelled the
same as it always had, like earth

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:09.190
and the moths that ate the choir
robes, and the greening tint

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.000
of the church collection plate.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.730
I almost opened my
eyes, but a voice said,

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.510
"Keep your lights closed,
infant star."

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.090
Right beneath my chin, I felt
a point of warmth and I knew

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.860
that it was someone holding
a candle close to my face.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.400
This comforted me somehow
to know the light was near.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.980 position:56%
I heard the other girls stumble down
the stairs, one by one, most gasped,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.070
a few of the very young
ones started to cry.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.960
Then I heard the basement
door rumble shut.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.770
I opened my eyes and I laughed.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.620
I laughed because even though
the room smelled just the same,

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.990
when I opened my eyes, I saw it had
become the most beautiful place I

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.690
have ever been in my
life before or since.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.610
It wasn't dark.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.280
The earth walls were
covered in white paper.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.220
What seemed like a thousand
candles were lit all around us,

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.310
in tiny glass and tin lanterns.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:06.320 position:56%
Strings of white hydrangea were
threaded across the top of the room.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.710
Clouds hung down from the ceiling
and for a moment I thought,

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.440
"Mama's brought down the
very sky to greet me."

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.270
But then I saw that it was just
tool from Ms. Vera's dress shop,

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.610
double up on itself
to seem like heaven.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.970
We jumbled ourselves all up
until we formed a new line.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.800
I was now in the middle.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.520
Mama strode up before us in a long,
white robe, trimmed with yellow.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.890
She held a gold bound
Bible in her hands.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:35.840
She opened a page at random and one
by one, we had to hover a finger

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.110
over the Bible, let it fall down,

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.830
and then read from
whichever passage we chose.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.380 position:56%
The passage gave us our secret name;

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.340
the name only other
stars knew us by.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.230
The poor girl before me chose
Herod, and she cried and cried

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:54.180
because she was going to have to go
by the name of a known baby killer.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.540 position:56%
I thought for certain mama would let
her pick again, but she only looked

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.740
on sternly as another star
patted the little girl's back,

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.900
and told her some quickly
made up nonsense

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.830
about this being a
splendid opportunity

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.140
to restore honor to the name.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:12.150
I was relieved then when
I picked Nymphadora.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.420
My real name is Ellen, but
Nymphadora is so much better.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.410
I bet you didn't know there
was a Nymphadora in the Bible.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.850
There is, Colossians 4:15.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.640
Later, I found out our
Bible was a mistranslation.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.370
It should have read Nympha, and
Nympha should have been a man.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:32.470
It was by some lucky magic that I
got so fine a name as Nymphadora

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.170
of the Spring City Stars.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.800
Nymphadora sounded beautiful
and elegant and pretty and peek.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.070
I liked that the Nymphadora in our
Bible ran a church in her own home.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.610
I was proud of the name but
when I turned a threw a smile

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.470
at mama, she did not return it.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.810
When we were all newly
named, mama inspected the ten

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.150
of us and still did not speak.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.360
She raised her hand and Ms.
Vera and another Star rolled

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.480
out a tea table stacked with
food, real food, bowls of potatoes

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.110
and biscuits and a lanky turkey
with its bony ankles wrapped

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.400
in paper to keep its marrow warm.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.280
Our deflated stomachs milk lined
in sugary, leapt in revolt,

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.970
but mama wouldn't let us eat.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:16.030
Instead, she stood in
front of the table.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.970
"Girls," she said, "you
are almost infant stars.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.450
Do you know what makes
a star shine?"

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:22.750
No one answered.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:26.440
We were all watching the spread
behind her, too hungry to speak.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.880
"Girls," she said, "I've
asked you a question.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.330
A tenet of being an infant star is
to speak when you are spoken to.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.630
So we will begin again.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.380
What makes a star shine?"

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.000
The newly named Herod
sniffed loudly, wiped the snot

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.940
from her face, "The
light of heaven?"

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.550
she offered cautiously?

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.440
It was a good guess, as we'd had
to drone this phrase incessantly

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.320
for the past few days as we fasted.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.620
"No," mama said.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.860
"No, not the light of heaven.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.090
What makes a Star of
the Morning shine,

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.880
what makes an infant star shine
among all the other pieces of dust

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.070
and dirt and rock that
are our Lord's creations,

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:06.370
is self-control, denial.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.350
Denial built up inside
little infant stars like you,

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.880
makes your moral fiber
strong like flint,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.050
so that when the world tests you,
when the world rubs up against you,

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.370
all vicious and sharp,
and everything within you,

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.880
everything is telling you to give
in, all your desire is to give in,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.600
do you know what happens?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.030
You don't give in.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.840
You don't become soft.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.900
You ignore your desires.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.850
The world's trials stir up light
in you so strong, so pure, so true,

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.950
no man on earth could put it out.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:43.740
Denial of your desires is what
makes an infant star shine."

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.670 position:56%
Mama leaned up against the table
and crossed her arms over her chest.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:51.530
She lifted her chin up to the
paper clouds and began to declaim.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:55.060
And even though she was my mother
and even though I worshipped her,

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.660
I wanted to groan because I was a
smart little star, and I could read

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.310
between the lines and see
despite the turkey's paper socks,

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.600
promising meat kept
warm, we weren't going

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.050 position:56%
to be eating anything, anytime soon.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.620
And when we finally did, it
would most certainly be cold.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.290
The very first star
denied herself everything

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:16.370
so that she could be a
beacon of light for others.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.280
Her name was Mary Whitman
and she was a slave.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.230
Herod gasped at this.

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.350
We were negroes it was true, but
we were all northern negroes,

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:27.510
born of at least two
generations of freed men.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.280
Those with slavery closer to
them than that, kept it hidden.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.310
The first Emancipation Day
was nearly 40 years past.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.360
Slaves were the Israelites
in the Bible.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.400
They were the figures drawn in
quick blurry clouds of black ink

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.800
in the illustrated editions

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.750
of "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
we read in school.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.240
Though we understood that some of
us were once them, and that we had

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.470
to bake cakes every
church bazaar for those

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:56.190
who were still pretty much them,
it never occurred to us as children

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.010
that slaves could live
in Spring City,

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.680
Massachusetts any more
than camels could.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.400
"Yes," mama said, "she was
a slave and she ran away

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.260
and came here to the north.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.470
But in order to run, she had
to deny herself everything.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.830
She had to deny herself love.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.540
She had a mother and father
and husband and little babies

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.260
and she had to leave them behind.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.190
She had to deny herself love
and she ran and she ran,

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.930
and when she came here, when she
came to the north, she was so full

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.200
of light from her trials
that she became a star.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.520 position:56%
And she began this sisterhood to
teach other negro women how to shine

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.450
like her, because in order for the
negro race to survive and thrive,

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.240
we need a hundred stars,
a thousand stars,

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.890
full of light to show
others the way."

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.850
Mama rested against the table
and I heard the wood groan,

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:45.250
and just a whiff, just
the tiniest hint

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.730
of melted butter filled the air.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.820
"Not everyone can be a
star," she continued.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.120
"Not everyone can be so
strong as to deny themselves

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.760
to make sure the negro
race survives.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.210
But we believe you infant
stars have the potential

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.710
to become Stars of the Morning."

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.780
And here, mama gestured to Ms. Dora

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.300
who brought her a wooden backed
chair, which mama sat down on,

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.310
arranged her skirts,
made herself comfortable.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.250
And I cannot remember the rest
of the speech from the night,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.550
because my attention was taken

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.920
up with keeping my lips pressed
together and sucking hard

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.410
on my own tongue to
keep from standing up,

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.330
pushing my own mother aside,
and lapping up the mounds

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.190
of potatoes stacked behind her.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:26.510
Okay, that's the end
of that section.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:32.080
[ Applause ]

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.380
That was a longer one,
so thank you guys

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.390
for indulging me while
I read that one.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:44.980
And now I'll open up to questions
if you guys want to ask questions.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.390
Oh, great.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:51.960
&gt;&gt; My great aunt, who
raised my mother in part,

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.340
was a teacher of the
deaf in Northampton.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.640
&gt;&gt; Kaitlyn Greenidge:
Oh wow, wonderful.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.460
&gt;&gt; And the Clarke School there had

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.360
that oralist tradition
you were talking

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.830
about that ASL was
discouraged and was matter

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.170
in some ways I guess you
know, well-motivated to fit

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.820
in to the rest of society.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.120
&gt;&gt; Kaitlyn Greenidge: Right.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.450
&gt;&gt; Partly the desire of parents to
make sure their kids didn't stand

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:12.240
out or weren't set apart.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.870
But I wonder, you know, in
the larger arc of your book

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:20.620 position:56%
or your own life, this notion to fit
in, to assimilate, to be the same,

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.200
you know, what is that
dynamic tension?

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.720
How do you resolve that?

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.020
&gt;&gt; Kaitlyn Greenidge:
That's a great question.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.320
Thank you.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.530
So, the book in part was about
that -- is about that question.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.200
Is about what do you
sacrifice when you try

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.960
to make this way for assimilation?

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.330
And you know, America likes to
constantly talk about ourselves,

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:44.010
but we are a really interesting
and fascinating nation that we made

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.700
up of people from all over.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.070
And that is the tension in
question built into our very fiber

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:51.610
of our being of this country.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.970
And I mean, we fight
about it constantly.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:59.040
I mean it's at the heart of
probably every kind of major issue

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.290
that we talk about, is
what do you kind of give

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.100
up to become a part of the whole?

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.270
And what are the benefits of
being a part of the whole?

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.030
And can we mourn and can we
acknowledge the things that we lose

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.860
when we try to kind of
become a part of a whole?

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.740 position:56%
And so, those are -- I don't think
those questions are easily answered.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.340
I mean, I don't think
anybody has a one sentence

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.930
or a three sentence
answer to those questions,

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.320
but I do think they're really
interesting to keep asking

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.440
about these processes that we
do because on the one hand,

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.840
there is the practical need for
a group to assimilate for you

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.890
to be able to work together in some
kind of way, but on the other hand,

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.790
there is so much lost
and there's so much given

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.830
up by the group being asked to
assimilate that is not asked

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.650
of the group that they're
supposed to be assimilating into.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:50.990
And so, I think that
tension, for actually I think

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:56.240 position:56%
where what I find really interesting
about it is when people try to deny

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.910
that that tension exists
for certain things and say

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.100
that it's either all one
way or all the other.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.410
I don't think it's ever either
all one way or all the other

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.610
for that question around
assimilation.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.700
I think that tension
is kind of constant.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.280 position:56%
And people can come up with
different answers and different ways

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.810
of how they're going
to try and figure out.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:18.470
And I think each generation of
people comes up with their own way

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:20.910
of explaining what that's
supposed to be for themselves.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:23.850
And a lot of that also comes
from looking at the past,

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:28.270 position:56%
looking at parents and grandparents,
and what they've had to sacrifice

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:31.910
or give up, and as a descendent
saying, "Was it really worth it?"

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.210
So.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.510
&gt;&gt; I'll talk to you offline
about this, but Du Bois,

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.260
I did my senior thesis and I think
he had a lot of thoughts on that.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kaitlyn Greenidge: Oh, of course.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.860
Yes, yes, yes.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.690
Great. Any other questions?

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:44.990
Oh, wrap up.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.290
Over allotted time.

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.590
Okay, sorry.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.890
You were sitting right
there the whole time.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.890
I was like looking for you in the
