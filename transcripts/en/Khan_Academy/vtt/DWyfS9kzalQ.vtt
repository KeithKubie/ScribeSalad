00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:03.321
- [Instructor] So where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:07.834
we had Alexander the Great
consolidating his power

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:10.151
over the Macedonian Empire.

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:14.913
And in particular, he puts
down a rebellion in Thebes,

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:16.256
destroys the city,

00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:18.294
which makes the other
city-states of Greece say,

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:20.414
hey, we're not gonna mess
with this person anymore.

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:21.757
And then Alexander says,

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:24.202
I am now going to conquer Asia.

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:26.352
I am now going to conquer
the Persian Empire,

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:30.615
do what my father wanted
to do before he died.

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:33.134
And so he puts one of
his father's generals,

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:37.798
now one of his generals, in
charge of Greece, Antipater.

00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:40.230
Antipater, declares him regent,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.753
and then leads troops off
to what many people say

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.954
is have the greatest,
or many historians call,

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:49.370
the greatest adventure of all time.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.314
His attempt to conquer the Persian Empire

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:54.842
and become the king of Asia.

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.759
So the year is 334 BCE,

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.581
and the first major battle that Alexander

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:05.664
and his army encounters
is at the Granicus River,

00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:09.164
here in modern-day Turkey.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.548
Now, keep in mind that Alexander's force,

00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:15.972
depending on what time we're looking at,

00:01:15.972 --> 00:01:19.269
it numbers between 40 and 50,000 troops,

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:23.347
a good number of them
infantry, some cavalry.

00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:26.399
And most of the battles
that we'll see him fight,

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.709
especially the next two
against the Persian forces,

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:31.455
he's hugely outnumbered.

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:34.813
But at Granicus, he
actually has an advantage

00:01:34.813 --> 00:01:38.933
in terms of the number of infantry he has.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:42.073
He's slightly outnumbered
in terms of cavalry,

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:44.903
but he's able to defeat
the Persian forces.

00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:47.495
Now these Persian forces,
they are significant.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.062
They're led by the Persian satraps,

00:01:50.062 --> 00:01:53.649
these are the governors
of the territories,

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:54.502
I guess you could say.

00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:59.294
The Persian regions or provinces
in this area in Asia Minor.

00:01:59.294 --> 00:02:00.960
And he's able to defeat them.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.745
But as important as Granicus is,

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:06.915
he still, Alexander still
has not come directly

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:08.795
against Darius III.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.927
Darius III is the Shah in
Shah, the King of Kings,

00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:14.568
the king of Persia.

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.909
And not to confuse Darius
III with the Darius

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.186
who 150 years before this attacked Greece.

00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:23.646
So now you have Alexander,

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:26.038
his first decisive victory
against the Persians.

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:28.763
He makes his way down the Anatolian coast,

00:02:28.763 --> 00:02:31.125
in his mind liberating
many of these cities

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:33.644
that used to be Greek cities.

00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:35.589
Now if we zoom in a little bit,

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.724
you can see the way this map is set up.

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:41.273
Let me zoom in a little bit.

00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:45.423
Where you see these dotted
lines around a city,

00:02:45.423 --> 00:02:48.791
this means that Alexander's
forces siege the city.

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.881
They surrounded it, they
didn't let anything go

00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:53.422
in or out until the city surrendered.

00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:56.058
And so you see this path of
Alexander and his forces.

00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:58.058
We then go into 333 BCE.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.390
Outside of the forward movement
of Alexander and his troops

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.669
and their ability to take
over all of Asia Minor,

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.703
modern-day Turkey in only
a matter of a little more

00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:11.806
than a year,

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:14.886
what also happens in 333 BCE,

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:16.049
since some of you might
have been wondering

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.702
well, what ever happens to Sparta?

00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:19.928
Philip of Macedon never took over Sparta.

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:21.965
Do they stay independent forever?

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:23.557
And the simple answer is no.

00:03:23.557 --> 00:03:27.057
In 333 BCE, Antipater defeats the Spartans

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.436
at the battle of
Megalopolis and forces them

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:37.540
into what we now call
the League of Corinth.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.869
So let's keep now going
back to where Alexander is.

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.179
So Antipater clearly was competent at

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.512
maintaining power in Greece.

00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:49.397
And the next major battle that Alexander

00:03:49.397 --> 00:03:52.574
and his troops face is at Issus.

00:03:52.574 --> 00:03:55.849
And what makes Issus significant is that

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.249
they are hugely outnumbered.

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.413
Historians disagree by how
much they're outnumbered.

00:04:00.413 --> 00:04:02.948
Remember, we said Alexander's
forces were around

00:04:02.948 --> 00:04:04.248
40 or 50,0000,

00:04:04.248 --> 00:04:05.786
while the Persians at Issus,

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:07.379
depending on which account you look at,

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.642
were at least 150,000,
probably over 100,000.

00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:14.994
More ancient accounts talk
about many hundreds of thousands

00:04:14.994 --> 00:04:17.138
or even a million troops.

00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:20.601
What also made Issus
significant is this is where,

00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:23.711
this is the first time that Darius III,

00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.582
the Shah in Shah, the king of Persia,

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.547
directly confronts Alexander.

00:04:28.547 --> 00:04:30.812
Well, Alexander once again is able to,

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:34.979
or at least here is able
to overcome unlikely odds

00:04:36.282 --> 00:04:38.547
and defeat the Persian army,

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:40.880
sending Darius into retreat.

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:43.126
And he retreats so fast,

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:46.350
he even leaves an
encampment where his mother,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.742
his wife, and his two daughters are there.

00:04:48.742 --> 00:04:52.184
And Alexander then takes them captive,

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:53.972
but treats them very
nicely and then eventually

00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:55.989
marries one of the daughters.

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:59.906
So after that defeat,
Darius is on the retreat,

00:05:00.982 --> 00:05:02.787
or after that defeat for Darius,

00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:04.170
this victory for Alexander,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.857
Alexander then goes on into the Lavant,

00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:11.024
modern-day Syria and Lebanon
and Israel and Palestine.

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:15.770
And you can see he takes
siege of the cities

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.626
of Tyre and Gaza,

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:19.450
but by the time he gets through that,

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.875
it's now 332 and he
makes his way into Egypt,

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:24.629
and he's relatively unopposed.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.104
The satraps in Egypt to
say, okay, you know what?

00:05:27.104 --> 00:05:27.965
We recognize you.

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:29.494
They treat him as a liberator,

00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:32.167
and he even takes a
pretty large detour to go

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.834
to the Oracle for the god Ammon,

00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:39.920
and there he is reassured
that he is a son of Ammon.

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:45.344
And he already is told
by his mother Olympius

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:46.974
that he is the son of Zeus,

00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:48.680
and so many people call Alexander,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.105
or he calls himself now,
Alexander Zeus Ammon,

00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:54.392
the son of Zeus Ammon.

00:05:54.392 --> 00:05:56.543
So once again he's trying
to really make himself,

00:05:56.543 --> 00:05:58.053
or maybe he believes himself,

00:05:58.053 --> 00:06:00.829
that he is half god,
that he is a demi-god.

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:03.304
But then he continues on with this,

00:06:03.304 --> 00:06:05.107
I guess you could say grand adventure,

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:07.206
and I don't want to
romanticize it too much

00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:09.825
because even though he is in some way

00:06:09.825 --> 00:06:14.399
conquering and/or unifying
these large areas,

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.273
there's also a lot of bloodshed,

00:06:17.273 --> 00:06:19.156
a lot of civilians dying.

00:06:19.156 --> 00:06:22.161
This is a very ugly thing
that only looks romantic

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:24.729
from maybe a distance of
many thousands of years.

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:25.891
But when you think about it,

00:06:25.891 --> 00:06:28.846
it would not have been
very pleasant to have lived

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.588
in any of these cities that
Alexander and his troops

00:06:31.588 --> 00:06:33.684
are going through.

00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:35.460
But then he leaves Egypt,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.656
and the whole time after
the defeat of Issus,

00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:41.225
Darius keeps sending him treaties

00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:43.782
to say hey, maybe we
can work this thing out.

00:06:43.782 --> 00:06:47.818
Maybe you can just stop to
the west of the Euphrates.

00:06:47.818 --> 00:06:49.428
I'll give you this or that.

00:06:49.428 --> 00:06:51.798
But Alexander keeps
saying nope, not for me.

00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:53.315
I want to be the king of Asia.

00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:55.668
There's only one king of Asia.

00:06:55.668 --> 00:06:58.995
And so they eventually
meet again at Gaugamela.

00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:03.593
Once again, a very
significant battle in history

00:07:03.593 --> 00:07:06.340
where once again Darius is there

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.507
and has a significant force
advantage over Alexander,

00:07:11.788 --> 00:07:13.932
and this time doesn't make the mistake

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:16.573
of meeting him in a relatively narrow area

00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:19.610
where his force advantage
won't really be an advantage.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.063
But even at Gaugamela,

00:07:21.063 --> 00:07:24.540
Alexander is able to
decisively defeat him.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.707
And Darius has to flee over
the mountains to Ecbatana.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.764
My apologies, 'cause I
know I'm probably not

00:07:33.764 --> 00:07:35.647
pronouncing it perfectly.

00:07:35.647 --> 00:07:38.111
And Alexander and his forces then go on

00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:40.722
to capture Babylon and Susia,

00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:42.623
and Susia was actually one of the capitals

00:07:42.623 --> 00:07:44.735
of the Achaemenid Empire.

00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:46.691
So this whole way they're able
to get all of this treasure

00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:48.562
and start sending it back to Greece.

00:07:48.562 --> 00:07:51.143
And then, we eventually get to,

00:07:51.143 --> 00:07:53.958
and by this point having
been defeated at Issus

00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.614
and now Gaugamela and being on the run,

00:07:57.614 --> 00:08:01.550
the Persian Empire is, you
could say it's already fallen,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.557
or it's definitely falling,

00:08:03.557 --> 00:08:06.326
but it becomes really official once we get

00:08:06.326 --> 00:08:07.243
to 330 BCE.

00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:11.735
And remember, this is less than five years

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:12.868
since Alexander started,

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:14.560
and that's short by any time frame.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.571
But they're on foot and on horseback.

00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:18.386
This is not modern warfare where they have

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:20.582
tanks and trucks and planes.

00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:23.382
And the facts are
conquered so much territory

00:08:23.382 --> 00:08:26.066
and empires over 200
years old in this short

00:08:26.066 --> 00:08:29.591
about of time frame is
kind of breathtaking.

00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:32.815
But it's in 330 where the forces go to

00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:35.355
the Achaemenid capital of Persepolis,

00:08:35.355 --> 00:08:37.561
the capital for over 200 years,

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:39.396
and they sack that town.

00:08:39.396 --> 00:08:40.918
And not only do they sack that town,

00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:42.467
they destroy the town.

00:08:42.467 --> 00:08:43.984
And I'll repeat it again,

00:08:43.984 --> 00:08:45.973
Alexander the Great,
he's romanticized a lot,

00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:47.927
he's called the Great,

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:51.100
but they destroy that town in a way that

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.870
you would not make your parent's proud.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.168
Let's just put it that way.

00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:58.511
But at that point he is now
king of the Persian Empire.

00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:01.565
Darius is officially on the run.

00:09:01.565 --> 00:09:05.257
And what Alexander now
cares about is continuing

00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:08.336
this adventure, continuing
it east into what

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:12.381
we now consider to be
Afghanistan, Turkemenistan,

00:09:12.381 --> 00:09:16.086
Uzbekistan, and modern-day Pakistan.

00:09:16.086 --> 00:09:18.709
He also wants to get Darius.

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:20.909
Some would argue he wants
to kill him himself,

00:09:20.909 --> 00:09:23.588
some would argue that he wants to somehow

00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:27.057
have Darius declare
Alexander as the rightful

00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:29.738
Shah in Shah, king of Asia.

00:09:29.738 --> 00:09:32.651
And so you can see the path
of Alexander and his forces.

00:09:32.651 --> 00:09:34.447
After they destroy Persepolis,

00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:37.571
they then go up, they turn northwards.

00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:40.167
They go through all of
these cities up here.

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:42.167
Then in 329, they're on,

00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:47.095
they're following the trail of Darius.

00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:50.195
Darius eventually gets captured and killed

00:09:50.195 --> 00:09:52.151
by one of his satraps,

00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:54.604
someone by the name of Bessus.

00:09:54.604 --> 00:09:58.754
And Bessus, who is one of
the satraps of Bactria,

00:09:58.754 --> 00:10:02.671
kills Darius and declares
himself Artaxerxes V.

00:10:04.157 --> 00:10:06.648
He wants to be the Shah in Shah.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:11.219
Well, eventually Alexander
catches up with Bessus in 329.

00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:14.512
He's really angry that
Bessus has killed Darius.

00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:17.017
He's also likely angry
that Bessus is claiming

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:18.532
that he is the Shah in Shah.

00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:21.624
And so he kills Bessus
in fairly brutal form.

00:10:21.624 --> 00:10:24.275
And there's different accounts
of how the killing happened,

00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:28.463
but all of them are
various degrees of brutal.

00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:32.832
But from there Alexander's
troops continued on eastward,

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:36.151
continued on eastward
into what we now consider

00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.734
to be Afghanistan and Pakistan.

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:44.250
And there he has the famous
battle with the king of Porus

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.518
where he encounters
these 200 war elephants.

00:10:47.518 --> 00:10:50.412
But once again he's this
great military tactician,

00:10:50.412 --> 00:10:52.529
and he's able to defeat the king.

00:10:52.529 --> 00:10:54.653
And along this whole way
it's worth mentioning

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:56.472
he sets up all of these towns,

00:10:56.472 --> 00:10:58.800
he sets up 20 Alexandrias.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.288
And near here he even
sets up a town named after

00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:05.025
his horse Bucephalus,
the town of Bucephala.

00:11:05.025 --> 00:11:08.094
And Alexander is eager to keep conquering.

00:11:08.094 --> 00:11:10.420
Once he defeats the
king of Porus, he says,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.113
hey, I want to go conquer
the rest of India.

00:11:13.113 --> 00:11:16.127
But his troops are far from
home and they are tired

00:11:16.127 --> 00:11:18.863
and they are spread thin
and they're getting sick.

00:11:18.863 --> 00:11:20.780
They are not so interested in that.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.751
So eventually Alexander says, all right,

00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:25.021
I'm with y'all.

00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:26.555
Let's go back.

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:28.794
And the troops are really, really happy.

00:11:28.794 --> 00:11:30.500
They make their way back.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.299
You can see the path back after,

00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:36.886
and you can see as they follow
the Indus River in Pakistan.

00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:39.636
And eventually we get to 323 BCE,

00:11:45.123 --> 00:11:48.492
and Alexander is back in Babylon.

00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:52.537
And it's over there in
Babylon that Alexander dies

00:11:52.537 --> 00:11:54.897
at the ripe old age of 32.

00:11:54.897 --> 00:11:57.696
It's mindblowing to think
about how much happened

00:11:57.696 --> 00:12:00.657
in the 12 years that he was emperor

00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:04.824
of the Macedonians or even
the Shah in Shah of Persia.

00:12:06.234 --> 00:12:09.780
He was able to defeat an
empire over 200 years old.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.808
And what's significant about this is that

00:12:11.808 --> 00:12:13.139
as he conquered,

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.592
he encouraged his troops to assimilate.

00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:17.476
In fact, he was criticized
for maybe assimilating

00:12:17.476 --> 00:12:19.440
a little bit too much.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.888
But he dies in Babylon,

00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:23.332
and it's not clear exactly why he dies.

00:12:23.332 --> 00:12:24.829
He was a major drinker.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:26.481
Some people say alcohol poisoning.

00:12:26.481 --> 00:12:28.519
Some people say it was direct poisoning.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:29.966
But needless to say,

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:34.086
this was one of the
most significant decades

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:38.253
in human history, this conquest
of Alexander the Great.
