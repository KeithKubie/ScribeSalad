00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.570
So this example is best characterized as natural

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.720
selection not random selection. And the reasoning is

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.240
that this particular allele faced direct selection pressure

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.940
during the Bubonic plague to be at higher frequencies

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.860
today in Northern Europe. This wasn't a random

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.220
event like a meteor striking or a zombie

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.420
attack where the allele. And its frequency change

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.340
had nothing to do with the events surrounding it.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.480
This allele protected people from the Bubonic

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.030
plague, so those with this allele survived to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.550
pass that allele on. It was selected

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.840
for through a process of directed natural selection.
