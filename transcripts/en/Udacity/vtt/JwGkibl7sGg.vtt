00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.773
Here's the answer. So here's the provided code for MainDish. It has an init

00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:08.135
method and a str method. What we want to do with appetizer is almost the same

00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:12.850
thing. So let's start by cutting and pasting that code. So here's the code from

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.248
the MainDish init and we'll cut and paste that into the appetizer. And now we

00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:21.472
need to account for one little difference which instead of having sides, the

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:25.864
appetizer has a number of people that it serves. We also need to implement the

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:29.698
str method for the MainDish. We're printing out the name as str if it's

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:33.046
vegetarian or not. The description if it has one and the price. And you'll

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:35.994
notice I'm using conditional expressions here which is something you might not

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.450
of seen before. We haven't introduced it yet in this class. This is similar to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.400
an if statement except in this case it's an expression. That means it produces a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.492
value so we can use it in an assignment in this case giving a value to default

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:52.324
parameter. And what it means is, if the value of the if test is true, the value

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:56.780
of expression is what we put before the if. Otherwise it's what we put after the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.240
else. So in this case we'll get the star if self dot vegetarian is true.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.770
Otherwise we'll get nothing. This is what we did to implement str for the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.478
MainDish. For the str function we want to do exactly the same thing for

00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:11.169
appetizer as we did for MainDish, so we can cut and paste this code.
