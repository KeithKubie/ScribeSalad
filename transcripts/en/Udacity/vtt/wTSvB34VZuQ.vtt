00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.550
To understand more deeply the properties of means and analysis,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.406
let us look at another, slightly more complicated example. In this example,

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:14.660
there are four blocks instead of the three in the previous example. A, B,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.940
C, D. In the initial state, the blocks are arranged as shown here.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.240
The goal state is shown here on the right. The four blocks are arranged in

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.030
a particular order. Now if you compare the configuration of blocks on

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.590
the left with the configuration of blocks on the right, in the goal state,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.590
you can see there are three differences. First, A is on Table,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.980
where A is on B here. B is on C. That's not a difference. C is on Table.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.030
C is on D here, D's on B, D's on Table here. So there are three differences.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.350
So, this is a heuristic measure of the difference between the initial state and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.280
the goal state. Once again,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.790
we'll assume that the AI agent can move only one block at a time.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.590
Given the specification of the problem, what states are possible

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.760
from the initial state? Please write down your answers in these boxes.
