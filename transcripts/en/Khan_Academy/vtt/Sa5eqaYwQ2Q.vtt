00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.912
- [Instructor] Now,
we're going to talk about

00:00:00.912 --> 00:00:03.929
one of the most famous conquerors
in all of human history,

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.398
and that is Alexander the Great.

00:00:06.398 --> 00:00:07.662
But before talking about

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:09.548
all of the things that he conquered,

00:00:09.548 --> 00:00:11.622
let's think about how he got started out

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:15.048
and in particular, how he's
able to consolidate control

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:18.298
over the empire that his father begins.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.794
So, in the last video,

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:23.567
we saw that exiting the Peloponnesian War,

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:25.372
the Greeks were weak.

00:00:25.372 --> 00:00:28.458
Sparta and its allies,
the Peloponnesian League,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:32.920
they had won, but the Greeks
were ripe for being conquered.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.883
And they end up being
conquered by Philip II,

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:39.466
King of Macedonia, and
he rules from Pella.

00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.432
And shortly after he
becomes king, his son,

00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:47.886
his first son, Alexander, is born.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:52.053
And Alexander is the son that
Philip has with Olympias.

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:56.986
Olympias is the daughter
of the king of Molossia,

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.402
which makes her Molossian
and not Macedonian,

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.773
which is going to be
somewhat important later on

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:06.086
when Philip II dies.

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:09.693
But the early part of
Alexander's life is quite good

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:12.729
and he seems to be in favor
with his father, Philip II.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.896
After all, Alexander seems like
a decent heir to the throne.

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:21.020
Early in his life, he gets from his father

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.060
what is arguably the best
tutor, for sure of the time,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.894
probably the best tutor in
human history, in Aristotle.

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:31.273
And the way that his father convinces him

00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:35.010
to tutor Alexander when Alexander's 13,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.955
he tutors him from when Alexander
is about 13 to about 16,

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:43.727
is Philip destroys
Aristotle's village of Stagira

00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:46.322
as he conquers Greece.

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:50.367
And Aristotle says, "Okay,
sure, I'll tutor your son.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:54.955
"But in exchange for that, why
don't you rebuild my hometown

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:58.267
"and free all of the people
who had been enslaved

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:00.128
"after the town was conquered?"

00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:03.180
And so, Philip agrees;
Alexander gets a great tutor.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.958
There's also the stories of
how Alexander carried favor

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.021
with his father by taming
the famous horse Bucephalus,

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:13.615
who Alexander will
eventually ride into Asia

00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:16.703
as he conquers the
Persian Empire and beyond.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.344
And Philip, very proud of his young son

00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:23.090
being able to conquer this
seemingly untamable horse,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.362
as Philip conquers, as he conquers Greece,

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:30.690
Alexander is alongside him leading troops,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.391
showing him to be a
capable military general,

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:34.860
a capable leader.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.731
So, all seems to be working
out well for Alexander

00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:41.814
until Philip takes what ends up being

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:45.520
his seventh and last wife.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.858
Until then, Olympias was his favored wife.

00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:51.086
And Olympias is a bit of a character,

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:52.820
at least from the point of historians.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.358
And you should take all of
this with a grain of salt

00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:56.283
because many of these
histories and these stories

00:02:56.283 --> 00:02:57.933
were written hundreds of years later,

00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:00.285
and so it's not clear how
much was a true account

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.472
versus how much was made up.

00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:05.869
But beyond Olympias not being Macedonian,

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.353
she is from Molossia, she is
also, according to Plutarch,

00:03:09.353 --> 00:03:12.897
part of the Cult of Dionysus
and she worships snakes

00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:15.215
and potentially even sleeps with snakes,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.252
which is really off-putting
to a lot of the Macedonians.

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:22.169
And so, when King Philip,
in around 337 or 338,

00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:28.085
finds a Macedonian to marry
and her name is Cleopatra,

00:03:29.347 --> 00:03:31.684
not the famous Cleopatra from history,

00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:34.679
we'll talk about her
in a few hundred years,

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.718
but you see here, Philip II,
he takes his seventh wife.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:39.655
I don't list them all here.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:43.338
I only list Olympias here
who he marries in 357 BCE.

00:03:43.338 --> 00:03:47.532
And then they have Alexander,
born Alexander III,

00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:49.577
shortly thereafter the next year.

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:51.714
They also have another
daughter, Cleopatra.

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:53.631
Once again, not the Cleopatra

00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:56.202
when people refer to it in history.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:04:00.369
But then, around 337 or 338
BCE, he takes his seventh wife,

00:04:02.998 --> 00:04:05.733
and this seventh wife
is also named Cleopatra.

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.428
She is Macedonian.

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:11.178
Philip renames her
Eurydice after his mother.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.718
And so, you can imagine

00:04:14.718 --> 00:04:16.660
this is already a little bit threatening.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.684
Because, well, what if
this Cleopatra has a son?

00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:21.725
And she eventually does have a son.

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:24.818
And now, that son would
be pure Macedonian,

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:28.222
as opposed to Alexander,
who is only half-Macedonian.

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:30.317
And this becomes quite pointed

00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:33.379
at the wedding of Philip and Cleopatra,

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.962
the Macedonian Cleopatra,
in 337 or 338 BCE

00:04:38.292 --> 00:04:40.194
when we have this account, and once again,

00:04:40.194 --> 00:04:41.964
take all of this with a grain of salt.

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:43.571
This is an account by Plutarch

00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:46.083
that was written 400 years later.

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:49.804
But Plutarch writes, "At
the wedding of Cleopatra,"

00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:51.395
this is Cleopatra Eurydice,

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:53.882
this is the Macedonian
Cleopatra, the young one,

00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:56.685
"whom Philip fell in
love with and married,

00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:59.779
"she being much too young
for him, her uncle Attalus,"

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.071
and you see him on our
little family tree here,

00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:07.904
this is Cleopatra's Uncle
Attalus, a Macedonian,

00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:11.100
"her uncle Attalus in his drink

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.418
"desired the Macedonians
would implore the gods

00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:16.090
"to give them a lawful
successor to the kingdom

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.740
"by his niece."

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.349
Let me underline that.

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.684
Give them a lawful
successor to the kingdom.

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:22.517
You might be saying,

00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:24.077
"Wait, I thought Alexander
was a lawful successor?"

00:05:24.077 --> 00:05:26.957
And Alexander's probably
thinking the same thing.

00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:28.983
"This so irritated Alexander

00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:31.118
"that throwing one of
the cups at his head,"

00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:34.571
throwing it at Attalus' head,
"'you villain,' he said.

00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:39.126
"'What, am I then a bastard?'
Then Philip," Alexander's dad,

00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:41.554
"taking Attalus' part," so he
wouldn't take his son's side,

00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:43.381
he takes the side of his in-laws,

00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:45.558
"rose up and would have
run his son through,

00:05:45.558 --> 00:05:47.294
"but by good fortune for them both,

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:50.204
"either his over-hasty rage,
or the wine he had drunk,

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:53.490
"made his foot slip, so that
he fell down on the floor.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.493
"At which Alexander
reproachfully insulted over him:

00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:59.662
"'See there,' said he, 'the
man who makes preparations

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:01.658
"'to pass out of Europe into Asia,

00:06:01.658 --> 00:06:05.921
"'overturned in passing
from one seat to another.'"

00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:09.187
So, if this account by
Plutarch is even vaguely true,

00:06:09.187 --> 00:06:11.679
it shows this real tension that is forming

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:14.345
between Alexander and his father.

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:15.880
And it's of course being goaded on,

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.584
or likely to be goaded on,
by his mother, Olympias,

00:06:19.584 --> 00:06:22.220
who was the primary wife for a little bit

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.463
but now she's being pushed aside

00:06:24.463 --> 00:06:27.684
in favor of this Macedonian, Cleopatra.

00:06:27.684 --> 00:06:31.154
And so she actually goes
into voluntary exile,

00:06:31.154 --> 00:06:34.779
Alexander follows her, and
so things are quite tense.

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.350
And they really come to a boiling point,

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.222
or everything gets released
a year or two later,

00:06:41.222 --> 00:06:45.781
when Olympias' other child,
Cleopatra, the other Cleopatra,

00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:47.487
not Cleopatra Eurydice

00:06:47.487 --> 00:06:49.964
and not the famous Cleopatra from history,

00:06:49.964 --> 00:06:53.225
she gets married to Olympias' brother.

00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:55.687
And so, she's marrying her uncle.

00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:58.782
Many strange things happened
like this in the ancient world.

00:06:58.782 --> 00:07:02.304
This is 336 BCE and this
is the famous wedding

00:07:02.304 --> 00:07:06.471
where Phillip II is
assassinated by his bodyguard,

00:07:07.382 --> 00:07:11.269
who was likely Phillip II's former lover.

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:13.998
But once Phillip II gets assassinated,

00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:16.170
you could imagine that many people

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.478
are wanting to have a go at the throne,

00:07:19.478 --> 00:07:24.467
in particular, Alexander,
aided by his mother, Olympias.

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:28.498
And so immediately, there
starts to be a consolidation

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:31.435
of power and the first
way to consolidate power

00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:36.359
is to kill off all of the
folks who might threaten you.

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:38.880
And so Olympias and Alexander,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.149
and many historians give
credit mainly to Olympias,

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:45.261
some say Alexander was
involved more or less,

00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.254
but they go on a killing spree.

00:07:47.254 --> 00:07:50.667
Europa is killed, Caranus is killed.

00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:53.686
These are the children
of Cleopatra Eurydice.

00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:57.661
At the time of this, we're
talking 336, 335 BCE,

00:07:57.661 --> 00:07:59.435
they would have been toddlers.

00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:02.024
They would have been two,
at most three years old.

00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:03.078
They're being killed.

00:08:03.078 --> 00:08:05.330
There are some accounts
that Cleopatra is killed

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.274
or she is forced to hang herself.

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:09.906
There's some accounts that
some combination of them

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.851
are burned alive.

00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:15.514
Alexander goes after
Attalus, the famous uncle

00:08:15.514 --> 00:08:19.918
who insulted him at the wedding
party only a few years ago.

00:08:19.918 --> 00:08:22.570
He kills his cousin, Amyntus,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.991
who might have had a claim
to the throne, other princes.

00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:28.053
So this is this bloody, bloody period.

00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:31.045
So even though sometimes people
glorify some of these rulers

00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:33.950
like Alexander the Great, that
they unified all these people

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.860
and they pushed culture
throughout the world,

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.330
or however you want to talk about it,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.480
they usually come to
power in very brutal ways.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.674
And their conquering is also very brutal.

00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:45.593
You really shouldn't romanticize,

00:08:45.593 --> 00:08:47.244
oh let's conquer other people.

00:08:47.244 --> 00:08:50.575
A war is ugly and when
there's multiple factions

00:08:50.575 --> 00:08:54.101
coming to a throne, that is also ugly.

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:56.908
So, we're shortly after
Phillip II's death.

00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:58.705
Alexander, with the help of his mother,

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.521
is able to consolidate
power within his family,

00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:03.144
really secure his place

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:06.227
as the king of the Macedonian Empire.

00:09:07.442 --> 00:09:08.275
And so the next thing

00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:12.312
is to secure his hold
on the empire militarily

00:09:12.312 --> 00:09:15.142
and you immediately
start having rebellions

00:09:15.142 --> 00:09:17.892
to the North and West of Macedon.

00:09:20.538 --> 00:09:23.702
And so, in particular, the Illyrians,

00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:26.793
which is in modern-day Albania,

00:09:26.793 --> 00:09:28.938
so this region right over here.

00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:30.688
They start to revolt.

00:09:31.715 --> 00:09:34.260
Alexander goes and makes a point

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.760
of sieging the pass at Peliam.

00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:41.982
This is a very strategic
location but while he's there

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:45.197
with his military forces,
so while he's there

00:09:45.197 --> 00:09:47.324
with his military forces, you can imagine

00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:48.916
the other city-states of Greece,

00:09:48.916 --> 00:09:51.915
in particular Athens and Thebes,
say hey now's our chance.

00:09:51.915 --> 00:09:53.665
King Phillip is dead,

00:09:54.523 --> 00:09:57.095
Alexander's out fighting
with the Illyrians,

00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:59.847
let's rise up and regain our independence.

00:09:59.847 --> 00:10:01.383
And many of them thought that Alexander

00:10:01.383 --> 00:10:04.504
might have already died in the
previous military campaign.

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.527
And so you can imagine
they were very surprised

00:10:06.527 --> 00:10:10.448
after Alexander took control
through a siege at Peliam,

00:10:10.448 --> 00:10:12.975
and is able to come down
surprisingly quickly.

00:10:12.975 --> 00:10:15.045
He really makes his soldiers march

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:18.077
hundreds of kilometers
in a matter of weeks,

00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:21.410
to come down and put down the rebellion,

00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:26.323
from his point of view, at Thebes.

00:10:26.323 --> 00:10:29.680
And the Thebans refuse to stop rebelling

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.638
and so in retaliation, Alexander the Great

00:10:32.638 --> 00:10:36.805
completely destroys Thebes,
this famous city of antiquity.

00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:41.591
Only a few decades before this time,

00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:45.094
the leading city-state in all of Greece.

00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:48.790
And so he destroys Thebes,
he enslaves its people,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.843
but that's what allows
him to essentially scare

00:10:51.843 --> 00:10:54.516
the rest of the city-states
of Greece to come in line.

00:10:54.516 --> 00:10:55.854
He hasn't conquered Sparta,

00:10:55.854 --> 00:11:00.168
or his empire hasn't conquered
Sparta, that will happen soon

00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:02.642
but the rest, it really
consolidates his power.

00:11:02.642 --> 00:11:05.225
And now, we're talking 335 BCE,

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.243
he's ready to think about doing
what his father was planning

00:11:09.243 --> 00:11:12.660
and going off and trying to conquer Asia.
