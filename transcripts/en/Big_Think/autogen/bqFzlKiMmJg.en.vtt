but it's like destroying the worker bees

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540
but it's like destroying the worker bees
 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.449
but it's like destroying the worker bees
in a bee colony you you need to kill the

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459
in a bee colony you you need to kill the
 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.220
in a bee colony you you need to kill the
queen bee otherwise she'll repopulate

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
queen bee otherwise she'll repopulate
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.940

the hive and that's that's the cancer

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.190
where we believe we have identified that
and they're working on ways on

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200
and they're working on ways on
 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.490
and they're working on ways on
destroying that key cell that really

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500
destroying that key cell that really
 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.830

different approaches and I think that's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130
different approaches and I think that's
 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.130

the right approach which is to try many

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140
the right approach which is to try many
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.830

down through basically think of it as a
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.539
down through basically think of it as a
software bug and we can now actually go

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549
software bug and we can now actually go
 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.600
software bug and we can now actually go
in and fix that that problem and I think

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610
in and fix that that problem and I think
 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.729
in and fix that that problem and I think
we are going to make great strides in

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739
we are going to make great strides in
 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.229
