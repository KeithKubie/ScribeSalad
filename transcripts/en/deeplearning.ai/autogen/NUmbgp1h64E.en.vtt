error then given that a team of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
error then given that a team of

experienced doctors discussing and
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.050
experienced doctors discussing and
debating can achieve 0.5 percent error

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
debating can achieve 0.5 percent error
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.609
debating can achieve 0.5 percent error
we know that Bayes error is less than

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
we know that Bayes error is less than
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.780
we know that Bayes error is less than
equal to 0.5 percent

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
equal to 0.5 percent
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.059
equal to 0.5 percent
because some system team of this doctors

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069
because some system team of this doctors
 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.300
because some system team of this doctors
can achieve 0.5% error so by definition

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
can achieve 0.5% error so by definition
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.250
can achieve 0.5% error so by definition
the theoretically optimal error has

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260
the theoretically optimal error has
 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.069
the theoretically optimal error has
gotta be 0.5% or lower

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079
gotta be 0.5% or lower
 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.899
gotta be 0.5% or lower
we don't know how much better it is

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909
we don't know how much better it is
 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.600
we don't know how much better it is
maybe there's a even larger team of even

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
maybe there's a even larger team of even
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.130
maybe there's a even larger team of even
more experienced doctors Academy's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
more experienced doctors Academy's
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.869
more experienced doctors Academy's
inventor so maybe it's even more better

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879
inventor so maybe it's even more better
 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.479
inventor so maybe it's even more better
than 0.5% but we know the also error

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489
than 0.5% but we know the also error
 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.839
than 0.5% but we know the also error
cannot be higher than 0.5% so what I

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849
cannot be higher than 0.5% so what I
 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.509
cannot be higher than 0.5% so what I
would do in this setting is use open't

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519
would do in this setting is use open't
 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.500
would do in this setting is use open't
5% as our estimate for Bayes error so I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510
5% as our estimate for Bayes error so I
 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.369
5% as our estimate for Bayes error so I
would define human level performance as

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379
would define human level performance as
 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.160
would define human level performance as
0.5% at least if you're hoping to use

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
0.5% at least if you're hoping to use
 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.069
0.5% at least if you're hoping to use
human level error in the analysis of

a research paper or for the purpose of
deploying a system maybe there's a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
deploying a system maybe there's a
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.839
deploying a system maybe there's a
different definition of human level

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.849
error that you can use which is so long
as you surpass the performance of a

as you surpass the performance of a
 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.520
as you surpass the performance of a
typical doctor that seems like maybe a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530
typical doctor that seems like maybe a
 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.649
typical doctor that seems like maybe a
very useful result to accomplish and

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659
very useful result to accomplish and
 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.080
very useful result to accomplish and
maybe surpassing a single radiologist a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
maybe surpassing a single radiologist a
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.300
maybe surpassing a single radiologist a
single doctors performance might mean

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310
single doctors performance might mean
 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.460
single doctors performance might mean
the system is good enough to deploy in

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
the system is good enough to deploy in
 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.420
the system is good enough to deploy in
some contexts

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430
some contexts
 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.270
some contexts
so maybe the takeaway from this is to be

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
so maybe the takeaway from this is to be
 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.280
so maybe the takeaway from this is to be
clear about what your purpose is in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290
clear about what your purpose is in
 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.379
clear about what your purpose is in
defining the term human level error and

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389
defining the term human level error and
 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.740
defining the term human level error and
if it is to show that you can surpass a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750
if it is to show that you can surpass a
 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.930
if it is to show that you can surpass a
single human and therefore argue for

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940
single human and therefore argue for
 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.819
single human and therefore argue for
deploying your system in some context

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829
deploying your system in some context
 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.119
deploying your system in some context
maybe this is the appropriate definition

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129
maybe this is the appropriate definition
 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.039
maybe this is the appropriate definition
but if you go is the proxy for Bayes

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049
but if you go is the proxy for Bayes
 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.259
but if you go is the proxy for Bayes
error then this is the appropriate

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269
error then this is the appropriate
 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.589
error then this is the appropriate
definition to see why this matters let's

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599
definition to see why this matters let's
 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.080
definition to see why this matters let's
look at an error analysis example let's

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090
look at an error analysis example let's
 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.030
look at an error analysis example let's
say for a medical imaging diagnosis

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
say for a medical imaging diagnosis
 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.939
say for a medical imaging diagnosis
example then your training error is 5%

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949
example then your training error is 5%
 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:01.860
example then your training error is 5%
and your depth error is 6% and in the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870
and your depth error is 6% and in the
 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.509
and your depth error is 6% and in the
example from the previous slide our

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519
example from the previous slide our
 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.970

human level performance and I'm going to

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980
human level performance and I'm going to
 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.899
human level performance and I'm going to
think of this as proxy for Bayes error

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909
 
 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.280
 
depending on what

depending on what
you defined it as a typical doctors

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879
you defined it as a typical doctors
 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.580
you defined it as a typical doctors

performance and experience after a team
 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.379
performance and experience after a team
of doctors you would have either one

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389
of doctors you would have either one
 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.360
of doctors you would have either one
percent or 0.7 percent or 0.5 percent

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.580
percent or 0.7 percent or 0.5 percent
for this and remember also our

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
for this and remember also our
 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.129
for this and remember also our
definitions from the previous video that

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139
definitions from the previous video that
 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.499

estimate laser and training error as

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.029
estimate laser and training error as
calling that a measure of the avoidable

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039
calling that a measure of the avoidable
 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.990
calling that a measure of the avoidable
bias and this as a measure an estimate

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000
bias and this as a measure an estimate
 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.939
bias and this as a measure an estimate
of how much of a variance problem you

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949
of how much of a variance problem you
 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.409
of how much of a variance problem you
have in a learning algorithm so in this

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419
have in a learning algorithm so in this
 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.050
have in a learning algorithm so in this
first example whichever of these choices

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060
first example whichever of these choices
 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.710
first example whichever of these choices
you make the measure of avoidable bias

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720
you make the measure of avoidable bias
 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.510
you make the measure of avoidable bias
will be something like 4% so be

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520
will be something like 4% so be
 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.089
will be something like 4% so be
somewhere between I guess 4% if you take

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099
somewhere between I guess 4% if you take
 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.980
somewhere between I guess 4% if you take
that to 4.5% if you use the 0.5% whereas

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990
that to 4.5% if you use the 0.5% whereas
 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.339
that to 4.5% if you use the 0.5% whereas
this is 1% so in this example I would

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349
this is 1% so in this example I would
 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.379
this is 1% so in this example I would
say it doesn't really matter which of

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389
say it doesn't really matter which of
 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.110
say it doesn't really matter which of
the definitions of human level ever you

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120
the definitions of human level ever you
 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.629
the definitions of human level ever you
use where did you use the typical

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639
use where did you use the typical
 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.089

doctors error or the single experienced

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.070
doctors error or the single experienced
doctors error or the team of experienced

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080
doctors error or the team of experienced
 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.810
doctors error or the team of experienced
doctors ever this whether this is a 4%

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820
doctors ever this whether this is a 4%
 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.420
doctors ever this whether this is a 4%
or 4.5% this is clearly bigger than the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430
or 4.5% this is clearly bigger than the
 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.029
or 4.5% this is clearly bigger than the
variance problem and so in this case you

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039
variance problem and so in this case you
 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.100
variance problem and so in this case you
should focus on bias reduction

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110
should focus on bias reduction
 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.110
should focus on bias reduction

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.540
of avoidable buyers will be I guess
somewhere between zero percent if you

somewhere between zero percent if you
 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.779
somewhere between zero percent if you
use that to 0.5 percent right that's the

use that to 0.5 percent right that's the
 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:00.920
use that to 0.5 percent right that's the

gap between the human level performance
 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.200
gap between the human level performance
in your training error whereas this gap

in your training error whereas this gap
 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.810
in your training error whereas this gap
is 4 percent so this 4 percent is going

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820
is 4 percent so this 4 percent is going
 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.029

use either way and so you know this

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110
use either way and so you know this
 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.420
use either way and so you know this
suggests you could focus you should

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430
suggests you could focus you should
 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.700
suggests you could focus you should
focus on variance reduction techniques

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710
focus on variance reduction techniques
 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.320
focus on variance reduction techniques
such as regularization or getting a

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330
such as regularization or getting a
 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.060
such as regularization or getting a
bigger training setting but where it

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070
bigger training setting but where it
 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.070
bigger training setting but where it
really matters will be if doing training

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080
really matters will be if doing training
 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.830
really matters will be if doing training
error is 0.7 percent so you're doing

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840
error is 0.7 percent so you're doing
 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.310
error is 0.7 percent so you're doing
really well now and you're Jeff error is

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320
really well now and you're Jeff error is
 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.200
really well now and you're Jeff error is
0.8 percent

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210
0.8 percent
 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.830
0.8 percent
in this case it really matters that you

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
in this case it really matters that you
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.310
in this case it really matters that you
use USA for base error as 0.5% because

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320
use USA for base error as 0.5% because
 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.200
use USA for base error as 0.5% because
in this case your measure of how much

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210
in this case your measure of how much
 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.749
in this case your measure of how much
avoidable buyers you have is 0.2% which

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759
avoidable buyers you have is 0.2% which
 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.719
avoidable buyers you have is 0.2% which
is twice as big as your measure for your

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729
is twice as big as your measure for your
 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:49.060
is twice as big as your measure for your
own variance which is just 0.1% and so

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070
own variance which is just 0.1% and so
 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.469
own variance which is just 0.1% and so
this suggests that maybe both of the

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479
this suggests that maybe both of the
 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.909
this suggests that maybe both of the
bodies and their ins are both problems

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919
bodies and their ins are both problems
 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.710
bodies and their ins are both problems
but maybe the political bias is the

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720
but maybe the political bias is the
 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.090
but maybe the political bias is the
bigger of the problem and in this

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100
bigger of the problem and in this
 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.670
bigger of the problem and in this
example 0.5% as we discuss on the

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680
example 0.5% as we discuss on the
 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.800
example 0.5% as we discuss on the
previous slide was the best measure of

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810
previous slide was the best measure of
 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.320
previous slide was the best measure of
Bayes error because the team of human

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330
Bayes error because the team of human
 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.089
Bayes error because the team of human
doctors can achieve that performance so

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:04.099
doctors can achieve that performance so
 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:06.400
doctors can achieve that performance so
if you use 0.7 as a proxy for base error

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410
if you use 0.7 as a proxy for base error
 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.080
if you use 0.7 as a proxy for base error
you would have estimates in the boydle

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090
you would have estimates in the boydle
 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.480
you would have estimates in the boydle
buyers as you know pretty much zero

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490
buyers as you know pretty much zero
 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.790
buyers as you know pretty much zero
percent and you might have missed that

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800
percent and you might have missed that
 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.710

you actually should try to do better

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720
you actually should try to do better
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.820
you actually should try to do better
on your training set so I hope this

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830
on your training set so I hope this
 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.279
on your training set so I hope this
gives a sense also of why making

gives a sense also of why making
 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:22.900
gives a sense also of why making
progress in machine learning problems

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910
progress in machine learning problems
 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.240
progress in machine learning problems
gets harder as you achieve well as you

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250
gets harder as you achieve well as you
 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.550
gets harder as you achieve well as you
approach children level performance in

careful about estimating base error you

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330
careful about estimating base error you
 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.149
careful about estimating base error you
might not know how far away you are from

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:37.159
might not know how far away you are from
 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.460
might not know how far away you are from
Bayes error and therefore how much you

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470
Bayes error and therefore how much you
 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.899
Bayes error and therefore how much you
should be trying to reduce avoidable

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:40.909
should be trying to reduce avoidable
 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:45.129
should be trying to reduce avoidable

single typical doctor H is one percent
error and it might be very difficult to

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:50.419
error and it might be very difficult to
 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:51.820

training set even better and this

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:55.009
training set even better and this
 

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.800
