00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.565
 I want you to stop the video 

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:05.480
 and first consider how much 27 is minus 1, 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.340
 then how much is 27 minus 10. 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.578
 Maybe it's too easy for you, 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.898
 but let's look at it from a point of view 

00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:16.318
 in the order of digits. 

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:18.669
 Take 27, at 27 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.620
 we have 2 in the order of the decimal, which means 2 tenths. 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.332
 And we see them here, two groups of 10. 

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:27.612
 And then we have 7 in the order of units 

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:30.445
 and we see these 7 units here. 

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:32.253
 I will now draw one, 

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:35.340
 I take out one, or else one unit, 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.210
 because here is the order of units, 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.568
 so I will scratch one. 

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:40.626
 I scratch one this way. 

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:42.223
 And how much remains after? 

00:00:42.223 --> 00:00:44.266
 I still have two tens, 

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.900
 so I will write 2 in the order of the decimal, 

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.591
 I still have 2 in the order of the decimal. 

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.814
 How many units do I have now? 

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:53.989
 There were 7 units, I scratched one 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.665
 and now there are 6 units, 

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:03.421
 so 2 decades and 6 units, that's 26. 

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.785
 Now let's think about 27 minus 10. 

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:10.595
 Again, this is 27 (2 tens and 7 units) 

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:13.241
 and now we will not bring forth units, 

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:15.663
 but we will draw 1 tenth. 

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:20.497
 Just remember that 10 is actually a dozen. 

00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:22.243
 It sounds like I repeat the same thing, 

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:23.437
 over and over, 

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.930
 but I really want you to grasp the meaning of the place. 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.827
 This is the order of the decimal and we have a number 1 there, 

00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:32.140
 so I'll get 1 decimal and 0 units. 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.210
 Let me scratch a tenth. 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.623
 To scratch a tenth, maybe I'll scratch this one. 

00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:40.316
 I will do it with a color that looks better. 

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:43.530
 Here, I scratched her. How old are you? 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.690
 How many dozens? 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.121
 Now I have only one complete group of 10, 

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.493
 i. I have one tenth, she is here in the order of the dozen. 

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:54.413
 How many units do I have? 

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.615
 I still have 7 units, 

00:01:56.615 --> 00:02:00.892
 so I still have 7 in the order of units. 

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:05.975
 Therefore, 27 minus 10 is 1 tenth and 7 units, or 17. 

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:08.298
 Here is another possible way of thinking, 

00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:09.770
 maybe it's your decision 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.286
 from the beginning of the video. 

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:13.410
 If we subtract a unit, 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.567
 we decrease the order of units by 1, 

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.888
 therefore we get 26 from 27. 

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.732
 But if we get 10, 

00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:22.042
 then we reduce the order of the decimal places by 1, 

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.850
 therefore instead of 2 we will have 1 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.309
 in the order of the tenths. 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.581
 From 27 we get 17. 

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:30.231
 Here the order of the units does not change.
