00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.180
I think to be better prepared for
fundraising process every founder need

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.320
to speak to other founders that
have gone through the process.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.020
Learn from them about their experiences,
the do's and

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.380
don'ts of what worked and what didn't.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.630
It's really about having a few things
ready when you kick of the process.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.110
A, you need the materials.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.110
You need the deck, you need any Excel
financials, everything that you can

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.960
that sort of you can share with
an investor at the right time.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.010
Second, you need to practice your pitch.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.880
The pitch is not 20 minute conversation,
it's really being able to tell your

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.010
story succinctly, in an effective way
and for that you need to practice a lot.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.670
And finally, you need to really
figure out who it is you're pitching.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.560
What type of investors
are you looking for?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.840
Who are they?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.800
Will they invest in
your type of business?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.800
Do they have the passion for it?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
All investors don't
invest in everything,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.020
you have to find the right ones for
you, for your business.
