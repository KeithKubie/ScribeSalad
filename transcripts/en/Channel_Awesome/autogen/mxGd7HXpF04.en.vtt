the most part again the complications of

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:36.570
the most part again the complications of
 

01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:39.050
the most part again the complications of
the plot are really I don't know I don't

01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060
the plot are really I don't know I don't

but then again maybe that's the point of
 

01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:46.610
but then again maybe that's the point of
it maybe it is meant to just exist in

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:46.620
it maybe it is meant to just exist in
 

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:48.320
it maybe it is meant to just exist in
this world where this extreme simplicity

01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:59.540
don't know if that necessarily makes a
classic but it definitely makes an

01:18:59.540 --> 01:18:59.550
classic but it definitely makes an
 

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:01.760
