Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Janet. Boom. Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio on our subject right now is cities. So far we've tried to pin down the character of a place with math or with a story or with some music.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:14          But it's like trying to take a snapshot of something that's growing and changing all the time and that feeling that skip had up on the rooftop, like the city with breathing. Maybe

Speaker 3:          00:26          the city really is like a living thing. Well, yes. In some ways. That's exactly right. The evolve, the grow. Think about it as Jeff West, every day, every minute, incomes, energy, food, trucks, water people, out goes garbage ideas, song stories, people energy in, energy out, energy, energy, Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:49          That's just what a city needs to do. Such Jeff port metabolize food, so to speak, because without that, organisms and sitters and so on, we'll simply do carry. So how does a city stay alive? What does it really take for a city to grow? Well, that question got me thinking about New York and led me to a place I've been wanting to go for a while.

Speaker 4:          01:18          [inaudible] to hear the reverb a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Where are you underground? Oh, 100 feet under

Speaker 4:          01:26          Brown [inaudible] so this is the sound of one of New York City's water tunnels. I'm standing in it. It's exactly what you would imagine. It's about nine feet wide, nine feet up, perfectly polished cement. And uh, it seems to just go forever.

Speaker 5:          01:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:50          so this is basically a, like you might call it a smaller artery inside the city's circulatory system. When this is online, in a couple of months, it will pump up to 290 million gallons a day.

Speaker 2:          02:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          02:07          something like that, which is an awesome thought in the literal sense. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:12          it's a, when you walked through the streets in Manhattan, this is Catherine Mallen from the Department of environmental protection. These water tunnels are anywhere from 200 to 800 feet below your feet. They just there and they're silently there. And when you turn on your tap,

Speaker 1:          02:26          can you take a drink? You are basking in a daily convenience that is born from blood, sweat, and death. To explain. You really have to go back to a time when there were no tunnels. This would be 1790 1800 or so around that time says historian Diane Galicia in New York's population was booming. It tripled in 20 years. And you suddenly at 100,000 people all getting their water from the same spot, a large freshwater pond called the collect than they had pigs running around by the hundreds and the chamber pots out in the streets and there were livestock and Lower Manhattan. At the time people had cows for milk. And so when they died, they had to do something with them. So often she says they'd throw their dead cows and everything else in the pond, the same pond they were drinking from, right? No, not surprisingly. As the city grew, people got sick in 1798 there was this yellow fever epidemic, killed a couple of thousand people and cholera and typhoid city officials were like, this has to change.

Speaker 1:          03:36          And uh, as if to accentuate the point in 1835, it was this huge fire. The fire department rushes out to put out the fire. But they can't. It was in December and the rivers froze and they couldn't get water to the fires. If you don't have water to fight the fire, the city burns down. It's pretty simple. Yeah, 700 buildings. So that's our starting point in New York City that could not grow. And by the way, the guy we just heard John Chick Donahue, he's the sand dog. So part of the long line of guys who blasted New York out of its poopy pawn phase and into its future. You ask your question why? Why are you guys cold? Sandhogs why wouldn't you be calling tunnel blasters or earth movers or something that's more, do you have any idea where that name came from? Yeah, it comes from the dictionary really, and I loved the look on people's faces when they asked me that and I, that's the answer. It's described in Webster's dictionary as a laborer who digs or works in sand originals sandhogs with the soft ground guys compressed there. That's where he didn't know to backup for a second when the city decided to scrap the pond in favor of clean water from upstate. If faced a couple of challenges, and this is also true. When they decided to build a subway system, namely nature, like how do you for example, build a tunnel under a river? Well they were sandhogs, Jamie, Dan, they did

Speaker 7:          04:55          little eat dog with what we call a muck sticks, shovels on the ribbon, 50 60 a hundred feet under the bottom of the river. Men with shovels, excavating ground. That's Nick's socal. I'm a tunneling engineer. Generally it's a dark, dank

Speaker 1:          05:12          place. Now the obvious engineering problem is that the river bottom, which is now above their heads is soft sands and silts and gravels. How do you keep that from not falling on your head? That's when a compressed air started being used. The basic idea says, nick, is it these huge pumps would basically pump air into the tunnels at such pressure that it would basically push the ceiling up. Exactly. So the mud doesn't cave in on the compressed there holes that thing from collapsing in on. Usually the engineers on the shore had to get the pressure just right says chick. Cause if they didn't, you get this absolutely terrifying situation that is maybe the best cocktail party story ever. We used to give an award, we haven't given it many years. We call it

Speaker 7:          05:58          the Marshall may be award

Speaker 2:          06:00          hello,

Speaker 7:          06:01          that were doing one of those tunnels. Brooklyn. The men are weapon to face in a tunnel and digging away very suddenly

Speaker 1:          06:12          is a blowout in the face of the wallet. Puncture hole develops tiny at first, but it quickly becomes bigger and bigger until it's the size of sort of like an eye. Then a whole head and all the compressed air rushes into that.

Speaker 4:          06:23          Oh, it would be like if you shot a hole through an airplane. Alia with shawl hats are flying into this whole lanterns shovels than a guy goes into the whole a guy. Yeah, a human being into the hole and another guy, boom. Then a third, the third guy must've been the luckiest sand hog in the world. This is an article from the New York Times as I struck the mud,

Speaker 1:          06:47          it felt as if something was squeezing me tighter than I'd ever been squeezed before. We blew through all at 60 feet and walked through the Redmond.

Speaker 7:          06:56          Yup.

Speaker 1:          06:57          To the surface. The pressure

Speaker 4:          07:00          blew him right up into the, yeah, you tell me. I was thrown about 25 feet above the water when I came out, but I don't remember that. That's remarkable. Anything

Speaker 7:          07:12          back down and landed right alongside a police boat in the one in the world. So they took him to clean them up. He went home. He came to work the next day. That's why they gave him the award. That's why the award is now. I'm not kidding you.

Speaker 1:          07:33          In the early days, no one kept track of how many people died building New York's tunnels the number. It's probably in the thousands. So wait, this, this right here, this plaque that we're looking at, this flack was a donated. This is Richie fits in and sees the current head of the San hugs union and we're standing in front of a big stone plaque with two dozen names

Speaker 7:          07:53          in memory of all the, uh, people that we lost in tunnels in New York City since 1970. You know, since we started keeping records,

Speaker 1:          08:01          small little photos commodity. Later he showed me a picture, which really underlined the point. It's a picture of him on his first compressed air job. Oh Wow. Look at that. This is myself. He's 19 he's huddled with five other guys and they're in this crowded tunnel and they're all black, was said, and he points to each guy in turn

Speaker 2:          08:19          dead, dead, dead, dead,

Speaker 1:          08:23          had cancer still alive, still alive. If you ask any of the sandhogs why they do this, mostly they'll tell you what we, we've got to, the city can't grow without its tunnels, but you also get answers like this from chick. If he says, when you're down there and it's pitch black and you're just walking away

Speaker 7:          08:42          and yeah, 600 foot under Manhattan, you're approximately 30th street or something, you're in the middle of the greatest city in the world. Nobody even knows you exist. Nobody has it. Nobody has a clue.

Speaker 1:          08:56          It just

Speaker 2:          08:58          beautiful.

Speaker 1:          09:02          It's just that it's a weird place. It's like being on a planet somewhere. He says when he's literally in this rock that is half a billion years old, he sometimes feels

Speaker 2:          09:14          very humble.

Speaker 1:          09:17          Yeah, we're in the middle of the art. Then you know how this is. You want to see nature. It is a romantic way of saying it. A, the human reality of it is, here's Richie's taken. Remember when you were a kid and they used to give you the Anne farms in the bay and farms were big. We are ants. Ants is so fricking many of them that if you got a squish a few and if they got to use each other to step over each other to, to, to, to keep that whole thing, that's it. That doesn't sound very grand the way you're putting it like that. It's reality. Our job is to conquer nature. He says, plain and simple. We're builders. Human beings are builders and collectively there's nothing that we can do.

Speaker 2:          10:04          Hmm. How often?

Speaker 4:          10:11          October 14th, 1842 oh, it was a huge celebration. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers. Line, Broadway was firing of cannons and the ringing of Church bell fireworks even, and at the end of it all says Diane, everybody gathered in City Hall Park and the turned a big fountain on and

Speaker 2:          10:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          10:36          water shot 50 feet into the air. New York City. We'd never be the same. No can finally be a city. But here's where you start to wonder a little bit about the real legacy of cities. What you see almost immediately after this moment, according to Diane, is that water usage skyrocketed. Suddenly you had indoor plumbing. All the new buildings were being outfitted with water closets and kids were playing in the hydrants all day long. And to make a long story short, just 10 years later, the city is out of water again. So they get to build more tunnels and then more. And if you follow the water and those tunnels, backup state, you see that the city is gobbling up reservoirs, one after another, dozens, which made it had to kick people off that land, well then called eminent domain. Their villages would have to be bulldozed and burned cemeteries fruited do you see what's happening? I mean you could see this city that we live in as a kind of monster. It's just always hungry, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. And

Speaker 1:          11:33          because like, like there is another logic available here. Like if you took all the people in New York City, all those New Yorkers, you know, if, if you had every inhabitant in New York City suddenly left New York City and moved to small towns all across America, you would need a ton of resources to make that possible. That's Jonah lira again, by the way. So in a sense, New York City saves lots of forests, saves

Speaker 3:          11:54          lots of water. And the reason why, well that takes us back to Jeff and Lucia's ideas about cities. Well I suppose, cause it all started years ago, Jeff at the time was studying this time was living things. Let's go back to biology for a moment. He looked at a huge variety of creatures and for each one he collected data from its metabolic rate to the length of it, say how quickly it breathes. And he discovered something kind of fascinating about creatures as they grow bigger and picker. If you double the size of an organism, you double the number of cells that need to be sustained. You would therefore expect that the energy you need to supply would double. You've doubled the number of customers, so to speak. Yeah, yeah. No, no. That is not the case. Instead of doubling, it needs less energy per unit cell to sustain the whole organism.

Speaker 3:          12:47          So there is a kind of notice way. Second, that means that the, that the cell is somehow doing more with less. Right. Does that also mean though that an elephant cell somehow is more efficient than mouth cell? That's correct. Huh. And Jeff says, the way they do that is pretty simple. They just move slow. I process energy at a slower rate. So if you take a mouse cell, a cell that lives in a mouse and does its work, brings in resources, spits out the waste, bring in more resources, spits out the way it does this to a particular

Speaker 8:          13:17          beep.

Speaker 3:          13:22          But now says Jeff, if you listen to an elephant cell,

Speaker 8:          13:25          okay.

Speaker 3:          13:27          [inaudible] means no

Speaker 8:          13:29          poem. It's moving

Speaker 3:          13:33          obviously slower. So it's using less energy in a given moment, which makes it efficient. What does that have to do with cities? Turns out cities work kind of the same way in cities. You see the same kind of efficiency when it comes to infrastructure, electricity, length of roads, lengths of pipes, lengths of electrical, cables, saline, how much gas is consumed is the point. The bigger the city, the less roads you need per capita. What is per capita mean anyways, per person, per person, the less electrical cable lines you need per capita, the less gasoline stations you need per capita, et Cetera, et cetera. So every unit of pipe carries more water and more sewage. Every line of electrical wire carries more. It did. Jeff, does that mean then that if, uh, if I moved to a bigger and bigger city, do I in a sense become greener the bigger the city I live in?

Speaker 3:          14:29          Yeah, that's a very interesting question. And this is where Lewish and Jeff, I think the case is still a little bit out. And even Jonah, it gets complicated when you ask, are people more or less efficient? This is when everybody starts to throw in all of these caveats and qualifications, all the variable qualifications and ambulations and prognostications. Distillations. Let me just tell you what I think. I think you'd better. All right. We all love to talk about how green we are when we live in cities. This is something everybody in the city talks about, right? Because we are, because we take the subway and the bus, we don't draw and driving. Right. The most energy consuming thing. Listen to me, the analogy that you just gave me, it does not work. Okay. You said that cells as they go from small bodies to big bodies slow down.

Speaker 3:          15:16          Yeah. Well cities, the opposite happens. Of course as cities get bigger, each individual unit in that city moves faster. So thank you Jonah. We speed up. It's true. We learned this earlier and this is not trivial. Okay. Cause as we speed up, we bump into more people. We have more ideas, we invent new things, we want more things. We want more or more of your tastes. New Ideas. More interactions. More human friction. More. More choices. Yeah, a better life. That's what a city is all about. I, is there anything wrong with that? No, not at all. But there's all I'm saying is there's a cost to it that we don't acknowledge. Western Betancourt did this back of the envelope calculation where it's long been known that a body at perfect rest, if you lie on your bed all day in a coma, you will consume and buy 90 watts of electricity.

Speaker 3:          16:01          That's your basal metabolic rate. If you're a hunter gatherer living in some tribe in New Zealand, you will consume about 240 watts of electricity every day. Energy just simply to stay alive, plus the energy you need to hunt them. However, if you are living in America, the wattage required to drive your car, run your computer, make your clothes, air conditioning, being able to go to movies on and on and all the various things that constituted our life. If you add all those up, your lifestyle requires about 11,000 watts of electricity every day. So that's, that's more energy than a blue whale requires. Now, some of you listening, particularly if you're engine deer, you may think, wait a second, why are you calling these watts? When his power through his system power through a human, call them jewels. It's the technically correct word. And then you'd be right, wouldn't you?

Speaker 3:          16:48          But the numbers are the same. So let's, we'll just call them lots. So one way to look at what cities have enabled us to do is basically live like 300 and million blue whales in America. Are you sure that cities are causing this development? That it begins and ends with cities and you can't assign it all to cities. But that psychology of wanting more, that's a city psychology. It's why people come to cities. And then the lifestyle that grows up around that gets broadcast out on TV and radio shows and movies, which are city industries to the country. And if you just take a historical look at this, like the last 300 years have seen more and more consumption, right? Yeah. And that trend says Jones, it's grown in neat parallel with the growth of cities. Cities have enabled that kind of growth. Even if you guys are a right, we know that half the planet already is living in cities, 80% of America. So yes, there are more people. I'll agree with that. More choices, asking for more consumption, more energy, more, more, more, more, more. Even if that's so cities, because they are ingenious

Speaker 9:          17:50          and they come up with all these new ideas. Maybe cities will solve the problem right now. Jets, someone somewhere in Calcutta is about to invent the super light bulb elevator telephone pipe that will make it possible for another 200 trillion people to live together in peace, harmony, and beauty until the next round. All right? You go ahead and claim to that optimism and you of course can go hang yourself in corner, so we'll be right back. I remember crawling. That's dad. He was Radiolab.
