Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And I am now living
in London. Besides popping on over to Disneyland

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.660
Paris, I've also been looking at DONGs: Things
you can Do Online Now, Guys. For instance,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.200
because I'm now in Britain, my team has changed
for clickclickclick.com. The site recognizes

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.750
what country you're in and then asks you
to click as many times as you can. Earn turbo-clicks

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.870
to get two minutes of auto-clicking and when
you're done, submit to support your country.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.750
These were the standings when I played.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.540
This website takes a look at your physical
and moral strength and then calculates approximately

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.350
how many 5-year-olds you could take in a fight.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.190
Gorillablackdog recommended Drinkify. Tell
it a musician and it will give you some tunes

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.220
and a drink recommendation. Now, we all love
soundboards, but when it comes to a button

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.920
that makes noises - 10, 100, 1,000 - it's never
enough. Luckily, MyInstants contains literally

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.500
more than 3,000 sound clips available with a click.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.940
IFlores105 showed my MyWorldMapper, which
is amazing, it's full of maps of the world

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.970
where regions are physically bloated or shriveled,
based on statistics. This one, for instance,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.070
allows you to visually compare how many people
live in cities on Earth.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.080
Themediversion's Image Mosaic Generator is
nice. Upload any image you want and it will

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.060
spit you back thousands of images which, from
afar, are your original.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.060
Whoops, are you trying to break the law?
Well, don't do anything until you check out the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.929
Ransom Note Generator. This way, your messages
will be anonymous and needlessly frightening.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.639
If you're like PumpkinHead5150 and you want
to waste time playing free games but also

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:59.639
read some great literature, play Silent Conversation.
Here, you are the "I" floating above text.

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.829
Touch every word while maneuvering around
dangerous words.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.749
Aether is an art game where you travel by
using your tongue like a grappling hook. As

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:14.760
you ascend away from a planet, gravity changes,
and you swing through space, fall to other

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.129
worlds, and figure out their puzzles. 
Once you do, the planet regains its color.

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.540
In Prior, you're a square who has forgotten
everything - who you are, who your family is.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.379
All you can hope to do is read scraps of paper
about you to learn your story and how to

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.079
even play the game.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.899
Concerned Joe is like being the bus from Speed.
If you don't move, your health falls and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:48.000
the narrator, well, he's ridiculous. Concerned
Joe was submitted by SporkMurderer. Now, she

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.420
might murder sporks, but the internet loves
them, according to WhatDoesTheInternetThink.net.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.579
The site searches a word or phrase you enter
and evaluates the positivity, or negativity,

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.849
of what's being said about it on the web.
And look, sporks tend to be discussed with

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.459
quite a bit of mirth.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.099
Super Pig. Angelperson0 submitted this.
A game of dark rooms where bacon won't help,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.400
but stumbling onto spikes means that your
blood fluorescently splatters, giving the

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.369
next pig an idea of what's ahead. You've only
got so many pigs, so be careful.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.860
Now, if you'd rather splatter something more
humane, be like PryoStar and use JacksonPollock.org.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.960
Every time you click, the color changes. Not
cute enough? Well, Purrgirl234 says Cornify.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.719
Drag this little thing right hear to your
bookmarks bar and BAM. Now, whenever you're

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.019
on a site, you can click it to add unicorns.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.719
And here's a game that's like an almost never-ending
brick breaker, except the colored pieces you

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.189
break off become balls you can keep using.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:59.230
Now, ChocolateMilkMonster served us up a Puzzler.
You want all the balls to be the same color

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.970
and when you click one it turns a quarter-turn
clockwise, and if its blue lines meet any

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.630
of those of balls around it, that ball will
become the same color and also turn a quarter-turn.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.370
Set off small chain reactions and play the
end carefully. VoilÃ¡. But in case of emergency,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.050
call the EmergencyYodel.com.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.900
Finally, Reddit user iamcogita created this
YouTube educational mural, it's incredible.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.780
So many of my friends! You can click their
heads to see their channels, or, go straight

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.450
to youtube.com/edu to find others like us,
especially the ones who don't appear on camera,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.710
who probably made themselves harder to draw.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.520
Stay saucy.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.540
And as always,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.860
thanks for watching.
