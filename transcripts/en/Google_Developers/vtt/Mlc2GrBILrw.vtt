JEREMY WALKER: Hello,
and welcome to

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.540
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.510
We have a pretty exciting
show today.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.190
But before we get started, I
want to introduce myself.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.040
I'm Jeremy Walker.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.990
I'm a developer advocate
for the YouTube APIs.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.930
Then we have Jeff Posnick
visiting from New York.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.790
He's my counterpart
out in New York.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.040
I think he's on mute.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.050
JEFF POSNICK: Hello
to everybody.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.970
Hopefully, you can hear me.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.350
JEREMY WALKER: Yep.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.040
JEFF POSNICK: And thanks for
being on the show, to the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.670
folks that you're about to
introduce from WeVideo.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.580
I'm looking forward to it.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.980
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.640
So we're really excited to have
some of our partners here

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.005
from WeVideo.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.000
We have Krishna Menon,
who's the CTO.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.820
And then we have
Mark Floisand.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.330
MARK FLOISAND: That's right.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.290
JEREMY WALKER: I always worry
I pronounce that wrong--

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.710
who's from business
development.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.760
So we're really excited.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.590
We've been partnering with you
guys for quite a while.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.239
We worked with you guys at I/O.
And we've done some other

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:05.750
recordings.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.300
But we haven't had you
on the show yet.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.550
So we're really excited to
finally get you here.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.630
MARK FLOISAND: And we appreciate
being here.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.990
Thank you.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.980
KRISHNA MENON: Thank you.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.280
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.320
Well, let's jump into it.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.730
We want to cover a couple
general questions first.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.420
And then we have a demo for
everyone out there.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.350
So that'll be pretty exciting.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.090
And then we'll get into
the technical details.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.330
So why don't you tell me a
little bit about the history

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.450
of WeVideo.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.440
MARK FLOISAND: So WeVideo
was founded last year.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.420
And we're based up
in Palo Alto.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.910
We're practically neighbors.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.030
The company actually is based
on a platform of technology

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.930
that was originally conceived
in Scandinavia

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.330
about five years ago.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.190
And that technology platform was
originally very much aimed

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.100
at schools.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.840
So we had about 400,000 school
kids hammering away at this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.340
cloud-based video and
collaboration environment.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.350
And WeVideo was conceived to
take that fundamental concept

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.260
and that code and really,
frankly, democratize video--

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.290
to enable us to reach many,
many more people globally.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.919
The company was founded over
here in Silicon Valley.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.060
We received a round of funding
earlier this year and have

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.990
been growing since.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.300
So we're really focused on
trying to just make video

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.615
editing much easier to do and
available for everyone.

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:21.080
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.130
So democratizing
video editing.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.010
MARK FLOISAND: Yeah.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.680
You think of, obviously, the
huge reach that YouTube has

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.390
with regard to video viewing.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.720
Everyone that's online has
now seen video online.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.880
And as a media category, it's
obviously growing like crazy.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.010
What's lagged behind that is
people's ability to actually

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.340
edit their own video.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.540
And so what we see is this huge
demand for people who've

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.730
captured a lot of video, who are
used to sharing and seeing

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.140
video, but are perhaps
frustrated by how difficult

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.630
it's been in the past to edit
that video and make it really

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.510
compelling.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.270
And so we think that there is
a great opportunity to make

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.450
editing a key part of the value
chain, if you like, and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.335
make it easy for people to edit
their work, then share

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:09.010
it, which makes it much more
compelling, much more

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.070
interesting for people to
view, and overall drives

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.080
better content.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.950
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.100
And to be clear for everyone out
there, it's not like you

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.490
need plug-ins or anything
like that.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.430
You can just go to your site
and start using it as if

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.260
you're using an installed
view editing suite.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.760
MARK FLOISAND: That's absolutely
true, Jeremy.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.790
As a cloud-based video
platform, one of the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.320
advantages we bring is that
people don't need bespoke

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.740
downloadable software.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.840
And a key part of, I think,
frankly, our success together

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.720
and working with yourselves
has been we were able to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.490
effectively embed that
capability into YouTube itself

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.150
or into one of the properties
that enables people to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.955
actually work on editing our
files from within the YouTube

00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:55.560
creator program.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.720
So what that's done is I think
it's made it very accessible--

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.120
the editing component of it--

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.460
and really helped people to
improve the quality of their

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.970
content without needing
downloadable tools, complex

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.570
software editing, and so on.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.150
And some of the things that
we'll show everybody today are

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.580
how we've evolved from that.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.250
Because I think when we started,
we had a relatively

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.209
sophisticated platform.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.470
And what we found, certainly,
in talking to our customers

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.350
was it's still hard.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.070
So someone who's never
done any video

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.950
editing, it's still hard.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.370
And so we've made it easier.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.200
We've continued to strip away
at the editing process, to

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.630
narrow down to the core essence
of what people need to

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.010
do to produce great content and
to be able to tell their

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.810
stories easily.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.730
And that's what's
embedded in our

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.570
implementation with YouTube.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.970
JEREMY WALKER: Well, I'm
always excited to--

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.210
it's really neat to hear about
it, but I always like to see

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.160
it in action.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.630
And I know you guys have a new
list of features that you

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.990
launched recently that I'm
hoping you'll talk about.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.850
So why don't we--

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.530
Krishna, if you want to jump
into the demo, and then you

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.860
can talk about the
new features.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.380
And then we can talk about
the technical stuff.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.820
KRISHNA MENON: All right.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.780
I'll walk you through the demo,
but I just wanted to

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.810
emphasize something that Mark
said, which is what we learned

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.020
was that a number of users who
came to our site had actually

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.230
no video experience.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.250
So they had to do
a video project.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.600
They had content.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.930
But they didn't understand what
video editing was about.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.090
In response to that is
what we came up with.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.520
And what I'm going to
show you today is

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.880
our most recent offering.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.970
We just launched it
a few weeks ago.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.350
It's a storyboard version.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.580
So it's intended for
novice users.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.500
It's intended to still create
great quality videos.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.330
So even though the user
experience is simplified, we

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.840
still want to give them
the ability to

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.210
create great videos.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.420
And a term I'm going to talk a
little bit about today is what

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.210
we call adaptive user
experience.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.930
So while you can start off
with this, we also have

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.250
versions for you that, as you
graduate and as you become

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.540
better at it and you want more
control over your final

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.140
output, we have more advanced
versions for

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.440
you to start using.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.580
And the data between all the
versions is going to change a

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.416
little And I'll show you that
as I do the demo today.

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:07.850
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.310
So it's like an easy version
to start, and as you get

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.050
better, you throw more stuff
in there for them to

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.840
use to refine it.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.180
KRISHNA MENON: That's exactly
what I [? meant. ?]

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.570
But all the data's
interchangeable.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.180
So you can take the data from
one version to another without

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.960
any loss of fidelity.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.930
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.460
KRISHNA MENON: All right.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.100
So what you're seeing on my
screen right now is our

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.695
storyboard version.

00:06:26.695 --> 00:06:28.250
So this is the latest editor.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.560
On the left hand side
is all my content.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.030
So assume I just came back from
a skiing trip and I've

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.210
got some content.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.030
And at the bottom of the screen
is the storyboard.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.530
So that's where, actually, I'm
going to put together my

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.140
storyboard from this location
I just took.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.150
Now, the way we bring content
into the system is either I

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.530
can upload from my hard disk, or
you can also bring it from

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.620
all these different sources.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.430
So obviously, Google Drive
is a big part of ours--

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.920
Instagram, Facebook.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.670
So you don't have to download it
from those sites, bring it

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.290
to your desktop,
and upload it.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.482
We can directly connect to those
sites to bring it your

00:07:02.482 --> 00:07:03.920
content [? within. ?]

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.710
So I'm going to put together
a simple storyboard.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.560
I'll go through it.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.440
So I'll go through and
pick a few clips.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.670
So I'll drag this one in here.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.510
And I'll pick a couple more.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.130
And then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to do some

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.090
editing to make it better.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.790
And I'll pick another
one here.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.610
So what this also allows me to
do is I can easily drag and

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.200
drop, move things around.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.750
So as I reorder things
in my storyboard,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.930
I can move it around.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.220
I'll just pick one more clip
here to finish it.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.850
So now I've got a little
storyboard that I've put

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.570
together in a few seconds--

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.150
nothing sophisticated.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.050
I've got a little title slide
and I've got a few clips.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.030
And I can play--

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.670
it's still not edited.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.020
I haven't done anything
with effects.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.530
I don't even know what
effects are.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.200
Now, some of the concepts are
available to everybody.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.970
So if I wanted to just
give it a title, I'll

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.680
call it Skiing 2012.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.870
And then, also, on
the different

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.810
clips, I can add titles.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.800
So I can put a caption that
says, Getting There.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.570
And also, I could
tag a friend.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.230
So the tagging a friend-- again,
the idea here is that

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.750
if you tagged a friend and you
publish it, then we notify

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.300
your friends that you were
tagged in this video.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.370
So there's a social element
to the editing, also.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.920
And I'll just go ahead and add
a few more captions here.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.110
Oops.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.539
Again, the concepts I'm showing
you here are concepts

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.865
most users are used to.

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:45.240
And I'll add one more here.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.920
So now, if I just play these,
you can start seeing--

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.610
I'll just go to the beginning
and show you

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.630
what it looks like.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.960
So I've got the titles.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.830
And now, what we get to is the
interesting part of it.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.710
So now, I've put together a few
clips and I've got some

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.460
titles and captions.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.960
And we have a concept called
Styles and Themes.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.140
So the idea here is that we
want to give you create

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.110
quality video without you
understanding what

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.260
it takes to do that.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.890
So if you don't understand
effects, if you don't

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.200
understand audio, if you don't
understand transitions, we've

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.280
done that for you.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.780
So I'll pick a theme here.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.570
I'll pick the vintage theme,
use it, and let

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.370
me just play that.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.040
At this point, what it's doing
is it's downloading the

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.250
resources for that theme.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.250
Now, for us, everything
is real time preview.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.313
So you want to be able to make
changes and see it right away.

00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:45.566
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:46.816
JEREMY WALKER: Oh, cool.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.140
KRISHNA MENON: So it's doing
the transitions.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.010
It's done some color
correction.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.590
It's added audio to it.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.140
And basically, [? I ?]

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:57.410
[? say, ?]

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.040
[? you know what, ?]

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.950
I don't mind that.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.030
Let me try a different one here
and I'll just go ahead

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.574
and try my 1960s theme.

00:10:03.574 --> 00:10:04.500
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.440
MARK FLOISAND: Shows
your age, Krishna.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.180
KRISHNA MENON: Yes, and I'm
dating myself here.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.372
So again, instantaneous--

00:10:11.372 --> 00:10:14.130
an important thing in creating
is you want quick iterations.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.840
You don't have to
wait and render.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.170
So I can see something
right away.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.232
And we have that we have 20 plus
teams right now that you

00:10:22.232 --> 00:10:23.740
can go and try out with it.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.770
And then the final step is, once
I'm done with that, I can

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.070
go ahead and publish it.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.510
And this is where the YouTube
integration comes in.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.210
So I can set the resolution.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.210
I can mark it as private.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.320
And I can just go ahead
and publish it now.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.135
So what this is going to do is
where we do the integration

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:38.810
with the YouTube APIs.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:44.240
And the first part of this
is that we'll take your

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.450
storyboard.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.160
And it's all server-side
processing.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.250
So we've got a rendering farm
on the server and a

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.520
cloud-based infrastructure
that's going to take that

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.940
content, take the high
resolution versions of it,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.800
render all the effects, and
create a single output file

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.840
out it, high quality, and then
we take that file and publish

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.480
to the YouTube channel
for that person.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.390
So that's the process.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.820
So what you've seen here is,
basically, in a few minutes,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.470
I've put together a good
quality video.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.120
JEREMY WALKER: Wow,
that's neat.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.220
And so this is for the
beginners, and

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.880
then, as they start--

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.960
well, actually--

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.660
KRISHNA MENON: So let
me just show you.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.020
So I've done this now
and I want to say,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.050
OK, you know what?

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.900
I actually want to go ahead,
I want to do a

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.850
little bit more editing.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.920
I'm actually not a novice.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.145
So I can now switch over
to the timeline mode.

00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:30.870
So this is the next level
of the editing.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.310
Notice now, the look
is different.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.160
It's not as-- the storyboard
version.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.420
It's showing me a lot more
elements of the timeline,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.160
including what effects
are applied and the

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.830
audios and all that.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.220
So if I wanted to now go ahead
and add a voice over or change

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.340
the effect-- and if I said, you
know what, I actually like

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.530
this theme, but I want to use
a different effect, I can do

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.360
that here easily without losing
all my previous work.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.270
So again the idea of adapting
the user experience--

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.910
that's our philosophy in
developing applications.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.330
JEREMY WALKER: Wow, that's
really neat.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.520
OK.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.980
So even if you are experienced
but you have a limited amount

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.240
of time, you can just pick a
theme, throw together your

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.550
clips, and then you just
export to YouTube.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.150
KRISHNA MENON: That's
exactly right.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.980
And for us, it's not only having
versions for different

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.490
levels of users.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.020
Our vision is to have this
running on all devices so it's

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.170
basically web platforms,
tablets, smartphones.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.460
And those are coming
in the future.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:23.740
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.375
So you guys have something
planned for mobile, then?

00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:28.830
KRISHNA MENON: Yeah.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.090
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.780
That's good to hear.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.625
MARK FLOISAND: Especially
for Android.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:30.880
JEREMY WALKER: Android.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.060
[LAUGHING]

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.670
JEREMY WALKER: That's what
we like to hear.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.370
Well, why don't we dive into
the technical side?

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.370
So do you want to talk a little
bit about how the

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.110
integration went about, at least
with YouTube APIs and

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.310
then maybe what language
you used?

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.910
KRISHNA MENON: All right.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.620
So we used Version
2 of the APIs.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.040
Version 3 came out recently.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.300
And we're going to look into
that starting in January.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.850
As I mentioned, for us, the
integration was about once we

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.755
do the rendering in the cloud,
we take that file and we use

00:13:00.755 --> 00:13:02.070
the YouTube upload API.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.180
So it's basically the data
APIs we're using.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.370
We're not embedding the
YouTube player.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.440
We're using the data API
to push the file up.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.720
Our back end is all written in
Java, so we used the Java

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:17.430
client libraries for the data
API to integrate the upload.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.070
Besides the upload, we also
do check the status.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.810
We add developer tags so we
can search for WeVideo.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.150
We want to get the URL back
and email it to the user.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.680
And we're also looking to
tie into analytics.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.370
So we want to give the user
information on how many views

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.430
did their creation get?

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.950
And then eventually tie it to
things like gamification--

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.640
create a video that gets
10,000 views or

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.110
something like that.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.190
So that's the level of
integration we've done.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.010
The integration itself was
very straightforward--

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.620
no issues at all.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.660
And we're looking forward
to what the

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.420
Version 3.0 has to provide.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.812
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:13:55.812 --> 00:13:57.420
Oh, go ahead.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.310
JEFF POSNICK: Sorry.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.795
You mentioned analytics.

00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:02.770
Have you had a chance to look at
our new standalone YouTube

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.440
analytics API also?

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.790
KRISHNA MENON: We've started
looking into it, but the idea

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.950
there is that the information we
want is what is the views,

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.805
how many views did a piece
of content get

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:13.190
and things like that.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.750
But we started looking
into it.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.220
We'll have integration on
that coming up soon.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.610
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.290
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah,
that'll definitely

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.400
make your lives easier.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.950
How you did it before with the
old APIs, you actually had to

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.310
download a zip file and
go through CSVs.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.270
Now, you'll get all the
information correctly with

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.370
just the information you need.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.720
KRISHNA MENON: So for us, our
users, since we're a creation

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.480
platform, YouTube is the most
popular destination site for

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.540
most of our users.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.560
JEREMY WALKER: Oh, that's
good to hear.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.920
Yeah, that's good to hear.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.270
Yeah, we definitely, when you
talk about the API, we put you

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.520
guys in the creation category,
because you create new content

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.720
that we add to YouTube.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.700
Was there anything, I guess,
when you're working with the

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.820
APIs that you saw that
was counterintuitive?

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.150
KRISHNA MENON: No, no.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.766
It was relatively
straightforward to use.

00:14:57.766 --> 00:15:01.070
For what we're trying to do,
it was not a problem at all

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.850
adopting it.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.591
So it was very straightforward.

00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:05.300
JEREMY WALKER: And I know we
talked a little bit about

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.970
this, but are there features
you're hoping

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.960
to see in the future?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.880
I know you guys mainly do
uploads, so your use case is

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.030
taken care of, but I always just
like to ask that question

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.244
in case you can think
of something.

00:15:20.244 --> 00:15:21.550
KRISHNA MENON: Not currently.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.680
Mostly, as you mentioned, it's
all about upload and

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.060
publishing.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.520
And for that, we're
pretty good.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.740
Once we get the analytics,
that'll be the

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.310
last missing piece.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.230
I think at some point, if you
started doing where we're

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.250
taking input from YouTube, then
there might be some other

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.710
requests coming up.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.030
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.320
Well, great.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.640
MARK FLOISAND: That's actually
a good point, because I think

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.420
one of the things we've heard
from customers that have

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.810
published and then have got
volume and good SEO, inbound

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.890
traffic coming to a particular
site or particular file is

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.545
what they do if they want
to make changes to

00:15:52.545 --> 00:15:53.480
it once it's live?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.680
And so I think as we go deeper,
looking at how we can

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.450
tackle that problem for people
rather than editing or

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.990
republishing, wiping out their
traffic and starting again,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.550
that's probably an interesting
area to explore over time.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.750
MARK FLOISAND: And one more
thing I wanted to show you on

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.420
my screen here is that--

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.380
I wanted to show you what the
finished output looked like.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.960
You saw the preview
on the screen.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.180
So this is going to be
what the finished

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.980
output looks like.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.925
And so this is something that
was created on WeVideo.

00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:23.764
Let me just go to the beginning
of the file.

00:16:23.764 --> 00:16:27.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.810
KRISHNA MENON: So this
was created using

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.060
our storyboard version.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.371
It's the 1960s theme.

00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:42.621
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:50.870
KRISHNA MENON: So hopefully,
that gave you an insight into

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.680
what WeVideo does.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.720
JEREMY WALKER: Well,
that's great.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.600
Well, thanks for coming on.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.390
For everyone out there, we have
an open question forum.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.370
So go to that link.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.530
It's right below in the
description if you want to ask

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.980
a question on Google
Moderator.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.329
And we can answer that.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.650
In the meantime, Jeff, we
always do Stack Overflow

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.869
question of the week.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:15.339
So I'll hand it over to
Jeff to go over that.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.500
JEFF POSNICK: Thanks
so much, Jeremy.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.460
So a couple interesting
questions to choose from this

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.040
week, and I wanted to focus on
one of them asked by a Stack

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.280
Overflow user named Chris.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.550
And this focuses on the
aforementioned YouTube

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.230
analytics API.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.960
So Chris, to distill his
question into a sound bite,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.560
was curious about how quota
worked in the analytics API.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.220
Specifically, he went into some
real details about how

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.030
many types of various calls you
can make before running

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.540
into quota limits.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.270
So my response--

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.130
to elaborate a little
bit on what I

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.730
posted on Stack Overflow--

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.410
is that, first of all, we're
not really giving specific,

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.420
hard numbers.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.160
We're not saying this particular
type of YouTube

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.480
analytics call costs 10 quota
units in this type plus 15.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.035
And you have 10,000 per day
or something like that.

00:18:14.035 --> 00:18:16.790
We just need to maintain a
little bit of flexibility

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:21.850
there in terms of adjusting
quota costs in the future or

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.760
adjusting the daily limits
in the future.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.930
And once we document this
specific quota costs for this

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.090
specific type of call, we really
lose that flexibility

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.150
in changing things.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.250
So apologies right off the bat
that we're not completely

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.970
transparent about that.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.860
But that being said, we do have
some general guidelines

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.790
and some things that we make
clear from the documentation.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.070
Chris linked to the
documentation and I'll post a

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.870
link out to the specific part
that I'm talking about into

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.730
our Google+ page after the show
so folks can go and refer

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.700
back to it.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.270
But basically, what we say in
the docs is that the relative

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.290
quota costs of analytics
API calls depends

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.990
mainly on two things.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.930
First of all, it depends upon
whether you're using a

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:13.700
dimension of a video, which
tends to be a little bit more

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.820
expensive, or if you're using a
different report dimension,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.780
which tends to be a little
bit cheaper.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.650
And second, it depends upon
the number of metrics that

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.120
you're requesting.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.080
So you can think of it as a
little bit of a matrix where

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.010
you have maybe a dimension of
some sort of time period and

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:32.950
only one metric.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.390
And that's probably going to
be your cheapest call.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.330
But then if you started saying,
I want a mention of a

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.260
video and I want three different
metrics returned in

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.260
that report, I don't want to
say it's going to be three

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.700
times more expensive or five
times more expensive.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.040
But it's going to be
more expensive.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.810
So that's the overall
guidelines.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.450
And then it gets into the
question of what should you as

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.970
developers do to code
defensively and to deal with a

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.825
little bit of uncertainty about
what the actual quota

00:20:04.825 --> 00:20:05.160
limits are?

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.560
How should you write code
in that kind of reality?

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.110
I think the most important thing
to keep in mind-- and

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.730
this applies also to the
data API, not just

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.310
the analytics API--

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:20.130
is that you really should
not be afraid of quotas.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:25.070
Don't be afraid to make a lot
of requests against the API

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.396
and potentially bump into
any quota limits.

00:20:28.396 --> 00:20:32.050
It's very tempting to try to
scale things down on your end

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.240
and to put in I want to sleep
for one minute in between I

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.430
every call I make.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.070
But I wouldn't really
recommend that.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.460
I'd recommend make as many
calls as you need to make

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.030
against the API and wait
until we start

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.880
returning back quota errors.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.740
And at that point, you should
adjust your traffic pattern.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.490
We're not punishing
you when you do

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.330
encounter a quota error.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.980
We don't disable access to the
API or anything like that.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.850
We're just saying, hey, you're
going to need to slow down the

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.790
rate at which you are
making calls.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:10.170
So what we recommend in the docs
is doing as much traffic

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.640
is you need to make.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.270
And then when you do get
a quota error, start an

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.160
exponential back off pattern
where you basically will wait

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.970
for a certain period of time in
between receiving a quota

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.840
error and then making
your next request.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.970
If you do happen get another
quota error back when you make

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.580
your next request, then you
wait twice as long as you

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.110
previously did, and then try
again, and so on and so forth.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.310
It might be reasonable to start
with waiting a minute

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.500
after you get back your first
quota error and then retrying

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.110
after a minute.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.330
And then retrying after two
minutes and four minutes and

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.520
so on, up to someone limit.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.360
Probably, if things don't work
after pausing for 16 minutes,

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.970
at that point, maybe you should
give up, because maybe

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:56.330
you've pushed--

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.200
I don't want say pushed
your luck too much.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.570
But actually, I've been playing
around with the

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.040
analytics API a little bit and
playing with seeing how the

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.830
quota limits are returned
from the API.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.690
And we actually do distinguish
between short term quota

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.250
limits and the daily limit
that you've run into.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:18.020
So you will get a different
error back from the API if you

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.050
run into one of the
short term or more

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.080
recoverable quota errors.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.780
And in that case, you should
do the exponential back

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.810
[? offs. ?]

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.730
And then there is a separate
error saying, hey, you've

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.810
reach your maximum number
of API calls that

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.530
you make per day.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.480
If you get that error back,
then at that point, you do

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.235
need to give up.

00:22:34.235 --> 00:22:38.350
But the bar for running into
that daily limit is really

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.050
rather high.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.010
And it might be adjusted
even higher in

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.860
future if we need to.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.490
So that's a general philosophy
to have.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.780
Don't be afraid of
quota errors.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.030
Make the requests you
need to make.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.710
Obviously, don't make
extra requests.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.630
Don't just throw traffic
and at the API

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.830
servers for no reason.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.835
But if you do need to make
these requests, go

00:22:58.835 --> 00:22:59.940
ahead and make them.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:06.380
So I'll post some links to our
Google+ page plus YouTube Dev

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:12.010
and share those things I've been
talking about during the

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.900
show so people can refer
back to them later.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.450
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.070
Yeah.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.510
People always ask that
when I go to events.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.500
What I do about the
quota stuff?

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.560
And like you said, we're not
there to penalize you.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.510
Use as much as you need
and then do back off.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.740
But with the new APIs, like you
pointed out, only request

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.370
the information you need in
parts, whether that's on the

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:40.100
data API or just the metrics
you need in analytics API.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.830
Because if you don't need,
it's costing you.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.180
And you don't want it to cost
you if you don't need it.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.110
So that's always important.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.030
Well, thanks for that.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.080
So we actually only have
one question so far.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.080
And it's for me.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.165
JEFF POSNICK: Do you
want to answer your

00:23:55.165 --> 00:23:56.055
own question, Jeremy?

00:23:56.055 --> 00:23:56.500
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.180
Is Google Developer
Relations hiring?

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.080
Yes, we are.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.910
JEREMY WALKER: Go to
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.880
We have a bunch of open
positions, if you are

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.280
interested, as a developer--

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.180
not necessarily here in the
States, but anywhere.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.595
Let us now.

00:24:13.595 --> 00:24:14.570
Check out that page.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:15.450
We're always interested.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.255
And we have a shortage of
people, so you definitely

00:24:18.255 --> 00:24:20.190
should that out.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.480
But I wanted to thank you
guys for coming on.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.390
It was great demo.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.370
It's really interesting.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.300
And it's neat to see
the new features.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.970
And as I said, we're always
happy to have you guys on

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.030
because we've worked with
you for so long.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.430
And we had you on at
Google I/O. So

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.010
thanks again for coming.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:38.560
KRISHNA MENON: Thank you.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.470
MARK FLOISAND: We really
appreciate it.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.190
Thank you very much for
having us today.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.510
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.720
Well, thanks everyone
for attending.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.170
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.010
I think maybe a programming
note--

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.450
we're going to be off for
the next two weeks.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.050
We're not going to be doing our
weekly Wednesday show due

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.080
to various holidays.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.750
And I think our next is what?

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.310
January 9 maybe?

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.050
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, it's later
in January, I know.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.170
So that's probably right--

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:04.936
January 9.

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:05.790
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.290
So sorry, everybody I know.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.540
You'll have to go back
and watch some.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.290
Actually, you know what?

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.670
Maybe we'll post on our Google+
some of our older

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.780
episodes from the archive that
folks might find interesting

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.425
to watch during our hiatus.

00:25:22.425 --> 00:25:23.910
MARK FLOISAND: A year-end
outtakes.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.280
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.410
JEFF POSNICK: Indeed.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.210
Indeed, yeah.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.870
JEREMY WALKER: Well, thanks
again for coming.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.310
And Jeff, thanks for joining
us from New York.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.920
MARK FLOISAND: Absolutely.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.170
KRISHNA MENON: Thank you.
