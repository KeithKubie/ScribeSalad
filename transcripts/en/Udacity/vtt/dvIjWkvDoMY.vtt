00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.810
Because Neanderthals lived outside of Africa, and we have

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.020
fossils of them living in Europe, Middle East, and

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.940
Asia, we would not expect to see any Neanderthal

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.560
sequences in genomes that show their main heritage in

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.060
Africa. And we can even see here, my Neanderthal

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.010
ancestry is about 2.7% And I have a European

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.210
background. But if we go to our example that

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.210
we've talked about a bit more, Roy King, who has

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.050
amazing chromosomes from all over the world, he shares

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.070
about 50% genetic ancestry from Africa. And you can

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.760
see his Neanderthal percentage is much lower, just as

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.380
we'd expect form someone with a significant African heritage.
