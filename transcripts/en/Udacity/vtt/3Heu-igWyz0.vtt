00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.160
&gt;&gt; But most traits aren't like eye color right?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.070
&gt;&gt; Right. Most complex traits are actually result

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.800
of multiple genetic interactions with an environmental influence.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.880
&gt;&gt; Well going back to our nature and nurture phrase, how do

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.720
we know how much of a trait is from nature or from nurture?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.580
&gt;&gt; Well it can be difficult to make a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.520
blanket statement about how much is nature and how much

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.320
is nurture. Because there can be a lot of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.720
variability from individual to individual, but what we can do

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.140
is look at all the differences in a group of individuals and how much

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.640
of that is caused by a genetic influence. This is what we call heritability.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, heritability we talk a lot about that in psychology.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.470
&gt;&gt; Sure, heritability is measured on a scale from zero to

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.020
one, where zero means that variation in the trait is not

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.570
due to genetics at all, whereas a one indicates the variation

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.800
of the trait can be explained completely by genetics. For example,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.470
when people talk about the heritability of

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.300
a disease, they're referring to how much

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.030
of differences in risk for that disease

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.905
across the population is due to genetics.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:03.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's not the same thing as saying how much of a trait is genetic?

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.410
&gt;&gt; Exactly those are two different things, whether or not

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.220
a trait is caused genetically versus whether the variability in

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.820
a trait is due to genetics. Let's go and take

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.320
a look at our example of height again. Suppose we're measuring

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.230
height in two different parts of the United States.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.060
Now, let's say in the first population everyone has

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.260
a similar economic status. And thus a very similar

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.140
lifestyle. But in the second population, people vary a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.200
lot in their economic status and their resulting lifestyles.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.775
How would the heritability of height compare between population

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:41.800
one and two? Do you think it would be the same? Do you think it would be higher

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.110
population one? Or do you think it would be higher in population

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.090
two? Remember, heritability is measured on a scale from zero to one.
