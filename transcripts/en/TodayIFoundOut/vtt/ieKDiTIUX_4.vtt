00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.330
Why is Mustard is Yellow?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.251
A common misconception is that yellow mustard
(the kind you put on your hot dog) is yellow

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.390
because of the mustard seed.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.650
This is not true.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
The mustard seed is a dullish gray, brown
color.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.869
The striking, bold yellow color actually comes
from the rootstock of a plant called turmeric.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.829
Turmeric, native to the rainy humid tropical
forests of South Asia, has been used as a

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.330
natural food dye for centuries.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.780
The turmeric plant is harvested annually for
its rhizome, or rootstock.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.489
The rhizome is boiled, dried out, and ground
into a powder.

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.829
This powder is then mixed with mustard seed
powder, vinegar, water, salt, and voila, you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.609
got yourself traditional yellow mustard!

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.199
Turmeric is also a common ingredient in many
South Asian and Indian dishes.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.370
It provides an earthy, slightly bitter taste
that complements many curries.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.420
In addition, it isn’t just the rhizome powder
that is used for cooking, but the whole plant.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.420
The leaves of the turmeric plant are used
in many Indonesian recipes due to the plentifulness

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.420
of the plant in the region and the sharp flavor
of the leaves.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.420
Throughout the generations of living off of
the land in the region, people have discovered

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.420
that turmeric possesses many medicinal qualities.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.420
Traditionally, it has been used an anti-inflammatory,
antiseptic, and a guard against liver damage.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.420
In fact, the American Cancer Society has officially
stated that curcumin, the active ingredient

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.420
in turmeric, is an antioxidant and has shown
in preliminary studies to kill cancer cells

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
in lab samples.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.420
Plus, it has been found to reduce the growth
of several different forms of cancer cells

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
and tumors in lab animals.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.420
The United States Institute of Health rated
turmeric as “possibly effective” for Osteoarthritis

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.420
and upset stomach, with research still pending.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.420
Turmeric began to make its way west during
the 12th and 13th centuries.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.420
In medieval England, turmeric was often called
“Indian saffron” since it was often used

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.420
as a cheaper alternative to the much more
pricey saffron.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.420
In 1280, Marco Polo wrote in his memoirs that
turmeric was a vegetable “with the properties

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.420
of saffron, though it is not really saffron”.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.420
In the 18th century, turmeric was beginning
to be grown in Caribbean countries, where

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.990
the climate was similar to South Asia.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.760
Jamaica became a big grower of turmeric and
to this day, rhizome powder is still used

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.240
in Jamaican cuisine.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.070
Getting back to the mustard of it all, mustard
itself dates back to the ever-enterprising

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.070
Romans.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.950
They would combine the seeds with unfermented
grape juice to create what they called “burning

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.460
juice”, or mustum ardens in Latin (hence
our now familiar English word “mustard”.)

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.590
The popularity of mustard grew in Rome and
swept into their conquered territories.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.530
In the Burgundy region of France, most famous
for its wines, a little town called Dijon

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.980
embraced mustard and began making its own
variety, substituting the unfermented grape

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.530
juice with vinegar.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.550
To this day, Dijon, France is still known
as the mustard capital of the world for its

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.680
unique and sharp tasting Dijon mustard.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.869
Yellow mustard didn’t come along until the
turn of the 20th century.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.460
In 1884, two brothers by the name of Robert
and George French bought a flourmill in Rochester,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.520
New York after their previous flourmill upstate
burned down.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280
They named the mill the R.T.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.280
French Company.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.440
When Robert passed away, George’s other
brother, Francis, came aboard to help the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.440
family business.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.950
In 1904, George began experimenting with “creamy
salad mustard”.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.750
He added turmeric to the traditional recipe
for added presentation and color.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.020
Yellow mustard premiered at the St. Louis
World’s Fair in 1904 as a condiment to put

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.060
on hot dogs to great fanfare.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:03:06.180
The rest, as it were, is mustard history.
