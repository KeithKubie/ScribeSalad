00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:06.689
 Let us solve some tasks in order of action, but in order to save time I will solve every second example 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.204
 I will do these tasks here: 

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:10.555
 We start with 1b 

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:11.246
 1b here 

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:21.749
 There are 2 plus 7 by 11 minus 12 divided by 3 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.783
 Just remember that first is what you have in brackets. 

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:24.732
 braces 

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:28.367
 So you have your braces-- Let me write them this way. 

00:00:24.763 --> 00:00:29.145
 Your highest priority will be brackets, 

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:33.779
 after that, the gradation, 

00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:38.532
 then multiplication and division and then 

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:41.001
 addition and subtraction 

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.521
 Let us remember this and get caught up 

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.197
 with the sequence of operations 

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:47.802
 For order - no brackets here, 

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.652
 there is no degree, so the priority goes to multiplication 

00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:51.339
 and division. 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.604
 You can watch this in the following way 

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:57.112
 We do our multiplication before we make a collection or 

00:00:57.112 --> 00:00:59.500
 subtract and do our division before 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.932
 to perform any collection or subtraction 

00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:06.900
 Task 1b is precisely that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.548
 brackets are just to confirm your intention, 

00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:13.428
 that I will accomplish my multiplication and division 

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:17.147
 before I do the collection and subtraction. 

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:27.254
 So 7 by 11 is 77, then 12 divided by 3 is 4 

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:34.953
 And the rest of the task was 2 plus that thing, which is 77, minus that. 

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:37.779
 And here, since everything is gathering or subtracting, 

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:40.388
 let's just go from left to right. 

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:48.183
 2 plus 77 is 79, minus 4 is equal to 75 

00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:52.073
 So 1b is equal to 75 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.315
 Let us decide 1d 

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:57.260
 This is a pleasantly complicated task. 

00:01:57.413 --> 00:01:59.111
 So 1d. 

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:04.945
 You see 2 by 3 plus 2 minus 1 

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:14.295
 Close the two brackets, all on 4 minus 6 plus 2 

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:18.559
 minus 3 minus 5 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.043
 Let's see if we can do that a little. 

00:02:21.043 --> 00:02:23.215
 As we have said, brackets have the highest priority. 

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:25.653
 So let's fix the brackets first. 2 minus 1. 

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:28.811
 2 minus 1 is only 1. 

00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:31.096
 3 minus 5 

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:37.354
 This makes minus 2 or, I have to say, negative 2. 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.231
 6 plus 2 is 8. 

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:43.174
 Now let's keep looking at the brackets to see 

00:02:43.312 --> 00:02:45.573
 where can we simplify things 

00:02:45.773 --> 00:02:48.709
 We have these braces here 

00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:50.847
 So 3 plus 1 will now be equal to 4 

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.935
 Actually, let me transcribe this. 

00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:59.637
 We get 2 across this expression, 3 plus 1, that's 2 in 4. 

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:01.525
 That, right there, is 4. 

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:04.480
 All this on 4 minus 8, this is negative 4. 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.256
 This is exactly what is negative here 4. 

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:09.517
 And then minus this negative 2. 

00:03:09.517 --> 00:03:12.558
 So minus negative 2. 

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:18.518
 2 at 4 e 8, so all this is simplified to - minus 

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:20.685
 from negative is exactly plus, 

00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:21.879
 the negatives are destroyed. 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.207
 Thus, the whole is simplified to 8 divided by a negative of 4, 

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:30.920
 which is negative 2, plus 2 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.001
 . 

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.775
 Which is equal to 0. 

00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:37.246
 So this big, complicated thing is simplified to 0. 

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:39.439
 Now let's solve 2b 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.574
 2b. 

00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:45.157
 Let me clear a little space here. 

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:50.431
 I will leave the operations priorities there. 

00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:57.103
 Let me delete that, and let me wipe it out 

00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:01.721
 Okay, 2b 

00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:02.333
 2b. 

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:04.439
 Calculate the following 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.509
 expressions involving variables 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:06.594
 Clear enough. 

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:13.310
 They wrote 2y of a square and say x is equal to 1, which is inappropriate, 

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:16.348
 because there is no x, y is equal to 5. 

00:04:16.378 --> 00:04:19.839
 If y is equal to 5, this can be recorded 

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.222
 like 2 by 5 per square 

00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:29.548
 And notice, I put brackets there. 

00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:31.333
 I could write this as 

00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.682
 2 by 5 per square. 

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:35.687
 And if you look at the order of operations, gradation 

00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:38.313
 has a higher priority than multiplication. 

00:04:38.313 --> 00:04:39.760
 That is precisely why I automatically put my mind 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.427
 these braces. 

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:45.912
 First we will graduate. 

00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:51.666
 That's 25, so we got 2 by 25, which is 50 

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:58.091
 So the answer to 2b is equal - in a darker color - that 

00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.013
 is equal to 50 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.685
 Let us decide 2d 

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:06.571
 . 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.518
 We have given a square minus x, all square. 

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:17.362
 x is equal to 2, and y equals 1. Well, we only substitute. 

00:05:17.362 --> 00:05:19.890
 Where we see y, we write in his place 1. 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.749
 So this will become 1 per square x minus square - 

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:27.856
 Excuse, minus x, not x square. 

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:28.929
 We put only x there. 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:30.676
 Here is where we will replace with 2. 

00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:32.835
 And then all this in a square. 

00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:37.563
 Well 1 of a square is again 1, so it's 1. 

00:05:37.624 --> 00:05:43.110
 1 minus 2 is negative 1. 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:51.245
 Then we will have to square up our negative 1, 

00:05:51.568 --> 00:05:54.490
 so this will be equal to positive 1. 

00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:58.413
 And this is equal to 1 Negatively negative is positive. 

00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:54.614
 . 

00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:58.528
 Okay, let's solve 3b 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.561
 3b. 

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.437
 The next tasks 

00:06:03.437 --> 00:06:04.622
 I will write them in yellow. 

00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:06.241
 Decide the following 

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.658
 expressions involving variables. 

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:09.719
 All right. 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:10.710
 The same idea. 

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:14.281
 So they give us 4x on 9x per square 

00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:19.033
 Oh, actually I said I'd decide 3b, and I started 3a. 

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:19.958
 So we start. 

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:29.086
 We have z of a square on x plus plus x square 

00:06:29.132 --> 00:06:31.589
 on x minus y. 

00:06:31.712 --> 00:06:35.927
 And they tell us that x is equal to 1, y is equal to 

00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:38.968
 negative 2 and z equals 4 

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:40.932
 Let's first make our replacement. 

00:06:40.932 --> 00:06:43.612
 Thus, z the square is the same thing as - I will write it in 

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:54.155
 different color - 4 per square on x, 1, plus y, negative 2, 

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:59.564
 plus x per square, this is 1 per square, on x, 

00:06:59.703 --> 00:07:02.033
 which is 1, minus y. 

00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:04.792
 y is negative 2. 

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:09.794
 So this will become equal to 4 per square is 16, on 1 plus 

00:07:09.794 --> 00:07:16.521
 negative 2, it's 1 minus 2 - it's just negative 1 - plus 

00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:20.685
 1 per square, which is 1 per 1 minus negative 2. 

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:24.191
 This is the same as 1 plus 2 

00:07:24.345 --> 00:07:25.868
 That is, 1/3. 

00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:28.840
 So it will be divided into negative 1. 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:36.725
 We could record this as equal to negative 16 plus 1/3. 

00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:40.665
 Now - if we want to collect them as fragments, we must 

00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:42.734
 to put a common denominator 

00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:48.388
 Negative 16 is also equal to minus 48 on 3, negative 48 to 3 

00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:54.019
 If you split 48 to 3 you will get 16, and I just 

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:55.419
 I keep the negative sign. 

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:59.108
 And then you add to that plus 1/3. 

00:07:59.108 --> 00:08:02.924
 We have a common denominator now, 3. 

00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:08.802
 Negative 48 plus 1 equals negative 47 

00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:15.417
 So our answer is negative 47 on 3. 

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.793
 Task 3d. 

00:08:17.793 --> 00:08:24.267
 . 

00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:25.414
 Such a situation. 

00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:36.124
 x squares minus z squares on xz minus 2x in z minus x. 

00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:40.672
 x is equal to negative 1, z equals 3. 

00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:43.726
 Make our replacements. 

00:08:43.726 --> 00:08:45.748
 This is x square 

00:08:45.932 --> 00:08:49.160
 Which is minus 1 per square 

00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:52.294
 minus z of square, means minus 3 per square 

00:08:52.294 --> 00:08:56.220
 All this on x at z. 

00:08:56.343 --> 00:09:05.196
 x in z is minus 1 by 3, minus 2 by x, x e 

00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:12.677
 negative 1, z minus x, 3 minus x. 

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:17.095
 x is negative 1 minus x. 

00:09:17.095 --> 00:09:20.371
 Wherever we see x, we put minus 1 

00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:21.676
 This will happen - remember, first count 

00:09:21.676 --> 00:09:22.794
 degrees. Well, 

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:24.281
 the braces first, then the grading. 

00:09:24.281 --> 00:09:30.745
 So we have a negative 1 per square, that's exactly positive 1. 

00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:32.594
 3 per square, this is positive 9. 

00:09:32.594 --> 00:09:35.209
 And our numerator became 1 minus 9 this is minus 8 or 

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:37.110
 negative 8. 

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.557
 and then our denominator. 

00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:44.990
 Negative 1 in 3 is negative 3 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.555
 And then let's calculate our brackets here. 

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:50.821
 We have 3 minus negative 1, this is exactly the same as 

00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.491
 3 plus plus 1. 

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:55.410
 So here it is 4. 

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.805
 Or our denominator has become negative 3 minus 2 by 

00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:03.077
 negative 1 in 4, this is negative 8 

00:10:03.077 --> 00:10:07.245
 Minus negative 8. 

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:09.990
 Minus than negative is the same as plus. 

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:20.863
 Thus, the whole becomes negatively 8 on negative 3 plus 8 

00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:24.282
 negative 3 plus 8 is 5 

00:10:24.282 --> 00:10:27.377
 Or this is negative 8/5, minus 8 on 5. 

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.313
 Okay, let me clear a little room so we can 

00:10:29.313 --> 00:10:32.520
 to see this task well. 

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.420
 Let me clear everything up here 

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.217
 . 

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:40.366
 These are interesting now. 

00:10:40.366 --> 00:10:42.608
 Task 4: Put brackets in each expression so you get it 

00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:44.015
 true equality. 

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:46.068
 Charming. 

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.879
 Okay .. 

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:48.185
 Thus, 4b. 

00:10:48.401 --> 00:10:56.034
 We have 12 divided by 4 plus 10 minus 3 by 3 plus 7 

00:10:56.034 --> 00:10:57.866
 is equal to 11. 

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.159
 Let's see what happens if we just follow the order of order 

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:04.223
 of operations, and I will calculate in mind because 

00:11:04.223 --> 00:11:05.702
 this will require some experimentation. 

00:11:05.702 --> 00:11:09.390
 Oh, yeah, this 4b, 12 divided by 4 - 

00:11:09.452 --> 00:11:11.602
 yes, this is the task. 

00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:14.554
 So, if we divide 12 to 4 first, we'll get 3 

00:11:14.554 --> 00:11:16.769
 So let me write it in yellow. 

00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:22.602
 If we apply the order of operations, it will be equal to 3 

00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:24.604
 This is going to be 9. 

00:11:24.604 --> 00:11:31.121
 So we will get 3 plus 10, which is 13, minus 9, 

00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:35.969
 13 minus 9 is 4, plus 7 

00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:39.504
 In fact, that seems true. 

00:11:39.504 --> 00:11:40.643
 Let me make sure I thought it right. 

00:11:40.643 --> 00:11:43.031
 3 plus 10 - OK, it seems true. 

00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:44.578
 So we really need only to apply the sequence of operations. 

00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:46.347
 So it looks like a real equation. 

00:11:46.347 --> 00:11:52.506
 If you think 12 divided by 4 plus 10 minus 3 by 3 plus 

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:55.061
 7, I think it's going true. 

00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:56.142
 Let's confirm. 

00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:57.365
 Let's make sure I do not make a mistake. 

00:11:57.365 --> 00:12:03.536
 12 divided by 4 is 3 plus 10 minus, 3 by 3 is 9, plus 7. 

00:12:03.536 --> 00:12:09.788
 This is equal to 13 minus 9 which is equal to-- all of this 

00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:17.087
 is equal to 13 minus 9, is equal to 4, plus 7 is, actually, 

00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:19.888
 equal to 11. 

00:12:19.888 --> 00:12:22.256
 That was not too bad. 

00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:23.748
 In fact, it was not necessary to place brackets here 

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:24.896
 make the expression true. 

00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:25.932
 Just follow the order of action. 

00:12:25.932 --> 00:12:27.559
 But putting these braces there, they do it a little 

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:29.279
 easier to read. 

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:31.339
 Let's try 4d. 

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:35.941
 . 

00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:42.978
 12 minus 8 minus 4 minus 5 is equal to minus 8 

00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:44.615
 First, let's see what happens if we apply it 

00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:46.780
 the order of action. 

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.223
 If we apply the order of action directly, we will calculate this 

00:12:48.223 --> 00:12:52.182
 4 at 5 first, which will give us 20 there. 

00:12:52.182 --> 00:12:53.528
 And then we will have 12 minus 8, which is 4. 

00:12:53.528 --> 00:13:01.366
 And then we count 4 minus 20 - No, that's not right 

00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:05.594
 That would give us a negative 16. 

00:13:05.594 --> 00:13:07.824
 So that's not true 

00:13:07.824 --> 00:13:09.219
 So we can not apply the order directly 

00:13:09.219 --> 00:13:10.774
 of actions. 

00:13:10.774 --> 00:13:14.613
 Excuse me, it's minus 8 there. 

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:18.815
 Let's see what we can do with this. 

00:13:18.815 --> 00:13:21.392
 Let's try some options. 

00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:27.043
 What we will get if we first count 12 minus 8 minus 4 and then multiply 

00:13:27.043 --> 00:13:28.172
 this at 5. 

00:13:28.172 --> 00:13:29.095
 Let's see what we get. 

00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:30.164
 I just experiment with the brackets. 

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.673
 So if we have 8 minus 4, this will be here 

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:37.479
 8 minus 4 is 4. 

00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:43.120
 And then 4 by 5 will be 20, and then 12 minus 20 - 

00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:44.612
 yes it is. 

00:13:44.612 --> 00:13:45.923
 Let's confirm this 

00:13:45.923 --> 00:13:47.817
 So, I say I will put clamps right there 

00:13:47.817 --> 00:13:50.183
 right there, and let's calculate it. 

00:13:50.183 --> 00:13:55.528
 You will see that 8 minus 4 is 4. 

00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:59.238
 So all this was simplified to 12, 

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:01.763
 minus 4 by 5. 

00:14:01.763 --> 00:14:02.567
 And we only apply the order of action, 

00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:05.083
 first multiply. That's exactly 20. 

00:14:05.083 --> 00:14:09.609
 And if I wanted to do that very clearly, in fact 

00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:11.844
 I would write it this way. 

00:14:11.844 --> 00:14:13.014
 I would put some more 

00:14:13.014 --> 00:14:14.014
 brackets right. 

00:14:14.014 --> 00:14:16.516
 But the order of operations would tell us this anyway. 

00:14:16.516 --> 00:14:19.211
 Finally, we get 12 minus 20, which is actually minus 8 

00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:21.302
 or negative 8.
