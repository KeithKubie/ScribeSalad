Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. People get too comfortable, you know? It's just, it, it's only their fans. There's preaching to the fan base. Yeah. We've got like Bill Maher is not changing anyone's mind. Just like people are, people are applauding there. They know they're going to apply before they even get there. Yeah. I would never do a comedy club. He looks in the comedy clubs at all. No, I'm sure he does not. Yeah. Yeah. I think, yeah. I think you really have to. Yeah. No, I think so too. Yeah. Well, he's in this weird category too, right? Where he's not just doing comedy. He's got to do, everything has to be political because this whole thing is about political, political shit. Like his show is his persona, who he is, you know, he donated $1 million to the Democratic Party. Like he's, it's all politics. Oh, all of it. And I can't stand political humor just because it's just, it's so easy.

Speaker 1:          00:49          You know? You're either, you're either making everyone mad or you're making everyone really happy, but it doesn't really matter like what the joke is. Yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, uh, and then if you're doing stuff about like the speaker of the house and you're like, God, when someone's like, should the Mueller report, it's like, fuck man. Like, no. Yeah. You know who's like super deep into politics on the right is nick depaulo like every time I talked to him yeah. And wants to talk about the fucking Steele dossier. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's talk about all this different, all the Shit Obama did. Well, how about when Obama did this? Yeah. How do you know? Yeah, I don't even know this. I know that the, the knowledge of it, like I once got a phone call before the last election, like a, you know, a year ago and they're like, we want to ask you about like, how involved would you say are you with politics?

Speaker 1:          01:41          And I'm like, very, actually, I'm pretty passionate right now. Um, and like, how informed would you say you, I'm like, I'm at 10, very informed and then like, okay. And they start asking me questions and I did not know what the fuck they were talking about. Like I hadn't heard of any of these things. Any of these bills. Like I have no idea. I have no idea what's going on. It's like the difference between a casual sports fan and someone who really understands all the drafts and all the pics from different colleges and all with this guy's got potential and this guy needs to work on this defense. This is a 40 times. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. The people who know that combine numbers, Yay. Bench press two 24 47 times. There's people that know that stuff and like it's exhausting because it, it's so involved.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Like do you have to, if you really want to be paying attention to everything that's going on with Nancy Pelosi, you know, you gotta, you gotta be paying attention to that all day long. And most of the people that do that, they're nuts. Like you're, you're, it's just, it's like sports, it's sports, but in a different way. Like you're just, this is the thing that you're wrapped up in [inaudible] although it does shape our world, you know? Yeah. As far as like right wing comics go though does not a lot of like Nick Depaulo is the king because he's actually really fucking funny. Like he's right wing as like a person and you know, he's conservative but he's also a great stand up comedian. But did he get more right? Yes. As he got older. Yeah. So it wasn't all wet because I remembered the Apollo. He's one of my favorites.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Uh, you know, when I would see him on TV as a kid and I know him a little bit now, but uh, the, the, the right things seem to come up more and more in the past 10 years. Yeah. He was always in, yeah. Angry guy, but he became like an old angry guy that's really into politics as he got older. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess part of it is like, it works for them. Like it's, people love to hear it. Like there's not a lot of those guys, like who does this right. Have to bank on in terms of like comics that they could go see good. Tim Allen barely. Does he do standup anymore? I think he does like, I think it goes up to the laugh factory does he thinks yeah. Okay. So maybe he's one of those guys are like, when was the last time you want to say six months ago?

Speaker 1:          03:55          You know what I mean? Oh yeah. You know what I mean? I don't, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but who else? Okay, so you got Tim Allen and Nick Depalo. There's gotta be more. There must be, I mean Norton kind of leans right a little bit more libertarian, but he doesn't do a lot of politic jokes. He'll talk about it. But when the fuck else is like no one, but if you want to do like left wing commander and so you can start with Michelle Wolf and work your way up. Oh yeah. This, there's millions of them. Michelle Wolf wasn't even like left wing. I think the correspondents' dinner, everyone's like, this is a star making turn. And I think it almost ruined her. Really? Yes. Because her show, Netflix was called the break. Like it was called the break and was like, we're going to take a break from all of this and just talk about like other things going on in the world. We don't need to be focused on politics. And after that, after the correspondence dinner, it was like the opening show was like her going after Sarah Huckabee Sanders and you're like, oh, you, you got forced into this. You know, we're not a niche. Yeah.
