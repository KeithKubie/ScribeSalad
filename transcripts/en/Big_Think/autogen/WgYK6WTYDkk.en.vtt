and end up with some sort of compromises

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
and end up with some sort of compromises
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.459
and end up with some sort of compromises
with the polluters and then we end up

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:31.469
with the polluters and then we end up
 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.560
with the polluters and then we end up
with this cap and trade and offsets and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
with this cap and trade and offsets and
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.410
with this cap and trade and offsets and
a completely ineffective system but this

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
a completely ineffective system but this
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110
a completely ineffective system but this
isn't now this situation in which we can

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
isn't now this situation in which we can
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.950
isn't now this situation in which we can
see what we are doing to future climate

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
see what we are doing to future climate
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.349
see what we are doing to future climate
and what the implications will be for

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359
and what the implications will be for
 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.290
and what the implications will be for
young people we're we're in danger of

dynamical system will be out of their
control but this the intergenerational

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739
control but this the intergenerational
 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.169
control but this the intergenerational
injustice of that is this problem is

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179
injustice of that is this problem is
 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.420
injustice of that is this problem is
analogous to that faced by Abraham

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

where you can compromise Lincoln

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
where you can compromise Lincoln
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.319
where you can compromise Lincoln
couldn't say well let's reduce the

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329
couldn't say well let's reduce the
 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.770
couldn't say well let's reduce the
slaves by 50% yeah you can't compromise

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
slaves by 50% yeah you can't compromise
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.520

on this we have to phase out the carbon

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
on this we have to phase out the carbon
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410
on this we have to phase out the carbon
dioxide emissions over the next several

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
dioxide emissions over the next several
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.450
dioxide emissions over the next several
decades and and frankly that means

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
decades and and frankly that means
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850
decades and and frankly that means
phasing out coal emissions and this cap

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
phasing out coal emissions and this cap
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.040

this is written by the polluters and
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.660
this is written by the polluters and
even by environmentalist their good

points in those bills also it's filled
 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.290
points in those bills also it's filled
with the polluters point of view and and

some environmental things to increase
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.240
some environmental things to increase
solar power for example but that's not

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
solar power for example but that's not
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100
solar power for example but that's not
going to solve the problem it's just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
going to solve the problem it's just
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.550
going to solve the problem it's just
like the old Kyoto Protocol approach we

they have to face the fundamental issue
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.010
they have to face the fundamental issue
as long as fossil fuels are the cheapest

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
as long as fossil fuels are the cheapest
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.740
as long as fossil fuels are the cheapest
energy then they are going to be burned

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750
energy then they are going to be burned
 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.340
energy then they are going to be burned
and their use will continue to increase

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350
and their use will continue to increase
 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.800
and their use will continue to increase
you have to face that that's what the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
you have to face that that's what the
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.900
you have to face that that's what the
lawmakers are not facing and that's what

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
lawmakers are not facing and that's what
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.170
lawmakers are not facing and that's what
President Obama has got to understand so

President Obama has got to understand so
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.480
President Obama has got to understand so
the only way you can address that is by

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490
the only way you can address that is by
 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.360
the only way you can address that is by
putting a rising price on the carbon

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370
putting a rising price on the carbon
 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.770
putting a rising price on the carbon
emissions then the alternatives the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780

produce carbon will compete more
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.880
produce carbon will compete more
effectively and those which are most

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890
effectively and those which are most
 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.700
effectively and those which are most
effective will begin to win economically

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710

democratic party was introduced by a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940
democratic party was introduced by a
 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940
democratic party was introduced by a
Democrat I'm sorry I can't think of his

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950
Democrat I'm sorry I can't think of his
 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.330
Democrat I'm sorry I can't think of his
name at the moment but it was

name at the moment but it was
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.630

discussion of this I think you know the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400
discussion of this I think you know the
 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.570

the way they were about health care but
 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.330
the way they were about health care but
we need to have that kind of in an open

we need to have that kind of in an open
 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.730
we need to have that kind of in an open
discussion so that we see what the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740
discussion so that we see what the
 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.130
discussion so that we see what the
alternatives are because this approach

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140
alternatives are because this approach

that is being pushed by the Democratic
 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.710
that is being pushed by the Democratic
Party is a disaster
