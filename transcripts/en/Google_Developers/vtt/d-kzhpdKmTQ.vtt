ANDREW BROGDON: Creating an
ad unit in the AdMob user

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.194
interface only
takes a few clicks,

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:11.610
but there's actually
a lot of work

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.170
that goes on under the hood.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.660
For example, AdMob has
servers and data centers

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.080
all over the world.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.710
So when you create a new ad
unit, information about it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.110
gets propagated
thousands of miles away,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.950
which is both really cool
and slightly time consuming.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.830
It can actually take up to an
hour for a new AdMob ad unit

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.020
to fully spin up
around the world.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.490
In the meantime, you'll get
an error code from the SDK

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.520
if you try to
request ads from it.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.020
The good news is
that if you need

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.410
to work on your code in the
meantime, Test Ads still serve.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.210
You can turn them on
using the test devices

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.550
parameter in your
ad requests, or use

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.110
one of the dedicated
Test Ad unit

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.450
IDs you find in our
implementation guides.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.120
So there's no need to slow down.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.870
