00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.153
 Let's see if we can find it 

00:00:01.153 --> 00:00:02.805
 the face of this parallelogram. 

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.150
 I also recommend that you pause the video 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.159
 and see if you can find it. 

00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:08.553
 Okay, we just have to remember, 

00:00:08.553 --> 00:00:10.165
 that the face of the parallelogram 

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:12.344
 will be just the foundation - 

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.821
 let me do it in a different color - 

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:16.375
 will be the basis of the parallelogram, 

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.256
 I want to write it in a different color, 

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.432
 so let me write: 

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:23.172
 the base of the parallelogram 

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:26.036
 at its height, 

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:30.966
 at the height of the parallelogram. 

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.364
 The face is equal to the height base. 

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.628
 What we can accept for 

00:00:34.628 --> 00:00:36.450
 the basis of this parallelogram? 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.654
 Well, we can assume it will be one of those countries. 

00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:41.309
 So we can get out of here, 

00:00:42.023 --> 00:00:43.592
 and I could say ... 

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:46.716
 I could accept this country as the basis. 

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:48.650
 What is the length of the base? 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.557
 We just go in the vertical direction. 

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:53.617
 We go from five to five, 

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:55.560
 to equal to minus seven, 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.127
 so it has a length of 12. 

00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:00.518
 We have five above the x axis and seven below the x axis, 

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.555
 total 12. 

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:02.441
 Or you can count them: 

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:04.661
 One two three four five, 

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:08.569
 six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. 

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.052
 So this is the foundation 

00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:12.824
 and we can say that the base is equal to 12. 

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.938
 Now what can we look like height? 

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:19.927
 Well we can look at this part 

00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:23.341
 here is the height. 

00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:24.759
 And how much will it be? 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.685
 Well, it seems very clear, 

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.675
 that the height is four. 

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:29.059
 This can be a little unpredictable, 

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:30.374
 because usually when talking about height, 

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:33.023
 we are accustomed to thinking how high something is given, 

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:35.818
 but you can imagine spinning this way, 

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:39.110
 that the base lies horizontally 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.724
 and then the height will be height 

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:42.675
 in the traditional meaning of the word. 

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:45.849
 But we can say that h equals four 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.682
 and it's now very easy. 

00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:52.064
 The face will be equal to 12, 

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:55.186
 the length of the base along the height, 

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.091
 four, 

00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:57.881
 yes, four, 

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.352
 which is clear that it is 48. 

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:03.108
 48 - say - 

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:05.476
 48 square units.
