00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:04.000
NARRATOR: Way out into space,
the sun's energy-giving

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.033
rays grow weaker.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:09.633
Solar panels would be
little use to Cassini

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.266
passing distant planets.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.467
It needs a far longer
lasting source of power.

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:21.967
The radioactive power of
plutonium-238 In Idaho Falls,

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:24.533
behind high level
security, the United

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:28.500
States Department of Energy
harnesses this prized source.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.667
The Cassini mission
required more nuclear power

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:35.600
than any other mission
in NASA's history.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.300
NARRATOR: Three heavily shielded
thermo-electric generators

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.934
transformed the heat
of radioactive decay

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.867
into electrical power.

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:46.100
They hold
iridium-coated plutonium

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.200
pellets, lasting for decades,
but potentially deadly to life.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.834
That energy source is
what keeps Cassini's

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.400
cameras taking pictures, and
powers its radio messages back

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.100
to Earth.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:05.066
It runs all the devices
on the spacecraft,

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.700
plus the residual heat is
funneled into the spacecraft

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.867
and it keeps all the
instruments warm and in

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:14.533
their proper operating range.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.500
NARRATOR: But how
do you stay warm

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.333
when outside temperatures are
dropping to minus 364 degrees

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.000
Fahrenheit?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You wrap up in a blanket.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.800
In this room at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Lab,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.266
there is over $1
million worth of them.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.367
MARK DURAN: This
is the fabric we

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:35.166
use to shield Cassini
and protect it

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.500
against the environmental
fluxes of space.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.867
NARRATOR: More than 20 layers
of specialized fabric protect

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.100
Cassini.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.967
Not real gold, but colored,
aluminized materials.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:48.900
$60,000 worth.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.767
Cassini was one of the
most challenging spacecrafts

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:54.633
to even undertake.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:59.633
It was menacing to think that
we had to develop shielding

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:01.133
for this entire spacecraft.

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:08.567
NARRATOR: It's taken decades
of dreaming, designing,

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:11.600
building, and testing.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.100
Now, the mission is ready to go.
