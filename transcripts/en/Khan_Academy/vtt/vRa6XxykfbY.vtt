00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:01.966
- [Voiceover] So let's
do a couple of examples

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.833
of the number opposites
exercise on Khan Academy.

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:07.293
Just to make sure that
we've really digested

00:00:07.293 --> 00:00:09.866
what it means to be the
opposite of a number.

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.667
So they have a number line here,

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.566
and then they've marked some
of the numbers with letters.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.500
And this is A, B, C, D, E.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.233
And then they say, "What
can we say about point B?"

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:24.233
And point B is one hash mark
to the left of zero, all right.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:25.833
"Select all that applies."

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:28.600
So the first thing, they say
is, "B is equal to negative D."

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.766
So that means that B needs
to be the opposite of D.

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.566
Let's see if that's true.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.600
D is here.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.692
D is one hash mark to the right of zero.

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:40.266
The opposite of D, or negative D,

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.233
should be one hash mark
to the left of zero.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.717
Which is B.

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:46.617
B is the opposite of D.

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:50.855
B is negative D, so this is true.

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:53.711
The next statement is,
"B is the opposite of E."

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:56.112
Let's see, E is one, two, three hash marks

00:00:56.112 --> 00:00:57.481
to the right of zero.

00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.666
So the opposite of E should be one, two,

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.095
three hash marks to the left of zero.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.812
That is not B; that is A.

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:07.666
B is not the opposite of E.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.357
A is the opposite of E,

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:10.310
but that isn't what they write here

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.633
so we're not going to check that.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.866
And then they say, "B
is equal to negative B."

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.719
That's saying that B is the
same thing as the opposite of B.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.266
That is not true.

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.333
The opposite of B is going to go on the

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.533
other side of the number line.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.466
That's D, which is not B.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.200
So this is also not true.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.267
This would have been true if they said,

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:28.866
"C is equal to negative C."

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.900
Because C is at zero,
it's zero away from zero.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.267
C is zero.

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:36.033
The opposite of zero is going to be

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.300
zero away on the other
side of the number line.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.748
Well, that's still zero away.

00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:42.200
So zero is negative zero.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.335
Or we could have said C
is equal to negative C.

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:49.366
But the only number for
which that is true is zero.

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.776
It's not going to be true for B,

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:53.792
because B is clearly not zero.

00:01:53.792 --> 00:01:56.733
So let's do a couple of here.

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.133
"What can we say about negative C?"

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.100
All right, so now C is zero.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.319
"Select all that apply."

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.540
"Negative C is zero."

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.017
Yeah, the negative of zero
is going to still be zero.

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:09.166
The negative of zero,
the opposite of zero,

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:11.392
is still going to be zero.

00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:13.800
The opposite of zero, that's
not going to be this number.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.600
This is some non-zero number.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.666
So that's that. All right.

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.100
"What can we say about point T?"

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.766
T once again is at zero.

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.433
So we say, "T is zero."

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:26.133
"Zero is the opposite of zero."

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.302
It is equal to negative zero.

00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:30.866
Both of them -- one is zero, you could say

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:32.533
zero to the left, one
is zero to the right.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.907
Well, that still means
that they're still on zero.

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:36.817
And they're right, they are zero.

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:40.233
"T is equal to the opposite
of the opposite of T."

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:43.592
Well, this would actually
be true for any number.

00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:45.333
For any number, the
opposite of the opposite

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.379
is going to be that number.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.529
We could have put the Q here, the R here.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.039
Really for any number the
opposite of the opposite

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.533
is going to be that number again.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:56.200
And so it's definitely going
to be true for zero as well.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.534
So that's definitely going to be true.

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.400
So hopefully that kind
of gives you a little bit

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.933
more practice with number opposites and

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.529
helps you digest things a little bit more.
