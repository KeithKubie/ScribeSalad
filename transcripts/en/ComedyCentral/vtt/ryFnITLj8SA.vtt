00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.400
- THAT GUY TOTALLY RUINED
MY DYNAMITE NAPOLEON IMPRESSION.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.307
[sighs]
NOW WHAT?

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.176
I'M WORKING ON SHREK,
BUT...

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.120
[imitating Shrek's brogue]
IT'S YEARS AWAY, DONKEY.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.760
- JESUS CHRIST...
YOU OOZE TALENT.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.680
THAT WAS DISGUSTING.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.354
AND I CAN'T EVEN CONCENTRATE
ON THAT

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.222
BECAUSE I'M TOO BUSY
HATING THAT DUDE.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:24.791
- I DON'T BLAME THE GUY,
THOUGH.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.592
HE'S CRANKY 'CAUSE HE HAS TO
WAKE UP SO EARLY

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:27.994
FOR SWIM PRACTICE.

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.563
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:33.766
MAYBE WE NEED TO MAKE IT
SO THAT HE NEVER, EVER WAKES UP

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.435
FOR SWIM PRACTICE AGAIN.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:39.238
ONE TIME I WENT SWIMMING
IN, LIKE, THE NEIGHBOR'S POOL

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.040
WHEN THEY HAD JUST SHOCKED IT
WITH CHLORINE.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.975
MY SKIN GOT ALL
FIERY RED,

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:44.877
AND MY HAIR STRAIGHTENED OUT
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.879
- WHEN I WAS A TODDLER,
I ACTUALLY FELL

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:48.915
INTO A WASHING MACHINE
FULL OF BLEACH,

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.349
AND I DIDN'T GET ITCHY AT ALL.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:53.653
I DID DIE, THOUGH...
FOR, LIKE, FOUR MINUTES.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.321
THE DOCTORS SAID
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.056
HOW MUCH BRIAN DAMAGE
I DIDN'T GET.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.025
THEY WERE, LIKE,
REALLY IMPRESSED.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.727
THAT WAS FUN. YOU WANNA DO
ANOTHER STORY BATTLE?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.996
I KICKED YOUR ASS.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.331
- NO. I JUST BROUGHT THAT UP
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.767
WE COULD MAYBE SHOCK
 THIS POOL.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.002
- GOOD IDE--
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID THAT.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:11.237
- NOW WE'RE TALKING.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.406
ONE OF THESE HAS GOT 
TO DO THE TRICK.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.009
- THERE'S, LIKE,
60 MORE BACK THERE, MAN.

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:17.542
- ALL RIGHT.
