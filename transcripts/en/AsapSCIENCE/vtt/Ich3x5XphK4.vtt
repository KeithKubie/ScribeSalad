00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280
Circumcision of the male penis has been practiced for thousands of years,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.800
often related to cultural and religious traditions.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.420
But whether you're "cut" or "uncut",

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.400
is one better in terms of health, how it feels, or sex?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.820
Circumcision is a medical procedure that removes the foreskin from the head of the penis,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.280
exposing the glans.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.700
Though its exact origin and intent is still debated,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.600
by the time it became common in the English-speaking world (the 19th century),

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.540
it was actually used in order to reduce sexual pleasure

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.160
and as a deterrent to masturbation,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.600
which was believed to cause many mental and physical illnesses.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.120
But the medical benefits of circumcision came into question in the late 1960s

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.780
when the research community came out against it,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.080
claiming that there was no clear medical benefit,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.760
and the risk for severe blood loss, infection, or death was high.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.700
This resulted in a decline in circumcised men.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.520
In the U.S., circumcision rates in hospitals dropped from 64.5% in 1979 to 58.3% in 2010,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.240
but worldwide, only around 33% of males are estimated to be circumcised.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.460
However, even more modern research has shown that it can reduce the risk of developing penile cancer

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.660
and infections such as syphilis, gonorrhoea, and herpes.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.120
It can also reduce HIV risk by up to 60%.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.380
A study done in Uganda involving heterosexual couples where one partner was HIV positive

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.240
showed that none of the circumcised men received HIV over the 30 months,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.360
while 40 out of 137 men that were not circumcised ended up developing HIV.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.520
This evidence holds true across Sub-Saharan Africa, but is not as clear in developed nations

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.580
or between homosexual men where more studies are needed.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.540
For women, a circumcised sexual partner may have a reduced risk of HPV,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.600
thereby reducing their risk of developing cervical cancer.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.680
So, how does circumcision protect against STIs?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.680
A study completed by Dr. Price and his team at Northern Arizona University

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.900
showed that one year after adult circumcision, the males ended up with 81% less bacteria on and around their penis.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.060
Dr. Price explained that, with uncircumcised men, the foreskin may be susceptible to infection

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.280
because the bacteria overload could prevent specialized skin cells, known as Langerhans cells,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.080
from stimulating the immune system.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.060
However, with good hygiene, these risks can be minimized.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.980
The benefits of circumcision begin to decrease when you study sexual pleasure.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.060
Research indicates the the removal of the foreskin reduces sensitivity of the penis.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.080
The foreskin is innervated with specialized nerves that can detect light touch,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.420
like the nerves found on our fingertips and lips.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.740
The most sensitive part of the penis is found between the transition region

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.460
between the external and internal part of the foreskin,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.540
which is the region exposed when the foreskin rolls back during sexual activity.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.360
Studies have shown that even the most sensitive part of a circumcised penis

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.700
is not as sensitive as the foreskin.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.840
But this reduced sensitivity due to circumcision could allow men to last longer during sex.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.680
One study documented 47 men who experienced premature ejaculation.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.140
When studying before vs after circumcision, it was found that the time of ejaculation

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.440
increased almost tenfold once they were circumcised, and partner satisfaction increased as well.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.420
When it comes to visual preference for circumcised or uncircumcised penises,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.420
it's mostly based on experiences and biases.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.180
The Canadian Pediatric Association claims that, because of the low risk of infection in North America,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.720
mandatory circumcision is not warranted.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.280
However, in parts of the world where STIs are rampant, the benefits of circumcision could outweigh the risk.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.460
At the end of the day, if you live in a developed nation and are hygienic,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.120
there isn't that big of a difference between the two.
