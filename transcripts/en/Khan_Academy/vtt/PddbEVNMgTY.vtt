LEBRON JAMES: Hey, everybody.

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:05.763
LeBron here.

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:08.272
Got another quick
brain teaser for you.

00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:10.940
Do I have a better odds
of making 3 free throws

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.560
in a row or 1 three-pointer?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.750
Here's my friend,
Sal, with the answer.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.260
SAL: Excellent question, LeBron.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.460
But before I answer
it, I want to point out

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.560
an interesting trend
related to your question

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.660
that I just dug up.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.420
This is from the New York
Times, October, 2009.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.890
So it's a couple of years old,
but it's really interesting.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.730
It shows that since
three-pointers were first

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.190
introduced-- they were
first introduced in the 1979

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.040
to 1980 season--
that three-pointers

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.800
have become more
and more frequent.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.270
So what they are showing here is
the average attempts per team,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.320
season by season.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.790
And it looks like there's just
a steady upward trend here

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
related to our question.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.126
There's a couple
of anomalies here.

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:50.500
And the ones that
really jump out

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.730
are these three seasons
in the late '90s.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.950
And that's because the
actual three-pointer line

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.379
was pulled in to essentially
get higher scoring games.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.920
So people attempted
more, but then it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.854
was put back to where
it was originally.

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:02.020
This was a shortened season.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.700
And I'm not really
sure what happened

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.180
in this, what is this, the
2001, 2002 season here.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.850
But it's something
to think about.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.990
There is just this trend
that more and more people

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.280
are taking three-pointers.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.030
Now, with that out of
the way, let's think

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.640
about your actual question.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.480
And to answer it, I dug up
your stats right over here

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.470
from nba.com.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.650
And we'll use your career stats.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.360
So we want to compare 3 free
throws to a three-pointer.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.190
So right over here, we have
your three-pointer percentage,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.750
and this is in your career.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.790
And I'll round it to
the nearest hundredths,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.180
so it looks like it's about 33%.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.615
So your three-point percentage
is-- we'll just call it 33%.

00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:44.170
And then your free
throw percentage,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.696
your career free
throw percentage--

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:48.070
so this is free
throw percentage,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.900
and this is in your career.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.700
We'll round to the
nearest hundredths.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.890
So we'll round up
right over here.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.380
That gets us to
right at about 75%.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.750
So clearly looking at these
numbers right over here,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.440
you're much more likely
to make a given free throw

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.131
than making a given
three-pointer.

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.380
You're more than twice as
likely to make a free throw.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.630
But that's not what you asked.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.909
You asked what about 3
free throws in a row.

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.950
And so what we'll do is
we'll do an analysis very

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.970
similar to the last
time when we asked

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.830
about 10 free throws in a row.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.630
So let's think about
the first free throw.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.510
So free throw number one.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.870
If we imagined a
gazillion-- a billion--

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.210
a gazillion's not a real number.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.020
If we imagined a billion LeBron
Jameses, identical LeBron

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.860
Jameses all taking
that first free throw,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.590
we would expect, on
average, that 75%

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.420
would make that
first free throw.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.250
So 75% is 3/4.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.840
So 75% would make
that first free throw.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.657
And 25%, we would
expect, on average--

00:02:44.657 --> 00:02:47.240
wouldn't always be the case, but
this is what we would expect.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.740
25% would miss that
first free throw.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.980
Now, let's go to the second free
throw, free throw number two.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.330
And we only care about
the LeBron Jameses

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.600
that keep making
their free throws.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.970
So let's think about of the
75% that made that first one.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.649
Some of the 25% might make
that second one and then maybe

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:08.440
even the third one.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.940
But let's just think about the
ones that made the first one.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.440
Of the ones that
made the first one,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.080
we would expect 75% of them
to make the second one.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.330
So 75% of the 75%,
that's 1/2 of the 75%.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.100
That's about 75%
of the 75% would

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.070
make that second free throw
and the first free throw.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.190
So now we have-- this is
going to be 75% times 75%.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.497
And, of course, there's
other combinations

00:03:36.497 --> 00:03:38.830
out here where someone's
missed at least one of the free

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.730
throws.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.900
Now, let's go to the third free
throw, free throw number three.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.250
What percentage of these
LeBron Jameses right

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.030
here will make the
third free throw?

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.980
Well 75% of these will
make the third free throw.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.410
So 75% of this number.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.770
So let me just draw it visually.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.350
That's 1/2.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.500
That's about 75% of that number.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.530
They will make the
third one, as well.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.500
And so this is 75% of this
number, which is 75% of 75%.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.180
This is how many LeBron
Jameses are going to make all 3

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.530
of the free throws.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.160
And, once again,
we can write this

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.890
as-- we could either
multiply it out

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.740
or we can just write this as
75% to the third power, which

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.700
is the same thing as 75%
literally means 75 per 100.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.820
Same thing as 75 over 100
to the third power, which

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.280
is the same thing as
0.75 to the third power.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.010
And so let's calculate it.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.562
Get the calculator out.

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:41.770
And actually, let me show
you we get the same result.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.450
We can write 0.75 times
0.75-- and on this calculator,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.490
that little snowflake
looking thing,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.110
it means multiplication--
times 0.75.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.789
And then we get 0.42.

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.330
I'll round to the
nearest hundredths.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.746
And that's the
same thing we would

00:04:57.746 --> 00:05:00.610
get if we got 0.75
to the third power.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.690
Once again, 0.42.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.070
So let me write that.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.240
So this gets us to
approximately 0.42,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.380
which is the same thing as 42%.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.480
So your probability of
making 3 free throws in a row

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.180
is 42%, which is still higher
than making 1 three-pointer.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.480
So I'll leave you there,
but I want the people

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.550
who are watching this video to
think about what would happen

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.800
if the numbers were different?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.930
Or maybe look up some NBA
players, or maybe some college

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.560
players, and figure out
and compare the probability

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.540
of making 3 free throws
to a three-pointer,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.999
and see if you can
find any players where

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:41.790
their probability of
making a three-pointer

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.280
is actually higher than
making 3 free throws in a row.
