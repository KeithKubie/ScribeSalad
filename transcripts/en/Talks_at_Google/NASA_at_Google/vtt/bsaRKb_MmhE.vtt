00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.410
MALE SPEAKER: I'm very excited
to have Dr. Hine here today.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.040
And he's over at Ames.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.260
Our neighbor to
the southeast-ish.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.260
And so Doctor Hine, if you'd
like to take the stage,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.580
that'd be great.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.075
BUTLER HINE: Hi,
I'm Butler Hine.

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:19.075
I'm the LADEE project manager.

00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:22.050
I'm going to talk about
the mission today and some

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.550
of the technologies
we demonstrated.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.620
I'm not going to talk as much
about the science results.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.200
The mission just ended
a couple of weeks ago,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.090
but the science data analysis
is happening over the next year.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.550
This is kind of a
snapshot of the mission.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.070
We had two objectives.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.330
One is measuring the
lunar dust environment.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.260
The other is measuring the
atmosphere or exosphere.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.980
It's a collisionalist
atmosphere.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.530
So it's a boundary layer
exosphere around the moon.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.935
It's one of the first
questions I always get is well,

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:54.060
the moon has no atmosphere.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.250
Well, it actually does.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.330
And most of the moons around
the solar system do as well.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.570
So it's a very interesting
scientific topic

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.700
about characterizing them.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.690
And they're very delicate
so they're easy to disrupt.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.690
We launched September 6.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.860
And then we just had
our impact April 18.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.200
So it was a short mission.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.360
That was by intent.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.930
It takes a lot of fuel
to fly low over the moon.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.650
I'll talk about the orbiter
and the science instruments.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.227
We pioneered a lot of
firsts on this mission.

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:25.060
The launch vehicles.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.600
First flight of
this launch vehicle.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.881
It's the first planetary launch
out of this new launch site.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.380
It's actually not
a new launch site,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.650
but for planetary
missions it is.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.440
But before I start
on LADEE, I wanted

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.320
to go back especially
for this audience

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140
and tell you where
LADEE came from.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.110
Because it was an interesting
story about where it came from.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.390
Ames was looking at ways to make
space flight less expensive.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.610
That's one of the
scourges of spaceflight

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.080
is it's so expensive that it's
an incredibly high entrance

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.240
barrier.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.830
And one of the things that
limits the amount of science

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.556
missions that NASA can do
is the cost of each mission.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.180
And it's because of
the traditional way

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.770
we do NASA missions.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.320
So one of the things
we were trying

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.630
to do in the 2005,
2006 timeframe

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.410
was come up with ideas
for how to do missions

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.600
at much lower costs than
they were traditionally done.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.930
And so some key ideas
from that effort

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.170
were design general
multipurpose architectures,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.110
multimission architectures.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.920
In the past, missions are
kind of custom designed.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.980
So think of a spacecraft
as a custom design.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.290
Every time you start, you
start almost start from scratch

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.100
and you custom design it.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.380
Now commercial spacecraft for
communications satellites,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.620
for instance, they do have reuse
of spacecraft architectures.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.480
But science
spacecrafts typically

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.670
are designed almost
from scratch every time.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.390
Invert the pyramid was a big
thing we were proponents of.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.460
The normal way
NASA does missions

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.690
is you define the
science goals and then

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.530
you define the
instruments that are

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.980
going to do the measurements.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.910
And then you design
the spacecraft

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.560
to accommodate the instruments.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.950
So that's this pyramid.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.830
It's a top down pyramid.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.100
Inverting the pyramid
means designing something,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.440
a bus that's capable
of multiple missions,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.000
and then choosing the science
that can fit into the bus.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.590
So it's inverting
that classic flow.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.500
And what that does is instead
of custom designing spacecraft,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.700
you actually can save cost by
having a multimission design

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.860
spacecraft that you then
tailor the science to.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.080
And then the other
thing was NASA

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.030
engineers love to design
stuff from scratch.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.780
I'm sure Google engineers
have the same characteristic,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.200
it's classic.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.650
One of things we try
to do to save cost

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.180
is not designing anything from
scratch if we can help it.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.090
But take advantage of
this ecosystem of space

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.200
qualified commercial
components that are out there.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.950
And so what came out was
this Ames modular common bus

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.170
concept.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.760
And these were the
project guidelines.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.120
I'm not going to go
into all of them,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.540
but some noteworthy ones
are develop missions

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.980
with multiple destinations.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.800
So if you can design one
spacecraft that can do things

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.279
on the surface of the
moon, around the moon,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.180
Lagrange points, even
out to Mars orbit,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.020
you have a lot of
science destinations

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.740
you can do with those.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.040
The other thing, number three,
is utilize cost effective

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.930
launch vehicles.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.560
If you go with the standard
heavy launch vehicles

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.320
that we're used to, especially
back then, the Atlas V

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.820
and the Delta IV heavy.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.090
They're very expensive.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.970
In fact, the launch
vehicle's so expensive

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.550
that it only makes sense to fly
either lots of small spacecraft

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.439
on it or one big expensive
spacecraft to justify the cost.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.980
And so we were going after some
of these new launch vehicles.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.730
Falcon I Space X had just
had successful flights

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.680
with Falcon I. We
were going after that.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.180
What we wound up using for
[INAUDIBLE] Minotaur V.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.310
I'll be going over
that in a minute.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.880
Now I'm going to skip
some of this other stuff.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.870
So the common bus
requirements that had were we

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.740
had to be compatible with
a range of launch vehicles.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.630
The critical mass and
volume constraints

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.190
derived from the
Falcon I back then.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.010
And the Esper is a way to
have multiple missions flying

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.970
on a single larger
launch vehicle.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.270
Mission duration turns
out to be a big driver.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.030
If you've designed
for short missions,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.350
then you don't have to make your
components as space hardened

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.230
as you do for long
lived missions.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.090
If you're going to go for 10
year mission, 20 year mission,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.854
the component cost goes way up.

00:05:45.854 --> 00:05:47.770
If you're going for a
one or two year mission,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.400
the component cost
goes way down.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.300
And then the
targets, lunar orbit,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.030
lunar surface,
anywhere on the moon.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.810
Earth-moon Lagrange points,
near Earth objects, and then

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.960
anything within the
Earth Mars orbits.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.246
This is the design evolution.

00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:08.870
This is really
interesting because when

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.530
you take those goals
or requirements

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.310
and you break them
down, you think, well,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.268
I've got to design a
lander because a lander is

00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:15.930
a unique thing.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.870
And then I got to
design an orbiter.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.270
And the team
actually started, we

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.880
started with those two branches.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.810
We evolved though.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.862
This is the design
evolution over time.

00:06:24.862 --> 00:06:25.820
Over a one year period.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.990
And we evolved the evolution
and then kind of at the end,

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.850
we were looking at how to
address manufacturing costs.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.070
And one of things you can
do with manufacturing cost

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.752
is have your design be modular.

00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:38.960
That does a couple of things.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.590
You can sink non-recurring
engineering costs once

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.480
and then reuse the modules.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.350
But you can also work on
the modules in parallel

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.090
so that you don't have
this serial dependency.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.290
A lot of times the
mission schedule

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.079
will have this serial
dependence of work on this

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.120
before you work on this,
before you work on this,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.940
and that could stretch
out your timeline.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.560
So we were trying to address
the work on things in parallel.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.840
When the design team was
doing that they realized,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.530
hey, these are
common modules that

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.330
can crossover between
landers and orbiters.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.527
So I actually don't
have to design a lander

00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:14.110
and then separately
design an orbiter.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.650
I can have one set of modules
that can actually do both.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.950
And so that's what
you see at the right.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.580
On the right, you
see the modules,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.340
the classic modules
within this design.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.960
You have a bus
module which contains

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.570
most of the active electronics
power for the system.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.210
You have a payload module
with reaction wheels

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.020
for applying attitude control.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.490
And then you have one, or two,
or three extension modules

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.700
and then the prop
system is designed

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.720
with standard interfaces so that
multiple propulsion systems can

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.457
be used and they have common
interface and control points.

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:52.040
And then, obviously, if you're
a lander you have to have legs.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.210
So on the left you can see
four different configurations

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.140
of this design.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.810
You can see a three
stack orbiter at the top.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.310
You can see a mini stack and
medium sized stack lander.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.500
And then you can see a near
earth object rendez-vous

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.940
which we're trying to
maximize your Delta V, which

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.600
means you're
minimizing your mass.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.370
So this is what the common
bus architecture looks like.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.000
So we had a skunkworks team.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.360
There were 12 of us
that were tackling this.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.340
First thing we did was we
prototyped some of this.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.490
Because we had lower performance
launch vehicles in mind,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.940
we wanted it as
light as possible.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.890
So we went with a carbon
composite structure instead

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.880
of an aluminum or
titanium structure.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.740
You can see our early
prototypes here.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.780
We did ground testing
of control algorithms.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.130
This is the lander
configuration.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.750
This is using cold gas
thrusters, basically

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.619
scuba tanks.

00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:51.910
Because we're in an urban area.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.970
We're your neighbors over there.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.970
If we were doing biprop
burning over there,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.660
you would not be happy.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.920
Because there would be toxic
fumes coming over here.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.690
So to do this testing,
we used a variant

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.370
of the propulsion
system with coal gas.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.000
Which is basically a
pressurized gas nitrogen.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.520
In this case, pressurized gas
that you blow down and through

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.290
the valves in the thrusters and
that gives you your propulsion.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.590
It's not very efficient.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.130
So we couldn't fly
this thing very long,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.150
but it was enough
flight time to allow

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.660
us to test the
control algorithms.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.390
And actually a piece of
trivia you may not realize

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.390
is your two founders
were actually here.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.970
We were in a
skunkworks mode that

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.220
was kind of under the radar.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.170
But somehow they
showed up one day

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.950
and saw some of this testing.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.100
And now back to LADEE.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.290
So that was the start
of the common bus design

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:53.840
and the prototype testing in a
terrestrial prototyping mode.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.640
Because of that, it looked
like the concept was viable.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.080
So the first thing
which is always

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.980
the hardest thing
with a new bus design

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.320
is getting a chance to
actually fly it in space.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.440
Because flying
things terrestrially

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.484
is much, much easier than
flying things in space.

00:10:08.484 --> 00:10:10.150
You don't have the
problems with thermal

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.441
and you don't have the problems
with temperature swings

00:10:12.441 --> 00:10:13.670
that you do in space.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.840
Vacuum et cetera.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.150
So at that time,
this was in 2008,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.524
NASA was planning for
significant human activities

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:24.190
around the moon.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.010
And one of the problems
with significant activities

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.930
around the lunar
surface is it disrupts

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.910
that pristine
exosphere environment.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.210
Dust and exosphere environment.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.610
So there was a goal back then
to measure the environment

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.960
before human disruption.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.640
So that's what
actually started LADEE

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.350
was to do these measurements
before the human activity

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.330
actually got to
be pretty strong.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.570
The LADEE guiding
principles we use,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.610
we designed the spacecraft
to be single string.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.990
So we, instead of
having true redundancy

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.750
which a lot of spacecraft
have true redundancy, have

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.900
an A set and a B set on
everything, avionics, sensors,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.111
everything, we
had single string.

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:08.610
Which meant everything
was critical.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.060
But we had functional
redundancy.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.950
So if we lost something, we
had a way for something else

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.390
to take over its functionality.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.720
I already mentioned
the avoid new design.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.190
Use commercially available
[INAUDIBLE] components.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.590
One of things that
NASA loves to do

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.710
is take a vendor's
proven design and say,

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.100
we're going to make you
make a change to it.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.330
And that, of course,
makes the cost go up

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.820
and eliminates that
reassurance you have

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.740
that it's flown before.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.740
So we said we're not
going to do any of that.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.120
Some controversial ones
was minimizing complexity.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.920
We have no deployables on this.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.930
You'll see in a moment that
this has body fix solar rays.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.670
Your classic view
of the satellite

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.660
is this folded arrays at launch.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.950
And then once you get on
orbit the arrays deploy.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.316
And you have the
solar collecting area

00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.150
in a deployed fashion.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.420
Well, deployables or any kind
of articulation on a spacecraft

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.060
is a failure point.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.100
So it costs a lot of money.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.880
And it's a place where
something failed.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.450
So we design that out.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.870
We have body fixed solar rays
all around the spacecraft.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.480
What that did as
a side benefit was

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.280
have a very simple safe mode.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.792
With spacecraft, you have
your normal operating mode,

00:12:23.792 --> 00:12:25.750
but you always have
something called safe mode.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.730
So if the spacecraft
has a problem,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.010
it'll drop back into a control
routine that is very robust.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.900
And that control
routine is designed

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.430
to keep the spacecraft
safe while you figure out

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.400
what's wrong with it.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.530
And then you come out of safe
mode into the normal mode.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.580
Well, most
spacecrafts since they

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.730
have deployed arrays,
that means the arrays have

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.700
to point at the sun.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.190
You also tend to have
hot sides and cold sides.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.930
And you have to make sure
your hot side is warm

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.980
and your cold side is cold.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:01.980
And safe mode has to work
guarantee with no question.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.100
So what that means is
that some spacecraft,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.210
90% of your software
development effort,

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.600
is around that safe code.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.800
And that 10% is
around the bigger code

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.810
that is your nominal run code.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.580
We intentionally made our
safe mode very simple.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.760
So that our safe mode was not
the driver for our software

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.749
development effort.

00:13:22.749 --> 00:13:24.290
And then the other
thing we did which

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.470
is kind of a 50/50 split
within the community

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.680
is launching powered off.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.740
Some people love to
launch powered on.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.070
Spacecraft is awake and
alive when it's launched.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.860
And then some people
like us wanted

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.400
to launch powered off so that
when the spacecraft separates

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.260
from the launch
vehicle, it wakes up.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.220
So this boot-up sequence,
where you do the boot-up

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.115
can be controversial.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.182
If you want to
launch powered on,

00:13:52.182 --> 00:13:54.390
you have to ensure that
nothing the spacecraft can do

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.750
can affect the
rocket in any way.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.360
And since the rocket
is around humans,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.040
you have these two
or three levels

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.240
of inhibits you have to
design into your system

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.770
so that no matter what happens,
you can't release toxic fuel,

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.410
you can't generate a spark, you
can't have an inadvertent radio

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.179
transmission.

00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:15.762
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
reaction wheels.

00:14:15.762 --> 00:14:17.637
BUTLER HINE: Can't spin
your reaction wheels.

00:14:17.637 --> 00:14:19.490
All of those inhibits
cost a lot of mass.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.230
And we were very
mass constraint.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.105
So we made the decision
to launch powered off

00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:24.650
so we wouldn't have
as many inhibits

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.270
that we had to deal with.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.890
And then that moves
your risk to on orbit

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.590
once you separate from launch
vehicle, that's your power-up.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.960
And so that first boot-up, is
the one that's the most risky.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.800
And then some of
these others are not

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.590
as important schedule
and cost guidings.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.710
So this is what the observatory
looks like for LADEE.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.600
And in NASA speak,
an observatory

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.664
is a spacecraft with the
science instruments on it.

00:14:51.664 --> 00:14:53.080
So without the
science instruments

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.530
it's a spacecraft, once you
add the science instruments,

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.380
it becomes an observatory.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.350
You can see the modules
that we use to the left.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.970
That bus module,
I mentioned, that

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.290
has all of the,
not all of them, it

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.710
has most of the active
components of the spacecraft.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.990
So it's like a mini
spacecraft by itself.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.110
Payload module is
where, by design, where

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.560
you put most of the
science instruments.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.140
And then we had a two
stack extension module

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.110
because our propulsion
system had to not only do

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:26.910
the lunar orbit insertion burn,
which is a big Delta V event,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.720
but it has to maintain
the orbit when

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.750
we're flying low over the moon.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.380
The four science instruments
or three sciences instruments

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.790
plus one technology demo,
you can see on the right,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.040
we had this bus nominally
carries two main instruments

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.610
on the payload
module cantilevered

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.670
opposite each other.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.710
In this case, those
locations were taken up

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.190
with a neutral mass
spectrometer to the left.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.519
And then the laser com
optical head on the right.

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:56.060
Because of the
science we were after,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.524
we also had two
smaller instruments

00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:59.190
that had to go up on
the radiator panel.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.910
So there's an ultraviolet
invisible spectrograph and then

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.340
a lunar dust
environment detector.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.725
These are the three science
instruments and the lasercom,

00:16:10.725 --> 00:16:12.282
you can see who provided them.

00:16:12.282 --> 00:16:14.240
The neutral mass spectrometer
was an instrument

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.180
provided by NASA Goddard
over on the east coast.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.070
Paul [? Mahaffey ?] was the PI.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.020
The ultraviolet spectrograph
was Tony [? Culpreet ?] here

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.590
at Ames.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.575
This is the same
instrument that was

00:16:26.575 --> 00:16:28.730
flown on LCROSS which
is that lunar impactor.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.630
So this instrument
has already flown once

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.710
and then we were reflying it.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:39.680
The dust experiment was a
institute dust impact detector.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.030
So it measured dust by the
impacts onto the aperture.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.930
And then the laser
communications demo,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.080
this was first flight
of optical com system.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.670
It was actually a very
aggressive experiment

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.520
to try to close the loop at
lunar distances which pointing

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.180
is very difficult at those
distances with the spot

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.140
size of the laser.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.600
And I'll tell you
a little bit more

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.089
about that part of the mission.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.630
Here are all the
external components.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.859
You can see the main
thrusters that [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.430
you see at the bottom, the
reaction control system

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.895
are the pairs of thrusters
on either side off of the CG

00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:23.390
so you get full three access
control of the attitude.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.530
You have the laser com and
you have the neutral mass

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.050
spectrometer in the prime
instrument locations.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.150
And then up top, you have
the extra instruments,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.090
but you also have the Omni
antenna top and bottom.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.860
And a medium gain antenna.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.040
Those are new technologies
I can talk about.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.390
The star tracker cameras.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.510
We have two heads.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.310
Because when you're
flying low to the moon,

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.926
one head is usually
always blocked.

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:46.300
So you need two
heads when you're

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.195
doing attitude determination.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.850
And then you'll notice
the body fix solar panels.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.933
So we have solar panels
all around the spacecraft.

00:17:54.933 --> 00:17:57.210
And you see the slight
cant at the top.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.100
That's so that there's
really only one orientation

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.840
that you don't get
power positive.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.910
And that's if the sun
is pointing right up

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.140
the main engine.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.230
That's the only way you cannot
get power to the system.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.290
And that leads you to
this simple safe mode.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.710
Because instead of having
active pointed safe mode,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.130
we can have a random tumble.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.040
We can be safe in
a random tumble.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.840
In fact, we like random tumbles.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.760
Or random spin.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.060
Keeps us nice and toasty
and it keeps power.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.380
If you look inside
the spacecraft,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.400
that top plate, which we
call the radiator panel,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.830
but there's so
much crap on there

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.234
that you don't radiate heat
very well off of that thing.

00:18:37.234 --> 00:18:37.900
[QUIET LAUGHTER]

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.490
Our thermal lead refuses
to call it a radiator panel

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.440
because he says it
doesn't radiate well.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.160
But you can see at the
top, to the top left that's

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.420
the view you saw before star
tracker cameras, LDACs, UVS,

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.960
the omnis, et cetera.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.090
If you flip that plate
over, you see on the right

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.780
the star tracker
digital processing unit.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.270
That's the controller
for the star tracker.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:05.200
You see the transponder, the
s-band RF transponder there.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.240
You see the flight battery
which is charged by solar rays

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.240
and then discharged
as you need it.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.590
And then the integrated
avionics unit.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:19.600
The integrated avionics unit
is a 3U compact PCI chassis.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.420
But it's designed for flight.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.760
So it not only has
the flight processor,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.100
has storage on board,
and a lot of I/O,

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.170
but it also has the power
distribution system.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.640
So the switches that
lets you shift power

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.050
from the rays to
the battery or power

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.240
out to all of the components.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.090
If you look at the bottom left,
you can see the payload module.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.530
The NMS and lasercom
optical head

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.800
are in the external position.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.920
But you can see inside there
the four reaction wheels

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.975
in a pyramid so that any
three of the reaction wheels

00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:54.720
can give you torque
in any direction.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.560
So three of four gives
you full control.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.870
And then there are
two boxes inside that

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.670
are part of the lasercom system.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.380
The outside is this
pointed telescope

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.870
with a three level pointing
system, coarse, fine and then

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.540
the server link system.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.310
Inside is the controller unit
which is, once again, processor

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.540
just like the spacecraft has.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.600
And also the modem unit.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.610
The modem unit is actually
the tricky part of this.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.300
How you modulate
this optical signal

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.510
is what makes this work well.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.010
And then you see the propulsion
module at the bottom right.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.200
It's a by prop system.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.600
NTO and MMH are the
two fuel and oxidizer.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.490
We have two fuel tanks,
two oxidizer tanks,

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.750
and it's a pressurized system.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.190
So we have two high
pressure helium tanks

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.647
that pressurize the
fuel and oxidizer tanks.

00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:51.230
This is what it looks
like when you're

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.710
doing observatory integration.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.590
We have a special
ground equipment

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.112
that we designed to
both the spacecraft

00:20:57.112 --> 00:20:58.570
to as it's being
assembled and then

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.850
you can orient the spacecraft
in either direction you'd like.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.640
You can orient it
vertically or horizontally

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.970
and then rotate it
around like a barbecue

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.360
to work on any part of
the spacecraft safely.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.190
You can also see the red
covers those are designed

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.760
to have a keep out zone
around any critical component.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.100
Those thrusters, those red keep
outs are for the thrusters.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.150
They're very delicate.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.450
You bump into them, you
can bend them a little bit

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.990
and then you've had a bad day.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.510
This is what the
observatory looks

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.130
like in the flight
configuration.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:38.100
Interesting thing is you have
a payload adapter fitting that

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.620
is usually what a spacecraft
attaches to a launch vehicle

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.027
with.

00:21:43.027 --> 00:21:45.360
Because we were trying to
save as much mass as possible,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.520
you can see that this path
which is in the bottom there

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.270
is this lattice structure.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:56.520
Normally, these are solid
aluminum or some kind of metal.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.600
This is a lattice
structure who's

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.540
kind of an Olympic
style bicycles that

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.000
have the carbon composite
rigging in them.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.120
This is a similar design.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.930
It's very strong,
but very lightweight.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.360
It's something the Russians
have been using for years.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.696
This was purchased from
the Russians from RUAG.

00:22:17.696 --> 00:22:20.570
But it's not something
the US has used before.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.760
So this is one of the firsts
in this country to use these.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.810
And it made all the
engineers nervous to see

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.967
the observatory sitting on
top of this very fragile

00:22:29.967 --> 00:22:30.550
looking thing.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.360
But it's actually
stronger than most metal.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.320
Then you see the main
thruster visible through it.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.570
So the mission architecture,
this is the RF architecture

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.360
that we used during the mission.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.400
We used an S-band transponder.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.350
So it's roughly 2.4
gigahertz is the frequency.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.860
We actually used all three of
the traditional ground networks

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.330
and space networks
that missions use

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.730
depending on what phase
of the mission we were in.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.360
The [INAUDIBLE] is the satellite
constellation around the earth

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.830
that the spacecraft can talk to.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.480
The International
Space Station uses it.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.710
We used that in
portions of the mission.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.550
The nearest network is a
network of ground stations

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.150
that have very good
tracking capabilities.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.070
So when you're flying by on
a close approach to the earth

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:27.330
and you're moving very fast,
the antennas can track you well.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.770
Once we got out
to lunar distance,

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.140
we were depending on
deep space network which

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.790
is the network that NASA
maintains around the world

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.440
to talk to spacecraft
in deep space.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.300
They're big, sensitive antennas.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.250
So we used all three
of these networks.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.737
All of the telemetry
and commanding

00:23:45.737 --> 00:23:47.320
through whatever
network we were using

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.830
goes back through the mission
op center here at Ames.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.980
We flew the mission
out from here at Ames.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.230
The science operation
center was what

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.890
coordinated the instruments
that's back in the Green Belt,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.710
Maryland.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.240
That was at Goddard.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.150
And then each instrument had
an instrument operation center

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.350
at their home institution.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:10.355
So MIT Lincoln labs had
the IOC for the lasercom,

00:24:10.355 --> 00:24:12.872
Goddard and Ames had the
IOC for their instruments

00:24:12.872 --> 00:24:15.080
and then the dust detector
was University of Colorado

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.970
at [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.427
So each PI had an IOC
that they could depend on.

00:24:20.427 --> 00:24:22.510
The lasercom architecture
was completely different

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.530
because it did not depend on
RF, it was an optical system.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.780
So they had their
main ground terminal

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.230
in White Sands, New Mexico
which had the most capability.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.770
It was a custom designed
ground station for them.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:40.039
But they also used
a telescope that

00:24:40.039 --> 00:24:42.080
had been converted into
a ground station for them

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.900
in Table Mountain, California.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:50.390
And then in Tenerife, the
European Space Agency, ESA,

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.990
was part of this experiment
where they provided a ground

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.270
station in Tenerife.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.190
So this architecture,
once again,

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.060
all comes together and flows
through the Lincoln Labs IOC

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.880
where the optical ground
station control was done.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.160
I mentioned a bunch of firsts.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.140
One of the firsts was
we were the first one

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.920
to use a new launch vehicle.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.714
A Minotaur V launch vehicle.

00:25:17.714 --> 00:25:19.130
In the spacecraft
world, you don't

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.100
want to be the first
to fly a launch vehicle

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.710
because you have a pretty good
chance of something exploding.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.100
This is an interesting
launch vehicle.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.100
The first three stages
are the Peacekeeper ICBM.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.280
The US and Russia have a
treaty, a START treaty,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.620
that allows each
country to re-purpose

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.730
their intercontinental
ballistic missiles

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.240
for civilian peaceful purposes.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.600
And so this treaty allows
the US to take these ICBMs

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.340
and then use them as commercial
or civilian launch vehicles.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.730
So the first three stages are
the peace keeper missile ICBM.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.280
And then orbital sciences
adds a fourth stage

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.950
to make it a Minotaur IV.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.290
And that's sufficient power to
put a satellite in earth orbit.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:09.440
And then we needed a fifth stage
which makes it a Minotaur V.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.630
And that gives us our
kick to lunar orbit.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.490
Or to the moon so that we
can get in lunar orbit.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.635
And so you can see the
fourth and fifth stage here.

00:26:18.635 --> 00:26:20.010
And then in the
bottom right, you

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.850
can see the spacecraft
stacked onto the fifth stage

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.990
within the faring.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.050
So we were first
flight of that which

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.234
was a little nerve wracking.

00:26:31.234 --> 00:26:32.150
It worked beautifully.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.730
The launch vehicle did
exactly what it needed to do

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.022
and actually gave us
a perfect insertion.

00:26:37.022 --> 00:26:38.980
Normally, launch vehicles
that are liquid fuel,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.140
they're more precise
than the solid fuel.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.910
These are all solid
rocket motors.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.400
So we expected a poor
insertion and had

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.640
to carry extra fuel in case
we got a poor insertion.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.360
But the launch vehicle gave
us a perfect insertion.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.340
We launched out of
Wallops Island, Virginia.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.560
Even people who live
there weren't really aware

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.030
that they had a launch
site that close.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.150
It's within sight
of Washington, DC.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.280
In fact, our launch was visible
up and down the east coast.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.250
The reason we flew out or
launched out of Wallops Island

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.350
is because the START
treaty specifies

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.680
the locations you
can launch from.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.860
So each country since
it is an ICBM launch,

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.810
the other country wants to
know where it's coming for.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.720
So Wallops Island
is one location.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.727
Kodiak, Alaska is another.

00:27:27.727 --> 00:27:29.060
And then Vandenberg, California.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.320
Those are the three
locations that are allowed.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.225
Vandenberg and Kodiak are
better for polar launches.

00:27:34.225 --> 00:27:35.600
So since we're
going to the moon,

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.440
we had to launch off
of the East Coast

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.640
and Wallops Island was
the launch location

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.870
that was allowed
under the treaty.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.820
This is what the
observatory looks like.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.580
Just prior to encapsulation.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.110
Encapsulation is what
happens when you're fully

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.790
stacked, checked out,
and you close the faring

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.690
on the spacecraft.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:59.400
So you can see that
the faring in two parts

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.960
and then you can
see the final stack

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.020
to the right of
the launch vehicle.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.136
We launched September 6,
it was a night launch.

00:28:08.136 --> 00:28:09.899
It was beautiful.

00:28:09.899 --> 00:28:12.190
As I said, you could see it
up and down the east coast.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:16.910
There's, if you do web
searches for LADEE launch,

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.800
you can see pictures people
took from New York City,

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.350
from up and down the east coast.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.940
Just beautiful shots.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.880
This was taken by one of our
integration test engineers.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:32.067
He's a semi-pro photographer and
he did this multiexposure photo

00:28:32.067 --> 00:28:33.650
of the launch that
was just beautiful.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.817
It's my favorite
photo of the launch.

00:28:36.817 --> 00:28:38.400
Here's a summary of
the launch events.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.760
You can see the track we used.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:45.390
We went out over the Atlantic
and flew over parts of Africa

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:51.360
before we finally did our final
staging and left earth orbit.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.690
The solid rocket motors
of this launch vehicle

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.770
provide you a really
strong kick at times.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.394
So it's a very
rugged, rough ride.

00:29:01.394 --> 00:29:02.810
And that was one
of things that we

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.220
had to design for a very
strong spacecraft structure

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.400
to handle that rough ride and
that vibration environment.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.160
So here's how we
went to the moon.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.830
I mentioned that solid
rocket motor launch vehicles

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:20.179
are notorious for giving you
unpredictable insertions.

00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:22.720
None of you are young enough to
remember the Apollo missions,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.751
but if you saw--

00:29:23.751 --> 00:29:24.792
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:24.792 --> 00:29:25.764
BUTLER HINE: Well, you are.

00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:26.264
OK.

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:26.780
You are.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.750
So those of us who can
remember the Apollo missions,

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.420
they have a classic figure 8.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.230
You go to the moon.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.860
That figure 8 is an
instantaneous launch window.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.620
So it's something if
you get a bad insertion,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.330
you don't get to
where you want to be.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.580
So we designed this with the
philosophy of phasing loops.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.560
So we launched
into phasing loops

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.240
around the earth
where each loop we

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.820
get a little higher,
a little higher,

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.625
and then finally, we have that
last loop where we hang there

00:29:55.625 --> 00:29:59.290
and the moon sweeps past us
and whips us around behind it.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.730
These phasing loops are
how you can compensate

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.170
for a poor launch insertion.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.180
Like I say, after it
happened, we didn't need them.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.910
But these loops were
designed so that we

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.540
could burn at various times and
compensate the poor insertion

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.360
and still get to
where we needed to go.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.910
So you can see the stars where
we actually did engine burns.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.370
The apogee maneuver 1B is
the test of the engine.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.080
So it wasn't a necessary
burn for trajectory,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.220
but we had never tested
the engine in space

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.110
before so you have to test it
first before you depend on it.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.330
And then we had
two perigee burns

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.910
close to the earth, PM1 and PM2.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.970
And then those were
very precise so we

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.856
didn't need any of the
other corrective burns

00:30:40.856 --> 00:30:42.990
or the third
perigee burn at all.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.890
And then TCM trajectory
course maneuver

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:48.550
1 was the final maneuver
which set our precise timing

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.630
for being whipped around
the backside of the moon.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.560
So once we whipped around,
lunar orbit insertion 1,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.100
LOI happened on October 6.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.160
That was our main
critical event.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.900
Because if we had
missed that burn,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.050
we would've sailed past
the moon and been wandering

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.920
around the Earth Moon
system for awhile.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.520
So that was our critical event.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.094
That happened
successfully October 6.

00:31:17.094 --> 00:31:18.760
That was during the
government shutdown.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.301
So there was a ghost
town over there.

00:31:20.301 --> 00:31:22.560
We were the only
people operating.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.400
You can't not pay
attention to a spacecraft.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.540
So we were able to
work during that time.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.560
But there wasn't a lot of
news coming out about it

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.760
until after everything reopened.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.560
But that engine
burn did just fine.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.710
Because NASA has had
a couple of spacecraft

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.120
go missing without contact.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.190
And so you don't know
why it went missing.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.870
One of the rules
that we all have now

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.340
is that you wait until
you're in view of the earth

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.310
to do a critical burn so
that you know whether it

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.610
worked or not and have
telemetry from the spacecraft.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:02.110
So the third phasing
loop since it's up there,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.950
the moon swings around,
whips us around behind it.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.340
As soon as it comes out
from behind the moon,

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.480
and here's the
view of it, you can

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.740
see earth peeking out around
the horizon down there.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.230
Soon as we're in contact
with the spacecraft,

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.070
it's doing everything
preprogrammed.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.980
We just need to be listening
and taking data during the burn

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.950
so if something goes wrong,
we know what happened.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:24.730
It did not.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.230
Everything went great.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:32.060
So we did two more LO, lunar
orbit, acquisition burns.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.180
LOI1 and then we did 2 and 3.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.750
Those were designed to get us
into this commissioning orbit.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.590
Commissioning orbit is where
you check out the spacecraft

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.590
and you check out the
science instruments

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.490
before you commit to doing
the science observations.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.810
Some science instruments
need calibration.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:50.780
Most of them need to blow
their protective covers

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.610
before they can operate.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.270
And so it's a time when you
can check out and calibrate

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.260
your instruments.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.592
So because the moon has
a lumpy gravity field,

00:33:00.592 --> 00:33:02.550
you burn a lot of fuel
when you're close to it.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.500
So we have the commission orbit
set at roughly 250 kilometers.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.110
That's where we sat
for about 30 days.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.720
That is where we checked
out the spacecraft.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.590
Couple of day check
out of the spacecraft.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.740
We did check out of the
science instruments,

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.740
but we also did the prime
lasercom experiment.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.320
So that's when we did
the lasercom experiment.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.360
After commissioning, we
did a two stage drop.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.970
We dropped the [INAUDIBLE] down
so we were in elliptical orbit.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:32.970
Check out the scientist
instrument one more time

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.940
and then drop the [? apoapsis ?]
into this circular lunar

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:42.360
orbit where we sat for the
main portion of the mission.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.660
So the lasercom.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.780
The lasercom was
wildly successful.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.480
I was one of these people
who looking at the specs

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.770
and looking at how
difficult it was

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:55.580
to close a link at that
distance with the earth,

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.160
I thought, oh my
god, they're going

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.510
to spend all their time in
a search pattern just trying

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.130
to find their ground station
before they could lock up.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.820
And so I thought it would
be very challenging.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:10.389
It turns out that once
we opened the cover

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:13.550
in one of the phasing loop
maneuvers, opened the cover,

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.139
and did the calibration
of the offsets.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.480
I mention that they have
a three stage system.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.210
So spacecraft provides the main
pointing of their instruments.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.139
So we point their optical head.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:30.100
And then they course point
medium point and then

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.730
once they lock up, they have
a piezoelectric server link

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.980
system that maintains
very high frequency.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.719
Maintains the lock.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:41.060
Once they did the
first acquisition

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.500
and had all their
calibration offsets,

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.130
from thermal
vibrations, anything

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.838
that had changed during
launch, once they

00:34:46.838 --> 00:34:49.889
got all that calibrated out, the
entire rest of their experiment

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.909
they locked up
with in one second.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.550
As soon as they swung
to it, servo, bang,

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.210
they there were locked on it.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.450
So it surprised all of us.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.110
It was really well done.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.732
Congratulations to that team.

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:03.190
What they were able
to demonstrate,

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.430
and you see some
of it here, they

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:09.520
were able to do 622 megabits per
second downlink from the moon.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.290
20 megabits per second uplink.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.200
It's designed to be asymmetric.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.970
You want more data
down than you want up.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.050
So that was perfect.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.630
The time of flight
measurement less than 100

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.840
picoseconds accuracy.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.770
That's very important
for ranging.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.330
One of things you
do to determine

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.460
your orbit around the moon is
you do tracking and ranging

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.240
of your transponder.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.860
We weren't depending on
lasercom for that, but what

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.310
they demonstrated was
orders of magnitude,

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:39.780
better ranging and tracking
than you can do in an RF system.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.761
They also, what's
not on this page,

00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:43.510
is they also demonstrated
some things that

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.310
are very practical for
use in future missions.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.520
They demonstrated that they
could acquire and lock up

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.730
their signal without
the RF back channel.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.590
So they never needed, after
they did it the first time,

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.520
they never needed our RF
system to close their link.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.770
They could do it all optical.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.040
That's really important.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.371
They also demonstrated
optical hand off from station

00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:05.870
to station.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.610
So they handed off from White
Sands to Table Mountain.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:11.955
Which with RF we hand
off from ground station

00:36:11.955 --> 00:36:13.807
to ground station
all the time with RF.

00:36:13.807 --> 00:36:15.390
But that's one of
the things that they

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.910
need to demonstrate that they
could do an optical hand off.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.493
They also demonstrated
that they could

00:36:19.493 --> 00:36:21.740
operate within three
degrees of the horizon which

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.470
is really tough.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.710
So they're going through most
of the murk of the atmosphere.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.610
They also demonstrated that they
could go through light clouds

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.750
with a laser.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:35.320
Unlike RF, moisture and
clouds can block you.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.120
They were able to shoot
through optical opacities

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.900
that you couldn't
physically see the moon,

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.730
but they were able to shoot the
laser through that cloud cover.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.940
So it was a very, very
impressive experiment.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.310
They did a fantastic job.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.490
Project managers, especially
NASA project managers,

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:56.010
are very reluctant to
depend on new technologies

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.890
because it's so easy for
something to go wrong.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.800
But they demonstrated
this enough

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.205
where I would fly this as
a primary communications

00:37:03.205 --> 00:37:04.320
on a future mission.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.610
It was very, very convincing.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.510
Once we dropped in down from
the commissioning orbit,

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.050
the lasercom
experiment was done.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:13.840
The science instruments
were checked out.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.220
We got into the
primary science orbit.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.400
You can see we refer to
this as the Seadragon,

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.190
you can see the backs
of the Seadragon there.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.530
This is because flying low
in this lumpy gravity field,

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.240
you never have true
circular orbits.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.840
You're always being moved up
and down by the gravity field.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.260
So to keep ourselves within
the tight band of the science

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.900
observations, we did
fairly frequent maneuvers.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.430
So any time you see
a vertical line here,

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.760
that's when we did a maneuver.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.510
So we had about 22 maneuvers
during the mission.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.650
To give you a sense
of comparison,

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.782
LRO, Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter

00:37:53.782 --> 00:37:55.490
is also flying around
the moon right now.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:38:01.320
They're in a polar orbit
which doesn't have the gravity

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.700
gradients that we do.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.270
They do two maneuvers a year.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:07.040
We typically do a
maneuver every week.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.548
So it's a much higher tempo.

00:38:09.548 --> 00:38:11.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.310
BUTLER HINE: No, it's the
mass cons within the moon.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.240
The moon doesn't have, we don't
think it has a liquid core.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.060
It's got concentrations of
mass and especially equatorial

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.030
orbits fly through
these mass cons

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.622
and have a lot of disturbances.

00:38:27.622 --> 00:38:29.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.230
BUTLER HINE: No, it's not.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.910
And then I mentioned that we
had a perfect launch insertion.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.860
What that allowed was since all
of our maneuvers were perfect,

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.260
we had enough fuel to extend
the mission another month.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.940
And during that time, you
can see in the bottom right,

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.500
we did extremely low
altitude science.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:52.120
Our nominal science was
around 30 to 50 kilometers

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.020
above the lunar surface.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.990
Once the prime mission
was done and we succeeded

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:01.120
in everything we needed to
do, we could take big risks.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.490
And so one of the big risks was
fly right over the mountains.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.220
And so we have data that
are well below 10 kilometers

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.170
there and right at
the end of the mission

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:16.220
we got data down to 300 meters.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.500
Very low.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.280
This is what the mission
op center looks like.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.940
We were split into three rooms.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.950
These views are of the main
[? mocha. ?] What's called

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.370
a [? mocha ?] over here at Ames.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.660
These are the folks who
were sending real time

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.042
commands to the spacecraft.

00:39:31.042 --> 00:39:33.000
We also had an engineering
team that was always

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.170
watching all the
subsystems in another room.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.490
But these folks were the
ones that were actually

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.490
actively commanding
the spacecraft.

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.830
We had to develop some
interesting software tools.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:47.690
The activity scheduling is
very difficult for LADEE.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:52.770
This is a tool that was kind
of a child of the tool that

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:54.800
was developed for
the Mars mission.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.130
Where you put your
activity timeline and then

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:59.740
there are resources
attached to each activity

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.820
and you can deconflict
the resources

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.890
and see what resource usage
against your available

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.950
and your margin.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:10.390
This is what allowed us to
put activities into the plan

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.756
that we uplink to the
spacecraft every other day.

00:40:13.756 --> 00:40:15.630
So which instruments
were on, which were off,

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.480
what the spacecraft was doing,
what attitude it had to be in,

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.590
what its power state
was, et cetera.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.980
That was all with this
called [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.990
activity scheduling system tool.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:30.930
We also did high precision
predicted position.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.900
I mentioned Del LRO is flying
around the moon as well.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.050
They have a nice camera.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.160
And so one of the things that
they did was try to image us

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.020
as we flew by.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.300
So this was an
eight kilometer pass

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.160
where, you can see in the
bottom left, the two spacecraft

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.120
orbits.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.180
So they're flying each one
at 1.6 kilometers per second.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.740
And they're crossing.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.170
And so the camera was able to
actually take a picture of us.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:00.150
You can see in the top right
the raw picture and then

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.700
superimposed in the bottom
right is the spacecraft

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.020
attitude against that picture.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.420
So that you can see the
illuminated solar rays,

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.960
you can see the
thruster, et cetera.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.040
That's a really challenging
picture to take.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.840
The speeds are so
great that they

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.000
had to do image
reconstruction technique.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.390
Which is why you see the
background of that upper right

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:23.650
image has this kind
of a diamond pattern.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:31.120
It's the image reconstruction
needed to deal with the speeds.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.504
We took star tracker images.

00:41:32.504 --> 00:41:33.920
One of things we
were trying to do

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.220
is recreate the dust glow image
that the Apollo astronauts

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.460
saw around the moon.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.610
So we did a variety
of star tracker.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.210
We didn't have a
camera on board,

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.640
but we did have
the star trackers.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.306
And we could put them
into an image mode

00:41:48.306 --> 00:41:52.560
and then watch the
sunrise at the moon.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.480
Our impact, I
mentioned that we went

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.200
through these really
low altitudes.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.629
This was actually the impact.

00:42:02.629 --> 00:42:03.920
It was at the site of a crater.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.140
I'll show you the
crater in a moment.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.590
But our orbit uncertainly
box is that blue box.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.990
It's basically two
kilometers in height.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:16.600
And you can see the box is
submerged in the ground.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.870
That's what tells you you're
close to impact there.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.090
So we impacted April 18.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.590
Location was on the
far side of the moon,

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.296
but it was still just
visible to the earth.

00:42:27.296 --> 00:42:29.420
So we actually were in
contact with the spacecraft.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.690
We saw the last telemetry
packet before it impacted.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.300
That helped us localize
exactly where it hit.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.080
And then all the science
data, the real time ops team

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.540
were in some kind
of zen state where

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.490
they were operating
faster than I've ever

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.560
seen an ops team operate.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.670
They closed science data
files, got them to the ground

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.860
as soon as the instruments
would take the data.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.660
So they were committed to
not leaving any science data

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.930
on the spacecraft at impact.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.420
Which was really
amazing to watch.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.430
This is the impact location
that red plus sign you see.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.640
It's just around the
side of the moon.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.832
This is actually what the
crater, the crater is Sundman V

00:43:12.832 --> 00:43:14.290
and you can see
the red cross right

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.260
on the edge of that crater.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.940
One of things LRO, they
are a mapping mission.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.400
So they map the entire
surface of the moon.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.760
They passed over this crater
right after our impact.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.807
But their image swap
went through the middle

00:43:28.807 --> 00:43:29.390
of the crater.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.070
So they just barely
missed our site.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:36.000
So they map every
site 28 days later.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.350
So we're waiting to
see when they pass over

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:43.270
again to see if we left a
scar or any kind of debris

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.960
on the surface.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.920
But our impact speeds were
so high most predictions are

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.330
we vaporized and we didn't
leave physical chunks anywhere.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.060
But you never know.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.670
Science, I mentioned I'm not
going to talk about science,

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:01.360
but the science instrument
results are very interesting.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.130
They detected helium,
neon, argon 40.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.076
Measured a lot of dust.

00:44:07.076 --> 00:44:08.450
We, in fact, as
soon as we opened

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:11.590
the covers in the commissioning
orbit, we saw dust.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:15.710
UVS saw sodium, potassium.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:19.300
You can see this is a
color-coded histogram

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.830
of our orbits.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.850
Our sunrise terminator orbit
was the prime science location

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.950
so you can see that
concentration there.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:32.924
And then these are some of the
species that we discovered.

00:44:32.924 --> 00:44:34.590
I'm not going to walk
through this list,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.532
but a couple of notable
ones are we saw water.

00:44:38.532 --> 00:44:40.490
After the L-cross mission,
one of the questions

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:44.100
is how does water get into
the polar [? cold ?] traps?

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.044
So this gives you
some information

00:44:46.044 --> 00:44:47.335
about the transport mechanisms.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:56.780
Then the dust measurements and
then I'll end on this slide.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.072
The technologies
that we demonstrated,

00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:01.280
the new technologies there
are basically four of them

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.022
that composite
[INAUDIBLE] structure,

00:45:03.022 --> 00:45:05.480
it's so lightweight that two
people, and I was one of them,

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.250
so I know this is
true, can lift up

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.700
the structure with their hands.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.560
But it's stronger than
most metal structures.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.530
Our s-band transponder
was first flight.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:21.850
We used and evolved
s-band antenna.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.190
It was not designed by human.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.980
It was designed by
a machine algorithm.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.700
A machine learning algorithm.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.370
Kind of a genetic
algorithm which you guys

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.210
know more about that than I do.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:35.340
But it doesn't look like
what human would design.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.460
The algorithm
designs the antenna

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.010
to match the beam pattern
and gains you want.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.170
So it actually looks like these.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.700
These look like
bent paper clips.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:51.210
That's what a machine designs
to optimize the RF energy.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:55.980
And those they had flown
once before on a mission

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.750
as a technology experiment.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.420
And then just like lasercom
was our technology experiment,

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.750
this previous mission
flew these antennas,

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:07.050
then we were able to fly
them for prime mission use.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.070
AUDIENCE: What was [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:11.870
BUTLER HINE: It's called
ST5, space technology 5.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:14.550
It was a mission designed
to fly new technologies

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:17.510
and make them eligible.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.760
And that's it.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.895
AUDIENCE: Where
had the [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:23.895 --> 00:46:25.270
BUTLER HINE: It
was a new design,

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:29.450
but similar design by the
same principle investigator

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.680
had flown on a
couple of missions

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.420
like Ulysses and Galileo.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.570
But that particular--

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.810
BUTLER HINE: Yes, yes.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.620
This one's very sensitive.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.237
And these instruments get more
and more sensitive over time.

00:46:42.237 --> 00:46:43.820
In fact, the neutral
mass spectrometer

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.250
was so sensitive that
one of our worries

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:49.795
was that they would just pick
up the spacecraft outgassing

00:46:49.795 --> 00:46:52.290
and not see the actual
measurement that they're

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.890
trying to see, but that
wound up not happening.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:56.422
They actually were able to see.

00:46:56.422 --> 00:46:58.630
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
flying low over the moon

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:59.900
takes a lot of fuel.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.650
I was wondering whether
those were planned burns

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.400
to correct for that
or automatic burns?

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.520
And do you think that
there is some software that

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.500
would give it a map
of the moon's gravity,

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.740
be able to give you
a longer mission?

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:17.080
BUTLER HINE: So these
were all planned burns.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.600
All of them occurred,
there was only one burn

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:24.680
that did not occur per our
plan two years ahead of launch.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.790
And that was one
where I mentioned

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.860
we passed close to LRO.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.870
We actually had a passage
that was scary close.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.230
It was within three kilometers.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.540
And so we had to do a divert.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.420
We had to move away from them.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.920
And so our planned burn
would have put us very close.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.100
And there's too
much risk of impact.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.240
[INAUDIBLE]
probabilities are low.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.140
So we adjusted that
burn to happen a couple

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.460
days later so that we
would not have that.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.810
But aside from that
adjustment, these

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.020
were all planned in advance.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:03.630
The software that allows
us to plan these burns

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.670
is very precise now.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:12.040
Especially Grail
mission which impacted,

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.680
a couple years ago, was a
gravity field mapping mission.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.870
And so the gravity field
map that Grail produced

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.280
is what you can use for
missions like [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.170
to do very precise predictions.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.920
Just so you predict, you're
going to waiver up and down,

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.000
you still have to do
something about it.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.020
So those 22 maneuvers
that you see,

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.470
those vertical lines
there, were what

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.270
we had to do to keep
ourselves within the band

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.490
that we needed to be for
the science observation.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.960
AUDIENCE: It looks like
it's almost always making

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.260
your orbit more
elliptical, isn't it?

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.630
BUTLER HINE: Yes.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.920
BUTLER HINE: Yes,
that's why there

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.640
are no true circular
orbit around the moon.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.340
The gravity gradients will move
you into an elliptical orbit.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.350
And so you can see if
it got too elliptic,

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.310
we would pull it back closer.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:09.220
Sometimes we would allow the
opposite side of the moon

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.850
altitude to grow so that
the side around the sunrise

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.190
was where we needed to be.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.170
And also what you
can't see in this plot,

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:22.400
these are just altitudes, but
the orbit also [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.970
the orbit will clock.

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:28.890
So the periapsis will
clock around the moon.

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:33.130
And we needed that periapsis
to stay at the terminator.

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.620
AUDIENCE: This is a
question from the members

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.880
of the
kerbalspaceprogram.com forum.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.174
I let them ask
questions on my behalf.

00:49:42.174 --> 00:49:42.840
BUTLER HINE: OK.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.510
AUDIENCE: So they
want to know do

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.070
you think any of the
cost saving features

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:49.100
such as the composite
modular design

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.650
will be used elsewhere
in NASA in the future?

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:55.790
BUTLER HINE: Yes.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.790
There's nothing concrete
on the books yet,

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:02.110
but we have two or three
concepts in development

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.500
that are going to be
proposed for flights.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.200
As I mentioned,
this bus design can

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.280
be used for almost any class
emission between Earth and Mars

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.050
orbit.

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:18.470
And so there are some proposals
to use it to go to Mars.

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:21.530
To go into the vicinity of Mars.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.577
It can't land at Mars.

00:50:22.577 --> 00:50:23.910
It doesn't have that capability.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:25.930
But it can go into
the vicinity of Mars.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:29.930
Near Earth asteroids
is a target.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.470
Lagrange points to
set up an instrument

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:36.540
and keep it at the Lagrange
point, those are good.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.980
A couple of the
Google X-Prize teams

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.250
have looked at the
bus or derivatives

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.920
of the bus for some
of their designs.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.890
So there's lots of
concepts out there.

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.230
I don't know which one
will be chosen next.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.210
I can't tell you.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.900
AUDIENCE: So is that
guy at MIT planning

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.515
to send his lasercom to Mars?

00:50:59.851 --> 00:51:01.350
BUTLER HINE: Well,
that lasercom was

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:08.170
designed for a class of
missions that were near Earth.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.310
Including the moon
that's near earth.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:14.830
There's another lasercom
design that hasn't flown yet,

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:18.890
but is done down
at JPL and Caltech.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:25.455
That is on target to try to
close the loop from Mars.

00:51:25.455 --> 00:51:29.180
AUDIENCE: Does the lunar
atmosphere seem to be less

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.470
sensitive to human activity
given the almost complete lack

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:36.024
of measurable changes
from the Chang'e 3?

00:51:36.024 --> 00:51:37.690
BUTLER HINE: Yeah,
that was interesting.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:43.280
Although our instruments
were set up to measure any

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.990
disturbances from the
Chang'e 3 landing.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:50.400
They were masked a
little bit because when

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.710
we were looking it was also
around a meteor shower which

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.210
naturally kicks up
a lot of material.

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:59.870
So we do not see anything that
we could definitively say was

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:03.140
from the Chang'e 3 lander, but
we did see a lot of activity.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.470
It's just ambiguous whether
it was that meteor shower

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.030
or whether it was
the actual lander.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.790
AUDIENCE: LADEE had
to endure an eclipse.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.570
Given that it was a
relatively short emission,

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:17.576
why was this not avoided to just
basically save weight and use

00:52:17.576 --> 00:52:18.812
a smaller battery?

00:52:18.812 --> 00:52:20.270
BUTLER HINE: We
actually did design

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.390
it to avoid that eclipse.

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.270
What you're talking
about is an eclipse

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:27.200
where the earth is between
the sun in and moon.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:31.550
So we went through hourly
eclipses through the mission.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:35.180
So it was designed and scaled
for those hourly eclipses.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.470
What happens in the
bigger eclipse which

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:42.400
happens twice a year,
roughly, is the Earth's shadow

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.060
falls on there.

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.450
So you stay in eclipse
for a lot longer.

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:48.460
And the eclipse
had just happened

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.920
around April 15 was a roughly
four hour total darkness

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.090
for us.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:57.490
We plan the mission
so that we could

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:01.600
accomplish the full mission
and miss that eclipse.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.580
It was only because the
launch vehicle gave us

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.540
a perfect insertion.

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.890
And then our
maneuvers were perfect

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:08.850
that we had that extra month.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.280
And so that's what allowed
us to try the eclipse.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.550
We actually went, as
an engineering test,

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.680
we went through that
eclipse with our systems

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.390
in pretty much normal
mode just to see

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:21.980
if it was a big limitation.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.960
And with the exception of being
able to test the propulsion

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.190
system coming out, everything
pretty much worked just fine.

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:31.325
We never actually went
dark and had to reboot.

00:53:31.325 --> 00:53:34.100
That was one of the
things you worry about.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:38.400
The system stayed
up and functional.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.430
But we did, since this eclipse
was such a strong driver

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:44.690
in the power system, we did
design the prime mission

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:46.279
so that we avoided that eclipse.

00:53:46.279 --> 00:53:47.154
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:47.154 --> 00:53:48.120
BUTLER HINE: Yeah.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:48.400
Thank you.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.400
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.350
[APPLAUSE]
