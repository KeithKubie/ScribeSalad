00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
Ever wondered what it would be like to talk
to animals?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.439
What would they say?

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:11.080
Well Koko the Gorilla might be able to tell
us.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.950
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.619
Making the rounds on the internet lately has
been a viral video of a gorilla with a message.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.590
Koko the gorilla signs saying she loves man
and loves nature but “man is stupid” she

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.279
says to “fix nature”.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.310
While heartfelt, it seems… a little scripted.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.439
I mean, her teacher even admitted to giving
her a script.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.500
But who is this Koko, anyway?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.200
Koko is probably the world’s most famous
gorilla.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.810
She’s a western lowland gorilla who rose
to fame in the 1980s with her amazing ability

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.480
to speak using American sign language...and
for her love of kittens.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.690
Since then she’s become a celebrity and
icon for gorilla conservation.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.610
She was born at the San Francisco Zoo on July
4th, 1971.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.300
She’s been working with teacher Dr. Penny
Patterson, then a doctoral student in developmental

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.530
psychology at Stanford university, since she
was just a year old.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.220
Within two weeks of working together Koko
had learned the signs for eat and drink.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.400
Since then Koko has spent over 30 years living
in the hills near Santa Cruz as part of the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.190
Gorilla Foundation, started by Dr. Patterson.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.630
She now uses over 1100 signs and even combines
them to make up her own words.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.080
For example, she signed “finger bracelet”
to describe a ring.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.930
But, back to the viral video.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.180
In spite of what she’s signing, Koko probably
doesn’t understand climate change.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.680
Frans de Waal, director of Emory University's
Living Links primate research center, told

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.700
the Huffington Post that "Koko's human-coached
message goes well beyond anything that a gorilla

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.600
understands or cares about.”

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.270
While she may not know much about climate
change, Koko does know a lot about language.Gestures

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.300
are something gorillas do naturally, according
to one study published in the journal Animal

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.430
Cognition.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.100
And the researchers note that the way apes
use this kind of “language” reflects some

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
understanding of the audience.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.040
For example, if an ape makes a series of gestures
and its “audience,” (other apes), understand

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.460
it, that ape will continue to make the same
gestures.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.210
If the other ape conveys confusion, the first
ape will try other gestures.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.850
This suggests that apes might have some sort
of theory of mind, or the understanding that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.370
others might have different intentions, desires,
or thoughts.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.980
It sounds simple, but only a few animals on
this planet can do it.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
So maybe gorillas li Koko have some sense
of what's going on in other’s minds.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.230
But surprisingly most apes fail another test
of animal cognition, the mirror test.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.460
This tests how self-aware animals are by seeing
whether they recognize themselves in a mirror.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.580
Gorillas, while supposedly highly intelligent,
fail the mirror test.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.780
Now, this might not be due to lack of intelligence
- eye contact in the gorilla world is seen

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.420
as an act of aggression.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.470
Either way, Koko, who has been raised mostly
with her teacher and around humans who make

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.220
eye contact, passes the mirror test...she
even uses a mirror as a tool to groom herself.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.640
She even seems to experience grief and memory.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.320
After the loss of her beloved kitten “All
Ball”, she signed the words “bad, sad,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.250
bad” and “frown, cry, frown”.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.850
It’s a loss she still refers to decades
later.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.520
She made headlines yet again when she heard
of the passing of Robin Williams, who she

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.709
once met.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.570
According to a spokeswoman for the Gorilla
foundation, “Koko became very somber, with

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.010
her head bowed and her lip quivering.”

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.040
She signed “woman” and “crying.”

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.959
While she may or may not have remembered meeting
him, it seems she at least was picking up

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:18.970
on her teacher’s sadness.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.780
So, in the end, that viral video might be
a little staged...but come on, what viral

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.230
video these days isn’t?

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.780
Koko has been a great icon for animal conservation.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.310
And she’s permanently changed the way we
understand animal intelligence.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.849
Her abilities have opened the door to true
cross-species communication.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.660
That’s something you can’t fake.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.660
CTA video

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.880
Animal emotions probably aren’t news to
you, especially if you have man’s best friend

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.070
curled up on your lap as your watch this video.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.709
Dog owners have been saying it for years:
"Dogs are really just four-legged, furry humans."

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.319
And now science backs it up!

00:03:50.319 --> 00:04:01.390
To find out more, check out this episode right
here.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:13.470
If you could communicate to an animal, which
would it be?
