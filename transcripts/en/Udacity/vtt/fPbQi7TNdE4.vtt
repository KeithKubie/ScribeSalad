To promote regular sleep, there's a variety of techniques to aid better sleep

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:08.800
patterns. You should go to bed at the same time each night, and rise at the

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.320
same time each morning. You should sleep in a quiet and dark room that's not

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.019
too hot or too cold. You should make your bed comfortable, and use it only for

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.548
sleeping. Not other activities, such as reading, watching TV, or listening to

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:28.614
music, or even studying. You should remove all TVs. Computers and other gadgets

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:33.047
from the bedroom. At the very least, turn them off. Avoid large meals before

00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:38.910
bedtime. Avoid caffeine, nicotine and alcohol four to six hours before bed.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.516
Don't exercise within two hours before bedtime. Don't nap late in the

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:47.519
afternoon. If you can't fall asleep, get up and do something else. And make

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.181
it's relaxing. Oh, and about 30 minutes before bed, you should try to start

00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:53.849
winding down, get into a routine.
