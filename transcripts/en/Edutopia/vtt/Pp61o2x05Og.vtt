&gt;&gt;David: When I first started in
high school, I wasn't that focused.

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:25.996
I failed a lot of my
classes starting out.

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:31.256
I was into graffiti, and you could
find me painting on anything standing

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:35.016
up -- trains, walls, just a long
list of things I did not own.

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:39.456
&gt;&gt;And it wasn't until my
junior year of high school.

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:44.886
I walked into the classroom
of Mr. Sullivan.

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:49.606
Mr. Sullivan introduced me to a
new art form called animation.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:52.036
Now, it wasn't new,
but it was new to me.

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:53.716
It was a new tool to use.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.996
&gt;&gt;David: Meeting Sullivan, it was
like a switch that just clicked,

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:01.146
and he just simply told me that I
didn't need to create in railyards.

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:03.996
I didn't need to create in back
alleys in the dark in the middle

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:07.116
of the night, that I could create
things that people will appreciate,

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:10.596
that it can take me places beyond
my neighborhood and the city.

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:14.166
So my perspective completely
changed about my art

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:17.816
and also what it could do to
change my life and other lives.

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:19.756
&gt;&gt;I remember this reporter asking me.

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.206
So I said, "I call
it Rhythm and Hue."

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:23.706
"How does it work?"

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:24.836
I said, "It's simple.

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:26.316
I take some brushes.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.626
I line up my paints, my canvas.

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:35.096
I turn on the music, and I let
the music paint the portrait."

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:37.306
"And he says, "How
does the crowd react?"

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.706
I said, "The crowd makes
a lot of noise too."

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:46.766
&gt;&gt;David: One of the things that
stick out to me that I learned

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.766
in high school was
how to be tenacious,

00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:52.016
and I remember Sean Sullivan.

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:54.426
He said, "Look up the
word 'tenacity.'"

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:56.676
And I said, "What does that mean?"

00:01:56.676 --> 00:01:59.836
Tenacity, I had never--
It was like a new sound.

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:01.126
I was like, "What language is that?"

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:03.456
But I looked it up, and
it was sort of, you know,

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.976
being tenacious is just not stopping,
you know, always having a momentum

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.386
and going after the things that
are sort of living in your heart.

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:12.916
And that was something
that was brought out of me.

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:17.416
That was something that was
taught to me through example.

00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:23.466
&gt;&gt;When it came to the end of high
school, I couldn't graduate on time.

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:27.996
So now, after high school, I'm living
from place to place, working odd job

00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:30.426
to odd job, and I was so frustrated.

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:32.256
I was living in this little
one-bedroom apartment.

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:33.556
I was sitting on the couch,

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:37.356
frustrated with the
direction of my life.

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:39.556
&gt;&gt;David: And it really
wasn't until a few years

00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:43.266
after high school I started employing
the creativity that was living inside

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:47.646
of me, but also employing the
tools that were given to me

00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:50.596
through these art academies
at Sheldon High School.

00:02:50.596 --> 00:02:51.166
[ Music playing ]

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:58.036
&gt;&gt;David: 2003 I started
teaching myself how to paint.

00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:01.326
I started turning my illustrations
and all these figure drawings

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:05.476
that I had been doing in my
animation classes into paintings,

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:11.296
and that led to starting to paint
live in jazz clubs and nightclubs

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:14.386
and eventually developing into
this performance painting show.

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:18.226
So it was-- I definitely
took an unconventional path

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:24.346
after high school, but I give all the
credit to the tools that I had gained

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:30.516
through the art academies
at Sheldon High School.
