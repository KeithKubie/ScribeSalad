00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.370
We mentioned this several times,
but the SW in the resource folder name

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.380
stands for smallest width.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.140
To drive home that point,
let's walk through

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.760
a hypothetical situation.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.180
Say you have an app
directory structure like this.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.700
We have some layouts defined
in the base layout folder,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.700
and we override some of those
in the layout-sw600dp folder.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.370
We also override one of these
in the layout-sw720dp folder.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.170
Let's look at which layouts
would be applied on which device.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.420
Say your app is running on a Nexxus 5.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.420
The Nexxus 5 has dimensions
360dp x 640dp.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.360
Of the two, the smallest width is 360dp.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.380
So we use this number to compare it 
against the folder names.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.030
360dp is less than 600
and is less than 720,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.470
so all the layouts will come
from the space layout folder.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.430
For the Nexus 7 2012 version,
the dimensions are 600dp x 960dp.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.856
Of the two sides
600dp is the smaller width.

00:00:53.856 --> 00:00:56.140
So you compare this
against the folder names.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.044
It turns out that the smallest width
is better than or equal to 600dp,

00:01:00.044 --> 00:01:03.360
so for the detail and the item layouts, 
we pull it from this folder.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.160
Now the main.xml file
is not declared in this folder,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.190
so we fall back to a less specific folder, 
which turns out to be this one

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.578
in the base layout folder.

00:01:10.578 --> 00:01:14.590
For the Nexus 10 the dimensions
are 800dp x 1280dp.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.810
Of the two sides, 
800dp is the smallest width.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.190
Now this device satisfies
the categories for all of these

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.390
because 800 is greater than 720
and greater than 600.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.400
However, the system chooses 
the most specific folder first.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.200
So it will choose this item layout
over these two.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.050
Since the detail layout 
is not defined here,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.370
it will fall back to a less 
specific folder, which is this one.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
Then for the main.xml file, 
it's not declared in either of these,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.220
so it falls back to this one.
