Android developer just currently doing a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
Android developer just currently doing a
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.860
Android developer just currently doing a
bunch of different projects right now

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
bunch of different projects right now
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.070
bunch of different projects right now
and loving it so I've been doing Android

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
and loving it so I've been doing Android
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.939
and loving it so I've been doing Android
for about five years and I've never been

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
for about five years and I've never been
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.300
for about five years and I've never been
into design really so I've just recently

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
into design really so I've just recently
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.570
into design really so I've just recently
got into design and I'm super excited to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
got into design and I'm super excited to
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580
got into design and I'm super excited to
kind of share what I've been learning so

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
kind of share what I've been learning so
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.709
kind of share what I've been learning so
I guess we should jump in here is

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
I guess we should jump in here is
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.709
I guess we should jump in here is
everyone here a developer is anyone a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
everyone here a developer is anyone a
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.670
everyone here a developer is anyone a
designer would you say awesome do you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
designer would you say awesome do you
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.869
designer would you say awesome do you
sketch you do you alright great so

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879
sketch you do you alright great so
 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.490
sketch you do you alright great so
sketch three if you don't know is a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
sketch three if you don't know is a
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950
sketch three if you don't know is a
design tool from Bohemia encoders that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
design tool from Bohemia encoders that
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420
design tool from Bohemia encoders that
it's kind of sweeping the industry right

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
it's kind of sweeping the industry right
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.670
it's kind of sweeping the industry right
now it's a screen design tool so it's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
now it's a screen design tool so it's
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580
now it's a screen design tool so it's
basically just for static screens and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
basically just for static screens and
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.080
basically just for static screens and
final assets or mock-ups it's not a

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090
final assets or mock-ups it's not a
 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.010
final assets or mock-ups it's not a
interaction design so it doesn't do

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
interaction design so it doesn't do
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.759
interaction design so it doesn't do
motion like pixate and it's it's very

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
motion like pixate and it's it's very
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.460
motion like pixate and it's it's very
geared towards screen design so you know

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
geared towards screen design so you know
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960
geared towards screen design so you know
it's it's not if you need to manipulate

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
it's it's not if you need to manipulate
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.830
it's it's not if you need to manipulate
a photo to make it to airbrush it or

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
a photo to make it to airbrush it or
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.240
a photo to make it to airbrush it or
something it's not going to be as good

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
something it's not going to be as good
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.600
something it's not going to be as good
as Photoshop but it's going to be a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610
as Photoshop but it's going to be a
 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.190
as Photoshop but it's going to be a
thousand times better at designing an

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
thousand times better at designing an
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109
thousand times better at designing an
appt than photoshop is in my opinion and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
appt than photoshop is in my opinion and
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.880
appt than photoshop is in my opinion and
a lot cheaper so why talk about sketch

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
a lot cheaper so why talk about sketch
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.120
a lot cheaper so why talk about sketch
at all and and I think that this quote

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
at all and and I think that this quote
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859
at all and and I think that this quote
from Roman Nurik really kind of sums it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
from Roman Nurik really kind of sums it
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780
from Roman Nurik really kind of sums it
up of why I think this is an important

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
up of why I think this is an important
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.480
up of why I think this is an important
topic and that's designer as chief

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
topic and that's designer as chief
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.429
topic and that's designer as chief
curator and I think this is the way

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
curator and I think this is the way
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499
curator and I think this is the way
we're seeing teams work more and more

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
we're seeing teams work more and more
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080
we're seeing teams work more and more
that everyone is kind of bringing ideas

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
that everyone is kind of bringing ideas
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.139
that everyone is kind of bringing ideas
together and the designer is the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
together and the designer is the
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.139
together and the designer is the
guardrails and make sure you know what

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
guardrails and make sure you know what
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.120
guardrails and make sure you know what
is getting put out there is really

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
is getting put out there is really
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510
is getting put out there is really
cohesive and solves the problem on a lot

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
cohesive and solves the problem on a lot
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340
cohesive and solves the problem on a lot
of agile teams I think most people would

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
of agile teams I think most people would
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.459
of agile teams I think most people would
say they're doing agile I I noticed that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
say they're doing agile I I noticed that
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.700
say they're doing agile I I noticed that
the designer is still kind of he's not

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
the designer is still kind of he's not
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.310
the designer is still kind of he's not
embedded or included as much as they

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
embedded or included as much as they
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.280
embedded or included as much as they
should be she's often times kind of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
should be she's often times kind of
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.030
should be she's often times kind of
given the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
given the
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.369
given the
and maybe there's a design meeting where

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379
and maybe there's a design meeting where
 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.410
and maybe there's a design meeting where
everyone comes together and reviews the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
everyone comes together and reviews the
 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.800
everyone comes together and reviews the
mocks or maybe there's not maybe

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810
mocks or maybe there's not maybe
 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.860
mocks or maybe there's not maybe
everyone just kind of comes together and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870
everyone just kind of comes together and
 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.209
everyone just kind of comes together and
the designs get handed to you after the

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219
the designs get handed to you after the
 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.179
the designs get handed to you after the
spec goes to to the designer and the

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189
spec goes to to the designer and the
 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.220
spec goes to to the designer and the
problem with that is maybe it's good up

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
problem with that is maybe it's good up
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.720
problem with that is maybe it's good up
front and in the design meeting everyone

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
front and in the design meeting everyone
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.309
front and in the design meeting everyone
thinks oh this looks great you know we

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319
thinks oh this looks great you know we
 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.280
thinks oh this looks great you know we
can do this right away but then once you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
can do this right away but then once you
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.809
can do this right away but then once you
actually start programming it you

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819
actually start programming it you
 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.819
actually start programming it you
realize this is maybe a little

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829
realize this is maybe a little
 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.300
realize this is maybe a little
impossible and so you have to go back to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
impossible and so you have to go back to
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.629
impossible and so you have to go back to
the designer and say oh yeah this was

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639
the designer and say oh yeah this was
 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.910
the designer and say oh yeah this was
kind of messed up here what not well

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
kind of messed up here what not well
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.289
kind of messed up here what not well
they've moved on to something else

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299
they've moved on to something else
 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.990
they've moved on to something else
potentially and the problem is not in

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
potentially and the problem is not in
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.250
potentially and the problem is not in
their head anymore and they've just got

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260
their head anymore and they've just got
 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.599
their head anymore and they've just got
to solve it really quick and get it back

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609
to solve it really quick and get it back
 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.039
to solve it really quick and get it back
to you so they can continue working on

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049
to you so they can continue working on
 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.240
to you so they can continue working on
their thing and usually the problem

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
their thing and usually the problem
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.890
their thing and usually the problem
doesn't get solved in the cohesive way

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
doesn't get solved in the cohesive way
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.409
doesn't get solved in the cohesive way
that it was solved the first time and

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419
that it was solved the first time and
 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.879
that it was solved the first time and
designer is curator puts the

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889
designer is curator puts the
 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.280
designer is curator puts the
responsibility to design on everyone so

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
responsibility to design on everyone so
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.349
responsibility to design on everyone so
everyone understands the design problem

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359
everyone understands the design problem
 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.020
everyone understands the design problem
everyone can actually contribute mocks

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
everyone can actually contribute mocks
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.119
everyone can actually contribute mocks
and contribute assets and I've kind of

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129
and contribute assets and I've kind of
 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.610
and contribute assets and I've kind of
seen that designers that are embedded in

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620
seen that designers that are embedded in
 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.619
seen that designers that are embedded in
design team in development teams where

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629
design team in development teams where
 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.020
design team in development teams where
developers are also contributing the end

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030
developers are also contributing the end
 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.439
developers are also contributing the end
product is much more rich designers

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449
product is much more rich designers
 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.719
product is much more rich designers
unfortunately in the Android world you

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729
unfortunately in the Android world you
 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.509
unfortunately in the Android world you
probably notice if you have an Android

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519
probably notice if you have an Android
 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.979
probably notice if you have an Android
specific designer I think you're kind of

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989
specific designer I think you're kind of
 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.949
specific designer I think you're kind of
in the fortunate minority but most of us

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959
in the fortunate minority but most of us
 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.649
in the fortunate minority but most of us
are designers carry iphones they aren't

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659
are designers carry iphones they aren't
 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.149
are designers carry iphones they aren't
familiar with the coolest Android apps

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159
familiar with the coolest Android apps
 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.830
familiar with the coolest Android apps
and the interactions within those apps

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
and the interactions within those apps
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.050
and the interactions within those apps
and it's just it's up to us to really

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060
and it's just it's up to us to really
 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.879
and it's just it's up to us to really
advocate for Android and make sure we

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889
advocate for Android and make sure we
 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.949
advocate for Android and make sure we
don't just have a port from the iOS app

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959
don't just have a port from the iOS app
 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.319
don't just have a port from the iOS app
or something that looks more like a

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329
or something that looks more like a
 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.349
or something that looks more like a
website or whatnot so designer is chief

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359
website or whatnot so designer is chief
 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.089
website or whatnot so designer is chief
curator I think it's a really important

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099
curator I think it's a really important
 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.330
curator I think it's a really important

say a toolbar at the top and it's got a

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:43.540
say a toolbar at the top and it's got a
 

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.140
say a toolbar at the top and it's got a
you know a rectangle for the toolbar and

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.150
you know a rectangle for the toolbar and
 

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.560
you know a rectangle for the toolbar and
and icons for all the menu items and a

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:50.570
and icons for all the menu items and a
 

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.720
and icons for all the menu items and a
home screen and whatnot you might you

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:52.730
home screen and whatnot you might you
 

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.010
home screen and whatnot you might you
might get on organized so you might want

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.020
might get on organized so you might want
 

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.690
might get on organized so you might want
to select all those things and hit group

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:55.700
to select all those things and hit group
 

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.610
to select all those things and hit group
and then in your layer list you'll just

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:57.620
and then in your layer list you'll just
 

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.980
and then in your layer list you'll just
see one group that says toolbar and you

00:15:59.980 --> 00:15:59.990
see one group that says toolbar and you
 

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.990
see one group that says toolbar and you
could drill down into it think of it

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000
could drill down into it think of it
 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.780
could drill down into it think of it
kind of like a package in Java create

we'll go into this a little bit deeper

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:21.170
we'll go into this a little bit deeper
 

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.800
we'll go into this a little bit deeper
but just know it's it's a way when

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:23.810
but just know it's it's a way when
 

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.990
but just know it's it's a way when

have like an album in the middle and you
 

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.329
have like an album in the middle and you
would swipe it and it would kind of you

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:22.339
would swipe it and it would kind of you
 

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:23.529

separately I thought that was kind of

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:31.309
separately I thought that was kind of
 

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:32.619
separately I thought that was kind of
annoying so maybe that's a little hole

00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:32.629
annoying so maybe that's a little hole
 

00:17:32.629 --> 00:17:34.899
annoying so maybe that's a little hole

your boolean operations we're going to

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:58.460
your boolean operations we're going to
 

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.950
your boolean operations we're going to
go into these a little more in depth

00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960
go into these a little more in depth
 

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.659
go into these a little more in depth
later but they are just extremely

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:01.669
later but they are just extremely
 

00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:04.749
later but they are just extremely
powerful for creating icons and and

00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:04.759
powerful for creating icons and and
 

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:08.320
powerful for creating icons and and
whatnot especially in material you'll

whatnot especially in material you'll
 

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.509

notice that icons are oftentimes very

00:18:10.509 --> 00:18:10.519
notice that icons are oftentimes very

flat that's the style they're supposed
 

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.479
flat that's the style they're supposed

depth most more we're just made up with
 

00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:17.680
depth most more we're just made up with
a bunch of polygons that you put

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:17.690
a bunch of polygons that you put
 

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.269
a bunch of polygons that you put
together and you intersect in a union

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:19.279
together and you intersect in a union
 

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:23.859
together and you intersect in a union
and I know that like seems kind of

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:23.869
and I know that like seems kind of
 

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.629
and I know that like seems kind of
obvious but to me it was like magic when

00:18:25.629 --> 00:18:25.639
obvious but to me it was like magic when
 

00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:28.359
obvious but to me it was like magic when
I learned that oh wow this this clock is

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:28.369
I learned that oh wow this this clock is
 

00:18:28.369 --> 00:18:30.999
I learned that oh wow this this clock is
just like four ovals and four rectangles

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:31.009
just like four ovals and four rectangles
 

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:34.690
just like four ovals and four rectangles
and their position together so very cool

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:34.700
and their position together so very cool
 

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.909
and their position together so very cool
we'll go over that in a minute move

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919
we'll go over that in a minute move
 

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:39.009
we'll go over that in a minute move
things forward and backwards so like

00:18:39.009 --> 00:18:39.019
things forward and backwards so like
 

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:41.259
things forward and backwards so like
this circle here is on top of the square

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:41.269
this circle here is on top of the square
 

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:43.149
this circle here is on top of the square
if i move the circle backwards then it

00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159
if i move the circle backwards then it
 

00:18:43.159 --> 00:18:45.219
if i move the circle backwards then it
would be covered the square would be

00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:45.229
would be covered the square would be
 

00:18:45.229 --> 00:18:47.320
would be covered the square would be
covering the circle pretty standard

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:47.330
covering the circle pretty standard
 

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.609
covering the circle pretty standard
stuff and interacting with layers so you

00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:51.619
stuff and interacting with layers so you
 

00:18:51.619 --> 00:18:53.229
stuff and interacting with layers so you
can select a layer and it will show its

00:18:53.229 --> 00:18:53.239
can select a layer and it will show its
 

00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:56.019
can select a layer and it will show its
handles you can resize by dragging a

00:18:56.019 --> 00:18:56.029
handles you can resize by dragging a
 

00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:58.570
handles you can resize by dragging a
handle you can use the arrow keys I

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:58.580
handle you can use the arrow keys I
 

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.129
handle you can use the arrow keys I
think this is pretty cool you can use

00:19:00.129 --> 00:19:00.139
think this is pretty cool you can use
 

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.989
think this is pretty cool you can use
the arrow keys and move it you know if

00:19:01.989 --> 00:19:01.999
the arrow keys and move it you know if
 

00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:03.639
the arrow keys and move it you know if
you hit the left arrow to move it to the

00:19:03.639 --> 00:19:03.649
you hit the left arrow to move it to the
 

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:06.159
you hit the left arrow to move it to the
left x 1 pixel if you hit the right key

00:19:06.159 --> 00:19:06.169
left x 1 pixel if you hit the right key
 

00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:08.379
left x 1 pixel if you hit the right key
to move it to the right x 1 pixel if you

00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:08.389
to move it to the right x 1 pixel if you
 

00:19:08.389 --> 00:19:10.089
to move it to the right x 1 pixel if you
hit shift and you hold the arrow key

00:19:10.089 --> 00:19:10.099
hit shift and you hold the arrow key
 

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:11.830
hit shift and you hold the arrow key
it'll move it by 10 pixels which is

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840
it'll move it by 10 pixels which is
 

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.219
it'll move it by 10 pixels which is
pretty nice but embedded in that little

00:19:15.219 --> 00:19:15.229
pretty nice but embedded in that little
 

00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:16.450
pretty nice but embedded in that little
statement there is something that's kind

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:16.460
statement there is something that's kind
 

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.940
statement there is something that's kind
of cool and you get to design in pixels

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:18.950
of cool and you get to design in pixels
 

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.279
of cool and you get to design in pixels
you don't have to do any math you just

00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:21.289
you don't have to do any math you just
 

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:24.039
you don't have to do any math you just
design an mdpi and when you need to move

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:24.049
design an mdpi and when you need to move
 

00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:25.570
design an mdpi and when you need to move
something over a little bit you just

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:25.580
something over a little bit you just
 

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.879
something over a little bit you just
move it by a pixel and everything gets

00:19:27.879 --> 00:19:27.889
move it by a pixel and everything gets
 

00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:30.070
move it by a pixel and everything gets
scaled up when you export and I'll show

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080
scaled up when you export and I'll show
 

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.169
scaled up when you export and I'll show
you how to do that here in a minute but

00:19:32.169 --> 00:19:32.179
you how to do that here in a minute but
 

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:34.899
you how to do that here in a minute but
I think that's very nice you can develop

00:19:34.899 --> 00:19:34.909
I think that's very nice you can develop
 

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:36.960
I think that's very nice you can develop
in a different density

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:36.970
in a different density
 

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.460
in a different density
if you want you can do you can develop

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:38.470
if you want you can do you can develop
 

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.700
if you want you can do you can develop
design and xx hdpi you just have to do

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:41.710
design and xx hdpi you just have to do
 

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.520
design and xx hdpi you just have to do
more math I just like the the pixels and

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.530
more math I just like the the pixels and
 

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.080
more math I just like the the pixels and
that's pretty cool I think so keep

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.090
that's pretty cool I think so keep
 

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.180
that's pretty cool I think so keep
moving along here oh yeah and you know

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:51.190
moving along here oh yeah and you know
 

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.539
moving along here oh yeah and you know
if you if you need to actually move an

00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:54.549
if you if you need to actually move an
 

00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:57.240
if you if you need to actually move an
object or a layer by a specific amount

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:57.250
object or a layer by a specific amount
 

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.000
object or a layer by a specific amount
that's kind of a strange amount you

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.010
that's kind of a strange amount you
 

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.289
that's kind of a strange amount you
don't have to use your mouse to drag it

00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:01.299
don't have to use your mouse to drag it
 

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:02.700
don't have to use your mouse to drag it
by that amount you can actually put

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:02.710
by that amount you can actually put
 

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.850
by that amount you can actually put
expressions in your inspector right here

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:05.860
expressions in your inspector right here
 

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.340
expressions in your inspector right here
like so I put plus 13 right here and it

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.350
like so I put plus 13 right here and it
 

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.260
like so I put plus 13 right here and it
moved it over to the right by 13 and if

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.270
moved it over to the right by 13 and if
 

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.450
moved it over to the right by 13 and if
I needed to move it 13 also down I could

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:12.460
I needed to move it 13 also down I could
 

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.940
I needed to move it 13 also down I could
do that that's really helpful for when

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:14.950
do that that's really helpful for when
 

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.169
do that that's really helpful for when
you have two layers you need to move

00:20:16.169 --> 00:20:16.179
you have two layers you need to move
 

00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:18.149
you have two layers you need to move
them at the same amount and you can put

00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159
them at the same amount and you can put
 

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:19.590
them at the same amount and you can put
expressions in there I think that's very

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600
expressions in there I think that's very
 

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.649
expressions in there I think that's very
cool you can also duplicate a layer

00:20:22.649 --> 00:20:22.659
cool you can also duplicate a layer
 

00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:25.560
cool you can also duplicate a layer
which becomes very powerful as we'll see

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:25.570
which becomes very powerful as we'll see
 

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.970
which becomes very powerful as we'll see
when we're creating an icon here in a

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:26.980
when we're creating an icon here in a
 

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:33.210
when we're creating an icon here in a
minute you can hide and show a layer as

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:33.220
minute you can hide and show a layer as
 

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.399
minute you can hide and show a layer as
you see this little eyeball here that's

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:35.409
you see this little eyeball here that's
 

00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:37.200
you see this little eyeball here that's
pretty helpful if you you've got a very

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.210
pretty helpful if you you've got a very
 

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.210
pretty helpful if you you've got a very
busy design and you need to focus on

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:39.220
busy design and you need to focus on
 

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.710
busy design and you need to focus on
this one little piece here you'll hide a

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720
this one little piece here you'll hide a
 

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.890
this one little piece here you'll hide a
bunch of layers it's a pretty standard

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:43.900
bunch of layers it's a pretty standard
 

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.539
bunch of layers it's a pretty standard
tool and most design tools but I just

00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:45.549
tool and most design tools but I just
 

00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:48.210
tool and most design tools but I just
kind of want to give an overview and you

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:48.220
kind of want to give an overview and you
 

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.320
kind of want to give an overview and you
can lock a layer this is really

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:49.330
can lock a layer this is really
 

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.240
can lock a layer this is really
important for background layers is what

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:51.250
important for background layers is what
 

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.970
important for background layers is what
I find because you know everything is

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:53.980
I find because you know everything is
 

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.020
I find because you know everything is
going to be on top of the background

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.030
going to be on top of the background
 

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.760
going to be on top of the background
layer and when you start selecting

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:56.770
layer and when you start selecting
 

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.680
layer and when you start selecting
around with your mouse you'll often

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:58.690
around with your mouse you'll often
 

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.159
around with your mouse you'll often
times accidentally select your

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:02.169
times accidentally select your
 

00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:03.659
times accidentally select your
background layer and move it and then

00:21:03.659 --> 00:21:03.669
background layer and move it and then
 

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:05.159
background layer and move it and then
it's in the wrong spot and you have to

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:05.169
it's in the wrong spot and you have to
 

00:21:05.169 --> 00:21:08.010
it's in the wrong spot and you have to
control Z and blah blah so very

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.020
control Z and blah blah so very
 

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.840
control Z and blah blah so very
important to lock the background layer

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:09.850
important to lock the background layer
 

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.580
important to lock the background layer
or any layer that you don't want moved

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:11.590
or any layer that you don't want moved
 

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.610
or any layer that you don't want moved
while you're moving stuff around so just

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:14.620
while you're moving stuff around so just
 

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.149
while you're moving stuff around so just
a continuing with that interacting with

00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159
a continuing with that interacting with
 

00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:20.190
a continuing with that interacting with
layers here as as you can see I've

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200
layers here as as you can see I've
 

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.270
layers here as as you can see I've
grouped these two this oval and this

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280
grouped these two this oval and this
 

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.560
grouped these two this oval and this
rectangle here and it creates a folder

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:25.570
rectangle here and it creates a folder
 

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.590
rectangle here and it creates a folder
on the on the layer list kind of keeps

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600
on the on the layer list kind of keeps
 

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:35.130
on the on the layer list kind of keeps
it organized and here's my inspector if

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:35.140
it organized and here's my inspector if
 

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.470
it organized and here's my inspector if
I select a layer I get all kinds of

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480
I select a layer I get all kinds of
 

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.080
I select a layer I get all kinds of
options I can put a an inner shadow and

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.090
options I can put a an inner shadow and
 

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.919
options I can put a an inner shadow and
outer shadow a border fill all the

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:43.929
outer shadow a border fill all the
 

00:21:43.929 --> 00:21:46.950
outer shadow a border fill all the
various join types can be edited here

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960
various join types can be edited here
 

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.590
various join types can be edited here
which are kind of a complex way to say

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600
which are kind of a complex way to say
 

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.820
which are kind of a complex way to say
like how it's

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:50.830
like how it's
 

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.470
like how it's
drawn together when you intersect our

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480
drawn together when you intersect our
 

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.000
drawn together when you intersect our
boolean objects and you can edit the

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.010
boolean objects and you can edit the
 

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.730
boolean objects and you can edit the
colors by dragging you can select a

00:21:59.730 --> 00:21:59.740
colors by dragging you can select a
 

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.060
colors by dragging you can select a
color with an eyedropper just the the

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.070
color with an eyedropper just the the
 

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.430
color with an eyedropper just the the
power of their inspector is really

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440
power of their inspector is really
 

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.049
power of their inspector is really
incredible for how cheap this tool is

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:07.059
incredible for how cheap this tool is
 

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:10.409
incredible for how cheap this tool is
and and in just that it's such a new

00:22:10.409 --> 00:22:10.419
and and in just that it's such a new
 

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:12.299
and and in just that it's such a new
tool they've really got everything

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:12.309
tool they've really got everything
 

00:22:12.309 --> 00:22:14.310
tool they've really got everything
covered a Gaussian blur they don't have

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320
covered a Gaussian blur they don't have
 

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.409
covered a Gaussian blur they don't have
a lot of different filter types you can

00:22:16.409 --> 00:22:16.419
a lot of different filter types you can
 

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:18.720
a lot of different filter types you can
put on an object so a filter type would

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:18.730
put on an object so a filter type would
 

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.970
put on an object so a filter type would
be like I filled this circle here with

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:20.980
be like I filled this circle here with
 

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.960
be like I filled this circle here with
red but I could do it like a Gaussian

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:24.970
red but I could do it like a Gaussian
 

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.750
red but I could do it like a Gaussian
blur and it would put a gradient in a

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760
blur and it would put a gradient in a
 

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.909
blur and it would put a gradient in a
certain way we kind of look fuzzy well

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919
certain way we kind of look fuzzy well
 

00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:33.680
certain way we kind of look fuzzy well
you can also put a texture on it and

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:33.690
you can also put a texture on it and
 

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.259
you can also put a texture on it and
there's not a lot of textures and sketch

00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:37.269
there's not a lot of textures and sketch
 

00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:39.330
there's not a lot of textures and sketch
so if you if you needed like a special

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.340
so if you if you needed like a special
 

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.740
so if you if you needed like a special
texture you might actually have to use

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:40.750
texture you might actually have to use
 

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.810
texture you might actually have to use
photoshop in that way they only have

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:42.820
photoshop in that way they only have
 

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.220
photoshop in that way they only have
like very basic one boolean operations

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:47.230
like very basic one boolean operations
 

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.310
like very basic one boolean operations
so this is kind of what I was talking

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320
so this is kind of what I was talking
 

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.750
so this is kind of what I was talking
about where when you need to develop

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760
about where when you need to develop
 

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.090
about where when you need to develop
something like an icon and how they're

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:54.100
something like an icon and how they're
 

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.070
something like an icon and how they're
just polygons that you kind of put

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080
just polygons that you kind of put
 

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.399
just polygons that you kind of put
together so you have Union which will

00:22:59.399 --> 00:22:59.409
together so you have Union which will
 

00:22:59.409 --> 00:23:01.019
together so you have Union which will
just take two objects and put them

00:23:01.019 --> 00:23:01.029
just take two objects and put them
 

00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:02.580
just take two objects and put them
together and the left will win out and

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:02.590
together and the left will win out and
 

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.820
together and the left will win out and
it'll be the same color you have a

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:05.830
it'll be the same color you have a
 

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.980
it'll be the same color you have a
subtract which will take whatever is on

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:07.990
subtract which will take whatever is on
 

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:11.190
subtract which will take whatever is on
top and and erase that from what's ever

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200
top and and erase that from what's ever
 

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.879
top and and erase that from what's ever
on the bottom there's an intersect I

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:14.889
on the bottom there's an intersect I
 

00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:16.350
on the bottom there's an intersect I
think that one's pretty obvious you know

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360
think that one's pretty obvious you know
 

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.649
think that one's pretty obvious you know
you remember set theory and there's a

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:19.659
you remember set theory and there's a
 

00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:21.149
you remember set theory and there's a
difference which it basically does the

00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159
difference which it basically does the
 

00:23:21.159 --> 00:23:23.009
difference which it basically does the
same thing as a union but on the on the

00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:23.019
same thing as a union but on the on the
 

00:23:23.019 --> 00:23:26.669
same thing as a union but on the on the
right so actually i might have said that

00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679
right so actually i might have said that
 

00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:30.000
right so actually i might have said that
wrong for difference but but here's

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.010
wrong for difference but but here's
 

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.409
wrong for difference but but here's
something i made here with boolean

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:31.419
something i made here with boolean
 

00:23:31.419 --> 00:23:35.180
something i made here with boolean
operations does anyone know what this is

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:35.190
operations does anyone know what this is
 

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:40.830
operations does anyone know what this is
yes it's a clock I got it right people

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840
yes it's a clock I got it right people
 

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.190
yes it's a clock I got it right people
knew it's awesome so yeah like I said

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200
knew it's awesome so yeah like I said
 

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.180
knew it's awesome so yeah like I said
this is just for circles and four

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:48.190
this is just for circles and four
 

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.149
this is just for circles and four
rectangles what i did was i just created

00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159
rectangles what i did was i just created
 

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:53.700
rectangles what i did was i just created
a an oval here it's just a filled it

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:53.710
a an oval here it's just a filled it
 

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.519
a an oval here it's just a filled it
with black remove the border and then i

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:56.529
with black remove the border and then i
 

00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:58.620
with black remove the border and then i
made a copy of it so i made a copy of

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:58.630
made a copy of it so i made a copy of
 

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.870
made a copy of it so i made a copy of
that oval its same size right on top and

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880
that oval its same size right on top and
 

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.549
that oval its same size right on top and
i went in the inspector and just resized

00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559
i went in the inspector and just resized
 

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:04.649
i went in the inspector and just resized
it about 20 pixels down

00:24:04.649 --> 00:24:04.659
it about 20 pixels down
 

00:24:04.659 --> 00:24:06.989
it about 20 pixels down
so you can't see it because it's it's

00:24:06.989 --> 00:24:06.999
so you can't see it because it's it's
 

00:24:06.999 --> 00:24:08.999
so you can't see it because it's it's
also filled here but there's another

00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:09.009
also filled here but there's another
 

00:24:09.009 --> 00:24:10.589
also filled here but there's another
circle in the middle that's it's black

00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:10.599
circle in the middle that's it's black
 

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:13.109
circle in the middle that's it's black
and then I Union them together I select

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:13.119
and then I Union them together I select
 

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.580
and then I Union them together I select
both ovals and I you knew them together

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:14.590
both ovals and I you knew them together
 

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.419
both ovals and I you knew them together
and it creates the outer rim then i've

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:18.429
and it creates the outer rim then i've
 

00:24:18.429 --> 00:24:21.659
and it creates the outer rim then i've
made a copy of the big circle and scaled

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:21.669
made a copy of the big circle and scaled
 

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.190

would have it in five different places

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:55.330
would have it in five different places
 

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.180
would have it in five different places
and then we could go to the design

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:57.190
and then we could go to the design
 

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.580
and then we could go to the design
meeting and the and the designer is

a little rectangle in the front and in
 

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.280
a little rectangle in the front and in
my design I only have the room for the

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:23.290
my design I only have the room for the
 

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.920
my design I only have the room for the
rectangle for the bitmap so what I need

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:25.930
rectangle for the bitmap so what I need
 

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.930
rectangle for the bitmap so what I need
to do is select both of these as I have

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:27.940
to do is select both of these as I have
 

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.370

done you can seem highlighted in the

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:29.380
done you can seem highlighted in the
 

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.900
done you can seem highlighted in the
layer list and resize that bitmap and as

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:33.910
layer list and resize that bitmap and as
 

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.050
layer list and resize that bitmap and as
you can see what you see now that I've

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.060
you can see what you see now that I've

masted the bitmap of Martius duarte is

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:41.290
masted the bitmap of Martius duarte is
 

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:45.000
masted the bitmap of Martius duarte is
in the middle here and that's actually

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.010
in the middle here and that's actually
 

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.490
in the middle here and that's actually
the rectangle that I clipped you and the

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:47.500
the rectangle that I clipped you and the
 

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.230
the rectangle that I clipped you and the
bitmap is still kind of visible on the

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240
bitmap is still kind of visible on the
 

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.300
bitmap is still kind of visible on the
outside with the rectangle and I can

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:51.310
outside with the rectangle and I can
 

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.240
outside with the rectangle and I can
resize those corners and and you just

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.250
resize those corners and and you just
 

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.620
resize those corners and and you just
kind of have to picture that there's a

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:55.630
kind of have to picture that there's a
 

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.080
kind of have to picture that there's a
little window you're looking through to

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.090
little window you're looking through to
 

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.150
little window you're looking through to
see the bitmap as you're moving it

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:00.160
see the bitmap as you're moving it
 

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.580
see the bitmap as you're moving it
around so just really powerful for like

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:02.590
around so just really powerful for like
 

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.860
around so just really powerful for like
if you needed a profile picture in the

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:04.870
if you needed a profile picture in the
 

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.260
if you needed a profile picture in the
shape of a circle you would just draw an

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:07.270
shape of a circle you would just draw an
 

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.000
shape of a circle you would just draw an
oval and put the bitmap behind it and

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.010
oval and put the bitmap behind it and
 

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:11.700
oval and put the bitmap behind it and
then mask them and then you can move it

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:11.710
then mask them and then you can move it
 

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.430
then mask them and then you can move it
around and get it right in the face

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440
around and get it right in the face
 

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.870
around and get it right in the face
although when you go to develop it the

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880
although when you go to develop it the
 

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.030
although when you go to develop it the
bitmap never looks right and like the

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.040
bitmap never looks right and like the
 

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.290
bitmap never looks right and like the
face is half cut off and then you got to

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:22.300
face is half cut off and then you got to
 

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.970
face is half cut off and then you got to
use the facial recognition but then it's

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:23.980
use the facial recognition but then it's
 

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.900
use the facial recognition but then it's
slow and I'm just kidding my jokes are

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:27.910
slow and I'm just kidding my jokes are
 

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.410
slow and I'm just kidding my jokes are
great today

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:30.420

children's cartoon and they had a very
 

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.140
children's cartoon and they had a very
small budget so I got to do the design i

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.150
small budget so I got to do the design i
 

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.690
small budget so I got to do the design i
got paid to do design for the first time

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:51.700

three pick three styles and just see if

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:21.340
three pick three styles and just see if
 

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.670
three pick three styles and just see if
you can make the whole design with that

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:23.680
you can make the whole design with that
 

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.370
you can make the whole design with that
and if you if you can't if you need a

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:26.380
and if you if you can't if you need a
 

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.410
and if you if you can't if you need a
fourth that's fine if you can only do it

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:28.420
fourth that's fine if you can only do it
 

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.870
fourth that's fine if you can only do it
with two that's even better but just

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880
with two that's even better but just
 

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.300
with two that's even better but just
having that idea like every time I went

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:33.310
having that idea like every time I went
 

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.270
having that idea like every time I went
to go make new textile had a new style

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:35.280
to go make new textile had a new style
 

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.650
to go make new textile had a new style
so just limiting it to three and then

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:37.660
so just limiting it to three and then
 

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.880
so just limiting it to three and then
the other one is to create shared shared

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:41.890
the other one is to create shared shared
 

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:51.210
the other one is to create shared shared
styles and we shared styles you you know

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:51.220
styles and we shared styles you you know
 

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.500
styles and we shared styles you you know
you basically have to think of about it

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:52.510
you basically have to think of about it
 

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.170
you basically have to think of about it
like styles in android if you know

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:55.180
like styles in android if you know
 

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.310
like styles in android if you know
you're going to use a header style

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320
you're going to use a header style
 

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.650
you're going to use a header style
everywhere you want to you want to when

00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:58.660
everywhere you want to you want to when
 

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.690
everywhere you want to you want to when
you create your text go over to the

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:00.700
you create your text go over to the
 

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.580
you create your text go over to the
inspector menu here and create a style

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:02.590
inspector menu here and create a style
 

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.620
inspector menu here and create a style
as you can see how header style for this

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:04.630
as you can see how header style for this
 

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.420
as you can see how header style for this
style and then when you're out

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:06.430
style and then when you're out
 

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.880
style and then when you're out
developing something else you can select

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:08.890
developing something else you can select
 

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.830
developing something else you can select
the the new text that you're doing and

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840
the the new text that you're doing and
 

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.290
the the new text that you're doing and
then come here in the inspector menu and

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:13.300
then come here in the inspector menu and
 

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.510
then come here in the inspector menu and
like I said I've got footer textures

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520
like I said I've got footer textures
 

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.920
like I said I've got footer textures
another style it'll actually show you

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:16.930
another style it'll actually show you
 

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.600
another style it'll actually show you
what it looks like in the inspector and

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:18.610
what it looks like in the inspector and
 

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.620
what it looks like in the inspector and
I choose a header textile here and I can

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:22.630
I choose a header textile here and I can
 

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.980
I choose a header textile here and I can
reuse my Styles really powerful and one

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:25.990
reuse my Styles really powerful and one
 

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.750
reuse my Styles really powerful and one
one minor thing with text when you

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760
one minor thing with text when you
 

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.270
one minor thing with text when you
insert text you can do it as auto and

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:30.280
insert text you can do it as auto and
 

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.550
insert text you can do it as auto and
that means that when you type your text

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:32.560
that means that when you type your text
 

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.720
that means that when you type your text
it'll just keep going all the way out to

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:33.730
it'll just keep going all the way out to
 

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.340
it'll just keep going all the way out to
the right if you hit a new line it will

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:35.350
the right if you hit a new line it will
 

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.570
the right if you hit a new line it will
come back this way and you can type

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:36.580
come back this way and you can type
 

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.210
come back this way and you can type
again or you can have it fixed link then

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:39.220
again or you can have it fixed link then
 

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.130
again or you can have it fixed link then
you just drag a rectangle and as you

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.140
you just drag a rectangle and as you
 

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.390
you just drag a rectangle and as you

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160
sketch how about I open sketch here and
 

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:27.749
sketch how about I open sketch here and
we'll just do it so I've open sketch so

00:39:27.749 --> 00:39:27.759
we'll just do it so I've open sketch so
 

00:39:27.759 --> 00:39:29.789
we'll just do it so I've open sketch so
the question was basically like you know

00:39:29.789 --> 00:39:29.799
the question was basically like you know
 

00:39:29.799 --> 00:39:33.299
the question was basically like you know
say i've created a rectangle and say

00:39:33.299 --> 00:39:33.309
say i've created a rectangle and say
 

00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:35.309
say i've created a rectangle and say
I've created an oval just by hitting 0

00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:35.319
I've created an oval just by hitting 0
 

00:39:35.319 --> 00:39:38.999
I've created an oval just by hitting 0
and X and like I need to like organize

00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:39.009
and X and like I need to like organize
 

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:40.589
and X and like I need to like organize
these so they're lined up and you can

00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599
these so they're lined up and you can
 

00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:42.479
these so they're lined up and you can
see there's guidelines as you like move

00:39:42.479 --> 00:39:42.489
see there's guidelines as you like move
 

00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:47.130
see there's guidelines as you like move
stuff around so you can see how like

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:47.140
stuff around so you can see how like
 

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.719
stuff around so you can see how like
sometimes it can be hard with the mouse

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:48.729
sometimes it can be hard with the mouse
 

00:39:48.729 --> 00:39:50.910
sometimes it can be hard with the mouse
because the mouse isn't super precise so

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920
because the mouse isn't super precise so
 

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.739
because the mouse isn't super precise so
one thing you can do is select multiple

00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:52.749
one thing you can do is select multiple
 

00:39:52.749 --> 00:39:55.799
one thing you can do is select multiple
objects and you have this little menu up

00:39:55.799 --> 00:39:55.809
objects and you have this little menu up
 

00:39:55.809 --> 00:39:59.189
objects and you have this little menu up
here gotta hit shift in the in the right

00:39:59.189 --> 00:39:59.199
here gotta hit shift in the in the right
 

00:39:59.199 --> 00:40:01.109
here gotta hit shift in the in the right
that'll help you kind of a line thing so

00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119
that'll help you kind of a line thing so
 

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.130
that'll help you kind of a line thing so
these are both of the line them to the

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:02.140
these are both of the line them to the
 

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.039
these are both of the line them to the
left side the middle you know to the

00:40:05.039 --> 00:40:05.049
left side the middle you know to the
 

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:07.410
left side the middle you know to the
right the tops are aligned and stuff

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:07.420
right the tops are aligned and stuff
 

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.390
right the tops are aligned and stuff
like that so and obviously you can look

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400
like that so and obviously you can look
 

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.759
like that so and obviously you can look
at the inspector to and see okay this

00:40:11.759 --> 00:40:11.769
at the inspector to and see okay this
 

00:40:11.769 --> 00:40:15.870
at the inspector to and see okay this
one is 286 high and you know I need it

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880
one is 286 high and you know I need it
 

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.009
one is 286 high and you know I need it
to be 290 so you plus 4 and then you can

00:40:20.009 --> 00:40:20.019
to be 290 so you plus 4 and then you can
 

00:40:20.019 --> 00:40:23.699
to be 290 so you plus 4 and then you can
make this one 290 also now they're the

00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:23.709
make this one 290 also now they're the
 

00:40:23.709 --> 00:40:25.169
make this one 290 also now they're the
same size but they're not necessarily

00:40:25.169 --> 00:40:25.179
same size but they're not necessarily
 

00:40:25.179 --> 00:40:27.509
same size but they're not necessarily
lined up so you know you want to select

00:40:27.509 --> 00:40:27.519
lined up so you know you want to select
 

00:40:27.519 --> 00:40:30.390
lined up so you know you want to select
it here and line their tops and the same

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400
it here and line their tops and the same
 

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.339
it here and line their tops and the same
so pretty cool and of course the

00:40:35.339 --> 00:40:35.349
so pretty cool and of course the
 

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:36.689
so pretty cool and of course the
questioner said they've only played with

00:40:36.689 --> 00:40:36.699
questioner said they've only played with
 

00:40:36.699 --> 00:40:38.489
questioner said they've only played with
her for 15 minutes it's a very intuitive

00:40:38.489 --> 00:40:38.499
her for 15 minutes it's a very intuitive
 

00:40:38.499 --> 00:40:40.709
her for 15 minutes it's a very intuitive
tool and you know you run into that

00:40:40.709 --> 00:40:40.719
tool and you know you run into that
 

00:40:40.719 --> 00:40:42.630
tool and you know you run into that
little things like that all the time and

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640
little things like that all the time and
 

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.920
little things like that all the time and
it's pretty easy to figure out so yes

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:46.930
it's pretty easy to figure out so yes
 

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:53.549
it's pretty easy to figure out so yes
I I haven't gone too deep so the

00:40:53.549 --> 00:40:53.559
I I haven't gone too deep so the
 

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:55.290
I I haven't gone too deep so the
question was what other plugins besides

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:55.300
question was what other plugins besides
 

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.059
question was what other plugins besides
Zeppelin do I use I haven't gone too

00:40:57.059 --> 00:40:57.069
Zeppelin do I use I haven't gone too
 

00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:59.910
Zeppelin do I use I haven't gone too
deep into other plugins but the plugins

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920
deep into other plugins but the plugins
 

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.520
deep into other plugins but the plugins

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:19.540
Styles built-in to CSS but I'm there's
 

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.720
Styles built-in to CSS but I'm there's
tons of other plugins to that you could

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:21.730
tons of other plugins to that you could
 

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.760
tons of other plugins to that you could
use them that's built in but you there's

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:23.770
use them that's built in but you there's
 

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:43.280
use them that's built in but you there's
other plugins anyone else yes yeah

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:43.290
 

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.900
that's a good question it I don't know

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:45.910
that's a good question it I don't know
 

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.780
that's a good question it I don't know
if I have a good one or not but you know

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:48.790
if I have a good one or not but you know
 

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:52.200
if I have a good one or not but you know
one thing that I like to do is just kind

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:52.210
one thing that I like to do is just kind
 

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.120
one thing that I like to do is just kind
of it's like you're reading a book you

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:54.130
of it's like you're reading a book you
 

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.880
of it's like you're reading a book you
know what happens first is top left

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:56.890
know what happens first is top left
 

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.650
know what happens first is top left
corner and then as it happens it goes

00:41:58.650 --> 00:41:58.660
corner and then as it happens it goes
 

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.140
corner and then as it happens it goes
bottom down right and that's how I

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:01.150
bottom down right and that's how I
 

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.030
bottom down right and that's how I
organize it but I don't know there's

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040
organize it but I don't know there's
 

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.920
organize it but I don't know there's
probably better strategies that's a good

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:04.930
probably better strategies that's a good
 

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:06.210
probably better strategies that's a good
question but the question was how do you

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:06.220
question but the question was how do you
 

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.339
question but the question was how do you
organize your Art boards and that's my

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:08.349
organize your Art boards and that's my
 

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:09.870
organize your Art boards and that's my
strategy just like reading a book top

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880
strategy just like reading a book top
 

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.839
strategy just like reading a book top
two left so like say there's a the first

00:42:12.839 --> 00:42:12.849
two left so like say there's a the first
 

00:42:12.849 --> 00:42:16.770
two left so like say there's a the first
screen is a it's a master-detail and you

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:16.780
screen is a it's a master-detail and you
 

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.120
screen is a it's a master-detail and you
know there's a list on the first screen

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.130
know there's a list on the first screen
 

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.829
know there's a list on the first screen
I would put my detail to the right of it

00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839
I would put my detail to the right of it
 

00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:21.690
I would put my detail to the right of it
and then if you scroll down to that it

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:21.700
and then if you scroll down to that it
 

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.730
and then if you scroll down to that it
might go down one on that level but I

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:23.740
might go down one on that level but I
 

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:35.470
might go down one on that level but I
don't have a good strategy honestly

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480
 

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:48.590
yeah that's a good point yes sir yes I

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:48.600
yeah that's a good point yes sir yes I
 

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.840
yeah that's a good point yes sir yes I
so the question was do you use different

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:50.850
so the question was do you use different
 

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.050
so the question was do you use different
Art boards four different screens and

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:53.060
Art boards four different screens and
 

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.910
