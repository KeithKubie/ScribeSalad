00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.940
We've all been there before: you're in love, you think everything's going great and then...

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.760
Um, we have to break up.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.700
Well, you just lost a fan.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.940
If you found yourself in this situation, I know how you feel.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.780
Sorry

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.819
You can't eat, you can't sleep, all you can do is cry, think about your ex, what went wrong

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.039
And why you're such an unlovable piece of shit

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.858
But listen to me: you're going to be okay. Not now, not anytime soon;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.559
but, eventually, and with the help of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.529
friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends. You need your support network right now more than ever.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.259
So call your friends or family and ask them to come over, or just get on the phone to talk or schedule a lunch or

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.520
dinner or whatever. You're gonna

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.739
have a lot of free time on your schedule between all the crying and crying that you're doing, and that's when you want to lean

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.929
on the people who love you; a lot.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.360
Because that's an opportunity to process this

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.899
relationship without all the negative

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.740
spiraling that you're bound to do in your own time because your support network is gonna say really supportive things that you won't say to

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.220
yourself. Things like:

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.980
"He wasn't right for you.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.180
I didn't say anything at the time, but you know we all knew you guys weren't a great match."

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.048
"You're amazing you're gonna find someone who understands you and appreciates you and wants to work it out."

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.899
"I love you. I'm so sorry this is happening."

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200
"Do you want some tea?"

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.400
When you're not leaning on your friends, pick up old or new hobbies. You're gonna

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.969
have a lot of free time on your hands, as I mentioned, and a very active

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.829
anxious mind to occupy and I please encourage you to not make drinking, smoking, or any other unhealthy form of escapism a hobby.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.290
Because I have done that before and it just prolongs your grieving process gives you a lot of bad tweets.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.670
And, you know, just doesn't make you feel very good so pick up something that you love

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.050
but you haven't tried it in a while, or something that you've always wanted to try. With my blindside breakup,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.880
I finally decided, like, I'm gonna try to cope with this in a very healthy way. And, over the last month

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.709
I read, like, 30 books I spent 40 hours getting reacquainted with drawing and poetry,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.790
meditated twice a day for 20 minutes, took a weekly yoga class, journaled a fuck ton, time saw two therapists and a life coach;

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.290
Yeah, I was, it was a lot.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.699
But, that said, I do know that this breakup is gonna be all you think about all the time so try to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.140
understand what you're going through.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.130
And, if possible, embrace it because chemically, your brain is going through the same withdrawal process as a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.260
cocaine addict. This is why it hurts so bad

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.100
*aaaahhhAaaaaAHAHAhhAAAA*

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.000
Oh God, oh

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.530
Grieving and crying

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.960
suck ass, but they're a very natural part of the process. And I know this is not what anyone wants to hear right now,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.690
it's not what I wanted to hear, but try to take this opportunity as

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.100
something good to transform yourself.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.710
You know, my friend told me to, like, try to make this breakup the best thing that ever happened to me.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.690
And, I know, you like hate them for saying it,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.200
but at the same time if you try to work towards making that statement true

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.570
you take a lot of actions in your life that are really healthy and good for you, because you get to choose how to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.150
handle this breakup, and how you're gonna transform from it.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.859
So, are you gonna be a victim and be like really sad? Longer than necessary, because grieving is important;

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860
Or, are you gonna get the best revenge

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.249
possible by just leveling the fuck up as a person and really empowering yourself and being the most successful greatest version of yourself possible?

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.730
I'm Anna Akana. I'm very sorry that you're hurting and also if you do not know Dodie. Please check her out

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.999
She's an amazing singer/songwriter and an advocate of mental health awareness

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.879
Her book is really great for those of you who have depression. It helped me a lot, and also helped me with my breakup.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.140
She's just fantastic, and if you need a good cry listen to her song '6/10.'
