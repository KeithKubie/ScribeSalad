00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.570
I'm really proud of all that
you've done with Project Compass.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.340
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.680
I had some rough moments but
I definitely learned a lot too.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.280
&gt;&gt; What's your next step?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.900
&gt;&gt; I was thinking that I should
try to learn more about my users,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.060
see how I can reach more people.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.110
&gt;&gt; Sounds like you want
to analyze some data.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.850
That's what data analysts do.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.410
Data analysts make informed
decisions about data.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.590
Let's check it out.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.500
Data analysts solve many
different types of problems.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.650
They identify meaningful relationships,
patterns or trends from datasets.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.770
Data analysts built reports and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.980
data dashboards on mint.com so users
can track and visualize their spending.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.729
They also use applied statistics and
machine learning algorithms.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.610
Facebook's facial recognition software
uses an algorithm to create a template

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.440
based on a person's facial
features to suggest

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.650
who you should tag in your photos.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.370
They also represent data in engaging
ways with data visualizations.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.160
One of my favorite data visualization
blogs is Information is Beautiful.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.380
They take ideas, issues, and
data to create visualizations for

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.480
people to understand complex data.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.120
Netflix, the online movie and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.530
TV streaming service is known
to make data driven decisions.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.630
They analyze data points such as
what time of day movies are watched,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.810
the time spent selecting movies,
and how often playback is stopped,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.390
to predict the perfect
viewing option for users.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.330
Amazon uses big data to drive
their recommendations feature.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.530
They take data points such
as your previous purchases,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.570
the items you add to your cart or

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.181
previous ratings to make suggestions
about products you may be interested in.

00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:44.435
Data analysts at Hired,
created a State of U.S.

00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:49.375
Salary Report to give visibility into
the job market for software engineers.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.745
Let's hear from Jessica,
who worked on this report at Hired.
