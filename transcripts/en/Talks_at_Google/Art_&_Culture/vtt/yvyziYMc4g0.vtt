[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.230
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.810
- Chicago is the
home of the blues.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.430
It's the house of house music.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.470
It's the consciousness
of hip hop.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.750
Chicago is the mixture of
the south with this big city

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.580
sentiment, you know?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.060
Chicago is a city made up
of politics, gangsters,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.479
political activism,
and struggle,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:38.180
beauty, beauty in the struggle,
and music that defines

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.180
the things of all of that.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.460
- Chicago takes hip hop
very, very literal and very,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.400
very serious.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.910
- The Brick Hats,
for example, were

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.230
so ready to battle
Rock Steady, man, they

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.760
slept on the streets of New
York for three days and three

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.390
nights.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.735
They gave props and love.

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:56.360
They were like, those dudes over
there from Chicago doing that.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.740
These dudes were amazing.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.440
- By the time it
started to pick up here,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.630
you know, the city of
New York had already

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.504
been well in advance in fighting
with their war on graffiti.

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:14.870
Chicago wasn't
ready for that yet.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.990
- Hip hop was not only cool and
it was not always everywhere.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.950
And we were a definitive tribe
of outcasts in our own house

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.170
music-dominated city.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.360
- House people hung
with house people.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.010
Hip hop fans hung
with hip hop fans.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.530
There were a few that
kind of did both.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.590
But not-- there was
firing in between.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.270
- You know, I hear this on GCI,
the number one station for hip

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.430
hop and R&amp;B. Well,
that's bullshit

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.800
because they wouldn't play
that when we came out.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.356
We're from the '80s.

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:45.730
- I literally was
at the Bismarck

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
when Little Louis was like,
man, quit asking me to play rap.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.720
Rap music is for people
from the projects.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.490
- College played a
major role in that.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.234
WKKC was killin' in.

00:01:56.234 --> 00:01:58.275
- If you was from the
North Side, you was on NUR.

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:00.925
If you was from the South
Side, which I am, you was HPK.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.950
- I was tired of
hearing, [SINGING]

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.509
Compton's in the
house, New York this.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.110
And when people
talk about Chicago,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.200
they talk about the Buckingham
Fountain, Sears Tower.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.072
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:18.230
The tourist sites.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.660
I'm fixin' to take you
on a real fucking cool.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.510
- See, Chicago hip hop, to me,
was designed as the message.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.750
Like, it had to be-- you had
to come hard with your lyrics.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.310
And then it was about the beats.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.710
- It was Clark,
it was Ski Beatz.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.280
It was Jay, it was James.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.755
And at that time, we
used to have arguments.

00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:40.380
How was better?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.300
Cap D or Jay Z?

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.380
- Twista is one of the
most lyrical mother

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.240
fuckers in the game.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.530
It's just that he's writing four
times more than most rappers

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.580
in order to rap that fast
and still it's more lyrical.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.835
- It was the new sound.

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:58.270
It was like, we was all raw.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.860
New, untouched talent from
the middle of the country.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.930
- And Twista was in the truck
and he said his verse to us.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.320
And I was like, oh, shit.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.470
It's fixin' to change some shit.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.660
- I would go take Twista's
songs and I would go and get

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.100
the lyric sheet and I
would learn the lyrics

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.990
and then spit his verses
just to train my muscles

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.670
to learn how to rap like that.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.256
- One day, he was like, yo, man.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:28.885
I think I want to
change my name.

00:03:28.885 --> 00:03:31.292
I'm like, what do you
want to change it to?

00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:32.554
He's like, Common Sense.

00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:33.970
And I was like,
man, that is dope.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.810
Like, do that shit.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.350
Do it.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.279
- My favorite record, rhyme
for rhyme, is "Resurrection."

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:40.820
When that album came
out, I was like,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.111
nobody's fucking with that guy.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.630
And me being a New
Yorker, at the time,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.100
people used to give me shit.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.920
- Kanye taught us,
as songwriters,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.280
himself, me, GLC,
everybody, Malik Yusef.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.200
He taught us, as songwriters,
how to collaborate.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.005
Kanye is the king
of collaboration.

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.910
- Chicago has just
the game mentality.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.170
That's just, that's
Chicago's mentality.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.050
Chicago is diverse,
in the sense it's

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.460
got a lot of different
people, but they all

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.585
stay in their neighborhood.

00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:10.760
- For real,
especially in Chicago.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.440
All this is gang territory.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.160
But that is what we were
trying to get away from.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.167
Hip hop is-- it
was the key to get

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.000
into a whole lot of
different neighborhoods.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.500
Name

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.069
- Didn't matter
what color you were.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.920
It didn't matter what
language you spoke.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.316
It didn't matter what
neighborhood you were from.

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:29.190
It didn't matter-- ain't
none of that matter.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.826
The only thing that
matters is can you DJ?

00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:33.130
Can you beat boy?

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.055
Can you MC?

00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:35.270
Can you make beats?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.700
All that mattered
was, can you do

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.030
what's required of the culture?

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.144
And I think hip hop broke
down those barriers.

00:04:41.144 --> 00:04:43.310
And I know, for me, it broke
down a lot of barriers.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.450
- Hip hop is not black music.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.870
It's a lifestyle.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.920
That's what hip hop is.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.000
It's a lifestyle.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.860
- You cut from a
special and a different

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.842
cloth when you a Chicagoan.

00:04:53.842 --> 00:04:56.085
I noticed this from
traveling around the world.

00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:58.894
I run into somebody from
Chicago and all of a sudden,

00:04:58.894 --> 00:05:01.560
it's like being part of a secret
society or some shit like that.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.438
- As much as I hate this city,
I can't escape this city.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:09.812
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:16.130
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.939
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:20.980
THE FRANCHIISE: So that
was actually the premiere

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.900
of the sizzle reel.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.410
It's the first time that
anyone's had a chance to see it

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.390
and I just got so excited
for our discussion,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.520
especially as someone
originally from Atlanta,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.600
but is so heavily immersed in
the hip hop scene in Chicago.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.440
I'm so interested in
learning about the beginnings

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.210
of the success stories that
we see today with Kanye West

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.710
and Chance the Rapper.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.370
So without further ado, let's
welcome our panelists, Midway.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.870
All right.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.610
So why don't you tell us a bit
about how the film came about?

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.946
What started the project?

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:54.320
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Well, what
kind of makes everybody laugh

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.690
now is that it was a
project for me to get out

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.427
of the corporate grind
that I was doing.

00:05:59.427 --> 00:06:01.010
I was working for a
marketing company.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.360
It was just kind of
sucking the soul out of

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.734
me and I wanted
to do something--

00:06:03.734 --> 00:06:07.460
I wanted to do something--
music and film and hip hop

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.980
have always been right there
towards the top of everything

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.313
that I've ever been involved in.

00:06:11.313 --> 00:06:12.740
So this is one
thing that kind of

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.757
combined all that, along
with me being a history nerd

00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:16.590
and everything else.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.048
And I was a journalist
at one time,

00:06:18.048 --> 00:06:20.090
so it kind of combines
all that stuff.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.580
And I think the
catalyst for doing

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.510
this was seeing this
documentary series on hip hop

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.730
on one of the main,
you know, VH1, MTV,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.470
one of those types of channels.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.511
And it was like four episodes.

00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:34.010
And of course, the
first episode was

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.710
on New York hip hop,
or the birthplace

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.830
of hip hop and everything.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.955
But then when they got
into, oh, well, then hip hop

00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:43.760
expanded into these other cities
and they mentioned probably

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.900
seven, nine other cities.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.340
Chicago wasn't even one of them.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.860
And that was kind of like,
that's just ridiculous.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.550
And I mean, I've known
Chad for about 20 years now

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.160
and like he said, I just
called him up and was like,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.210
we're going to do this.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.930
And he was like, cool.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.660
And here we are.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.670
And it started as
like, we're going to do

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.400
a two-hour documentary film.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.310
And you know, again, because
we've come up in the culture

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.970
and in Chicago and we know so
many people, when we're sitting

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.320
there and we're trying to--

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.280
one of the first things to
do is you're writing a list.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.200
Who are you going
to talk to, what

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.366
are you going to talk about?

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:21.770
And so we started
writing people down.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.414
Who are the top 40 people
that we need to talk to?

00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:27.080
And then it quickly it was like,
well, you can't leave them out.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.329
And if you leave them, well,
you can't leave them out.

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:31.250
And so we're like,
well, I guess we'll just

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.140
talk to everybody, which
is kind of how it's

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.690
bloomed into being more
of an archival project

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.660
on top of the film.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.610
And yeah.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.876
And here we are, just
over three years later.

00:07:41.876 --> 00:07:43.875
CHAD SORENSON: I looked
at him and saw that list

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.620
and I was like, dude,
this isn't going to work.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.799
There's a lot more people
we need to talk to.

00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:50.840
And we both agreed that
we needed to expand this.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.250
And then, like he
said, it turned

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.820
into a massive archival
project, which now--

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.430
we're really grateful that
it turned into that, as well.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.805
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
The first person

00:07:59.805 --> 00:08:03.080
that I called to talk to about
working on this was Chad.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.820
The second one was Kevin
Beacham, who's not here.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.580
And some people may
or may not know Kevin,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:13.040
but he's a DJ and
historian and he's

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.100
done a little bit of
everything in hip hop.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.900
He was the host of Time Travel
on WNUR, Northwestern's college

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.420
radio station from '95 to 2002.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.507
And he created the Chicago
hip hop timeline back in, man,

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:28.340
when did he do that?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.580
Maybe 2000, something like that?

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.470
CHAD SORENSON: Yeah.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.737
RYAN BROCKMEIER: And you
know, if for nothing else,

00:08:32.737 --> 00:08:34.570
we would use that as
some sort of reference.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.380
But I've known Kevin
for a long time

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.871
and I wouldn't feel right
doing it without him.

00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:40.620
So he was the second
person that I called.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.500
So me, Kevin, and
Chad, you know,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.795
spent the first couple of months
kind of outlining and putting

00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:48.920
things together before we
eventually, then, kind of

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.930
expanded the team
to what it is now.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.080
THE FRANCHIISE: Got it.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.560
So I was doing
some research and I

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.680
saw that there were
over 76 vignettes

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.710
that you've already put out
there on your YouTube page.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.600
This is a massive undertaking.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.009
How many people did you
end up interviewing so far?

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:08.050
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Well, we
are still interviewing.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.842
THE FRANCHIISE: OK.

00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:10.216
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
But right now, I

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.810
believe the number
is 192 interviews--

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:12.290
THE FRANCHIISE: Wow.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.748
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
--that we've done.

00:09:13.748 --> 00:09:15.530
So there are still
interviews to go.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.090
There are still many
vignettes to go.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.790
And some people do get
a little bit confused.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.530
The vignettes are
not the project.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.520
They're just to show what we're
doing and that it's coming.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.540
So yeah.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.740
CHAD SORENSON: The biggest
thing with the vignettes

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.990
are to show people that
it's still being worked on

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:36.380
and let people know that there's
been a lot of, like anywhere,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.670
a lot of projects.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.520
And it can be
overwhelming for people,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.600
so people will start
something and then quit,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.270
and that happens a lot.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.150
And we want to make sure that
people see that we're committed

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.470
to this and we're continuing.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.310
That's why we constantly
are spending time

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.230
with Barb and
everybody to continue

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.730
posting on social
media and showing,

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.520
and the vignettes are a way
to keep people interested.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.340
And it's a good way to--
'cause our interviews are long,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.460
usually, with people and they
can be anywhere from an hour

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.700
to two hours plus, sometimes.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.090
So that information, we
got such great information

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.840
in that interview.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.710
We want to make
sure we can use it.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.390
It might not fit
in the film, but we

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.850
want to be able to use it
in some form or fashion

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.530
because it's information
that should be heard.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.860
THE FRANCHIISE: Awesome.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.550
And with 192
interviews, what have

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.870
been some of the most
interesting stories?

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.970
I want to get to the juice.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.930
What has really
stood out to you?

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.680
What are some things
that people might not

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.690
know about these artists and
DJ's that are featured here?

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.540
CHAD SORENSON: Well, I mean,
there's so many, right?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.430
And I got to say,
honestly, we haven't really

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.770
had a lot of bad interviews.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.420
Everybody's had something
interesting to say.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.970
Maybe in an hour interview,
maybe not everything.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.350
Everything is kind of like--

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.360
an hour might not
be all interesting,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.040
but they have something really
juicy to say, in a good way.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.570
One of the great
things is seeing

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.740
how everybody is connected.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.906
And I won't get into that
because it's kind of long,

00:11:02.906 --> 00:11:07.190
but we have a connection from
someone who a lot of people

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.920
might not know that connects
all the way to Kanye West that

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.690
shows how if this person
didn't do what they did,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.304
then Kanye may or may not
have been where he's at.

00:11:18.304 --> 00:11:19.970
And I'm sure Kanye
probably doesn't even

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.115
know who this person is.

00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:22.490
So we're able to,
with this film,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.198
we'll be able to kind
of connect the dots

00:11:24.198 --> 00:11:29.930
and show the importance of
how everybody is connected.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.131
That's what's been
really cool for me.

00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:35.630
THE FRANCHIISE: Does anyone
else have any really interesting

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.105
stories they'd like to share?

00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:39.230
CHAD SORENSON: Do you want
to tell the Rubber Room?

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.813
SPEAKER 2: Well, the
Rubber Room story

00:11:40.813 --> 00:11:44.480
was a really emotional
story for me,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.340
and I think a lot
other people that was

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.480
able to listen to Rubber Room.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.820
Rubber Room is an awesome group.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.990
What year did they
come out, Chad?

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.030
CHAD SORENSON: I mean,
mid-'90s, they started.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.950
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.830
And the sound is kind of
like an industrial sound,

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.750
like an industrial
hip hop sound.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.260
And that sound directly
influences the sound

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.130
that we hear today.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.990
If anybody is out that's into
a group called Run the Jewels,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.390
Run the Jewels is
directly influenced

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.957
by a group called Rubber Room.

00:12:15.957 --> 00:12:17.040
CHAD SORENSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.484
LP will tell you
that completely.

00:12:18.484 --> 00:12:19.400
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, sure.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.691
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Just a funny
quick side story to that.

00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:25.430
But one of the first sessions
that Chad and Kevin and I had,

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.050
we're talking about people
who we want to talk to.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.640
We were talking to people that
are also not from Chicago that

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.290
may have worked
with Chicago artists

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.060
or have some sort of
relationship there.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.770
And one of the people that
I wanted to put on the list

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.415
was LP.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.800
And they were kind
of like, OK, why LP?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.200
And I'm like, because
when I talk to him in 2004

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.500
or '03 or whenever
it was, he directly--

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.600
he told me himself how much
of an influence Rubber Room

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.430
and the Opus
production was for him.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.440
And then Kevin was like,
that's kind of funny

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.560
that you mentioned that
because I gave LP a Rubber Room

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.660
demo back in like '95.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.539
So that's where--

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:05.330
SPEAKER 2: He stayed
with LP and gave him--

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.320
and they traded demos.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.370
So he had the
"Funcrusher Plus" demo.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.880
LP gave him-- Kevin-- the
"Funcrusher Plus" demo,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.084
and then he gave him the
"Gothic Architecture" demo.

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:15.000
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Yeah.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.980
But sorry, back to
the Rubber Room story.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.430
SPEAKER 2: So I think we all
got emotional around the time

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.390
that--

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.200
I guess they had a deal.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.010
And I think Chad can tell the
story a little bit better.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.720
CHAD SORENSON: Well,
OK, so they had a deal.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.339
And everybody from
Chicago was really

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:34.880
rooting for Rubber
Room at that time.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.870
If you were ahead in that
era, you loved those guys.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:44.270
And they were getting touted
as the next thing to blow.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.526
"Rolling Stone" did a
big huge article on them

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:47.900
and everybody was
getting excited

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.820
because this was one
of-- outside of Common,

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.186
this was going to be the next
group that would represent us

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:54.560
and we were all
happy about that.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.630
They were a great
representation of us.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.530
And we felt like these guys
could come back and reach out

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:05.660
to other people and try to help
expand the city's exposure.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.550
And the label called in
the middle of their tour

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.730
and folded.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.165
Said, you know, they still
had, whatever, 10 cities left.

00:14:14.165 --> 00:14:16.110
They said, it's over, come home.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:23.490
So [? Metamo, ?] he's one of
the main rappers, he flies back.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.250
He gets on the L to go home.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.770
And he said he rode the
train all night, you know,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.420
back and forth, back and forth.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.210
And he was afraid to
step off the train

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.410
because the second he knew he
put his foot on the ground,

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.760
it was over.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.600
It was over for him.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.700
And he felt like
that was their shot.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.760
So people are
putting, literally,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.030
their blood, sweat, and tears
into this music and culture.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.160
And you know, we got emotional
because not only have

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.590
we been a part of
this community,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.160
but you wanted them to win
and you just felt his pain.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.140
And it really, in the interview,
it really bleeds through.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.900
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.790
CHAD SORENSON: Sure.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.660
SPEAKER 3: And
hopefully, that story

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.850
does a lot to dispel
the myth that Chicago

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.150
is full of a bunch of haters and
we don't have each other back.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.290
That's always been
a wives' tale to me.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.750
Because just due to the fact
that there's collaborations

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.740
that's going on here on the
stage, as Rhymefest said,

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.830
that Kanye may have been the
king of the collaboration,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.110
but he did learn that
from the culture here.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.897
Now, there was
beefs between crews.

00:15:27.897 --> 00:15:28.730
That's just natural.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:29.806
I'm fresher than you.

00:15:29.806 --> 00:15:30.972
SPEAKER 2: It's competition.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:31.705
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:33.310
My crew could get
up more than yours.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.130
But when you came down to
it, it was that bridging

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.900
of all of the different
cultures and all

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.760
of the different
segregated areas

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.970
of the city that made
Chicago hip hop what it is

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.140
and what it was.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.260
And it's just inescapable.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:52.000
And my joy about being,
pretty much, the archivist

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.530
and the curator
of the exhibition

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.500
is that we get to see
this interconnected story.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.040
It's just funny, looking
at who really, really

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.090
were the seeds that
germed Chicago hip hop.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.930
It'll make a lot of
people drop a lot

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.530
of their pretenses about
race, ethnicity, and culture

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.170
and who's really
down for the cause.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.730
It's just a beautiful thing.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.100
And one of my favorite
stories is, I guess,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.670
Iomos Marad said it best.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.670
We were all about staying fresh.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.050
You had to be original.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.850
The way he would
tell that, we would

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.070
go and try to put on
layaway our new Polos.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.540
You know, I was not a good dude.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.110
You know, I used to get my
khakis with the braided belt.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.857
Tongue out on the gym shoes,
my cap with the bent brim.

00:16:32.857 --> 00:16:33.940
Just trying to look fresh.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.856
And then you see somebody
else doing it harder

00:16:35.856 --> 00:16:36.970
than you and you're like--

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.760
CHAD SORENSON: I
think, do we have that?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.280
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
We do have the--

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.510
CHAD SORENSON: Do
you want to show it?

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.384
We do have that clip.

00:16:41.384 --> 00:16:43.450
RYAN BROCKMEIER: You
want to show Iomos Marad?

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.950
CHAD SORENSON: We can show
you a clip of the Iomos Marad.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:45.425
Yeah.

00:16:45.425 --> 00:16:46.841
THE FRANCHIISE:
Let's take a look.

00:16:52.574 --> 00:16:53.240
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.830
- That's where I first
seen legends of Chicago,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:08.310
like [INAUDIBLE], Twilite
Tone, Anthony Anton, Juice.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.089
That's the first time I
saw a Juice and Akbar.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:16.619
And Kanye was the one that
took me to the barber shop.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:20.180
First time we went
and we sat in the car.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.140
I never forget,
we sat in the car.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.530
And we used to get
our polo from TJ Maxx,

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.609
you know what I'm saying?

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.530
And we put it on
layaway because we

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.930
didn't have no money for Polos,
you know what I'm saying?

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.960
So we would put out,
we put our money

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.740
on Polo, a bunch of Polo shirts.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.980
We think we flossin', like,
we in the car like, yeah,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.700
you looking bad, like
yeah, you look bad, man.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.830
Word, we good, you
know what I'm saying?

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.745
And then we would get to the
spot and see Anthony Anton

00:17:50.745 --> 00:17:54.690
and his brother walk past, or
[INAUDIBLE] walk past and you

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.800
want to burn your shirt because
them dudes did it on a level

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.720
where--

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.689
we was like, where are they
getting this Polo from,

00:18:02.689 --> 00:18:03.730
you know what I'm saying?

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.390
Like where-- they can't
be getting their Polo

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.680
for what we getting our Polo.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.721
You know what I'm saying?

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:12.090
It was just like, where are they
getting these polo pieces from?

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.490
We just want to burn our shirt,
you know what I'm saying?

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.827
And I used to just idolize them.

00:18:17.827 --> 00:18:19.810
Them dudes was like
superheroes to me,

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.565
you know what I'm saying?

00:18:22.565 --> 00:18:23.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.520
THE FRANCHIISE:
Aside from staying

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.360
fresh, being original, and
the sense of community,

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.180
were there any other larger
themes or threads that you

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.700
noticed throughout
the interviews

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.420
that you want audiences to take
away with them after seeing

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.660
the film?

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.410
RYAN BROCKMEIER: I
mean, some of the stuff

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.344
that we're talking about is--

00:18:44.344 --> 00:18:45.760
[INAUDIBLE] touched
on it earlier,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.070
is the segregation
within the city.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.530
And you know, and there's
a lot of different levels

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.190
of segregation, whether it's
race or ethnicity or gangs

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.660
or any of that kind of stuff.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.660
And hip hop was the thing that
brought everybody together

00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.335
for it.

00:18:59.335 --> 00:19:02.020
What Andrew was saying,
people were doing hip hop

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.210
to get out of that stuff.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.410
And it was allowing you,
it was giving you that pass

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.050
to travel from the South
Side to the North Side

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.950
and to be part of that group
and it was all-inclusive.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.550
So we're touching on
themes like that here.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.050
We're trying to do more
than just a straight,

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.030
this person put out
a record or painted

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.840
this wall that led to this.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.350
We want to get a little
deeper on what makes Chicago

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.690
different from other cities.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.460
CHAD SORENSON: There's
two running themes

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.930
that are very unique
to Chicago's experience

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.120
in being hip hop.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.620
And like you said, segregation.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.720
Segregation really
played a role.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.590
Our city is divided up
into kind of three cities,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.080
with the East Side
kind of being--

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.704
I kind of put that
with the South Side.

00:19:41.704 --> 00:19:46.160
But you know, the
segregation is so important

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.440
because here, you got
a city like New York.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.990
And all the MCs,
it doesn't matter

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.960
where they're from, what
borough they're from,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.920
they're New York MCs.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.730
You kind of know they're--

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.420
everybody's kind of the same.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.710
Chicago, you have
the West Side, which

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:05.090
is completely different in
culture, in style, and in rap.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.530
It's called a cadence, the way
a rhyme pattern is put on track.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.224
And then you have the South
Side, which is very different

00:20:12.224 --> 00:20:14.390
and you have the North Side
which is very different.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.554
Everybody has their
own influences.

00:20:16.554 --> 00:20:18.470
While they'll work
together at certain points,

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:23.996
it still was like three little
cities within one major city.

00:20:23.996 --> 00:20:25.370
And that can be
divided, like you

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:29.462
said, by race, even ethnicity
within race could break up.

00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:30.920
Because if you grew
up in the city,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.320
you may know that it's
a Polish neighborhood

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.920
or an Irish neighborhood, a
Puerto Rican neighborhood,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.970
Mexican neighborhood.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.350
And then those are divisions.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.808
Then you have gang
divisions, which

00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:44.552
again, played a major
role in how people

00:20:44.552 --> 00:20:46.010
moved through the
city and how they

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.560
became involved in hip hop.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.580
And then also, you can't forget
this is the birthplace of house

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.200
music, all right?

00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:02.800
So that played a major role in
how hip hop, or you developed

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.370
with hip hop.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.590
Some people hated
the house movement.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.050
Some people loved
it and embraced it.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.920
But either way,
it doesn't matter.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.780
We're Chicago, it's the
birthplace of house.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.900
So the way you moved through the
city, house had a role in that.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.490
Yeah?

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.130
BARBARA KALICKI: To camp
onto what you just said,

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.640
in almost all of the
interviews we were in,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.280
we heard from people
that these guys,

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.080
if they weren't part
of hip hop and they

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.140
were going through one part of
the gang culture in one gang

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.990
area to another gang
area, they may have

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.925
gotten attacked or messed with.

00:21:37.925 --> 00:21:39.550
But because they were
a part of hip hop

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.600
and they knew them from
the different gangs

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.730
from hanging out
at the shows, then

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.749
oh, no, leave that guy alone.

00:21:45.749 --> 00:21:47.790
He's part of that crew or
he's part of that crew.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.900
SPEAKER 2: So Barb, I used
to graffiti back in the day.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.770
And--

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.978
SPEAKER 3: Just a little bit.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.850
SPEAKER 2: And there were
places where we would get up

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.190
and cats would come by like,
yo, what are you doing?

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.907
Like, yo, I'm just
trying to do this piece.

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:05.990
And they would be like,
yo, like, they're hip hop,

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.906
like leave them along.

00:22:06.906 --> 00:22:07.900
You know what I mean?

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.182
So that let us travel,
you know what I mean?

00:22:11.182 --> 00:22:13.640
CHAD SORENSON: And that could
be a life or death situation.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.150
We had [INAUDIBLE] Fresh tell an
amazing story about how he got

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.300
ran up on and a gun pulled on.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.959
And they were-- him and Akbar--
were literally made to rap.

00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:27.500
And if they couldn't, you know,
they had to prove themselves,

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.070
right?

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.140
And that's happened--
a few people

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.360
have that very similar story.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.040
One thing that I do
want to specify too,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.760
though, is while we do talk
about the rapping and DJ

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.390
culture, this is the
whole hip hop culture.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.630
That's what's made
this project so big.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.586
We're covering the dancing,
the b-boys, the breakers,

00:22:48.586 --> 00:22:50.210
and we're covering
the graffiti aspect.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.480
So it encompasses the whole
culture and the movement,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.450
as opposed to just the
rappers or the DJs.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.200
THE FRANCHIISE: And
blues music also plays

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.180
a major role in Chicago.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.670
So in addition to
house and blues,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:09.950
did you notice a lot of people
pointing to certain other older

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.220
artists as their influences
and shouting them out

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.010
in the interviews that might
be surprising to us here?

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.170
RYAN BROCKMEIER: I can't
say we had too much.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.845
SPEAKER 2: We just
had Crucial Conflict.

00:23:24.845 --> 00:23:27.401
RYAN BROCKMEIER: I'll
let you talk about that.

00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:29.400
SPEAKER 2: But Crucial
Conflict was one of them.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.330
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Yeah.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.290
Before telling
that story, I just

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.979
want to say maybe
not specific artists,

00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:37.270
but that's another theme that
we've been talking about,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.500
how Chicago used to be the
mecca of music, especially

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.790
the blues and we had
record row all up and down

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.880
Michigan Avenue.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.540
And that's one of the things
that stunted at least the music

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.570
part of hip hop in Chicago,
was that a lot of that industry

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.780
went away in the late
'70s, early '80s.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.630
And so we're talking about that.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.930
But Chicago hip hop
culture has been here

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.390
since the beginning since
it started in New York.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:12.360
It's just been more, you
know, graffiti and dancing

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.380
was the big thing in
late '70s and '80s.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.210
But to this story,
we've been very

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.550
fortunate to be able to
film some of our interviews

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.650
at the legendary Chess Records.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.824
And just for us being music
fans, the first time that we

00:24:26.824 --> 00:24:28.990
went in there and were able
to look at that, I mean,

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.960
I think all of us got chills
when we were just walking up

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.220
those stairs, knowing the
history of just that building.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.560
But we just-- we recently
interviewed Crucial Conflict

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.230
and I think they were
taken just as much

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.250
as we were by the thing.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.020
Because they were
taking pictures,

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.760
they were so excited,
and just like--

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.604
they were like kids who were--

00:24:48.604 --> 00:24:50.020
CHAD SORENSON:
Being in that room,

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.436
the hair will stand
up on your arm

00:24:51.436 --> 00:24:56.380
because you're in the birthplace
of what becomes rock and roll.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.080
You have Johnny B. Goode
was recorded there.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.590
It was written in the basement.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.590
Chuck Berry recorded a
lot of his records there.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.859
You have Etta James,
you have Muddy Waters.

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:08.400
SPEAKER 3: Didn't the Beatles
cut their first American record

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.310
at Chess?

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.910
CHAD SORENSON: The Beatles.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.080
No, that was VJ
across the street.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.280
SPEAKER 3: That was
VJ across the street.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.555
CHAD SORENSON: But
Fleetwood Mac recorded

00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:15.970
there, the Rolling Stones
recorded a big record there,

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.740
and Aretha Franklin's very
first record was recorded there.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.270
If you guys get
a chance, go down

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.900
to Willie Dixon's Blues Museum,
the original Chess Records.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:26.920
It's amazing.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.320
Thank you to Julia, too,
for hooking that up for us.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.360
THE FRANCHIISE: We were talking
a bit before we started here

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.850
and you were telling me
about some artists that

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.200
were from Chicago, originally.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.360
Like I didn't know that
David Banner was born here.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.942
Are there any other artists
that you were able to interview

00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:44.650
or that you plan to
interview that people

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.337
might be surprised to know that
they're actually from Chicago?

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:48.670
CHAD SORENSON: Yeah, definitely.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.295
Go ahead, Ryan.

00:25:49.295 --> 00:25:52.630
You can-- I just
dumped it on him.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:53.320
Yeah, go ahead.

00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:58.510
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Well, I mean,
Chali 2na from Jurassic 5,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.030
who everybody knows them as
being a Los Angeles group.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.690
But he was born in Chicago.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.680
He's part of Shy Roc Nation.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.964
As far as who we're
going to interview,

00:26:07.964 --> 00:26:10.130
I know that there's some
on there, but to be honest,

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.000
our list is so long with
people that my brain is

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.190
getting a little scrambled
trying to pinpoint--

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.080
CHAD SORENSON: I
can tell you one.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.542
Mr.-- the Rappin' Duke.

00:26:19.542 --> 00:26:21.000
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
That's a good one.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.110
CHAD SORENSON:
The Rappin' Duke--

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.818
some of you guys might
be a little young,

00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:25.480
but if you remember
the Rappin' Duke,

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.350
he put out a record in 1986.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.510
His name was Shawn Brown.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.218
His record was called
"The Rappin" Duke."

00:26:32.218 --> 00:26:35.110
He raps-- it's kind of
a novelty record-- he

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.840
raps like John Wayne, right?

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:36.925
SPEAKER 3:
[IMITATING THE RAPPIN' DUKE]

00:26:36.925 --> 00:26:38.730
I'm talking here and now.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.005
Playing with the cattle
and rustling the cows.

00:26:43.005 --> 00:26:45.810
You can bet your sweet willie,
I'll be dancin' in the street.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.760
CHAD SORENSON: There you go.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.060
SPEAKER 3: Sorry.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.850
CHAD SORENSON: But yeah,
it was immortalized

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.080
in Biggie's "Juicy"
record, where he--

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.856
what's the line?

00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:57.230
SPEAKER 3: Remember
Rappin' Duke?

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.572
Da-hah, da-hah.

00:26:58.572 --> 00:27:01.030
CHAD SORENSON: So yeah, he went
to Morgan Park High School.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.420
He's from Chicago.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.378
RYAN BROCKMEIER: He's in
Atlanta now, actually.

00:27:04.378 --> 00:27:07.300
CHAD SORENSON: Shabba-Doo from
the movie "Breakin'," Ozone,

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.120
born and raised in Cabrini.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.130
And he's very excited
to be a part of this.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.630
We haven't filmed
him yet, but we've

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:14.440
been going back and forth.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.148
And he's really excited
to tell his story

00:27:16.148 --> 00:27:18.820
because he brought a lot of--

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:26.890
from style of dance to
style of dress to LA,

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.640
really kind of gets credited
as being the LA thing.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.407
And he's like, he
tells me, it's funny.

00:27:32.407 --> 00:27:34.490
He's like, man, there were
no Puerto Ricans in LA.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.040
He goes, I'm the one that
brought all that there.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.230
And I mean, I believe him.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:43.000
And he was very specific
on certain styles

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.730
and he formed the LA Lockers
with Rerun Barry and Mickey

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.060
Basil, yeah?

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.830
They were a very
popular dance group.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.560
But yeah, go ahead.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.360
Sorry.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.050
SPEAKER 3: Wait a minute.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:56.950
That's something I didn't know.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.408
You saying that Chicago had
something to do with the rerun?

00:28:02.702 --> 00:28:04.410
THE FRANCHIISE: I also
learned that there

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.360
have been a lot of documentaries
about the story of hip

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.735
hop in Chicago that haven't
actually been finished

00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:15.380
or get deterred for
whatever reason.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.260
So how has this
project been different?

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.030
How have you managed
to raise funds

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.830
for such a massive undertaking?

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.530
And how do you
keep moving forward

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.776
with such an important story?

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.000
SPEAKER 3: I'm the last one
to join the project so far,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.630
and from what I've
seen, the project

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.060
is different in the
fact that it's not

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.124
just one particular crew of
individuals doing the work.

00:28:39.124 --> 00:28:41.040
And when I say that,
you'll hear people coming

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.360
from one side of the town.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.220
You'll hear people
telling the 63rd Street

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.020
story of hip hop, the North
Side story of hip hop.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.870
We come from all
sections of the city,

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.750
so we're invested
in representing

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.220
hip hop in a holistic
sense, in its entirety.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.790
So I see that being
a tad bit different.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.530
And we're not not including
any section of hip hop

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:06.240
that's born here, from the drill
music to some of the hip house,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.550
to the conscious rap.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.190
CHAD SORENSON:
Everything's included.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.565
SPEAKER 3:
Everything's included,

00:29:09.565 --> 00:29:11.010
so we're not
picking and choosing

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.870
who it is that we're
trying to represent.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.610
We're here to
represent Chicago hip

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.550
hop in its multifaceted forms.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.140
We all like it to
knock in the trunk.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.885
And if it got a message behind
it, some of us like it better.

00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:24.930
If it's getting rah-rah
others of us like it better.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.990
So the difference is
that we're actually

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.240
trying to tell the
entire story of hip hop.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.240
Not just the rap side, not
just the DJ culture side,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.560
not just the breaking side.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.107
But everything.

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:36.940
CHAD SORENSON: Yeah.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.240
We're covering all the different
styles of hip hop here.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.240
And like I said, there's
a lot of unique styles.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.040
Because people are like, are you
going to cover the drill scene

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.080
or are you going to cover this?

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.190
Because they really didn't
think we were going to.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.290
And we're like,
yeah, even hip house,

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.272
it's connected to
Chicago hip hop.

00:29:51.272 --> 00:29:52.980
But one thing, I do
want to say it again.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.650
I go back because the graffiti
and the dance culture,

00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:02.090
Chicago didn't really have a
rap scene until, I would say--

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.350
there's not a real way
to exactly quantify it.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.070
But there was a bunch
of releases as 12

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.870
inch singles and
people were rapping

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.420
and there were singles
as far back as '82.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.970
And there was a lot of stuff.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.680
And then one of the first
albums I just had posted

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:22.450
was MF Boys, 1988,
late '88, early '89.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.900
But really, it was
kind of scattered

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.460
and there wasn't necessarily
a huge scene here.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.390
Before that, hip hop was
held down by the graffiti

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.190
and the dance
crews and the DJ's.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.686
And the graffiti
and the dance crews

00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:39.810
were really the start of
the hip hop movement here,

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.570
as far as the culture, as far as
what you call hip hop culture.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:48.480
And then you had groups
like Ill State, which

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.560
was one of the earliest crews,
Purple Mansion on the South

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.530
Side.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.260
Yeah, they were crews that--

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.620
Shy Roc Nation, in the
mid '80s, late '80s,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.870
everything started kind of
coming together and forming

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.760
more cohesive crews.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.210
And yeah, here we are today.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.097
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:12.097 --> 00:31:12.930
RYAN BROCKMEIER: No?

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.610
Go ahead.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.430
GRAYSON WAMBACH: Well,
to answer your question

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.380
about funding around this film.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.755
BARBARA KALICKI:
Thanks, Grayson.

00:31:19.734 --> 00:31:21.900
GRAYSON WAMBACH: The unique
thing about this project

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.080
is I can say and
I think we can all

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.360
say this is a legitimate
independent film that's

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:30.990
being made.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.037
And what I mean by that is we
have no-- as of right now--

00:31:35.037 --> 00:31:36.370
it's definitely being worked on.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.130
But we have no funding.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.810
It has all been out of pocket.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.780
It has all been based on the
relationships that we all have.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.000
And it is a grassroots
project that

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.890
has taken a lot of time,
a lot of dedication.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.340
And it's one of those projects
that you can honestly say--

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.950
when independent film, in
the way that it's used,

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:04.080
has been skewed in the
last 10-plus years--

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.850
I can honestly sit
here and say that we

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:11.430
are developing and creating
an independent project.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.520
But by all means,
though, that doesn't

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.470
mean we don't need the funding.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.220
CHAD SORENSON: It's
definitely independent

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.050
when we go, hey,
can we do this trip?

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.925
Let me see how much
money I got in my pocket.

00:32:20.925 --> 00:32:23.110
It's literally coming
out of our pocket.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.110
GRAYSON WAMBACH: And to
honestly finish the film

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.360
and to finish telling the
story that we want to tell

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.560
and that we want to
bring to the world,

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.660
we will need to
secure that funding

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.120
to finish a project like this.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.550
Because it is a feature film.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.920
THE FRANCHIISE: How can
people contribute financially,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.472
like people in this
audience, perhaps?

00:32:44.472 --> 00:32:46.680
RYAN BROCKMEIER: I mean,
currently, there's two ways.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.170
You can go to
patreon.com and it's

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:53.976
P-A-T-R-E-O-N.com/midwaydoc.

00:32:53.976 --> 00:32:56.100
And that's kind of like a
monthly subscription type

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.052
thing, so if you want to give us
$2.00 a month or $5.00 a month.

00:32:59.052 --> 00:33:01.260
And then you can get little
things like video updates

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.590
and stuff like that, or you
can just give us a one-time

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:09.490
donation through Paypal, which
is just paypal.com/midwaydoc.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.470
But to kind of, real
quick, piggyback--

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.928
I know we're running out of
time-- but to kind of piggyback

00:33:13.928 --> 00:33:16.590
on what everybody was saying,
what makes this different is

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.610
that there's been
little documentaries

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.670
on a specific crew or
on a specific scene.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.530
I think this is--

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.370
we're going to
finish it and it's

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.620
going to encompass everything.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.500
We want to make sure that
we encompass everything.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.286
And as we said, we've been
working on this for a little

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:36.160
over three years now.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.250
We've been filming
for over, about almost

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.660
two and a half years now.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.160
So it's like, that's
why we're doing-- again,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.720
that's why we're doing the
vignettes because we don't

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.070
want-- we didn't want
to film somebody in 2015

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.760
and now it's 2017 and we're
like, whatever happened to it?

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.750
I don't know.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.460
So you know, we're
still doing that.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.020
I guess this is
all of our project.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.260
But since I'm the
director, I'm directing

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.100
it and I left my
job two years ago--

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.450
a little over two years
ago now-- just specifically

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.230
to work on this.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.230
So it's definitely
a labor of love.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.400
It's a passion project.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.960
But we want to--

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.481
and we obviously have to thank
the community, the hip hop

00:34:13.481 --> 00:34:13.980
community.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.537
Because everybody has been
so gracious with their time,

00:34:16.537 --> 00:34:18.870
with their knowledge, with
their contacts and everything

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.370
like that.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.110
Because we know a lot of people
and we've definitely used that.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.500
But we wouldn't be where we are
without the community support,

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.320
too.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.739
CHAD SORENSON: This is
the community project.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:29.520
This is the city.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.889
This is a city of Chicago and
this is the hip hop community's

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:32.388
movie.

00:34:32.388 --> 00:34:33.360
This is their story.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.120
This isn't his film, it's not
his film, it's not her film,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.380
it's not my film.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.380
It's not EC's film,
it's not Kanye's film,

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.980
it's not Common's film.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.159
It's the community's film.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.320
And this film, as
I always say, it's

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.860
going to be as good as the
community lets it be and shares

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.030
and helps us make it.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:55.590
And we've gotten nothing but
great help from everybody.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.865
I mean, in any way
possible, we've

00:34:57.865 --> 00:35:00.240
gotten help from the community,
so I can't be more happy.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.062
And that's totally against
what people say this city is.

00:35:04.062 --> 00:35:04.770
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:05.650
THE FRANCHIISE: Awesome.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.024
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
And lastly, it's

00:35:07.024 --> 00:35:11.670
like it's perfect timing to
do a project like this, just

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.020
with the success of-- you know,
Chance is just blowing up.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.560
There's no other way
to describe that.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.010
And as much-- he'll be in
the film and Common will be

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:23.670
and that.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.202
And as much as we want to
celebrate those successes,

00:35:26.202 --> 00:35:27.660
we also want to
celebrate everybody

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.580
that built that
foundation for them

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.720
to stand on where they are.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.360
I mean, you know, Chance is
doing everything independently

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.894
now and it's great.

00:35:34.894 --> 00:35:37.560
But there's a lot of people that
did it independently before him

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.832
that he's learned from and
learned what not to do.

00:35:39.832 --> 00:35:41.790
And that's kind of been
the Chicago thing, too.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.210
You know, not to use
the cliche, but it's

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.191
the blue collar mentality of
kind of do-it-yourself type

00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:48.690
of thing.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.690
And that's one thing that
Chicago has always had

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.020
and it's definitely been
part of the hip hop culture

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.954
and so we want to
shine a light on it.

00:35:54.954 --> 00:35:56.620
CHAD SORENSON: And
one thing I just want

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.994
to say before time
runs out, too,

00:35:57.994 --> 00:35:59.760
is this is also an
archival project

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.580
and we partner with the Center
for Black Music Research.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:09.600
And we are collecting flyers,
posters, literally anything.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.060
Dr. K gave us an original
1991 Ill State varsity jacket

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.810
that's one of the
coolest things I've ever

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.590
seen because I haven't
seen one of those,

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.310
except on an album cover,
like, 20 years ago.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.764
So the stuff we're
getting is amazing

00:36:23.764 --> 00:36:24.930
and people are contributing.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.960
So we're collecting
and preserving

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.820
the culture because
it doesn't need

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.470
to be in somebody's basement.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.760
And God forbid, they pass
away or a flood or something

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.260
happens.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.100
We need to have--

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.930
this is bigger
than all of us now.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.640
The culture and the
scene we've created

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.040
is bigger than one crew.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.700
It now deserves to be put away
so people can learn from it

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.570
and we can continue.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.030
And it's everything-- like,
I'm donating my whole record

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.610
collection, as far
as Chicago hip hop.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.905
So again, it's bigger
than all of us.

00:36:52.905 --> 00:36:54.030
THE FRANCHIISE: Definitely.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.931
Definitely.

00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:56.430
All right.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.680
Well, thank you so much
for answering my questions.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.540
Now I want to give
the audience a chance

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.220
to ask questions of their own.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.850
If you could just
step up to the mic

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.270
if you have a question in mind.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.770
Yes.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:08.910
Go ahead.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.190
AUDIENCE: I have a slight
question, but also just

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.230
a proclamation.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.270
My name is Carl West.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.690
I am the guy that created
Chicago's, so far,

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:23.010
only hip hop and R&amp;B awards
that lasted for 10 years.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.650
And most of the artists
that you guys mention all

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.660
graced the stage in
their early career.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.760
And that was part of
what I wanted to do,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.580
was to create a venue
for emerging artists

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.400
to have an opportunity
to be saluted.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.170
And so it was an
amazing transformation

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.410
for me and artists.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.700
I mean, it opened my
eyes up to so much.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.147
So I wanted to make
sure that if possible, I

00:37:46.147 --> 00:37:46.980
can make sure that--

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.200
I got video of a lot
of performances early

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.340
on with Kanye and Common
and so many people.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:58.530
I've got the footage of
Kanye actually being Kanye.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.172
It was one of the first times
he had a platform like that

00:38:01.172 --> 00:38:02.880
and he was cursing
the radio stations out

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.540
because they wouldn't
play his music.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.930
And so I kept it
to myself because I

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.150
didn't want to embarrass
the brother because it

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.855
was pretty graphic,
after he had performed.

00:38:12.855 --> 00:38:15.319
And I still won't release
all the footage, right,

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:17.610
because we want to honor that
brother because he's been

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.910
so powerful to our community.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.730
But hip hop was a labor of
love for me, that awards show.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.700
So I just wanted to make sure
that I put that out there.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.400
And also, I mean, I've
been blessed over the years

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.267
from that experience.

00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:33.600
I want to know what I can do
to be an executive producer

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.530
on the movie.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.280
CHAD SORENSON: OK.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.950
Well first of all, salute to
you for doing that and giving

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:42.069
people a platform at that time.

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:44.190
Yeah, and
footage-wise, anything.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.240
Anybody with footage.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.790
Anything we can get to that
will help make the film better.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.070
And obviously,
the whole point is

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.965
to make people make
Chicago look good,

00:38:51.965 --> 00:38:54.090
so we want to use stuff
that's in a positive light.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:55.697
But you know, talk
to Ryan and I mean,

00:38:55.697 --> 00:38:57.030
we can definitely talk about it.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.670
But we much
appreciate, A, for what

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.440
you did for the community and
B, for helping out in any way.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.794
Again, a community
project, guys.

00:39:04.794 --> 00:39:06.210
THE FRANCHIISE:
Thank you so much.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.110
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.230
THE FRANCHIISE: Hi.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.020
AUDIENCE: Googler here.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.469
My favorite documentaries
tend to have a story arc,

00:39:12.469 --> 00:39:14.010
regardless of the
fact that it's kind

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.497
of a nonfiction piece of work.

00:39:16.497 --> 00:39:18.330
So I was wondering if
there is a clear story

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.340
arc that you're aiming for or if
it's too early in the process.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.940
And then my second question
is what your hope for Chicago

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.060
is, post-documentary?

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.110
What is an ideal world look
like as a result of your work?

00:39:29.677 --> 00:39:31.260
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
I'll definitely speak

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.780
to the story arc, in
that we definitely

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.100
want to create a story arc.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.825
We've got an outline
for that and it's

00:39:38.825 --> 00:39:40.950
going to come together with
the voices of everybody

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.740
that we've interviewed, talking
about a particular subject.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.010
And that, I think if
there's one theme, maybe,

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.240
to take away from what
we're trying to do,

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.330
it'd maybe be like underdog.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.160
You know, Chicago
having that success

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.830
and making it happen despite
the lack of major record

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:59.370
labels or just the
infrastructure to do that.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.860
A lot of Chicago
graffiti artists

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.355
really paved the way as far
as that culture and that art

00:40:05.355 --> 00:40:07.710
and that look being
mainstream today.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:12.770
You know, Chicago had a big
part of that, so we want to--

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.670
so that's probably, I
would say, the theme.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.503
There's definitely going
to be, like I said,

00:40:16.503 --> 00:40:20.040
we definitely want to get away
from the linear storytelling as

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.710
possible and we want
to make it compelling.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.710
I want this project
to be accessible

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.540
and somebody find
interesting who

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.240
lives in Montana or Wyoming
who has no idea about hip

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.310
hop or Chicago to,
at the very least,

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.630
find the story interesting.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.550
CHAD SORENSON: Yeah, it's
a struggle story, for sure.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.716
Because a lot of these
people, they give everything,

00:40:37.716 --> 00:40:39.810
and Chicago is a
very blue collar--

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.630
it's a midwest, blue collar,
hustle, hardworking city.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.410
And everybody's story
kind of fits that.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.160
And you know, you have
someone like Chance

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.240
who did it on his own.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.300
So this is kind of
everything the story

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.490
arc is going to be
based on just leading up

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.290
to where we're at
today and the success

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:01.240
and all the struggles
that happened beforehand.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.540
And what I would love to see
happen at the end of this

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:09.850
is just the community to
start embracing all of us.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:11.610
And when I say all
of us, I mean like--

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.480
because right now, there's
a tendency to be like,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.917
let's say, you see
a pizza, right?

00:41:16.917 --> 00:41:18.750
And you have little
pepperonis on it, right?

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.200
And we have little circles.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.010
And everybody is kind of in
community, their own little hip

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:24.510
hop circle.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.910
And I want to try to
make that disappear

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.010
and make a little
bit more unification.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.690
I think the film--
people will learn

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.648
a lot more of their
history they can take away.

00:41:32.648 --> 00:41:34.560
Especially the younger
kids will learn

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.690
why Ill State is one of
the most important things

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.523
to ever happen to their
life that they never

00:41:38.523 --> 00:41:40.160
knew was important.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.240
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.810
THE FRANCHIISE: Thank you.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.650
Any other questions
from the audience?

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:46.180
Go ahead.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.330
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.150
So you guys talked
about the original ideas

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.670
for it being just a documentary.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.490
And then it grew and now
it's an archival project.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.500
You talked a little bit
about your partnership

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.390
with the Center for
Black Music Research,

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.130
but I wonder if you can talk
a little bit about the Midway

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.780
brand.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.300
Because I know there's
also Midway radio.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.030
So a little bit about
how it's expanding

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:13.615
and how we should
look out for Midway.

00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:15.430
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Sure.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.460
As far as the partnership
with Columbia,

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.610
when we started putting
it together, we wanted--

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:25.060
my first vision was just to
have the Midway website be

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.550
kind of like a place for
people to go just to learn more

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.960
about Chicago hip hop.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.050
And as the project grew, it
always was in the back of mind

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.910
that I wanted to
partner with some sort

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.110
of educational institution.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.314
Because that's really
something that's

00:42:38.314 --> 00:42:39.730
becoming more and
more popular now

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.960
because Cornell's got a
big hip hop archival thing,

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.644
the Smithsonian--

00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:46.060
I think the University of
Tulane does the southern hip hop

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.130
stuff.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.130
So that was always something
that I wanted to do and Chad

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.084
and I were lucky enough,
we were on a panel--

00:42:53.084 --> 00:42:55.000
well, not a panel, but
we were part of a group

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.750
to help kind of develop a
hip hop minor at Columbia

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.010
College, Chicago.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.494
And through that,
I started talking

00:43:01.494 --> 00:43:03.160
to people in the music
department, which

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.576
led me to the talk
with the Center

00:43:04.576 --> 00:43:05.980
for Black Music Research.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.949
And they were like, we want
to be your partner with this.

00:43:08.949 --> 00:43:10.990
And I said, that's perfect
because Columbia's got

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.690
such a huge history
with Chicago hip hop.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:15.740
That's the perfect
marriage with that.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.444
So if anybody doesn't know
about the Center for Black Music

00:43:18.444 --> 00:43:20.110
Research, they've got
one of the largest

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.000
jazz collections and
blues collections

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.920
and it's just an
amazing institution.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.230
And people come from
all over the world

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:31.600
to do their thesis papers on the
stuff that they're working on.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.550
So the fact that they
want to do, they want

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.330
to preserve hip hop is great.

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.710
So we're working with
them to kind of funnel

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.640
what we're finding and
what we're researching

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.120
so they can archive
it, you know,

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.790
for people to
learn from forever.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.600
And then to the second
one, for the Midway brand--

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.017
[CLEARS THROAT] excuse me.

00:43:51.017 --> 00:43:53.350
Yeah, that's kind of how we're
looking at it as a brand.

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.200
Again, just to kind of create
awareness because we want to--

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.620
and to go back to the
question about where

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.790
we want to see Chicago be after
this, we're all in Chicago.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.736
We're all from
Chicago and we want

00:44:06.736 --> 00:44:09.110
to reverse those negative
stereotypes that are out there,

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.818
whether it's from hip
hop culture or just

00:44:10.818 --> 00:44:13.840
for the general Chicago
violence and that kind of stuff.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.350
We want this film to be a very
positive light on Chicago.

00:44:20.974 --> 00:44:22.390
And part of that
is just expanding

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:23.685
the awareness of this project.

00:44:23.685 --> 00:44:25.060
So we started
Midway Radio, which

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.370
is a video podcast we
do almost every Monday

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:28.480
night at 8 o'clock.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.370
And we've had a lot
of really cool guests

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.230
and we just have a
general conversation

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:34.300
that's more current
as to what's going on,

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.610
where our interviews
are more historical

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.834
and talking about the past.

00:44:38.834 --> 00:44:40.500
But yeah, and we've
got some other ideas

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.800
and we've got some other
things that are coming up

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.966
that we can't quite say yet.

00:44:42.966 --> 00:44:45.430
But yeah, we're always
looking to expand.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.430
CHAD SORENSON: I just
want to say one last thing

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.360
and he had kind
of touched on it.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.890
I love my city.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.750
I love the people
that are in this city.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:54.460
I love the culture of the city.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.540
And I'm really just over
the national narrative

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:04.730
that they portray of my
city that's just inaccurate.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:07.870
So with this film,
we're hoping to show

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:10.510
that there's a lot of love
and peace and positivity

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:14.170
that comes through a
culture in this city.

00:45:17.001 --> 00:45:18.542
That's what I want
to definitely want

00:45:18.542 --> 00:45:20.333
to make sure people
get when they see this,

00:45:20.333 --> 00:45:22.225
at the end of it.

00:45:22.225 --> 00:45:23.619
THE FRANCHIISE: Perfect.

00:45:23.619 --> 00:45:25.785
I think we have time for
one more audience question.

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:31.260
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:36.360
Just exactly going off
what Mr. West was saying,

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.760
moving forward,
what are some things

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.070
that you guys are looking for?

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.145
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:44.145 --> 00:45:46.520
RYAN BROCKMEIER: As far as
the production and stuff goes?

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.940
RYAN BROCKMEIER: Yeah,
well, like I said,

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.470
we're still interviewing,
so we still have that to go.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.040
And then we're looking for
archival stuff for both film

00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.010
and for the Center for Black
Music Research and that stuff.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.382
So that's anything from
flyers to photos to videos.

00:46:02.382 --> 00:46:03.840
You know, we've
got a lot of people

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.960
donating stuff on
Hi8 and VHS tapes

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.630
and some DVDs and
stuff like that.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.370
Any posters, all
that stuff is going

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.694
to be scanned at museum quality.

00:46:13.694 --> 00:46:15.860
Because that's another thing
that we want to do when

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:16.670
the film is done.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:20.290
We want to do a joint exhibit--

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.352
a Chicago hip hop exhibit
along with showing

00:46:22.352 --> 00:46:23.560
the film and stuff like that.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.670
So we want to put some
of that stuff on display.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:27.390
CHAD SORENSON: We're
going to make that happen.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:28.181
AUDIENCE: One more.

00:46:28.181 --> 00:46:31.180
Did you guys think about
creating maybe a saga?

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:36.210
Because if you truly want to
dig deep into Chicago's roots,

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.210
we're going to need
more than one project.

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:43.480
And if you go
back, I was hearing

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.200
you say some of the
elder names, but I'm

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.790
a younger guy so I want to
get straight until like 2008.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:56.990
Straight into-- 2008 to about
2016, I have direct archive.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:59.130
I hosted radio for
about six years so far,

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.402
so I can be helpful there.

00:47:00.402 --> 00:47:01.860
RYAN BROCKMEIER:
That'd be amazing.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.390
AUDIENCE: But I
really want you guys

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.420
to take this and really
capture it because it's only

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.767
going to happen one time.

00:47:07.767 --> 00:47:09.600
CHAD SORENSON: Look,
I'll tell you flat out.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.940
We have, like I said,
we have interviews

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.480
that are an hour to, sometimes,
two-plus hours with people.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.731
We eventually want to make
sure all this footage is

00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:18.480
seen by everybody.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.980
There's nothing we want
to leave in the vault.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.688
So we're talking about
all different ways

00:47:21.688 --> 00:47:24.960
to use it outside of
the film and make it

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.160
available for everyone to see.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.370
We definitely feel like--

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.578
at one point, me and him
looked each other like, man,

00:47:31.578 --> 00:47:34.680
we got a legit responsibility
now beyond the film.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.750
This is a real community
responsibility.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.120
But I'm fine with that.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.200
It's not even a pressure.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.190
It makes me feel proud.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:42.420
And I can go out and--

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.010
you have someone like
a new kid like Saba

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:50.850
that needs to be celebrated
for all the great things

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:51.599
that he's doing.

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:52.640
AUDIENCE: Right in there.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.430
And we got other kids that
didn't make it to that light

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.679
and are sleeping--

00:47:56.679 --> 00:47:57.720
CHAD SORENSON: Certainly.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.719
AUDIENCE: --that need to
be-- we need that light

00:47:59.719 --> 00:48:01.920
to be shined on them that
tried to get to that point

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.390
but couldn't make it out.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:06.240
CHAD SORENSON: You have people
like DA Smart, who might be--

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.790
well, for me, he's one
of the greatest rappers

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.040
to ever live on
planet Earth, period.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.370
I'm comparing him with
Jay-Z and everybody.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:15.810
But people don't know
him outside of Chicago.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.470
And to me, that's like--

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.350
it's insane.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.270
That's insane that
DA Smart-- but it's

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.594
just the breaks of
the city sometimes.

00:48:23.594 --> 00:48:25.260
But we want to make
sure that, at least,

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.990
people are going to get
a chance to be exposed

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:29.375
on a different level to him.

00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:32.070
SPEAKER 3: With that being said,
me being one from the Each One

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.440
Teach One generation, spread
the message out there, bro.

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.240
Let the little ones know--

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:35.690
AUDIENCE: I will, definitely.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:37.106
SPEAKER 3: Let the
young ones know

00:48:37.106 --> 00:48:39.486
that this is what we're
doing and expose them

00:48:39.486 --> 00:48:40.860
to it so that they
know that they

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.134
should be helping with this.

00:48:43.134 --> 00:48:44.550
Not saying that
we're getting old,

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.010
but we can only put so
many bricks in the wall

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:47.557
at this time.

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:49.140
And we're trying to
lay the foundation

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.987
so that those who come after
us can keep building on it.

00:48:51.987 --> 00:48:52.820
CHAD SORENSON: Yeah.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.342
We want this to continue to go.

00:48:54.342 --> 00:48:55.800
After the film is
done, we're still

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.870
going to continue
adding to the archives

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.580
and filming
interviews with people

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.760
as new people come along.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.977
So not just a two or two
and a half hour documentary.

00:49:03.977 --> 00:49:05.310
We would like it to be a series.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.310
But that takes time,
money, energy, and effort.

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.280
And I hope I'm not--

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.370
AUDIENCE: Most
importantly, dedication.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.860
CHAD SORENSON: No, no.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.280
RYAN BROCKMEIER: No.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.488
SPEAKER 3: --by saying that--

00:49:12.488 --> 00:49:14.230
CHAD SORENSON: I yell
at him every day.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.640
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.525
We're asking the community--

00:49:15.525 --> 00:49:16.080
BARBARA KALICKI:
Sharing is caring.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.790
SPEAKER 3: --to hold
us, to be beholden, make

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:19.080
us beholden to the community.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:19.747
Check up on us.

00:49:19.747 --> 00:49:21.330
BARBARA KALICKI: And
share on Facebook

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.840
and Twitter and Instagram,
and keep sharing out there.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.000
The more people we reach,
the better our chances

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.694
are of getting this completed
in a timely fashion.

00:49:29.694 --> 00:49:31.360
Not that it's not
going to be completed.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:31.860
It will.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.850
But we need everybody to share
and like on Facebook, Twitter,

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:36.780
and Instagram.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.110
THE FRANCHIISE: What's the
handle for people to follow?

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:40.735
BARBARA KALICKI:
@midwaydoc on Twitter,

00:49:40.735 --> 00:49:42.690
@midwaydoc on
Instagram, and I think

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.850
it's Midway Documentary,
The Story of Chicago Hip

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.440
Hop on Facebook.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.361
So follow and
share, share, share.

00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:49.860
CHAD SORENSON: Ryan
hangs up on me--

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.240
I was going to say,
Ryan hangs up on me

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.073
probably once or twice
a week because my job

00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:56.160
as a producer is to give
him unrealistic stuff.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.660
I dream up things that we're
going to do and he's like, bro,

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.660
do you know how much money
that's going to cost?

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:01.350
I'm like, I don't care.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.558
We're going to figure it out.

00:50:02.558 --> 00:50:03.720
And we have been.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.550
But literally, he's
like, no, we're not--

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.525
I'm like, yes we are.

00:50:06.525 --> 00:50:07.400
And you're going to--

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.149
and I was like, and
you're going to do it.

00:50:09.149 --> 00:50:10.539
And he's like, OK.

00:50:10.539 --> 00:50:13.080
RYAN BROCKMEIER: And then I call
Grayson to vent a little bit

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.450
and see what we can do
and what we can't do.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.832
So it's a team project.

00:50:16.832 --> 00:50:18.540
CHAD SORENSON: It's
what a producer does.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.370
He yells at the director.

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:22.161
RYAN BROCKMEIER: But
back to your question,

00:50:22.161 --> 00:50:24.720
we do have thoughts of maybe
turning this into a series

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.200
or maybe even an extended
cut at some point.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.000
Things may change.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.800
We're not to that point yet.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.810
I still would love
to do an actual--

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.490
like a two-ish hour feature
length documentary because I

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:36.990
still--

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:39.480
I think it's important to
get the Chicago story out.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.070
And you know, you can't
screen a 10-hour series

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.000
in another state for that.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.230
So I still want to be able to
do the feature length so we

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.840
can show that around.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.844
But there's definitely
talks of all that stuff.

00:50:52.844 --> 00:50:55.010
And at some point, whether
it's through the archives

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.230
or through another,
more produced, thing,

00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:59.205
everybody will be
able to read or watch

00:50:59.205 --> 00:51:01.580
all the interviews that we do
and all that kind of stuff.

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.265
Yeah.

00:51:02.265 --> 00:51:02.900
THE FRANCHIISE: Awesome.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.920
That's great to hear.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.970
AUDIENCE: Well, thank
you guys, and good luck.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:07.085
CHAD SORENSON: Thank you.

00:51:07.085 --> 00:51:08.960
THE FRANCHIISE: And we
have time for one more

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.990
question from the audience.

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.990
AUDIENCE: How you doing?

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:13.550
My name is Isaiah.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.770
I am the founder and
executive director

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:19.310
of Rise Urban Cultural
Centers of Chicago.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.270
That's my dad and my
son sitting over there.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:23.920
My dad's a board member
and my son's a hip hopper.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.280
If you guys know Shadow
Master MC, he runs 606.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.380
He's a board member in
my organization, as well.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.760
Basically, what
our mission is is

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.730
to provide Chicago's at-risk
youth a safe and productive

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:38.190
environment to learn the
five elements of hip hop.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:40.500
We just started in November.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.290
This is our first year.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:47.330
We hope, in the coming years,
to become a 501(c)(3) and gain

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:50.125
our own facility
and our own fleet.

00:51:50.125 --> 00:51:51.500
Basically, what
we're going to do

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.800
is go out to alternative schools
in at-risk neighborhoods,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.040
grab these kids up after school,
bring them to our facility.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.750
And right now, we're
developing a program

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:03.730
based on the "Gospel
of Hip Hop" by KRS-One.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:07.110
Now being that
we're in Chicago, we

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:10.950
want to bring our curriculum
and our program to our roots

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:13.720
and offer that to our kids.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.220
All right?

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.380
So we're right along with
the mission of Midway.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.470
I would love to
stand with you guys

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:20.976
and work with you
guys along the way

00:52:20.976 --> 00:52:23.100
to make sure we get that
information to these kids.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.409
Because maybe this generation,
they might snooze on it.

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.450
You know what I'm saying?

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:28.991
They might snooze
on it a little bit.

00:52:28.991 --> 00:52:31.380
But the next generation--
those 9 to 15-year-olds,

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.660
we can grab them up, you know?

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.850
And teach them what
real hip hop is about.

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:39.750
Real hip hop, the five
elements, you know what I mean?

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:45.240
I think a lot of kids nowadays,
they look at the rap game.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.490
They look at the rap
industry and they

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:48.975
think that's what hip hop is.

00:52:48.975 --> 00:52:51.100
CHAD SORENSON: That has
nothing to do with hip hop.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.060
AUDIENCE: I'm sure you all have
heard of mumble rap, you know?

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.130
It's all over, you know.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:58.866
And sure, that's
an aspect of it.

00:52:58.866 --> 00:53:00.990
The guy you were talking
about who got on the train

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:05.040
and took a step off
and knew it was over.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.760
I want to be able to
change that mentality.

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.300
Community is what
hip hop is about.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.670
DA Smart, he's the god.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.480
That's the god right there.

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.980
It's not Vert or
[INAUDIBLE] or Lil whoever.

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.299
It's the guy that's
from your neighborhood,

00:53:24.299 --> 00:53:25.340
you know what I'm saying?

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.673
So I just wanted to put that
out there and say thank you

00:53:27.673 --> 00:53:29.924
guys, all of you, for
putting this together.

00:53:29.924 --> 00:53:32.340
CHAD SORENSON: Salute to you
for doing community projects.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.040
AUDIENCE: And I cannot wait
to see it when it comes

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.800
to fruition.

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.159
Thank you.

00:53:37.159 --> 00:53:38.700
CHAD SORENSON: I
saw you beat boyin'.

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.116
BARBARA KALICKI:
Yeah, we saw you.

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:41.795
You didn't think we
saw you, but we did.

00:53:41.795 --> 00:53:44.030
THE FRANCHIISE: So that
concludes our discussion.

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:46.110
Thank you both so
much for being here.

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:49.550
Again, you guys can follow them
@MidwayDoc on social media.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:51.670
If you'd like keep up
with me, you can follow me

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:54.250
@TheFranchiise with two i's.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.750
And thank you all for coming.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:56.791
CHAD SORENSON: Thank you.

00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:59.700
[APPLAUSE]
