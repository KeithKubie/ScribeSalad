[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:13.710
SAURABH MADAAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950
please join me in
welcoming Mohnish Pabrai.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.450
MOHNISH PABRAI: Thank you.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.820
Thank you, Saurabh, for
that generous introduction.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.320
And great to be
back in the plex.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.890
I think this is my
third time here.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.725
And congratulations on the
stock getting past $1,000.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:39.500
A little bit behind the
other team, but that's OK.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.490
You can catch up.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:51.010
So anyway, I wanted to share
some thoughts about a subject

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.810
that one of my motivations
of sharing this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.270
is to try to learn
myself so all of these

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.740
are not kind of fully
formed parts, if you will.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.239
But I'm hoping that
some of these ideas

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.540
will get pounded into my brain a
little bit better because I get

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.910
to talk about it and
some insights might

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.320
come from folks like you.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:23.120
So in Los Angeles, there's a
large active asset management

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.890
shop that some of you
might have heard of,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.080
it's called Capital Group.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.240
They've been around
for about 85 years

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.460
and they manage
about $1.4 trillion.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
And the Capital Group has a
number of different funds,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.010
kind of like Fidelity.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.830
But unlike Fidelity,
which has these star

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.740
managers like William
Danoff or Peter Lynch,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.900
Capital Group runs things
a little bit differently.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.840
So they assign teams of managers
to manage a specific fund

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.660
and each manager
will, for example,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.020
manage a few hundred
million or $100 million

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.660
or maybe $1 billion
out of a larger fund.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.050
And then they collect kind
of all the different manager

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.810
picks and that's what
comprises the whole fund.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.460
And so a few years back, I was
at a dinner at Charlie Munger's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.830
house and it's a small group.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.920
He posed a question
to the group.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.960
He said that the Capital
Group a few years back

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.830
had set up what they
called a Best Ideas Fund.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.720
And so they asked each of
their portfolio managers

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.230
to give one stock pick, their
highest conviction idea.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.040
And then they created
a Best Ideas Fund,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.520
which was taking one pick
from each of the managers.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.230
And Charlie said that this Best
Ideas Fund did not do well.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.900
It underperformed the benchmark,
underperformed the S&amp;P,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.340
and so on.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.260
And he was asking the
group why that was.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.960
And then before we could
kind of get further

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.590
into the discussion,
dinner was served.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.670
Everyone kind of moved,
the conversation shifted,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.930
and this thread kind of
just got left unanswered.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.930
And I think this was like
five or six years ago.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.930
And I would meet Charlie once
in a while but either I'd forget

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.540
or there'd be a lot
of people around.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.250
And I thought I had the
answer for why this happened,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.610
but I didn't know because God
hadn't told me why it happened.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.099
And so earlier this year, I
was with Charlie and I said,

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.640
this time I'm going
to make sure this

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.230
is the first thing I bring
up so that I bring closure

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.050
to this issue.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.370
So I said, Charlie, you might
remember five or six years ago

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.840
and I brought up
the Capital Group.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.423
And he beamed.

00:04:02.423 --> 00:04:05.030
He said, oh yeah, I
remember that really well.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.220
And so I said, so
what was the reason

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.560
the Best Ideas Fund
didn't do well?

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.480
And then he said,
well, it wasn't once.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.300
They tried it several times.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.970
They tried setting up these
Best Ideas Fund multiple times

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.420
and each time it failed.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:30.750
And so he said, before I answer
the question why it failed,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.630
I want to give you a story from
my days at Harvard Law School.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.640
And so he said
that sometimes when

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.580
they had classes at Harvard Law,
the professor would bring up

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.210
a case where kind of facts were
such that it wasn't obvious

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.790
which side was in the
right, it could kind of

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.420
could go either way.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.820
And then they would divide
the class into halves randomly

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.320
and one half would argue for
the defendant and the other half

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.760
would argue against
the defendant.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.630
And then the two sides went
off and studied the facts

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.360
and then they made
their arguments.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.290
And then after all
of that was done,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.630
when they surveyed
the entire class,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:27.180
overwhelmingly the students
who had argued for the motion

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.830
believed strongly
that they were right

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.830
and the people who had
argued against the motion

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.200
believed strongly
that they were right.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.310
And again, these are folks
that before they had studied

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.430
the facts, they didn't
particularly have a leaning one

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.220
way or another.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:53.580
And then Charlie brought
up that basically, he

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:01.670
quoted this English actor,
Sir so Cedric Hardwicke.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.610
And Sir Cedric
Hardwicke basically

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.100
was kind of a little bit of
a smart ass, but he said,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.770
you're already fooled.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.110
And he said, I've been a
great actor for so long

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.050
that I can no longer
remember or know

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.141
what I think about any subject.

00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:21.640
Right?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:29.700
And Charlie said that the
even the temples and churches

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.380
make you repeat stuff
because as you shout it out,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.270
you pound it in.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:43.650
And basically, the
Best Ideas Fund Charlie

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.040
said was simply the picks were
the ideas that the managers had

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.590
spent the most time on.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.430
And so when they spent the
most time on these ideas,

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.886
they were the most
excited about them.

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:01.260
And of course, when they put
all of these ideas together,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.480
things didn't go so well.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.180
And in "Poor
Charlie's Almanac," he

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:18.920
talked about how the human mind
is a lot like the human egg.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:27.980
So once the first idea gets
in, just like the human egg,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.840
it locks up and sealed
off any additional ideas

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.620
from coming in.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.790
And so you have what
he calls the commitment

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.860
and consistency bias,
where basically we

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.060
get locked into what's
taken hold in our brains.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.870
And we see this even in
the political discourse,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.160
if you will.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.610
If you talk to folks
who love Donald Trump,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.530
they can't see
anything wrong with him

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.720
and if you talk to folks
who are on the other side,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.520
they can't see anything
right with him.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.170
And then of course,
reality probably

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.710
is some shade of gray
in the middle there.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.370
But Warren Buffett
also has a great quote.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.490
He says, what human
beings are best

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.980
at doing is interpreting
new information

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.640
so that their prior
conclusions remain intact.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:28.370
So I think there's also a second
reason why the Capital Group's

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.440
Best Ideas Fund didn't do well.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.210
So the portfolio managers
they have specialize.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.750
So someone specializing in
utilities, someone specializing

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.450
in the coal industry,
sometimes specializes

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.870
in artificial
intelligence and so on.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.100
And so naturally, if
you go to the guy who's

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.250
focused on the coal
industry he is probably

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.270
going to give you the
highest conviction coal

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.920
idea that he has.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.730
And it's kind of like a horse
that can count from one to 10

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.590
is a smart horse, it's
not a smart mathematician.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.550
And what you want in
the portfolio is not

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.380
the best coal company, what
you want is the best stocks.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.090
And so this kind of siloed
approach to people having

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.540
specializations can
lead to utilities,

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.710
for example, could
all be overvalued

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.630
at a particular point
in time, for example.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.020
And so you bring in a utility,
you bring in a coal stock,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.740
and so on so forth and
obviously, the end result

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.060
isn't going to be so good.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.400
So anyway, that was I
think the second thing

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.060
I thought might be a reason
why the Best Ideas Fund didn't

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.660
do so well.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:55.250
But getting back to the
human mind and the human egg,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:01.040
I thought about how is it
that we can kind of counter

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.810
these biases?

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:10.970
Because it's obviously
important because on one hand,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:17.310
we cannot make investments
until we spend time studying

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.770
companies, but if you spend
time studying companies you get

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.090
biased.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.230
So it's kind of an issue.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.160
So I was thinking
about, well, how

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.830
do I try to build a framework
which can get around

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.790
some of these issues?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.592
And so I came up
with a few hacks.

00:10:40.592 --> 00:10:43.050
I thought there might be two
or three things at least I can

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.570
think about that can be useful.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:51.570
And the first hack was that
just being aware of these facts

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.910
is a huge advantage.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.220
So being aware of the fact
that we have a lot of biases,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.370
our mind can play kind
of games, tricks on us;

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.820
the shut-off mechanism in
the human brain and so on.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.470
So being aware of
that, being rational.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.770
Charlie Munger says that
he hasn't been successful

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.740
because he's smart,
he's been successful

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.690
because he's rational.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.650
And another thing
that is I think

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.500
a very useful approach
is to be fluent

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.940
in the other side
of the argument.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.880
So if you're going
to go long the stock,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.300
it probably is a
very good exercise

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.110
to spend time developing a
thesis on why to go short.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.010
And that will force your
brain to think about things

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.720
that normally it doesn't
want to think about and such.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:51.540
So the first hack is just kind
of be aware and let rationality

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.680
prevail.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:03.610
The second hack is kind
of like what Buffett--

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:09.060
I just want to go back to
Warren Buffett's childhood, when

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.510
he was a teenager, before
I get to the second hack.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.180
So Warren Buffett when
he was a teenager used

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.780
to go to this racetrack
in Omaha called Aksarben,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.600
it's actually in Nebraska
spelled backwards.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.230
So this Aksarben racetrack,
what he used to do

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.870
is after all the
races had been run,

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.690
he'd gone collect all the
discarded tickets people had

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.540
left throughout the racetrack.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.870
He'd collect them all and then
he'd go through each ticket

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.260
carefully to see if there
were discarded tickets that

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.390
were actually winning tickets.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.460
Because people are having
fun, they're drinking,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.939
and so on and so sometimes they
might have a winning ticket

00:12:46.939 --> 00:12:47.730
and not realize it.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.680
And he would always find a few
of these free lunches, if you

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.650
will, tickets that are
actually winners but have

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.310
been discarded.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.130
And because he was underage,
he used his Aunt Alice

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.580
to go to the window and
collect on these tickets.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.170
And so this is what kind
of the teenage Buffett did.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:13.080
And then in 1993,
there was this author

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.830
who went by the name Adam Smith
and he wrote a few books--

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.220
"Money Masters" and
so on, "Super Money."

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.800
And he was interviewing
Warren Buffett

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.980
and he said, so if a younger
Warren Buffett were coming

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.200
into the investment field today,
what would you tell him to do?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.510
So Buffett says,
well, I would ask

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:44.370
him to do exactly what I did,
which is if you're working

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.790
with small sums, learn
about every publicly

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.220
traded company in the US.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.380
And then Adam Smith said,
but there's 27,000 companies.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.010
And Warren Buffett's answer
was, start with the As.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.750
And so it sounded like a
kind of facetious reply,

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.430
but it really wasn't.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.830
And at the 2001 Berkshire
shareholders meeting,

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.600
Buffett said that when
he started in '51,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.740
he went through every page
of the Moody's manual twice,

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.820
and a set of Moody's
manuals were 20,000 pages.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.430
In fact, I bought
one recently on eBay

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.380
and it's got about three
or four companies per page

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.930
and it goes about 1,500 pages.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.910
So there's a lot of data there.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.810
And he went through
that one year two times.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:42.480
And then in 2006, he
was talking to students

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:48.960
at Columbia University
and he was talking to them

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.250
about going through the
Moody's Manual in '51.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.330
I'll just read that it
was an absolute question

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.190
of turning the pages.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.360
On page 1433 he found
Western Insurance.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.480
In 1949, they earned $22 a
share; in 1950, $29 a share;

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.470
and in 1951, the range
in the stock price

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.850
was between $3 and $13,
kind of less than half

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.250
of the previous year's earnings.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.279
And he went to a
broker and looked

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:19.320
at the investment manual.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.290
There was nothing
wrong with the company.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.400
And then 10 pages later, he
found National American Fire

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.570
Insurance.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.700
Then he says, this book
really got sensational

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.070
towards the end.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.820
In 1950, it earned $29.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.500
The share price was $27,
book value was $135.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:45.560
And then in 2005, he told
the students just a year

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.450
before he met them someone
sent him a Korean stock market

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.210
guide.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.020
I actually have seen it,
it was put out by Citibank.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.460
And he spent about five
or six hours on a Saturday

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.190
going through this list
of Korean companies

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.370
with just some of the
basic information.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:09.050
And he picked out about 20
companies from that list

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.620
and he put about $100 million
of his personal portfolio

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.740
into those 20 companies.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.300
And so for example,
there was Daehan Flour,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.590
which sold about 1/4 of
the flour in South Korea.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:26.060
It had earnings of know
13,000 yuan three years ago,

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:31.100
18,000 yuan two years
ago, 23,00 a year ago,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.560
and it had over 100,000 yuan
per share in share and equities

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.300
and the whole thing was
going for 38,000 yuan.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.800
Right?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:46.550
So he did very well with
his Korean escapades

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.550
without really knowing a whole
lot about the businesses.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.950
He just kind of went
through them just purely

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.110
on a quantitative basis.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:17:02.540
And then in 2011, my
friend Guy Spier and I

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.760
found ourselves in
Warren Buffett's office.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.250
And you can see on the right
there's the "Japan Company

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.660
Handbook."

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.940
And I was actually
familiar with that handbook

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.510
because I had a subscription
to the exact same book.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.619
And so when I saw
that on Warren's desk,

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.510
it was quite a surprise.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.340
And so I asked him about it
because in 2011 Berkshire

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.580
Hathaway, they can't buy
Mickey Mouse companies.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.860
And the reason I was going
through the "Japan Company

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.300
Handbook" was I was looking at
Japanese net-nets, companies

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.860
trading well below their
liquidation values and so on.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:52.580
And so I asked Warren why he was
fooling around with the "Japan

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.190
Company Handbook" and of
course he puts on a poker face

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.880
and doesn't say anything.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.380
And then I picked
up the book and Guy

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:05.780
and I dog-eared some of
the pages of companies

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.120
that we had found
that were interesting.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.590
So without asking him, we
kind of mutilated his copy.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.267
And most of these companies were
toward the back of the book.

00:18:15.267 --> 00:18:16.850
He said, yeah, that's
always the case.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.300
It's really the back end is when
all the good stuff shows up.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.894
And then of course, he
doesn't tell us anything more

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.060
about what he did with that.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:29.300
But that was during
daytime hours

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.640
at Berkshire Hathaway
is what he is doing.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:39.110
So actually, the
teenager at Aksarben

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.490
and the young adult going
through the Moody's manual

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:49.490
and then the much older adult
going through the Korean stock

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.760
book and then the "Japan
Company Handbook," all of these

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.580
exercises are the same.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.150
They are all exercises
where you're spending

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.690
very little time on a given--

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.140
either a given ticket
or a given company--

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.370
and you're going
very rapidly through.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.850
I mean, if you're cycling
through 40,000 pages of 50,000

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.790
or 80,000 companies
in a year, you're

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.360
clearly not spending much
time on any single company.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.930
And to what he was looking for
when he was going through this

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:30.160
was very specific patterns,
and when he saw those patterns

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.830
he acted.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.530
And so the pattern
was it had to hit him

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.080
over the head with
a two by four.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.230
And so either it had to be
a winning ticket at Aksarben

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.260
or it had to be a stock
where it would just

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.360
stop you in your tracks--

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.780
$100,000 in book values
trading at $40,000,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.110
making $25,000 a year,
that sort of thing.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:58.400
And so that brings me
to the second hack,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.040
which is which is basically--

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.100
to paraphrase Nancy Reagan--

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.040
just say no quickly.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:13.010
So we have this built-in bias
where once we spend time,

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.080
we get pregnant with the idea.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.550
Well, don't spend a lot of time.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.050
Right?

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.670
And so you are rushing through
a lot of stuff and only spending

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.970
time on stuff that is looking
like an absolute no-brainer.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.480
And one of the things about
the investing business which

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.050
is so much better than baseball
is there are no called strikes.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:37.220
So we can let hundreds and
thousands of ideas go by

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.390
and it doesn't matter.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.110
So it doesn't matter if we
miss something that goes up 10x

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.150
or 100x or 1,000x.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.770
What matters is what
we actually invest in.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.910
So it's a very forgiving
business from the perspective

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.670
that we don't really
need to know everything

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.910
about everything, we don't
need to act on everything.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.820
We can miss lots
and lots of stuff

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.840
and it can still work out well.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:10.490
And the advantage-- so the just
say no fast is what it does

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.720
is it frees up a lot of time.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.080
So if you're going through
companies-- and many times

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.950
when I look at a business,
most business I look at,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.590
I'm done in seconds.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.200
Maybe it takes 10,
15, 20 seconds.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.900
Because I'm generally
looking like, for example,

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.690
on a typical day in
the office, people

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.862
will send me investment
ideas, which is great.

00:21:39.862 --> 00:21:41.320
I love to receive
investment ideas,

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.660
so it's mp@pabraifunds.com.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.860
Feel free.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:52.970
And so when I get in
and I look at the ideas,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.100
I just look for two numbers.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.445
I look at what is the stock
price of whatever idea

00:21:58.445 --> 00:22:03.350
is being pitched and what is
the person saying it's worth?

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.720
And unfortunately, most
of the things I receive

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.140
will be like the stock's
at $12 and here is all

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.330
the reasons it's worth $16.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.630
And so when I see something
like that, in about 10 seconds

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:15.800
I'm done.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.080
I don't even bother
to figure out

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.910
whether it could be
worth more and the person

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:21.800
missed it and so on.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.140
I just assume that some
intelligent person who

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.740
thought about it and
I'll just give them

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.875
full benefit of the doubt
that they've got it right.

00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:34.625
And so the same thing
with most companies.

00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:41.060
When I look at them, if it
doesn't hit me very strongly

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.350
with some intensity in
the first few seconds,

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.930
the first few
minutes, I move on.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:53.410
And if it does does
have unusual traits,

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.260
I mean, I think in 2012
I spend a lot of time,

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.320
probably two months, doing
nothing but studying Fiat

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.120
Chrysler and General Motors.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:08.350
And so it frees up a lot of
time to study the businesses,

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.170
but you've scanned a lot
of stuff on the horizon

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.120
before letting things in.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.710
So that's the
second hack is just

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:20.040
say no fast and that
kind of leaves room.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.050
And of course, if you
are a voracious reader

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.470
and you kind of buy into
what Charlie Munger says

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.080
is the latticework
or mental models,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.000
then many times things
will come together

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.340
in a very rapid timeframe.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.860
I mean, Warren
Buffett talks about

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:44.170
that he got a cold
call from a banker who

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.207
suggested to him that
Dairy Queen, which

00:23:47.207 --> 00:23:48.790
was privately held,
was a company that

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.470
was available for sale.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:54.540
And so Warren said, well, we
have our acquisition criteria

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.900
listed in the annual report.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.880
Does it meet all the conditions?

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880
And the guy said, yes.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.790
He said, well, send
me the numbers.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.730
And I think in less
than half an hour,

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.730
Berkshire had made an
offer and they had a deal.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.120
And so there was no way
Warren Buffett could

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.690
have looked at Dairy Queen
before because it's not

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.350
a public stock.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.470
But he knew enough
of the business

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:23.770
to understand that basically,
franchise restaurants, there's

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.309
a certain way you
can look at them

00:24:25.309 --> 00:24:27.350
and you can figure out
kind of what they're worth

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.725
and what you ought to be paying
for them and so on and so

00:24:29.725 --> 00:24:30.230
forth.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.550
And he went through that
math really quickly.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.350
He had an investment
at that time

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.250
in McDonald's, which he
probably studied at some length,

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:44.110
and that probably got him
where he needed to be.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:51.160
So the third hack, which is kind
of related to the second hack,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:25:01.290
is basically this
notion that Eli Broad

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.656
talks about in "The Art
of Being Unreasonable."

00:25:05.656 --> 00:25:06.780
It's the title of his book.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.910
It's a great book, actually.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.860
And so Broad is a very
successful entrepreneur.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:20.800
And so in the quest for
investments, be unreasonable.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.220
So don't settle for
this thing is at $13

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.030
and it should be $18
and that sort of thing.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.790
I always tell people,
please try to send me

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.090
things which are P/E of
one because P/E of one

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.770
is great, maybe P/E of two
and I can deal with that,

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:45.020
single digit math is easier
to deal with and such.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:54.840
And so basically, there are
over 100,000 publicly traded

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.050
stocks on the planet.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.470
There are always things going
on with different companies

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.560
getting into distress or high
growth or various other things.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.120
And because these are all
auction-driven markets,

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.300
by definition they
have wide swings.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.330
I mean, you can throw a dart
at a New York Stock Exchange

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.020
company, look at the 52-week
range on the company,

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.560
and it will be something
like $75 to $150.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:28.020
And if you pick a random
home in Palo Alto,

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.890
that is not the fluctuation
in the home price.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.640
And so auction-driven
markets have this nuance

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.210
where they kind of
either get euphoric

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.160
or they get
pessimistic, and they

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.180
might do both in the same year.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.370
And so that's what leads to the
distortion and the mispricing

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:53.592
and that's what we
can take advantage of.

00:26:53.592 --> 00:26:55.300
So those are some of
the thought I really

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.310
wanted to share with you.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.470
Again, this is kind
of a work in progress.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.530
I'm still trying
to get better at it

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:09.280
and I just want to make sure
that I am aware of the fact

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.430
that spending time on companies
is likely to make me biased.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.040
And so I'm hoping to
get better on that.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.939
So with that,
thank you, Saurabh.

00:27:19.939 --> 00:27:21.730
SAURABH MADAAN: Thank
you so much, Mohnish.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.960
So Mohnish, I'm going to pick
up right from where you said.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.800
The stock is at $12,
your target price is $18.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.770
Let's bring the element of
time into the picture, as well.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.310
If something is $18 today
and going to be $36 tomorrow

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.445
and so on, how do you look at
time horizons in your analyses?

00:27:40.445 --> 00:27:41.320
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.370
So $12 to $18 is not
really interesting

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.070
because that's kind of 50%.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.530
I know 50% sounds like a lot.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:54.070
But one of the things is
that in value investing,

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.650
there's a free lunch
and the free lunch

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.560
is that the greater
the margin of safety,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.410
the higher your returns.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:10.300
And so if a company is worth
$18, if I can buy it for $4,

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.300
I've got a huge
downside protection

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.740
in terms of what might happen.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.240
And the thing is businesses,
capitalism you guys

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.780
see it Google as
brutal, dog eat dog.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:28.240
I mean, and you're at the
cutting edge of all these guys

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.670
who want to encroach on
your territory, if you will.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:40.940
And so businesses are not
kind of steady entities.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.470
They fought for their survival.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.700
And so when we are
trying to project

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.040
the future for
business, we should

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.760
demand huge margins of safety.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.240
And so that's another
reason why the $12 to $18

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.550
is not that interesting because
it's not so much the timeframe.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.324
So if there's a
catalyst in place,

00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:04.240
let's say some company
is going to be acquired

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.960
for $18 in two months and
it's sitting at $12, well

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.830
if that's happening and
the odds, according to you,

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.020
are 95% that it's
going to close,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.540
sure then you can go for
it because everything

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.510
is encapsulated.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.968
SAURABH MADAAN: I
guess my question

00:29:18.968 --> 00:29:23.980
is more about quality versus
net asset value bargains.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.240
So you could be looking at a net
asset value bargain that is not

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.100
worth $18 selling at $12 versus
looking at a quality company

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.560
that you think is
worth maybe $18 today

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.010
but you know five years from
now it could compound to a much

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.570
higher value, as well.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.610
And that's where a net asset
value bargain or a commodity

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.674
company five years from
now might not necessarily

00:29:47.674 --> 00:29:48.340
have the runway.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.215
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:29:49.215 --> 00:29:53.050
I mean, I think that
it is always better

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.610
to buy compounders.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.820
It's always better
to buy growth.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.540
If you're buying an
asset because it's cheap,

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.410
your upside is limited.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:09.340
And so buying cheap
assets in my opinion

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.650
is not the name of the game.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.280
I think what you really
want to get to is

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.720
you want to get to high growth
where the intrinsic value

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.680
increases over time.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.150
But you want to be
extremely unreasonable.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.600
High growth at a P/E of one.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.870
Can we do that?

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.650
Can we do that?

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.380
So what you really want is--

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.390
I mean, what I'm
saying is that I

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:43.490
think any fool can see that
Amazon will grow a lot,

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.630
Google will grow a lot,
Facebook will grow a lot.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:52.700
It becomes a lot
harder to figure out

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:57.249
what the returns will be
when you're investing today.

00:30:57.249 --> 00:30:58.790
They probably still
are good returns.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:05.250
I would say that these are
very durable [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.910
and so they're probably going
to be around for a long time

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.370
and they probably are great
investments even today.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:17.210
But we have 100,000
stocks to choose from.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:23.240
Why not do some digging without
spending too much time on one

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.740
and why not try to find
that diamond in the rough

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.410
and then take it from there?

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:38.670
Like for example, Charlie
Munger said that in 2002 he

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:44.630
read "Barron's" for 50 years,
so from the 1950s until 2002.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.970
And probably every issue of
"Barron's" has at least five

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.560
or 10 ideas.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.820
And so he said for 50 years,
he read an issue every week.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:32:00.860
That's 2,500 issues
and 25,000 stock tips.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.330
And he didn't act
on any of them.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:09.470
He acted on one "Barron's" stock
tip in 2002, which was Tenneco.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:13.670
By 2004, 2005 he had made
8x on that investment.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:18.320
So Tenneco was under distress,
the stock went to like $1.60.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.720
Eventually, it went to $55.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.020
He was out at $15
to $20 a share.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.890
But he put $10 million, it
became about $80 million

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.480
in two or three years.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.780
Then he gave the money
to Li Lu and that money

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.410
is now about my guess is
around $500 million or so.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.110
So this is happening
in our time.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.320
This is not the 1960s story.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:54.110
From 2003 to 2017, without
riding Google or Amazon,

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.660
he got there, to 50x.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.970
It's 30% a year or something.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.710
So the thing is that
what caused that?

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.570
Well, what caused it
with extreme patience

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.750
coupled with extreme
decisiveness coupled

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.840
with being very unreasonable
in terms of what he

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.970
wanted in terms of valuations.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.892
And that's the mantra.

00:33:15.892 --> 00:33:17.600
SAURABH MADAAN: So
one of the nice things

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.140
to see at this year's
Berkshire meeting in Omaha

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.050
was Mr. Buffett and Mr.
Munger being very candid

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:28.100
about how they've been changing
their own ideas about investing

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.980
and also being very candid and
open about admitting mistakes.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.390
So in that same
spirit, I guess what

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.990
we'd be interested in
is learning from you,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.020
maybe asking you if you
are willing to share some

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.810
of your insights from
things that you've learned

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:49.130
from in over two decades of
investing now, specifically

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.055
from mistakes.

00:33:50.055 --> 00:33:50.930
MOHNISH PABRAI: Sure.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.520
Well, first of
all, just in terms

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.620
of what happened in
Berkshire in Omaha,

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.650
I think it was an
eye-opener for me.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.320
And I think what
Warren pointed out

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:07.070
were these four largest market
cap businesses in the US--

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:13.580
and I think it's Facebook, I
think Amazon, Google, Apple,

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.190
and I think maybe Microsoft
in there, too, I'm not sure.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:22.400
But the top four or five of them
are about $2.5 trillion or so

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:28.310
in value and it's almost
10% of the value of all

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.600
the public equities in the US.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:35.540
And he didn't say
it was anywhere near

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.590
obvious that these were in
bubble territory in the sense

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.469
that he said these are
businesses, all of them

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:46.580
can be run without capital,
they run on negative capital.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.800
So they have two
characteristics,

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.659
they're running a
negative capital

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.409
and they're very high growth.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:56.420
And when you have a business
with negative capital

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:02.800
needs in very high
growth markets,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.930
those are the holy
grail of investing.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:11.830
And so he regretted the fact
that in the case of Google,

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.330
the founders had
visited Omaha, they

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.520
wanted to get
Warren's permission

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.090
on some usage of his letter
and principals and such.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.854
And many of the
Google principles

00:35:21.854 --> 00:35:23.270
are Berkshire
Hathaway principles,

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.960
which is just fantastic.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.500
And so he said that they
were a customer of Google,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.540
they were spending
on ad words, it

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.610
was obvious to them it was a
great business but he blew it.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.330
And so that was a great insight.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.210
And I think one of
the things that us

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:41.890
value investors have to be
cognizant of is that there

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:45.750
is definitive
change taking place

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.730
in the way the world works.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:54.750
And clearly, it's concentrating
into a few companies which

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:56.700
are doing an excellent job.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:04.440
And so not being able to have
exposure to those businesses

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.060
is a negative.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.560
But on the other hand, there
are hundreds ways from Nirvana,

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.230
you can get there with
Tenneco and Li Lu as well.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.500
So in terms of I
think the lessons

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.560
over the last couple of decades.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.010
One of the biggest
lessons I've learned

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:28.110
is to not be focused
on cheap assets.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.800
Historically, I always wanted
to buy things that were cheap.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.880
I discounted the
value of quality.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:42.390
My take at this
point is I want both.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:43.890
I want to get more unreasonable.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.030
I want cheap and good, or
better yet cheap and great.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.680
And so the idea is that you sit
and do nothing for long periods

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.490
and you study areas where
that may be possible.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.830
And they will show
up from time to time

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.290
because you have
such a large base

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.610
of auction-driven companies
that you can get there.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.480
And another learning
I've had, which

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:16.750
has happened more recently, is
to focus on stocks in India,

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.057
for example.

00:37:18.057 --> 00:37:19.890
SAURABH MADAAN: So tell
us a little bit more

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.640
about specifically
outside the US

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.580
because I think
your US portfolio

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.240
is very easily seen through
[INAUDIBLE],, for example,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.105
and you are the
master of cloning

00:37:32.105 --> 00:37:35.330
who has popularized this idea
so people are using it for you.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.080
But tell us a little
bit about this idea--

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.913
MOHNISH PABRAI: Well,
I was surprised myself

00:37:38.913 --> 00:37:43.800
that more than 70% of the
assets in Pabrai Funds

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.090
are sitting in companies
that are domiciled

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.730
outside the United States,
and that's the highest

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.900
number it's ever been.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.646
I mean, I've usually basically
been very heavily in the US.

00:37:56.646 --> 00:37:57.770
And part of the reason is--

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.280
I mean, none of
this is by design.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.800
I'm just a bottoms
up stock picker,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.230
I just go wherever I
can find opportunity.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.620
So it just kind of happens
to be that's where it led.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.480
And I think India
is probably I think

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:19.300
around 25%, 30% of that pie,
somewhere in that range.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.460
And what I find interesting
is that India has probably

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.220
5,000 public companies,
and probably 4,000 of them

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.100
are not followed
because they're small,

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.450
family-controlled businesses.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.974
Now, there are a lot
of governance issues,

00:38:32.974 --> 00:38:34.390
there are a lot
of honesty issues,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.970
there are lots of
different issues.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:42.750
So one of my principals used to
be that I never met management

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.930
and I never visited the
businesses because all of that

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.480
was very inefficient in
terms of time and such.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.630
And I think meeting management,
one of the negatives

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.800
is that you're talking to people
who are exceptional at sales

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.390
and that can distort--

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:01.380
Ben Graham said it can basically
lead to a negative distortion.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.140
But one of the
changes I made kind

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.050
of destroying one of my
best-loved ideas was I

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:11.730
decided I couldn't do India
without meeting management.

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.760
And I think India is a lot
more like private equity

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.420
with some of the
smaller businesses.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.960
So I started making
trips where I've

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.010
been meeting various
management teams in India,

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.500
and those have
been exhilarating.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.330
I've really enjoyed--

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.719
I mean, I've met some companies
that are outright frauds.

00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:32.760
It's kind of fun to sit
in a room with the frauds

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.930
and see what they look like.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.740
There are no horns growing.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:41.370
And there are others which
are exceptional entrepreneurs

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.160
with great runways and great
governance and all of that.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.990
And so this is very
early in that process

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:52.800
and I think I've visited or met
with maybe a couple of dozen

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.040
companies.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.030
SAURABH MADAAN: Mohnish,
I guess for young students

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.490
and young individual investors
who are sort of listening

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:03.030
to this conversation
maybe later on YouTube,

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.890
could you share
with us an example--

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.140
it doesn't have to be a
current investment, could even

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.720
be a past investment--
outside the US.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.000
Could you walk them through
how you found something

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.210
like this so that they
get the same inspiration

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.740
around these ideas?

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.660
MOHNISH PABRAI: Sure.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:23.460
Well, like I said, I
think on any given day

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:30.030
at work, one, two, or three
ideas show up, which is great.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:35.060
And most don't take
more than a few seconds.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.280
But I remember a little
over two years ago,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.700
some person I
didn't know sent me

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.120
a 10- or 12-page writeup of
a company I'd never heard of,

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.240
a company in India
called Rain Industries.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.550
And I had never heard of
this company, never heard

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.410
of the guy who sent it to me.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:57.260
But I did a quick check
on the two numbers

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.260
that I care about, which
is the current stock

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.070
price and the target,
and they seemed

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.130
to be like a zero added
to the current stock price

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:10.220
to the target, which
got my attention.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.320
That's my kind of guy.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:17.120
And so I said, let's
read what's going on here

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.370
and see what kind of
drugs this guy is on.

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:23.900
And so I sat down
to read the report,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.510
and I have to say
it was immaculate.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.740
I mean, it was really
very well put together.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.380
I think the report
is on the web.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.980
If you do a search
for Rain Industries

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:43.000
and the guy who sent it to me,
his name is Rajiv Pasricha--

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.380
I haven't met him yet,
he lives in Delhi.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:51.950
And so everything he was saying
about the business and the way

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.250
he explained it was awesome.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.097
I mean, I think that there was
nothing I could possibly find.

00:41:58.097 --> 00:41:59.930
So the only thing that
was left for me to do

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.580
was to ratify the facts.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.610
So he was stating this is the
business this company is in,

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.830
this is where it's going,
this is the market cap,

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.210
this is what it's worth, this
is why it's worth so much.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:12.390
So I just spent probably not
more than a few hours just

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:17.570
not testing that every
number was accurate

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.060
and that everything that
was being said in the report

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.710
was the way it is.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:25.970
And it wasn't a
large business, I

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:29.240
think the market cap at that
time was about $200 million.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.204
And in India, we can't buy
more than 10% of the business,

00:42:34.204 --> 00:42:35.120
so that's what we own.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.090
We own about 9.5%
of the company.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:44.080
And so far, it's
tripled in price.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.865
But it didn't do anything for
like, what, 20 months and then

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.050
in six months it came alive.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:53.310
And I think it'll keep
going for a while.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:59.524
But that's an example where
unreasonableness paid off.

00:42:59.524 --> 00:43:00.940
SAURABH MADAAN:
So Ben Graham used

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.870
to have this rule, maybe a
heuristic more than a rule,

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:10.990
if something doesn't do too much
for three years or four years

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.270
and if I'm
recollecting correctly,

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:17.070
he would just say, let's
discard this and rotate.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:20.530
With a company like GM, I
guess, which hasn't really

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:24.365
done much since the IPO, how
do you think of this heuristic?

00:43:24.365 --> 00:43:25.240
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.698
I think it's a very
good heuristic.

00:43:26.698 --> 00:43:28.870
And especially, it's
a very good heuristic

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.700
when you think
about all the biases

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.500
that can creep into our brains.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.740
So we have a large
position in GM.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.910
We have some gain, we
don't have a huge gain.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:42.490
Certainly, the analyzed
return since we've owned it

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.950
is pretty low.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.950
The stock is cheap.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:51.130
I am reaching the realization--

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:54.370
maybe it's right or wrong, we'll
see how the future unfolds--

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:58.630
that we may not get
much of a return,

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.790
even though the cash
flows and everything

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.940
are likely to come in, simply
because the market's always

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.770
concerned about what
happens in the future

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.420
and there will
always be concern.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.050
So my thinking of the GM
position at this point

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:18.160
is to think of it as cash
and think of it as available

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.890
for something more unreasonable.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.679
And so we'll see.

00:44:22.679 --> 00:44:23.470
SAURABH MADAAN: OK.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.450
So I have two more
questions for you.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:30.280
One is just a little
bit about Dakshana.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.400
I think one of your students
this year were in the top 50

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.690
all India ranks in the
joint entrance exam.

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:40.420
Maybe could you tell the
audience and folks on YouTube

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.550
a little bit about
how Dakshana started

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.380
and where it is
now in its journey?

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.440
Because I think that is also
a very big compounding engine

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.250
for you.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:48.600
MOHNISH PABRAI: Sure.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.240
Yeah.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:54.700
Well, the thing is like I
say, I am a shameless cloner.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.250
It's good to be a
shameless cloner.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:02.590
And I am probably
influenced by Buffett

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:09.790
that the best course of
action in terms of wealth

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.480
is to recycle back to society.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.060
I think if you're
trying to give it

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.670
to your gene pool in general,
you do more harm than good.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.720
So I knew a while back that
we wanted to recycle back

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:24.700
to society and I was
looking for a cause that

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.750
resonated and delivered
kind of high social return

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:29.560
on investment.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.860
And I ran into a
guy in Bihar who

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.650
ran this program called
Super 30, which I was

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.970
very impressed with, in 2006.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.510
And so I met him in
2007 and I wanted

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.870
to fund him and
scale that program.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.880
Basically, he was
he was picking up

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.360
kids who came from very
impoverished backgrounds

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.670
in Bihar and he was spending
about eight months with them,

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.430
30 of them at a time, and
then almost 100% of them

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:58.460
were going to the IAT.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.850
So if you're taking
a family where

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:06.520
the incomes are
$50 to $100 a month

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:10.810
and you're getting kids to
IAT who then get basically

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:15.370
hooked into the global economy
where they're making thousands

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.520
or tens of thousands a year in
India and even more than that

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.074
if they went into
places like California,

00:46:22.074 --> 00:46:22.990
that was a no-brainer.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.870
And plus, that permanently
kind of unshackled the family,

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:29.690
if you will, and extended
family, if you will.

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:33.620
And so when he said he
didn't want to kind of scale,

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.780
then I said, OK.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.490
Why don't we just
clone his model?

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:39.670
So I asked him if he had
any concern with me cloning.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.380
He said, no, that's great.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:41.950
Feel free.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.700
I'll try to help you, as well.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.750
And so that's what Dakshana
was set up as a vehicle

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.540
to try to clone Super 30.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:55.360
And what we do is we basically
identify kids who are poor

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.290
but they're very
talented, very gifted.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:03.250
And in India, if you
get a kid into IAT,

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:06.839
there's a very high government
subsidy, probably an 80%, 90%

00:47:06.839 --> 00:47:07.630
government subsidy.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.540
So the education is
almost free, just

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.410
a few thousand dollars, or
probably like $2,000 a year

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.510
is what you pay.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.260
And even that you can
get loans and so on.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:25.300
So the easiest way to
lift a family from poverty

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.710
is if there's high IQ in that
family, you can get into IAT

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:32.070
and then get them out.

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:36.100
So Dakshana has sent about--

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:41.930
north of 1,000 kids so far have
cracked the IAT entrance exam,

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.290
been accepted by the IATs.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:48.010
And now we have about 70% of
our kids every year who make it

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.010
through, which is great.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:54.680
And so we have about 800
or so kids in our program

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.120
at any given time and
we are scaling it up.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.560
I think by next year,
we'll be at over 1,100

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.102
and then we'll keep
going from there.

00:48:02.102 --> 00:48:02.935
SAURABH MADAAN: Wow.

00:48:02.935 --> 00:48:04.100
Congratulations on that.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.330
MOHNISH PABRAI: Well,
there's a great team.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:06.080
It works out well.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.079
SAURABH MADAAN: Awesome.

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:08.750
So one final question
and then we'll

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.150
roll it out to the audience.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.970
Could you give three
book recommendations?

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:16.250
I know you read a
lot, so I'm only going

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.650
to ask for the top three--

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:22.310
and they have to be other
than "Poor Charlie's Almanac"

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.830
and the Buffet biographies--

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.319
for the folks in your audience
here, as well as on YouTube.

00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:29.360
MOHNISH PABRAI: Oh, sure.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.420
I mean, I think two
of the books I think

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.620
are books I'm just about to
send to Warren and Charlie,

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:40.740
so I think you guys
might enjoy it.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:46.640
One of them is called
"The Beak of the Finch."

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.800
I think Jonathan Weiner
is the name of the author.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.030
It's a very old book.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:53.484
I think it came
out 24 years ago.

00:48:53.484 --> 00:48:54.900
I don't know if
guys have read it.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:55.660
SAURABH MADAAN:
Charles Darwin related.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.534
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:48:56.534 --> 00:48:59.150
So I was fascinated by the book.

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:01.910
I think that it's
talking about a couple

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:05.930
of researchers that spent
several months a year on one

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:09.200
of the very small
islands in the Galapagos

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.260
and they did this for
more than 20 years.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:16.980
And to their surprise, they
saw evolution in real time

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.480
with something
Darwin didn't see.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.270
So I think it's a great book--

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:24.070
unrelated to investing, but
I think it's a great read.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:30.050
And then the second one
is a book called "Am I

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:35.210
Being Too Subtle," and
that's a book by Sam Zell.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.440
And some of you might
have heard of Sam Zell.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.790
And this book, I think
what I would recommend

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:45.000
is to listen to it,
rather than read it.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.075
So it's a good way to kill time
on the Bay Area expressways.

00:49:49.075 --> 00:49:50.950
SAURABH MADAAN: It's in
his own voice, right?

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:51.825
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:49:51.825 --> 00:49:54.110
It's in his own voice.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.910
It's in his kind of
raspy Sam Zell voice.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:00.230
And so I've been
listening to it in my car.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.510
And I think there
are a lot of lessons,

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:08.810
a lot of lessons for investing
and operations and culture

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:09.320
and so on.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:16.010
And Sam is very candid, in
your face about the sharing.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:21.060
And so I think that's
another good book.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:25.970
And the third one,
which I'm rereading

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:32.420
and I'm learning a lot
from, is the other biography

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.532
on Charlie Munger, "Damn Right."

00:50:34.532 --> 00:50:35.990
So I know you said,
don't go there,

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.980
but "Dan Right" came out
probably 17 years ago.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.240
And there's a lot of
good stuff in there

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.860
in terms of some of the
different things, especially

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:54.500
some of the evolution Warren
and Charlie went through

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.820
from buying cheap assets to
focusing on better businesses.

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.334
And so I think there's
a lot of lessons there.

00:51:01.334 --> 00:51:02.750
And also, there's
a lot of lessons

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:07.040
about in many ways I
think Charlie Munger got

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:14.780
dealt a bad hand, if you will,
a far worse hand than most of us

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:18.440
are dealt. He had to
deal with the death

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:23.300
of his nine-year-old son, he
had to deal with blindness

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.650
in one eye after a
cataract operation that

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:31.790
went south, and then
just the extreme pain

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.810
of eviscerating that eye.

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:38.870
And so there's a lot
of human qualities

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:42.260
you can see in that
book where he's really

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.000
been really stoic
about that in the sense

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.820
that when there's been kind
of pain and suffering, in fact

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.380
he's absolutely
rational about his eye.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.950
He said at the time for the
procedure he was going through,

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.230
there was a 5% chance
of complications.

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:05.590
And so his rational side
said, one out of 20 I'm

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:08.620
going to get it and if
it happens to be me,

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.414
that's the way it is.

00:52:10.414 --> 00:52:12.580
SAURABH MADAAN: - And
Mohnish, before I roll it out,

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:14.080
can I scoot in one
little question,

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.890
what does your
average day look like?

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:21.170
MOHNISH PABRAI: Well,
my average day--

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:25.600
so one of the things I
learned form from Buffett

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.490
is to not put stuff
on the calendar.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:31.610
So I try to avoid--

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.720
except when Saurabh
calls me, I try

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.140
not to put things on my calendar
in terms of what I have to do.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:44.750
I like to have kind of a
very free day, if you will.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:50.080
And so actually, quite
frankly, I usually sleep late.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.650
So I usually roll into
work pretty late, probably

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.680
past 10 o'clock usually.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:02.020
And I don't really have
an agenda of what to do.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.250
I just kind of--

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:06.660
I obviously have a lot of
different reading material

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.650
and some that I'm going through.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.800
I'll see what's going to come
in the [INAUDIBLE] over the day,

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.340
if you will, and
then decide kind

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:17.470
of how I want to spend my time.

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:22.990
And one of the things I've
added recently is every quarter,

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:26.470
I'm spending about seven,
eight days in India.

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.690
So those days I usually
just kind of fill

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.700
with meeting companies and such.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:34.060
And in the meantime,
I'm actually

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.980
trying to learn more
about these businesses

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.820
before I go meet
the people and such.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.050
So some of that kind of
directs some of the reading.

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.740
But that's basically
how the day is

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:52.420
structured is to try not to put
a lot of things on the schedule

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:56.630
and to try to keep it
as free form as I can.

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:59.710
SAURABH MADAAN: You don't have
a McDonald's on your way where

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:01.200
your order depends on them--

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.200
MOHNISH PABRAI: I do.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.450
I do have a
McDonald's on the way.

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:08.950
I do sometimes pick up
McDonald's I have never

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:12.580
tried to calibrate the
spending base on the market,

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.250
so I'll leave that to Warren.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:20.800
I take a nap every afternoon,
so afternoon naps are great.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.325
They've got pods here to sleep?

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.200
SAURABH MADAAN: Yeah.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:23.991
MOHNISH PABRAI: OK.

00:54:23.991 --> 00:54:26.730
So please make sure you
take advantage of those.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:32.350
And yeah, so basically,
I'm pretty refreshed,

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:36.260
I think, by the evening so
I can then spend more time

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.740
with the reading and such.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.156
SAURABH MADAAN:
Your reading, most

00:54:39.156 --> 00:54:40.390
of it happens electronic or--

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.790
MOHNISH PABRAI: Oh, no.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.520
I don't read electronic at all.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.690
SAURABH MADAAN: Tell us why.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:44.920
MOHNISH PABRAI: I
just have never--

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.086
I mean, that's a preference.

00:54:46.086 --> 00:54:49.090
I've just never had--

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:55.630
even my e-mails, most of my
e-mails don't come to me.

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:59.590
I mean, even if it's addressed
to me, it goes to my assistant

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:02.450
and they get printed out.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:08.950
And I get all my
emails at 11:00 AM.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:12.340
And by about 11:00--

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.774
I get a folder
every day at 11:00

00:55:14.774 --> 00:55:16.190
and the folder has
anything I want

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:19.450
to look at-- any mail,
e-mails, things to sign.

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:23.050
Whatever is required
in terms of any admin,

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:25.480
it all shows up in
a folder at 11:00

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.500
and by about 11:15,
11:20, I'm done.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.850
I'm done with whatever
responses, whatever--

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:34.780
and my response usually
are chicken scratch.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.222
You already gotten
some of those, right?

00:55:37.222 --> 00:55:38.680
Chicken scratch
right on the thing.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.945
SAURABH MADAAN: - It's
not easy to make out.

00:55:41.945 --> 00:55:42.820
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.670
Sometimes they bring it back
to me, I can't read it myself.

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:47.740
So that's really bad.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.100
But it doesn't happen too often.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:59.740
So I agree with Charlie
that the multitasking

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:05.620
that we have going on today
in society is a net negative.

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.690
I think it just doesn't--

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:09.910
when you're trying
to do three things

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:11.860
you don't get to deep thought.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.860
And I think so I'm
trying not to do that.

00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:20.530
And so that's how
I've structured it.

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:23.650
I think Warren and Charlie
are even better than that

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.330
because they don't even have a--

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:28.152
I mean, Charlie doesn't
even have a computer.

00:56:28.152 --> 00:56:29.860
I don't know whether
he has a cell phone.

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.120
I don't think he has
a cell phone, either.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.578
SAURABH MADAAN: I
think Mr. Buffett

00:56:32.578 --> 00:56:35.235
has sent like one email
that got into public domain.

00:56:35.235 --> 00:56:36.110
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:39.589
The one email became part
of the Gates antitrust

00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:41.380
and he decided after
that, that was the end

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.950
of his email writing days.

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:45.580
I think he's done
three or four tweets.

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.155
He's done a few tweets,
so he's getting there.

00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:49.030
SAURABH MADAAN: Yeah.

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.530
All right.

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:50.474
So thank you so much.

00:56:50.474 --> 00:56:52.140
Let's open it up for
audience questions.

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.060
Yeah.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.420
AUDIENCE: So Mohnish, can
you share your insight

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.430
on the way the
market has reacted

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.290
to the new administration?

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.780
Because to me, it's
counter-intuitive.

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.830
I mean, most of the
corporations are

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:09.100
kind of opposite to the
government is functioning

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.195
and still after we
have a new president,

00:57:13.195 --> 00:57:16.630
the market has gone gangbusters.

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:19.630
So planning is something
that the new administration

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:24.640
is kind of lacking and
to me, things like growth

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.520
doesn't happen as an
accident but there

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.380
needs to be a lot of
planning for that.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.914
So any insight on that?

00:57:31.914 --> 00:57:33.580
MOHNISH PABRAI: Well,
so the first thing

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:40.600
is I think there's not much I
can gain from having insights

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:46.090
into what the market has done or
will do because I'm not making

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:49.210
market bets, if you
will, in the sense

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:52.960
that we're not trying to
figure out when to buy the S&amp;P

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.770
or sell the S&amp;P, if you will.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:58:00.330
So quite frankly,
that question is

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:03.180
for me not really relevant
because it doesn't matter.

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.730
But I would just say
this, that yes, we've

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:12.670
had a rally since
Trump's election.

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:17.470
But I think a bigger
kind of underlying story

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:23.020
may be that if
interest rates stay low

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:28.420
for an extended period of time,
then present valuations may

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:32.914
be a bargain, the stock
market actually may be cheap.

00:58:32.914 --> 00:58:34.330
And of course, we
won't know that.

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.842
We won't know that till we
get to 2020, 2025 and so on

00:58:37.842 --> 00:58:39.050
and see kind of where we are.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:41.680
So markets are
discounting mechanisms.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.720
If the market has a
crystal ball which tells it

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.950
where interest rates
are in 2025 or 2030,

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:50.620
then you can get to some
numbers accordingly.

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.900
The best that I can
tell about the market

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:58.990
is that there are
very few bargains

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.500
and there may be things that
are either fully priced,

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.870
there may be some things
that are overpriced,

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:07.420
but I don't see things
being egregious in the sense

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:13.000
that I saw valuations
in '99 and 2000

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.980
that were egregious--
pets.com and so on.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:20.320
And we lived to that, at
least I lived through that.

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.260
But today when you see
some of these companies

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:29.380
with these huge market caps like
Alphabet or Amazon or Facebook

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.680
and so on, there's
a lot of reasons

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.840
why you can justify
that because there's

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:40.440
a lot of underlying logic which
didn't exist with pets.com.

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:47.140
And so there is premium pricing,
you can say, on some assets,

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:51.010
but perhaps those assets
deserve premium pricing.

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:55.960
So the best thing is I would
say ignore the market because it

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.350
really has no
relevance and focus

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.520
on the minutiae, specific
business, specific stock

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:10.030
price, and hopefully
low single digit P/E.

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:12.040
AUDIENCE: So I
was very surprised

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.040
to find out that you
and Buffett still use

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.730
those books to look for stocks.

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:21.340
I mean, these days it's so
easy to find information.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.830
You can just go to GuruFocus,
use the stock screener,

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:24.790
find P/E one.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:27.580
You can do that
in half a second.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.854
Why does that still work?

01:00:28.854 --> 01:00:29.770
MOHNISH PABRAI: Right.

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:31.750
So actually, that's
a great question.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:39.250
Because in 2006 when he invested
in Daehan Flour in Korea

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:43.630
you could have had
Capital IQ, you

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.740
can run any screen
you wanted, it

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.980
would have popped up
all kinds of companies.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:53.350
And if you believe that
there are tens of thousands

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.830
of people with lots of
assets who have Capital IQ

01:00:55.830 --> 01:01:00.400
subscriptions, that stock should
have not been at that price.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.870
But just like the $1 bill on the
ground where the professor says

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.690
it can't be a real dollar bill
because in an efficient market,

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:09.970
there wouldn't be a
$1 bill on the ground,

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:17.560
the reality is that the speed
of access to information

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:23.680
is not the determining factor
in leading to market efficiency.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.430
I think that markets, because
they are auction-driven

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:30.280
and because there are humans
involved, they vacillate

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.990
between fear and greed.

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:34.480
And at that time in
the Korean market

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.140
for whatever was going on then,
there was more fear than greed.

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:46.210
And so I find, for
example, even today there

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:51.550
are lots of bargains in South
Korea, amazing bargains.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:53.710
SAURABH MADAAN: Can
you give an example?

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.085
MOHNISH PABRAI:
Well, you know we

01:01:55.085 --> 01:02:00.760
are buying right now so
we can't quite go there

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.030
because these things trade--

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:05.530
I mean, some of
these things, I'm

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:10.210
barely able to get $2,000
a day off the stock.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.830
We have a $500
million, $600 million

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.930
dollar portfolio
so we are nibbling.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:19.210
But we're buying things at
two and a half times earnings.

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:21.880
And I'm buying two and a half
times earnings of a business.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.120
So for example, I'll send you
on a treasure hunt, how's that?

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.051
A treasure hunt is more exciting
than giving you the treasure,

01:02:30.051 --> 01:02:30.550
right?

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:30.940
SAURABH MADAAN: Sure, sure.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.630
MOHNISH PABRAI:
It's always better

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:32.950
to hunt for the treasure.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:36.880
So I mean, I have
an insight and I

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.370
don't know whether the insight
will be right or wrong,

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:40.210
you can tell me.

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:47.640
So we know that there is lots
of different permutations

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.870
and combinations of changes
happening in the way humans

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:52.900
travel.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:53.400
Right?

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.580
So we used to have cars
and public transport

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.410
and taxis, that was it, right?

01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:03.140
Now you have Uber, you have Uber
Pool, you might get autonomous,

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.550
Weymo.

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.717
There's a lot of
different combinations.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.300
Some of you might
be familiar with Via

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.440
in New York, which
I think is great.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:20.460
And so the end result is that
humans have a lot more options

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.150
available for
transport and mobility

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.220
and the price is coming down.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.950
And also you have low
gas prices and so on.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:33.240
So it is an absolute
certainty in my mind

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.530
that per capita
miles being driven

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:42.330
in some kind of public transport
for humans is going up.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:45.810
I mean, I remember when I was
a student, I had my bicycle

01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:48.090
and mobility was very
restricted because I was poor

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.020
and I didn't have a lot
of places I could go.

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:53.320
Now I just see with my
kids, you can go anywhere.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.500
So if miles driven per
human are going up,

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.100
how can you play that?

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.540
Well, one way you can play
that is tire companies.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.210
OK?

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:08.580
So no matter what
happens, I'm almost

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.160
sure there will
be more tire sold

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.580
five years from now or 10 years
from now versus yesterday.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:20.610
And actually, if we get to
electric cars taking off,

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:23.430
they want weight
reductions so then they

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:24.920
make those tires paper thin.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.870
How many people
have a Tesla here?

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.040
Not Tesla owners.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.657
A value crowd.

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:30.990
SAURABH MADAAN: Value investing.

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:32.989
MOHNISH PABRAI: They're
a hard core value crowd.

01:04:32.989 --> 01:04:33.600
All right.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.250
So you know that like the
Teslas and of the Leafs and all

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.650
that, they have these
special tires which

01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:43.740
don't last very long but
cost a lot because they

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.087
want to keep the weight down.

01:04:45.087 --> 01:04:47.170
And so those are even
better for the tire company,

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:48.990
they keep wearing out very fast.

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:54.330
So my take was that
tires will do well.

01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:58.600
And so I made an investment
in a company in India,

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.170
which was really
cheap, which made

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:05.190
one of the ingredients
that goes into rubber

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.210
that goes into tires.

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:09.060
And I think that
will do very well.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:13.080
And the other was
a company in Korea

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.430
which is in one shape or
another in the tire business

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:18.900
and it's growing, actually.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.080
It's going to grow quite a bit.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.350
Even without these
demographic things happening,

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:25.590
it will still grow.

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:30.510
And if I'm buying a two and a
half or three times, in three

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.550
years I have all my cash back.

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:35.584
So that's the beauty
of P/E of three.

01:05:35.584 --> 01:05:37.500
SAURABH MADAAN: So it's
a tire-related company

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.685
in Korea with a P/E of
three for the treasure hunt.

01:05:41.685 --> 01:05:42.560
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.210
Have fun.

01:05:48.072 --> 01:05:49.530
AUDIENCE: So I
wanted to understand

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:52.710
how do you decide when
these three P stocks--

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:55.835
or not even three P, stocks
like Amazon and Google,

01:05:55.835 --> 01:05:57.210
when they are
valued so much, how

01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:59.220
do you decide when
to sell stocks

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.860
that have worked for you?

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.207
And a quick follow-up,
do you short?

01:06:03.207 --> 01:06:04.290
MOHNISH PABRAI: I'm sorry.

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:05.748
AUDIENCE: Do you
also short stocks?

01:06:05.748 --> 01:06:06.815
Do you short sell?

01:06:06.815 --> 01:06:07.690
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:12.240
So I have never shorted
a stock in my life.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.900
I will go to my grave without
ever having shorted a stock.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:19.890
I would suggest you follow
that same mental model.

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:21.510
If the only thing
you learn here is

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:24.100
to give up shorting
if you are shorter,

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.840
then I think it would
be an hour well-spent.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.710
So it's a great question.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:38.080
So each of us, I think,
has a limited quota

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:45.110
of 100 baggers that will
show up in our portfolio.

01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:50.200
I think I have had more than
my quarter of 100 baggers

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:56.730
that I was smart enough to
buy but too dumb to hold.

01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:58.140
And there's a long list.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:01.670
I used to own [INAUDIBLE]
Bank in '94, I don't know,

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:05.670
it was 150 times, I probably
got like 30% return after five

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:11.070
years; so that Blue Dot--

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:14.330
there's this 200
baggers I did capture.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:20.550
I owned Amazon in 2002,
I think, at $10 a share.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:22.650
I think it was 10%
of my portfolio then.

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:27.570
And I got 40% in a few months
and I was out so that's great.

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:31.770
But anyway, so
what I have learned

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:43.070
is don't sell the compounders
when they get fully priced

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:48.890
and don't sell the compounders
when they get overpriced.

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:54.770
Only sell the compounders when
it's absolutely obvious to you

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.020
that it's egregiously priced.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:02.900
The big money is in
riding the compounders.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:07.280
But you have to try to get in on
them at a reasonable valuation

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.290
and you have to be right on the
fact that they are compounders.

01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:15.060
And so it's a
forgiving business.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.342
You can be wrong quite a
few times and still be OK.

01:08:17.342 --> 01:08:19.550
SAURABH MADAAN: So Mohnish,
does that buy [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:25.903
mean that your buy versus hold
criteria may not be identical?

01:08:25.903 --> 01:08:28.069
MOHNISH PABRAI: It is not
identical, that's correct.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:31.040
I mean, this is a
very difficult lesson

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.250
for a cheapskate like me, it
was a very difficult lesson

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.750
for Warren and Charlie.

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:39.170
I think they learned that
lesson from See's Candy.

01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:41.640
That was a seminal
purchase for them.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.240
And the end date
they saw in that case

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.160
because of the
controlled business,

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.760
they could just see
the way it mushroomed.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:57.200
And so I think that if you get
businesses where management is

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.130
exceptional or the
[INAUDIBLE] are exceptional,

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.760
or in the case of
Google you get both--

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.729
buy one, get one
free, which is great--

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:11.060
then I think those
are businesses

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.729
you just don't want to touch.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:18.649
I met some folks in India in
some of these meetings that

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:20.359
blew me away.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:25.939
I mean, in some cases, I
just looked at it and said,

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:29.170
there's tailwinds, but
in addition to tailwinds,

01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:34.430
there is a phenomenal
operator and the price

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.270
below liquidation level.

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.770
And so those are
all good tenants.

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:41.899
So that's what you
want to look for.

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:45.590
But clearly, in my opinion,
I don't buy the notion

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:48.350
that you buy your
portfolio every day.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.470
To me, buy and
hold are different

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:56.330
and the cheapskate in me
still wants to not pay up.

01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:58.190
But I was able to
at a point in time

01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:01.640
get to where Google was just
at the edge of making it

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.770
so it made it, which is great.

01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:06.380
And that's the key
is that you want

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:10.730
to ride the compounders
for long periods.

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:14.197
SAURABH MADAAN: Is this
operator by any chance Piramal?

01:10:14.197 --> 01:10:15.030
Because I know you--

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:16.363
MOHNISH PABRAI: There are many--

01:10:16.363 --> 01:10:17.660
Piramal is a great operator.

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.450
That wasn't the one Piramal.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.700
But a great operator.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.670
And But no, there
are many in India,

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:33.080
I think, who are young and
great ethos, great drive.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.390
Piramal is an example
of a compounder.

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:40.160
And I think that if you
own something like Piramal,

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.080
I would just ignore the
price for a long time,

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.859
as long as Ajay is healthy.

01:10:44.859 --> 01:10:47.025
AUDIENCE: On a related
question, you first mentioned

01:10:47.025 --> 01:10:48.590
the best ideas
portfolio, thinking

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:52.400
how it would work in terms of
management positions, impact,

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:52.990
sizing.

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:56.780
I was curious how
you think about that

01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.300
sizing relative to
margin of safety

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.145
in your valuation
of the company.

01:11:02.145 --> 01:11:03.020
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.490
So that's a good question.

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:10.670
I think bet sizing just
gets down to conviction.

01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:13.010
Part of it gets
down to whether it's

01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:16.040
other people's
money or your money

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.820
and also kind of
where you are in life.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:23.390
I think if you're a
young engineer at Google,

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:27.860
you have many decades
of productive earnings

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.240
ahead of you.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:34.910
And so the key there is
to spend less than you

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:41.100
or earn and put it away
into places that make sense.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.180
So I would say it's probably
the mistake to have,

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:48.330
in that situation, more
than 10 or 12 positions.

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.080
And I think there's nothing
wrong with having money

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.047
in an index fund or
a few index funds.

01:11:54.047 --> 01:11:55.380
I think that's a good way to go.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.040
And so if you didn't
have a lot of ideas,

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.360
then you're going
to sock money away,

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.600
especially in a 401(k)
with matching and so on,

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.440
you could do that.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.620
And then occasionally
when things show up

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.890
on the radar which
are no-brainers,

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:15.530
then you can switch some
of the index fund money

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:21.260
into an actual stock idea and
such and take it from there.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.630
That's how I would do it.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:24.790
SAURABH MADAAN: Great.

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:27.410
I want to thank you so much,
Mohnish, for being so generous

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:29.120
and for sharing
your time with us.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.610
And thank you all for being
such a wonderful audience.

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.734
MOHNISH PABRAI: Well, always
a pleasure to be here.

01:12:33.734 --> 01:12:40.310
And I can check a box
that Alphabet is doing OK.

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.910
Thank you.

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:43.660
[APPLAUSE]
