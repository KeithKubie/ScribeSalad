and the question was framed around how

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
and the question was framed around how
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.900

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
we solve for a global emissions problem
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.230
we solve for a global emissions problem
and for me that's a question for 2050

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
and for me that's a question for 2050
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.210
and for me that's a question for 2050
because the problem right now is that

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220
because the problem right now is that
 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.480

to the changes that were already
 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.120
to the changes that were already
experiencing and climate change so the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
experiencing and climate change so the
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.639
experiencing and climate change so the
debate needs to change from mitigation

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
debate needs to change from mitigation
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.040
