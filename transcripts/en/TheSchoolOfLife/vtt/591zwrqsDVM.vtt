00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.240
You okay?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.640
Okay? Yeah I'm alright, yeah. How
are you, you alright? Yeah. Why, what?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:29.300
I dunno, you kind of just seem a bit distracted or
something. Distracted? No, no, I'm alright.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.320
I'm not distracted.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.760
Okay cool, so I got the tickets to Venice for
March.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.880
That's... terrific, really terrific.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.780
Terrific.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.629
You know I think that like some souls, are
kind of they're meant to together beyond space,

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.409
time, whatever. Look babe, like born to be
together but I also think that might not necessarily

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.450
mean they should be together on a day to day
basis.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.959
So, are you saying you don't want to be with
me any more?

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:26.519
NO, no not at all no. That's so simple, it's
way more complicated than that.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.880
I cannot deal with this. What do you even
want from me? I'm sorry, I don't get it. Like

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.700
where do you imagine this is even going to
go?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.560
Look why can't we just instead of overthinking
it just you know, not ruin the evening and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.049
you know order a pizza and watch a film together
and have some fun.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.260
Hey, come on. I love you, come on. It pains
me to hear you like this.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:13.380
I know you get a bit down on your birthday
so I got you this.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.400
This is the last one. Are you going to be
alright?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.909
Sure.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:51.040
I don't love you anymore and I'm sorry. I
know it hurts but it's how I feel.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.600
You just need some space.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.680
Mmm, I don't, I'm not sure that space... I
could all the space I want but I think I would

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.599
end up occasionally maybe wanting to sleep with
you but nothing more so I think I just can't

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.239
really see us having a future. I think, erm,
I think you should move on.
