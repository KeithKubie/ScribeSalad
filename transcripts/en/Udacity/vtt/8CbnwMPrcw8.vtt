00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.705
After colonization of the whole world by about

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.360
14,000 years ago, stable populations grew larger, and were

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.480
insulated from the original populations from whence they

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.480
came. As a result, new traits emerged in various

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.680
regions that stayed regionally restricted. We had sickle

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.040
cell anemia in Africa as a protection against malaria.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.770
The lactase persistance allele in milk drinking populations

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.290
of Europe and the Middle East began to grow.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.890
And various skin pigmentation alleles to accommodate humans in

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.600
new climates with various penetrance of UV rays from the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.500
sun began to appear. From humble beginnings, humans expanded

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
out of Africa into the rest of the world, creating

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.920
a vast array of alleles in brand new population.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.150
It wasn't until about a few hundred years ago that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.300
travel began to bring us all back together again. Leading

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.390
to mixing of the alleles between different populations at rates

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.010
like we've never seen before. Therefore, the resulting genetic

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.390
diversity has most likely had which of the following

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.740
effects? I want you to check any and all

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.720
that you think apply. The people are more homozygous for

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.069
more genes, or people are more heterozygous for more

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.750
genes? Are the population is better suited to survive

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.510
natural selection, or the population is less suited to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.620
survive natural selection? Pick which answers you think are best.
