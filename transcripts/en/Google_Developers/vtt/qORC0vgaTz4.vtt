00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:33.098
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:35.710
KRISPY UCCELLO: Hello and
welcome to the first episode

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.040
of Screen Intensity.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.360
This is a new format that we're
experimenting with where

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.880
we've done away with the
Hangouts On Air portion, and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.900
we're instead focusing on
content that will help you,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.580
the developers, understand
Google TV better, the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.780
audiences you can approach,
things you

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.920
might want to develop--

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.290
be it web apps or Android
applications for TV.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.330
We're going to be using this
format going forward, which

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.560
means we'll be launching only
one episode every month.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.190
But within that episode will
be packed three segments--

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.760
typically an event coverage
segment, a tutorial, and then

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.740
something else that we
decide as we go on.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.980
This month will be a little
different in that we're going

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.820
to be covering CES as well as
the LA YouTube Google TV

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.750
hackathon that took place
January 26 and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.140
27 at our LA office.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.950
Now, if you want to provide
feedback and give us an

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.510
understanding of how you feel
about this format, what you'd

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.280
like to see, et cetera, please
feel free to email me at

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.530
krispy@google.com.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.810
As well, feel free to create
video questions and hashtag

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.540
them with screenintensity.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.250
And I'll start looking for those
to see if we can roll

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.070
them into future episodes.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.690
So with that, why don't we get
started and take a look at

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.035
what happened at CES.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.740
Hello.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.600
My name is Krispy.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.070
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer on Google TV, and I'm

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.530
joined today with Matt Gaunt
who's a Developer Advocate,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.009
also on Google TV.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.440
And we're going to
talk a little bit

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.700
today about CES 2013.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.160
MATT GAUNT: The beast that is.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.340
KRISPY UCCELLO: The
beast that is.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.840
So why don't we lead off.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.960
What was your impression
this year?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.140
This was your first
time, wasn't it?

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.440
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, first time in
Vegas, first time at CES.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.700
I was blown away.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.220
It's just phenomenal to see the
number of companies there,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.300
the number of people that are
just passing through looking

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.100
at everything that they can
possibly get their hands on.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.700
Yeah, I was amazed,
to be honest.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.985
KRISPY UCCELLO: A lot of treat
bags floating around I'm sure.

00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:41.836
MATT GAUNT: So many bags.

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:43.730
KRISPY UCCELLO: So let's talk
about the presence of

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.980
Google TV at CES.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.200
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, so generally,
the presence of

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.710
Google TV, we had a lot of the
team members working there.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.210
We were kind of helping out a
lot of the partner booths,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.120
getting to meet a lot of people

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.350
that were coming through.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.620
And generally, everyone that was
there that we spoke to was

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.310
either enjoying the new features
that were brought in

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.870
V3, or they were telling us
about apps they love or

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.930
generally how impressed they
were about the number of

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.180
partners that we kind of grew
to and the numbers that were

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.520
being announced at CES.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.760
KRISPY UCCELLO: So certainly a
lot more buzz and excitement

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.550
and sort of that, wow, when
can we get on there?

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.110
MATT GAUNT: Exactly.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.740
It was a really nice mix of new
people that hadn't really

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.630
heard of Google TV versus
people that have been

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.120
following us since the start and
were just like, wow, you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.900
guys have just completely
exploded.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.750
KRISPY UCCELLO: So what do
you think this means for

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.210
developers in the TV
development or

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.270
app development space?

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.400
MATT GAUNT: So for me, I think
it's always come down to like

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.850
any kind of general platform
kind of application.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.330
You get to a point where you
have to pick a platform when

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.500
you're starting out.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.525
And generally, when you do that,
you're already targeting

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:50.120
a specific device, and then
instantly, you say, well,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.680
either I target one platform and
it's tied to one sort of

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.440
OEM or I can target one platform
that's literally

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.470
sported everywhere.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.250
And that's kind of the main
goal of Google TV.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.830
And I think we kind of proved
to the point now that

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.260
developers who are looking for
smart TV platforms, they can

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.250
go with Google TV and they're
going to start hitting a range

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.570
of devices from a range
of different partners.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.770
And at that point, they can
obviously sit there and make

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.250
the trade off of, well, if I
go for this, it's one code

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.890
base, it's going to run
on all these devices.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.910
It makes a lot of sense.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.490
KRISPY UCCELLO: Now, while you
were sort of cruising the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.850
floor and checking out all the
cool technology there, what

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.650
was your favorite
geek-out moment?

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.345
Where was that aha, I'm at
CES, this is amazing?

00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:35.990
MATT GAUNT: I think for me is
when you start going around

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.670
and you start trying out
different things

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.880
in the voice commands.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.480
And literally, just someone
showed me a new trick which I

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.200
didn't even know existed where
they say there, they pressed

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.445
the voice search button,
and just went, how

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:47.010
to tie a bow tie.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.330
And then YouTube just opened
up straight to a video of a

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.050
guy just showing you how
to tie a bow tie.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.740
And I just thought,
that's amazing.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.100
KRISPY UCCELLO: Because
bow ties are cool.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.980
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, obviously.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.075
But it's just that whole thing
of getting to a point where

00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:01.440
you can say a voice search and
then your TV is literally just

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.650
coming back with
the first thing

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.980
that is the most relevant.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.210
And obviously, it's just
amazing to think

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.050
where that could go.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.260
Like, that's one example.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.190
But you start going deeper and
deeper in and how you can

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.620
start responding to
these queries.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.050
KRISPY UCCELLO: So developers
often ask, how can I

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.600
participate in the voice
search part of this.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.790
So do you want to talk a
little bit about that?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.640
MATT GAUNT: At the moment, the
best way of doing it is if you

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.270
start integrating into the Quick
Search Box, which you

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.080
can already do on the
Android platform.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.550
Obviously, we're going to get
to a stage where your app is

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.380
going to appear in
those results.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.910
But it'd be really nice if we
start getting deeper, like I

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.190
hope one day, we have an API
where you can launch

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.000
automatically like we
do with YouTube.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.080
But at the moment, the Quick
Search Box, you say a voice

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.520
search, it'll come up, it gives
you a list of options.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.010
And then you can start
having your app

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.300
service at that point.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.970
So it's still really nice entry
point for a user to kind

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.240
of find your content.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.950
KRISPY UCCELLO: And what's a
good place for someone who's

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.940
maybe not familiar with
this technology?

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.470
Where should they start
digging in?

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.460
MATT GAUNT: So for me, I think
the best place is to kind of

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.540
start with a really core idea,
a core concept you think

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.320
people will really benefit
from and love.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.170
And then start developing
an Android app.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.090
And if you start getting to
that point where you can

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.660
release something and publish
it, do it as soon as possible

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.400
when you're comfortable with
it, like you think it's

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.480
actually good enough.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.310
Because what you start learning
is people will start

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.650
responding with feature requests
or they'll start

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.970
finding out bugs that you
haven't found yourself.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.940
And then you quickly start
learning about the platform,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.670
you start learning the nuances
of the APIs, et cetera.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.860
And for me, that's the easiest
way of doing it, is if you

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.200
start learning on the job, you
start getting people feeding

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.556
back to everything that
you're doing.

00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:34.170
It's much more organic.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.010
KRISPY UCCELLO: So measurement
is obviously

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.210
a big part of this.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.890
So analytics, mobile
analytics, APIs

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.290
would play a big role.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.850
But just back to the search
box for a moment.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.970
There's a section in Android
documentation about this?

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.810
MATT GAUNT: Yep, so I think
literally if you go to

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.700
developers.android.com, there's
a massive search box

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.230
right there.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.660
Search Quick Search Box.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.100
Generally, the documentation on
the Android site is great

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.480
because you don't just get
an API doc generally.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.160
If you search something like
Quick Search, what you'll get

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.140
is almost a blog post style
thing where they start saying,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.050
here's what you're trying to
do, this is how you do it.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.420
And they kind of guide you
through step by step in really

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.050
kind of plain English of
what you need to do.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.320
And then when you start saying,
well, I'd really like

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.570
it if it could just do this,
that's the point that they'll

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.890
kind of say, look at the docs
and you'll find what you need.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.830
KRISPY UCCELLO: Awesome.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.580
So with the talk about voice
search and how excited

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.090
everyone is around this, what
other things are we seeing

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.226
from device manufacturers that
we haven't seen in the past?

00:07:32.226 --> 00:07:34.950
MATT GAUNT: I think the main
thing that I kind of took away

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.200
from this, the main difference,
as well as just

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.850
the remote's still changing
vastly between each OEM,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.540
they've started adding in this
new button on the buttons

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.590
which basically say hide the
cursor or show the cursor.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.040
And basically, it's kind of a
nice way of switching the user

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.650
out from having that main
navigation with the gyroscope

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.610
or using a touch pad to just
having that up, down, left,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.860
right D-pad.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.310
So yeah, that, for me,
was the big thing

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.140
that's kind of changed.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.270
KRISPY UCCELLO: So the
directional pad obviously is

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.120
still going to be the primary
mode of input in the future.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.955
It's not going away, but we're
starting to see more--

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:09.205
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.130
MATT GAUNT: --much, much--

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.730
KRISPY UCCELLO: So one
last thing that

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.700
we should talk about.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.000
What do you think developers
of TV apps should pay

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.065
attention to out of
CES this year?

00:09:29.065 --> 00:09:31.320
MATT GAUNT: I think the biggest
kind of thing that

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.360
you'll notice when you start
looking at any kind of TV

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.460
platform is generally, they try
and make things as simple

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.480
and kind of relaxing
as possible.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.620
Like people who are in the
living room interacting with

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.990
their TVs, they're trying
to get to some form of

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.900
entertainment, generally.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.970
They're in that kind of mode
where they just want to relax

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.300
and just be entertained.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.330
And I think the biggest that
developers need to take away

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.720
from that is, whatever you do
with your UI, try and keep it

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.920
simplistic, try and focus more
on your core functionality and

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.710
make it as seamless as possible
to get the user from

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.310
entry to where they want
to go in your app.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.100
So for me, it's all about
focusing on the experience and

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.430
making sure what they're doing,
they're enjoying, and

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.740
just trying to create some
sort of environment and

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.240
experience where they're
really enjoying it.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.550
KRISPY UCCELLO: And that's
really what it comes down to--

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.920
create an experience.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.080
For those of you who are
watching now, you might be

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.690
watching this on the Google
Developers Live Android

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.720
application, which is what Matt
and I are working on.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.330
It started out as a seed of
an idea, I protected it.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.680
And Matt has been gracious
enough to help me make the UI

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.960
as wonderful as possible.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.540
So do you want to talk a little
bit about what you've

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.405
had to do to clean up my trail
blazing code paths?

00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:50.620
MATT GAUNT: So I kind of saw
what Krispy was doing.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.080
And one of the main things that
I wanted to do-- well,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.200
the first I wanted to do was
bring it in line a little bit

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.720
more with kind of the GDL
design already on

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.500
the website, et cetera.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.120
I think there's a really clear
branding already there, and I

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.950
kind of wanted to bring
it over to the app.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.550
So I started off doing some
mocks in just my favorite

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.840
photo editing software, went
through all of that, and got

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.785
to a stage where I was
quite happy with it.

00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:14.940
I'd taken input from other
people, including Krispy.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.020
And I thought right, cool.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.030
I'm going to start doing this in
code now because it's going

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.290
to be easier and
quicker to make

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.960
little changes and tweaks.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.640
But largely, a lot of it was
just pulling out different

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.530
fixed widths, fixed paddings,
moving it all into styles in

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.760
the values kind of directory,
and generally getting to a

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.190
point where everything was
shared and syncing up

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.090
with the same page.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.630
At that point, it was nice and
easy just to start making

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.980
little tweaks on different
versions whether it be on TV

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.130
or tablet or phone.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.980
And yeah, just bringing
everything into one more

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.030
coherent thing and making it
work or look slightly more in

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.630
line with Android design
guidelines.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.190
Because obviously, Android,
especially over the last kind

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.990
of couple of versions, have
really focused on encouraging

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.970
developers to have a very
similar look and feel while

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.100
still bringing in their own
branding, their own elements

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.430
of differentiation, but still
not expecting a user to learn

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.470
an entirely new interface.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.460
So I think we found
a good balance.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.210
KRISPY UCCELLO: Right.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.980
And actually, one of the things
that I learned from you

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.290
over this was going for a broad
layout architecture as

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.250
opposed to a deep one, which is
what I was tending to do.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.130
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, generally,
I've learned the hard way.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.670
If you have a layout structure
and you end up having linear

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.390
layout, view, linear layout, and
you start going deeper and

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.440
deeper and deeper in that kind
of view hierarchy, everything

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.570
starts getting slow, everything

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.770
starts getting sluggish.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.260
And yeah, one of things I've
just been doing is just

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.390
removing redundant views.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.800
So Hierarchy Viewer is a
fantastic tool for this, which

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.040
I've just been kind of relying
on quite heavily just to shave

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.780
off some of the--

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.960
KRISPY UCCELLO: Some of
the cruft I added.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.770
So for developers out there
who are curious, I mean I

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.670
don't have very much
Android experience.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.530
Since I've joined the team, I've
started to ramp up on it.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.090
I still consider myself a
generalist and someone

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.880
relatively new.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.415
But you've been at
this a while.

00:12:57.415 --> 00:13:01.530
MATT GAUNT: Yes, I've been
working on Android since 1.0.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.220
And I've kind of been working
with a number of companies

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.710
keeping relatively
up to Android.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.220
I think towards the start of
the tablet world, I think I

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.530
started tailing off,
so that's where I'm

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.710
still picking out myself.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.140
But yeah, generally, I've kind
of watched Android grow from a

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.540
fixed screen width and height
right up to where it is today.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.246
Yeah, I've been keeping busy.

00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:24.040
KRISPY UCCELLO: All right.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.820
Well, thank you very much, Matt,
for being here today.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.210
MATT GAUNT: Thank you.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.860
KRISPY UCCELLO: Hopefully,
you'll have a safe trip back

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.820
to London and we'll have you
back again in the future.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.010
MATT GAUNT: Yeah,
I'll be back.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.710
KRISPY UCCELLO: Now, for those
of you who are watching us for

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.900
the first time, some of the
things you might want to check

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.000
out, we have a lot of back
episodes from 2012.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.710
And you're also on another
Google Developers

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.610
Live Hangout regularly.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.120
MATT GAUNT: So I'm with Rich
and Nick quite a lot of the

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.790
time on the Android
Office Hours.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.760
So definitely check
those guys out.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.290
KRISPY UCCELLO: Great.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.935
Thank you for joining us.

00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:54.185
MATT GAUNT: Cheers.

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:29.838
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:29.838 --> 00:14:31.340
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.338
here from Google.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:33.835
We're going to talk about
them in a second.

00:14:33.835 --> 00:14:36.829
But we're here to help you,
answer your questions so that

00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:39.197
this becomes a pretty enjoyable
event and you guys

00:14:39.197 --> 00:14:41.320
can walk away feeling
good like you

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:41.819
accomplished something.

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:44.314
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:44.314 --> 00:14:48.638
and if you have any questions
about what it's like to work

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:52.298
for Google or any other
questions [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:52.298 --> 00:14:55.292
KRISPY UCCELLO: --another
stat for you.

00:14:55.292 --> 00:14:59.783
On average, about 300 million
people in the US watch about

00:14:59.783 --> 00:15:01.280
five hours of TV per day.

00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:05.272
Interesting?

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:06.270
You know what that is?

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.264
That's 166,000 years
of television

00:15:09.264 --> 00:15:11.260
watched in a single day.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.755
That's more than the entirety
of human history.

00:15:13.755 --> 00:15:16.123
MALE SPEAKER: So some people
asking me whether this is a

00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:17.248
real photo.

00:15:17.248 --> 00:15:20.741
And the answer is--

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:23.735
it is a real photo of me
with a [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:24.234
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:24.234 --> 00:15:28.725
MALE SPEAKER: It's a cool
hackathon combining YouTube

00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:31.220
and TV technologies.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.717
Welcome to everyone.

00:15:32.717 --> 00:15:34.214
Talk [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:34.214 --> 00:15:37.457
And folks are putting up all
their ideas and teams are

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:38.705
trying to form.

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:41.699
We're looking forward to
one hell of an event.

00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:42.697
MALE SPEAKER: I'm getting
my code out.

00:15:42.697 --> 00:15:45.192
I'm trying to recruit
people, so--

00:15:45.192 --> 00:15:47.300
MALE SPEAKER: Well, you
know first prize is

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.905
that 55 inch LG TV.

00:15:49.905 --> 00:16:22.575
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:22.575 --> 00:16:25.050
MALE SPEAKER: That was the best
presentation I've seen

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.716
here probably this week.

00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:29.165
Probably this year
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:29.165 --> 00:16:30.460
MALE SPEAKER: Wow,
high praise.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.910
MALE SPEAKER: It was
great, though.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:32.890
I enjoyed it.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.792
It's going to be some of the
inspiration from what we do in

00:16:34.792 --> 00:16:36.190
our presentation.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.260
MALE SPEAKER: The point of our
app is going to be that it's

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.330
going to be like a challenge,
like physical challenges.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.500
So instead of--

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.561
it's just supposed to be making

00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:44.670
exercise a lot more fun.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.420
So what you can do is you can
interact with your friends or

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.080
you can interact with people
all over the world.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.416
You can find them
on the map and

00:16:51.416 --> 00:16:53.626
then send them a challenge.

00:16:53.626 --> 00:17:09.338
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:09.338 --> 00:17:11.560
MALE SPEAKER: Whatchya fixin'
up there, Jeremy?

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.552
That looks like a lot of guac.

00:17:13.552 --> 00:17:15.544
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's going
to be a little of everything.

00:17:15.544 --> 00:17:20.524
MALE SPEAKER: We are going to
build a Google TV-related

00:17:20.524 --> 00:17:21.022
application.

00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:23.014
We don't know what it is yet,
but we're just trying to make

00:17:23.014 --> 00:17:26.002
it work first and then figure
out from there.

00:17:26.002 --> 00:17:26.500
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.280
We're working on an app that
will be based inside

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.444
Salesforce.com or the
[INAUDIBLE] platform that will

00:17:31.444 --> 00:17:35.820
allow companies to upload videos
to YouTube and then

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.842
automatically receive the stats
of how many people have

00:17:37.842 --> 00:17:40.460
watched that video, liked it,
et cetera, all from within

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.160
Salesforce [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
and so on and so forth.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:18:30.160
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: I hate
to disappoint you.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.577
I'm here supervising three
different people [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:35.577 --> 00:18:36.575
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:38.072
And what are they building?

00:18:38.072 --> 00:18:40.899
FEMALE SPEAKER: One of them was
the cat videos that you

00:18:40.899 --> 00:18:42.563
saw up front there.

00:18:42.563 --> 00:18:47.553
The other one was connecting
with the EdTech students who

00:18:47.553 --> 00:18:49.050
are interested in
furthering that.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.543
And then the last one is going
to surprise me, so we'll see.

00:18:52.543 --> 00:18:57.702
MALE SPEAKER: It's 4:10 PM, and
we're able to record from

00:18:57.702 --> 00:19:02.740
a webcam using the upload widget
up to YouTube and pull

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.466
some stats on that video.

00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:06.019
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:57.416
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:58.913
MALE SPEAKER: --all night?

00:19:58.913 --> 00:20:00.410
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, I was.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.406
MALE SPEAKER: And did you stay
up or did you sleep?

00:20:02.406 --> 00:20:04.901
MALE SPEAKER: I'm not
sure actually.

00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:06.010
Both.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.990
MALE SPEAKER: You think you're a
humming bird of some sort at

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.568
this point?

00:20:08.568 --> 00:20:09.564
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
that's right.

00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:11.556
MALE SPEAKER: So how
far along are you?

00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:13.548
MALE SPEAKER: Pretty
much close, yeah.

00:20:13.548 --> 00:20:14.544
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:20:14.544 --> 00:20:15.540
You think you'll do any demo?

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.536
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I think so.

00:20:16.536 --> 00:20:18.528
MALE SPEAKER: OK, good.

00:20:18.528 --> 00:20:22.014
MALE SPEAKER: We're
doing pretty good.

00:20:22.014 --> 00:20:24.170
We're where we wanted to be.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.872
We had a late night until about
2:00 in the morning.

00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:29.680
MALE SPEAKER: You look
a little sleep

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.583
weary, a little like--

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:31.549
I don't know where I am.

00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:33.481
MALE SPEAKER: That's
usually how I am.

00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.447
MALE SPEAKER: Morning.

00:20:34.447 --> 00:20:35.413
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:36.379
MALE SPEAKER: You ready
for another

00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:37.345
exciting day of hacking?

00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:37.828
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:20:37.828 --> 00:20:39.277
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:41.645
FEMALE SPEAKER: As
ready as ever.

00:20:41.645 --> 00:20:48.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: I am right now
just adding on a little page

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.108
where we can expand
on the search.

00:20:54.108 --> 00:20:56.740
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.770
To expand on the search, and
there's a toolbar for the more

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.536
popular searches and naming
categories to put as examples

00:21:03.536 --> 00:21:06.374
of what you'd see.

00:21:06.374 --> 00:21:08.555
MALE SPEAKER: So where
are we at?

00:21:08.555 --> 00:21:10.010
MALE SPEAKER: We're
doing good.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:15.580
We have a application that lets
teachers use Google TV in

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.518
the classroom and get feedback
from students by having the

00:21:18.518 --> 00:21:22.010
students anonymously engage when
they don't understand.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.456
And we have the view that lets
teachers set up the videos and

00:21:26.456 --> 00:21:30.572
prepare the class, and also
the interface that the

00:21:30.572 --> 00:21:31.396
students will see.

00:21:31.396 --> 00:21:34.735
Right now, we're planning to
make a bring-your-own-device

00:21:34.735 --> 00:21:37.455
interface so that students with
computers, cell phones,

00:21:37.455 --> 00:21:40.250
tablets can engage through
the application.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.275
We're doing pretty good.

00:21:41.275 --> 00:21:41.870
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Technology.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.923
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:44.923 --> 00:21:47.378
MALE SPEAKER: Number two.

00:21:47.378 --> 00:21:48.851
How you guys doing?

00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:50.324
MALE SPEAKER: 10-4.

00:21:50.324 --> 00:21:50.815
Coding strong.

00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:52.288
MALE SPEAKER: Coding strong?

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.290
MALE SPEAKER: We've done the
basic functionality and now we

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.925
are building the interface
to interact with it now.

00:22:01.925 --> 00:22:06.750
I learn a lot with a few guys
on using the new API, the

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.718
YouTube API.

00:22:07.718 --> 00:22:15.910
And they are learning a lot
about the Google TV SDK

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.046
integrate with the Android
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:20.395
MALE SPEAKER: You all set for
another day of coding?

00:22:23.432 --> 00:22:25.471
MALE SPEAKER: I had this
awesome trick I was

00:22:25.471 --> 00:22:28.588
going to do to you.

00:22:28.588 --> 00:22:31.190
It's going to take me a little
while to build it though.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.787
I'm ready to code.

00:22:32.787 --> 00:22:33.741
We're going to win.

00:22:33.741 --> 00:22:34.695
MALE SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:36.126
MALE SPEAKER: Fighting timers.

00:22:36.126 --> 00:22:39.435
MALE SPEAKER: Fighting timers?

00:22:39.435 --> 00:22:41.340
MALE SPEAKER: Right now, we're
trying to make [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.240
Effective controller--

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.200
[INAUDIBLE] controller.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.865
FEMALE SPEAKER: They're doing
the hardcore stuff and I'm

00:22:50.865 --> 00:22:52.290
just getting the presentation
ready.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.665
So it's coming along
swimmingly.

00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:57.040
They will because I believe
in the guys.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.415
Go team.

00:22:59.415 --> 00:23:02.735
MALE SPEAKER: But it's overly on
top of the live-stream TV.

00:23:02.735 --> 00:23:04.990
So you can still watch the show,
but you can also watch

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.325
it interactively at
the same time.

00:23:08.325 --> 00:23:10.760
MALE SPEAKER: We all understand
what we're doing

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.102
now, and our goal is clear, so
I think everyone is focused

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:18.305
and everyone's working on their
own piece of the puzzle.

00:23:18.305 --> 00:23:21.019
MALE SPEAKER: HTML and CSS based
modules, that'll be the

00:23:21.019 --> 00:23:23.464
building blocks of our pages,
while our partners are working

00:23:23.464 --> 00:23:24.931
on our database schema.

00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:27.050
And hopefully, within the hour
or so, we're going to be able

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.821
to start merging together.

00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:31.050
MALE SPEAKER: Totally.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.960
At this point, we've got a
bunch of it designed and

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.990
coded, and we're just going to
smush the two together and

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.360
everything will be magical.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.610
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:23:59.218 --> 00:24:00.610
KRISPY UCCELLO: Hi everyone.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.420
Krispy here.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.910
I'm going to walk you through a
basic tutorial on how to set

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.690
up your environment on Windows
so that way you can do Google

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:09.265
TV development.

00:24:09.265 --> 00:24:11.090
So we're just going to launch
Chrome here and

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.550
maximize the window.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.430
First thing we need to do
is install the JDK.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.500
So this is a clean install
of Windows 7.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.870
And I'm just going to
go to the Oracle

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.360
JDK download section.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.720
And what we want to do is
download the latest JDK,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.390
standard edition is fine.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.130
And since this is a 32-bit
system, I'm going to be

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.020
downloading the Windows
x86 binary.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.980
Don't forget to accept the
license agreement.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.650
So we'll do that and download.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.760
And so that'll take a second.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.590
I've sort of sped
things up here.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.260
While that's actually
downloading, I'm going to go

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:52.030
and get, not the ADK, that's the
accessory development kit

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.160
We're going to get
the Android SDK.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.490
So just do a quick search,
get Android SDK.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.240
And Android has done a wonderful
job of packaging up

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240
all the tools we need.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.280
So we're just going to download
the SDK, agree to the

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:04.770
terms of service.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.320
Again, 32-bit.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.250
And we're going to
download those.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.420
While that's downloading,
why don't we

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.925
launch the JDK install.

00:25:11.925 --> 00:25:16.110
So we'll just click here
and get this going.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.700
And again, I've sped up some
of this because it takes a

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.055
little long, especially on
a virtualized instance of

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:23.620
Windows here.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.280
So I'm just accepting pretty
much the defaults--

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.560
install the development tools,
source code, JRE.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.150
And I leave all the path
settings the standard or the

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.830
defaults that are there.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.560
So this could install and
set everything up.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.450
The nice thing about this
installer is you don't have to

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.630
modify environment variables
afterwards.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.950
So now that it's installed,
I like to use PowerShell.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.190
You can use the standard
terminal, but I like

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.290
PowerShell because I
could [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.010
et cetera.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.920
So we're just going to
launch this here.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.330
Oh yeah, the after
install screen.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.260
We can get rid of that.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.870
And go back to PowerShell and
we're going to type in Java

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.170
dash version.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.245
And we should see some
input which we do, so

00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:07.480
we know it's installed.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.880
That's great.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.390
And I think our zip files
downloaded for the SDK.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.760
So we'll just open this up.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.155
And I guess we've got to back
out of this to install it.

00:26:18.155 --> 00:26:20.940
So we'll just unzip
the directory.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.690
Now, I like to put my tools
in a development folder.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.310
So I'm going to create the
development folder.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.890
Usually, I just put that
under my user name.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.682
So Development.

00:26:30.682 --> 00:26:31.670
All right.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.830
And then I like to create
another folder for tools.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.630
So create another folder called
Tools and hit OK.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.765
And we're just going to extract

00:26:38.765 --> 00:26:40.150
this zip file in there.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.980
And this has everything you
need to get going with

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.470
development.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.780
Again, I've sped this up a
little bit because a little

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.740
slow on the instance
I'm using here.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.350
So once that is installed,
there's a couple things we're

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.290
going to need to do to sort
of get going with this.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.770
So let's open the directory.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.940
And we'll go into the Eclipse
folder which has a special

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.170
version of Eclipse that the
Android team has set up.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.655
So we'll launch Eclipse and tell
Windows it's OK to run

00:27:07.655 --> 00:27:12.890
it, and the Android Developer
Tools IDE will launch.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.712
I like using this one, again,
because everything is sort of

00:27:14.712 --> 00:27:19.320
pre-packaged, and the ADK tools
are already integrated

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.220
with this Eclipse instance.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.810
So it just makes life
a little easier.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.740
So again, in this case,
we're going to

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.250
create a new workspace.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.340
I don't like accepting the
defaults because it puts it in

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.630
a weird place.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.340
Inside our Development folder,
we are going to create a

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:40.210
subfolder, call it, I don't
know, GTV Workspace.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.370
And that's where we're going
to store our projects.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.240
So we'll just hit OK there.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.660
I typically don't set the
default because I like to

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.250
create a lot of workspaces.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.140
Your personal preference,
whether you want to use one

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.590
for all of them or not
is again your choice.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.075
So yes, we'll send statistics
to Google.

00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:58.260
And we'll just expand
this window.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.410
And you can just close
this screen.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.660
You can read all that
stuff if you want.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.920
It's just how to use it.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.445
And up here, we have the the
SDK Manager and the Virtual

00:28:06.445 --> 00:28:07.220
Device Manager.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.180
I'm going to launch the SDK
Manager because from here,

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.695
we're going to choose what sort
of SDK packages we need

00:28:14.695 --> 00:28:15.350
to install.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.110
So this is sort of an extra
little step here.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.870
By default, the latest
is usually installed.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.235
We need Android 3.2 installed
to do Google TV development.

00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:26.830
And you'll notice there's a
Google TV add-on below there

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.090
that contains an emulator.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.130
But we're not going to use
that in this video.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.720
So everything else looks
pretty good.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.840
So we're just going to install
these packages.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.020
This might take, again,
a few minutes.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.240
Oh, what's down here?

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.140
So I usually check if there's
any other additional extras I

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.285
want to add.

00:28:42.285 --> 00:28:44.700
We might do some analytics
stuff,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.010
so let's check Analytics.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.240
And that way we can
use the Analytics

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.490
tool in future tutorials.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.480
So everything else looks good.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.570
Let's just install
these packages.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.670
Going to accept all the
agreements, hit Install, and

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:58.980
that's going to proceed
to download.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.385
So again, I've sped this up.

00:29:00.385 --> 00:29:04.750
It might take a little longer
on your computer or it might

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.660
take less time.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.150
I don't know.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:08.805
So we'll let this install.

00:29:08.805 --> 00:29:10.880
Going to ignore those
console messages.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.215
And we close this.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.005
Let's see.

00:29:20.005 --> 00:29:21.200
We need to go in here.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.460
We need to launch the Control
Panel because now that we have

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.750
the tools installed,
we actually need to

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:27.660
add them to our paths.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.490
So we'll just go into the search
area here and we'll

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.640
type in environment variables,
and we'll click on Edit

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.580
Environment Variables which will
pop up our handy little

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.832
Environment Editor.

00:29:39.832 --> 00:29:44.800
Just drag that over here and
click on the PowerShell.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.090
And that will change our
Environment Variables.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.980
So we're going to
edit the path.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.560
But before we do that, we need
to know where our tools are

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.490
relative to the file system.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.785
So I'm going to go into the
Development Tools, and then

00:29:56.785 --> 00:30:00.500
you'll see in here that we have
the ADK bundles, so we'll

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.910
just change into
that directory.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:08.020
And we'll see that we have
another folder, the SDK.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.266
And then platforms.

00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:13.850
Do we need anything
in platforms.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.880
I don't think so.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.040
Let's just double check.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.940
Yeah.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.210
We're good on platforms.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.950
So I think we want
Platform Tools.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.864
That's really what we're going
to be adding to our path

00:30:24.864 --> 00:30:26.140
environment variables.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.580
So let's go Platform Tools.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.640
And you'll see in
here ADB exists.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.660
So this is the correct
directory.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.600
This is the one that
we want to use.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.720
And from here--

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.430
OK, so we see ADB
is right there.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.825
That means we want to take the
path that we're currently in

00:30:41.825 --> 00:30:44.820
and we're going to add that
to our environment path.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.265
So we just copy this.

00:30:46.265 --> 00:30:48.130
You can right click on it
after you highlight it.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.840
We'll go find the
path environment

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.490
variable and hit Edit.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.610
And then we're just going to
tack it on at the end.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.402
So with Windows, you just put
a semicolon at the end here.

00:30:59.402 --> 00:31:01.110
Let's go to the end.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.293
Semicolon, and then we'll paste
it in, Control V. And

00:31:04.293 --> 00:31:07.090
we'll hit OK.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:11.730
And then you'll have to hit OK
on the System Properties in

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.650
order for that to stick.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.350
Otherwise, you might add and
it's not actually applied yet,

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.270
and you'll get frustrated.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.880
So now, what we can do is we
can go ADP Connect and then

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.790
type in the IP address
of your Google TV.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:29.670
So you can get that under
Settings, Network, Status.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.400
You can see the Google
TV settings.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.470
The other thing is, you'll have
to set up your Google TV

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.900
to accept the IP address of the
computer you're using to

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.930
connect to.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:45.460
So that can be done from the
Settings, Application,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.240
Development.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.970
And then there's an area to
enter the IP address.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.640
So you can see we're
connected here.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.100
So let's go back here.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.580
We're going to create
our first project.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.230
Now, you could create an
Android virtual device.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.355
We're not going to do that
in this tutorial.

00:32:01.355 --> 00:32:06.120
Let's just create a new Android
package or project,

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.830
and we're going to call
this Hello Google TV.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.670
Now, I like to change
package name.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.510
It's good to do that and
not use the default.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:20.200
So we'll just use crom
Krispy Android's TV.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.200
And we'll call it Hello.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.250
Hello GTV.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.200
Sure.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.670
Now, required SDK.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:31.820
I like to put everything at 3:2
just because that makes

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.180
sure I'm targeting Google TV.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.940
You can leave the compile width
at whatever the latest

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.420
version is.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.260
It'll still target
the right SDK.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.520
Up here, I leave all
the defaults.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.660
It'll create a launcher icon,
activity, blah, blah, blah.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.380
And you can fiddle around with
this and toy with it.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.770
The default's pretty nice, but
you can differentiate your

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:52.500
apps by maybe choosing
clip art.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:59.490
So we'll choose this guy here,
and let's see, it's square.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.880
Purple background with
a yellow Android.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.410
That will look cool.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.340
So something that sort of stands
out on the screen.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.890
Make it a circle, add
a little padding.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.590
This is good for basic
development stuff.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.250
So just something
to keep in mind.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.215
Now, on this screen,
we're just going

00:33:15.215 --> 00:33:15.990
to create an activity.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.640
We're going to leave the
default, but you have lots of

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.760
other options here.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.980
I recommend when you're
beginning, just start with

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.480
basic blank activities that
way you learn what to add.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.980
We're going to leave the
defaults for the name.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.430
That's the activity name,
the layout name.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:30.612
And again, don't play
around with the

00:33:30.612 --> 00:33:31.580
navigation type right now.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.800
But just leave everything sort
of default here, because this

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.740
is just a light introduction.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.995
And now that this project is
created, once Eclipse catches

00:33:43.995 --> 00:33:45.816
up with me here.

00:33:45.816 --> 00:33:49.045
So your project's going to get
compiled and it's going to run

00:33:49.045 --> 00:33:51.680
through all the Android tools
and do the resource

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.644
generation, et cetera.

00:33:53.644 --> 00:33:56.500
Just going to wait for the
layout here to load.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.300
Again, I'm doing this on a
virtual instance, so it's a

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.460
little slower than it might
be on your computer.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.960
So I like to choose the Galaxy
Nexus view here because it's

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.100
about 720p.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.880
And if we rotate it on its
side and then choose the

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.524
Hollow theme, you've got sort
of what Google TV size is.

00:34:16.524 --> 00:34:18.330
So this is pretty
true to form.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.580
So we have Hello world.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.639
And let's just fit this
to the screen.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:28.650
And what we're going to do now
is we're going to run this.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.159
And so if this connected to your
Google TV, you're going

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.990
to see Hello world pop
up on the screen.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.280
So you've created your first
Android application.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.780
And oh, what have we got here?

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.920
Oh, no virtual devices.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.100
Oh, we disconnected.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:41.570
OK.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.629
So let's go back into
PowerShell, and we're going to

00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:46.960
go ADB Connect.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.550
So if this happens to you,
it's quite simple.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.230
You can do ADB Connect and then
the IP address of your

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.469
Google TV, and you see it
showing up here now in the

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.659
Android Device Manager.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.395
So we know that that's the
device we want to run it on.

00:34:58.395 --> 00:35:04.050
We'll click OK, and this will
now run or package it up and

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.690
install it on your Google TV and
run it and we should see a

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.965
nice screen that says
Hello world.

00:35:08.965 --> 00:35:10.910
If yours looks a little
different, maybe it has an

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.570
action bar or whatever,
don't worry.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.070
The important thing is
that it's running

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.140
on your Google TV.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.930
So now, we're going to play with
some of the properties on

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.770
here that just cover a few basic
things just to get you

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.170
started and whet
your appetite.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.220
So the first thing is maybe we
want to change the text size.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.540
So we're going to create
a new dimension here.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:32.304
We'll call it Big text or
something like that.

00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:35.710
Hit Font and we'll set it
to 44 device pixels.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.575
So this will be pretty
large on the screen.

00:35:37.575 --> 00:35:40.000
It's a good idea to keep your
font sizes large, especially

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.370
on TV, because your users are
about 10 feet away from the

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:46.980
screen and you want them
to be able to use it.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.450
Now, don't make everything
that big, but--

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:54.880
We can see here, here's our
dimension that we've added.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.200
And if you hold down the Control
key and click on it,

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.430
it will open the Dimensions
XML file.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.670
So this is sort of
how Android keeps

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.905
everything separately managed.

00:36:04.905 --> 00:36:07.660
So remember that you can Control
click and you can edit

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.830
this here if you wanted to.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.740
So we'll change this
maybe to 64 now.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.760
And if we go back and look
at the graphical

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.460
view, it's even bigger.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.370
So it's always a good to isolate
and separate out all

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.370
of the different parameters
in your lance.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:25.470
So I'm just moving this around
relatively out, and I'm going

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:30.900
to add I think another margin,
just to add some margin

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.570
space around it.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.300
There's lots of options
you can play with.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.175
There's lots of great
tutorials online.

00:36:35.175 --> 00:36:37.810
So let's go to the
margin here.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.320
And we'll click on this,
and we're going to

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.602
create a new dimension.

00:36:40.602 --> 00:36:44.940
And we're going to call
this Fat margin, and

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.280
we'll set this to--

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.480
that looks good.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.360
So we'll set that.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.726
And you can see that the margin
has been created around

00:36:53.726 --> 00:36:56.180
the text element.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:00.040
So from here, if we were to run
this, we would see it on

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.760
the screen like that.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.590
Let's drag another text object
onto the screen.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:05.670
I'm going to just center this
sort of where the Hello world

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.930
was before.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:08.030
So we'll drop that in there.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.550
And what's cool is now that we
have these dimensions, we can

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.160
actually reuse these.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.430
So if we go to Margin
and choose Fat--

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:19.734
whoops, what did I
do wrong here?

00:37:19.734 --> 00:37:21.050
Let's click on that again.

00:37:26.436 --> 00:37:28.810
Big fonts.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:29.120
All right.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.180
There we go.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.970
We have the margin,
we have the fonts.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:38.510
And now if we run this, we will
see on your Google TV

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.740
these two pieces of text.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.220
So this is a good thing that
can get you started.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:49.350
And stay tuned as we do future
episodes for more cool and

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.170
exciting things you can
do with your layouts.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.670
We're going to talk about UI
a lot more in future ones.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:57.070
But just to quickly recap, your
XML files get edited as

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.400
you play with the lance.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.820
And it's always a good
idea to edit in here.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.820
Now, in this case, I'm actually

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.080
getting a warning about--

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:06.700
what is this?

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.630
This is a string that needs
to be extracted.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:13.540
So my content description, I'm
just going to Control 1 while

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.810
I'm highlighting it, and that
menu will pop up and I can

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:17.990
extract the string.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.370
And then if we Control click on
it, we can see the strings

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.780
XML file and you can
see Large text.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.840
And we could change this
to whatever we want.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.130
So let's just do that now.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.145
Google TV Rocks.

00:38:28.145 --> 00:38:30.600
And we could save that.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.480
And run it.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.620
It And you can see
this on your TV.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:41.840
So hopefully, that gets your
appetite whetted and you dive

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.090
in a little bit further.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.035
