00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:01.992
- [Instructor] What we're going to do

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:03.549
in this video is continue talking

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.600
about uniform circular motion.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.249
And in that context, we're gonna talk

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:09.840
about the idea of period,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.590
which we denote with a capital T,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.788
or we tend to denote with a capital T,

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:16.251
and a very related idea.

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.092
And that's of frequency,

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:21.842
which we typically denote
with a lower case f.

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:25.030
So you might have seen these
ideas in other contexts,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.830
but we'll just make sure we get them.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.682
And then we'll connect it to the idea

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.659
of angular velocity, in
particular the magnitude

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.080
of angular velocity,
which we've already seen

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.742
we can denote with a lower case omega.

00:00:36.742 --> 00:00:38.792
Since I don't have a little arrow on top,

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:40.908
you could view it, just
the lower case omega,

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.551
as the magnitude of angular velocity.

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:47.182
But first, what is period
and what is frequency?

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:49.362
Well, period is how long does it take

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:51.111
to complete a cycle?

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:53.971
And if we're talking about
uniform circular motion,

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.122
a cycle is how long does it take,

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.000
if this is, say, some
type of a tennis ball

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.592
that's tethered to a nail right over here

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:04.260
and it's moving with some uniform speed,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080
a period is, well, how long does it take

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.127
to go all the way around once?

00:01:08.127 --> 00:01:11.392
So, for example, if you
have a period of one second,

00:01:11.392 --> 00:01:14.279
this ball would move like this,

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.279
one second, two seconds,

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.693
three seconds, four seconds.

00:01:20.693 --> 00:01:22.411
That would be a period of one second.

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:24.173
If you had a period of two seconds,

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:26.373
well, it would go half the speed.

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:30.233
You would have one second, two seconds,

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:32.566
three seconds, four seconds,

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:36.111
five seconds, six seconds.

00:01:37.314 --> 00:01:38.733
And if you went the other way,

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.852
if you had a period of half a second,

00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:44.451
well, then it would be one second,

00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:45.451
two seconds,

00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:50.257
and so your period would be half a second.

00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:54.882
It would take you half a
second to complete a cycle.

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:58.967
The unit of period is
going to be the second,

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:02.619
the unit of time and it's
typically given in seconds.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.308
Now, what about frequency?

00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:08.819
Well, frequency literally is
the reciprocal of the period.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.652
So frequency is equal to one over,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.867
let me write that one a little bit neater,

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.137
one over the period.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.795
And one way to think about it is

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:22.788
well, how many cycles can
you complete in a second?

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:25.266
Period is how many seconds does it take

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.846
to complete a cycle, while frequency is

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:31.096
how many cycles can you do in a second?

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:36.349
So, for example, if I can
do two cycles in a second,

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.349
one second, two seconds,

00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:41.186
three seconds,

00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:45.079
then my frequency is
two cycles per second.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.869
And the unit for frequency is,

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.617
sometimes you'll hear
people say just per second,

00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:53.308
so the unit, sometimes
you'll see people just say

00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:55.479
an inverse second like that,

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.667
or sometimes they'll use the shorthand Hz,

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:00.584
which stands for Hertz.

00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:06.360
And Hertz is sometimes substituted
with cycles per second.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.628
So this you could view as seconds or even

00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:10.360
seconds per cycle.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.260
And this is cycles per second.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.008
Now with that out of the way,

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:17.268
let's see if we can connect these ideas

00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:20.249
to the magnitude of angular velocity.

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.519
So let's just think about
a couple of scenarios.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.109
Let's say that the magnitude
of our angular velocity,

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.359
let's say it is pi radians,

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.462
pi radians per second.

00:03:33.662 --> 00:03:37.452
So if we knew that, what
is the period going to be?

00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:40.949
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.261
So let's work through it together.

00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:44.361
So, this ball is going to move

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:46.931
through pi radians every second.

00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:48.571
So how long is it going to take

00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:50.629
for it to complete two pi radians?

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.796
'Cause remember, one complete
rotation is two pi radians.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.420
Well, if it's going pi radians per second,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.003
it's gonna take it two
seconds to go two pi radians.

00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:04.932
And so, the period here, let me write it,

00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:09.900
the period here is going
to be equal to two seconds.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.202
Now, I kind of did that intuitively,

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:16.452
but how did I actually
manipulate the omega here?

00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:18.542
Well, one way to think
about it, the period,

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.796
I said, look, in order to
complete one entire rotation,

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:24.629
I have to complete two pi radians.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:29.803
So that is one entire cycle
is going to be two pi radians.

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.641
And then I'm gonna divide it by how fast,

00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:35.213
what my angular velocity is going to be.

00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:36.493
So I'm gonna divide it by,

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:40.612
in this case I'm gonna
divide it by pi radians,

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:44.779
pi, and I could write it
out pi radians per second.

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.494
I'm saying how far do I have to go

00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:49.293
to complete a cycle and
that I'm dividing it

00:04:49.293 --> 00:04:52.733
by how fast I am going through the angles.

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:56.512
And that's where I got
the two seconds from.

00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:59.121
And so, already you can think of a formula

00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:02.621
that connects period and angular velocity.

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:08.183
Period is equal to,
remember, two pi radians

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:10.575
is an entire cycle.

00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:13.226
And so you just want to
divide that by how quickly

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:15.417
you're going through the angles.

00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:17.896
And so that there will connect your period

00:05:17.896 --> 00:05:19.814
and angular velocity.

00:05:19.814 --> 00:05:21.065
Now if we know the period,

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:24.026
it's quite straightforward
to figure out the frequency.

00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:27.515
So the frequency is just
one over the period.

00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:29.946
So the frequency is,
we've already said it's

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:32.356
one over the period, and so the reciprocal

00:05:32.356 --> 00:05:35.237
of two pi over omega is going to be

00:05:35.237 --> 00:05:36.737
omega over two pi.

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:43.799
And in this situation where
the period was two seconds,

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:45.648
you don't even know what omega is,

00:05:45.648 --> 00:05:47.978
and someone says the
period is two seconds,

00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:50.645
then you know that the frequency

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.709
is going to be one over two seconds.

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:02.805
Or, you could view this
as being equal to 1/2.

00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:05.086
You could sometimes see units like that,

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:07.095
which is kind of per second.

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.428
But I like to use Hertz, and in my brain

00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:15.286
I say this means 1/2 cycles per second.

00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:16.586
So one way to think about it,

00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:18.626
it takes two seconds to complete.

00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:20.944
If I'm doing pi radians per second,

00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:24.237
my ball here is going to go one second,

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:27.654
two seconds, three seconds, four seconds.

00:06:28.567 --> 00:06:30.013
And you see, just like that,

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.236
my period is indeed two seconds.

00:06:32.236 --> 00:06:34.366
And you also see that in each second,

00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:36.697
remember in each second
I cover pi radians.

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:39.826
Well, pi radians is half a cycle.

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:42.743
I complete half a cycle per second.
