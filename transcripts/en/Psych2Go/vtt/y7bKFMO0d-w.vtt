00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
[Music]

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.750
Unlike physical abuse, being emotionally abused
doesn't leave you with visible scars or bruises

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.930
that can be easy to detect.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.500
In the U.S., every ten seconds, a report of
child abuse is made.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.270
That means on a yearly basis, this involves
more than 6.6 million children who are affected.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.140
Emotional abuse weakens the individual's emotional
development and sense of self-worth that can

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.460
have lifelong damaging effects.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.410
Here are 10 signs of emotional abuse from
parents.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.200
One; you experience random emotional outbursts.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.890
Do you tear up easily or find it hard to control
your emotions?

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.520
When the child grows up in an environment
where they were constantly reprimanded or

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.199
had their emotional needs neglected, they're
more likely to experience their emotions in

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.430
extremes.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.280
This makes it difficult to achieve self-composure.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.210
They may demonstrate high spirits when they
get validation from others, but hit rock-bottom

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.979
at the snap of a finger when they aren't getting
the attention or support they crave.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.759
Two; you are overly affectionate to strangers...

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.600
or you're super kind to people you haven't
known for a long time.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.280
People who never received unconditional love
from their parents will try to make up for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.450
the cruelty they grew up with by nurturing
others instead.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.420
They never want someone else to experience
the same trauma as they did, so practicing

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.869
empathy comes naturally to them.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.219
Three; you are aggressive toward others and
animals.

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.340
On the contrary, some children with emotionally
abusive parents connect hostile toward their

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.009
classmates and treat animals poorly.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.719
As a result of internalizing the abuse, they
may imitate their parents harsh treatment

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.969
and lash out on others.

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.890
Victims of emotional abuse always felt things
were out of their control, so they try to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.810
make up for it by doing the opposite, being
the emotional abusers themselves.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.600
Four; you have little to no friends.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.069
Do you isolate yourself from others or feel
painfully shy around new faces?

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.009
Children who are emotionally abused will often
lack the proper social skills they need to

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.590
form connections.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.540
Consequently, they may either find themselves
in toxic relationships often mistaking them

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.959
for normal ones or avoid commitment altogether
in fear of getting hurt again.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.800
Five; you aren't confident about your future.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.629
Victims of emotional abuse often grew up with
parents who criticized and belittled them

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.870
and dismissed their feelings.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.530
As a result, they're likely to grow up being
pessimistic.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.430
This can prevent them from going after their
dreams as they run away from their true potential.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.879
Six; you constantly repress your emotions.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.650
Parents who emotionally abuse their kids do
not create a safe space where it made them

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.439
feel OK to cry.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.500
Instead, their kids might have grown up in
fear, afraid of doing something that would

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.120
upset or anger their parents.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.440
Consequently, like brave little soldiers,
at a young age, they learned to bottle up

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.670
their feelings for survival.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.599
It's no big deal they might say, and may grow
up resorting to drugs and alcohol as a poor

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.670
coping mechanism.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.849
Seven; you don't know who you are.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.819
Do you struggle with establishing a strong
identity or often feel like you're stuck in

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.819
limbo?

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.130
If you grew up with parents who are controlling
and emotionally manipulative, they've raised

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.989
you to be codependent.

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.360
As a result, you never had full control over
your own life and in shaping your own identity.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.650
Eight; you often seek validation from others.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.110
Victims of emotional abuse usually lack self-confidence.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.620
In order to make up for those feelings of
worthlessness, they may take great measures

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.270
such as people-pleasing in order to feel loved
and appreciated, whether it means putting

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.340
on a facade on social media or making up white
lies just to stay on someone's good side.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.860
This can cause them to struggle with authenticity.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.500
Nine; you're highly self-critical.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.730
Did your parents put a lot of pressure on
you as a child?

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.239
When you are expected to reach high unrealistic
expectations, you may not feel like you're

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.239
good enough if you aren't always working yourself
to the bone.

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.950
You may also end up becoming a perfectionist
and not allow yourself to be human.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.400
Ten; you experience a lot of guilt.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.250
Children with emotionally abusive parents
can grow up with guilt issues.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.021
When they try to establish boundaries and
seek emotional support from others, their

00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:25.980
parents may guilt trip them into isolating
themselves; "Oh, looks like you've forgotten

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.970
about me..." or "don't you love me?" are phrases
to watch out for.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.750
