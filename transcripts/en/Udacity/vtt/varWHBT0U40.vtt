00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So this is the end of Unit 6.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me summarize what we've seen, and there are lots of connections

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
between the different things we've seen

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that all use cryptography to solve problems.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So the first thing we looked at was Anonymous Communication,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we saw how to do that using onion routing

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which was a chain of public key encryptions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We looked at how to do voting using mixes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which also involved a chain of public key encryptions

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
with the addition of audited permutations.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We looked at how to provide

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
anonymous digital cash in a centralized way.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This involved using blind signatures.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But blind signatures pose the risk that if you don't know what you're signing

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's a big problem.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we talked about the cut-and-choose technique

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to verify the messages before signing the one that wasn't opened.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And finally we looked at bitcoin.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That provides a way to do decentralized digital cash.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This also used a chain of public keys

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but unlike onion routing and voting, where we were using chains of encryptions,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in this case we are using chains of signatures.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we also saw how bitcoin uses hash preimages as a proof of work.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And having proofs of work is useful for many other protocols,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So all these protocols use a combination of asymmetric cryptography

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and symmetric cryptography typically involving hashing.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And there's a tremendous amount of things

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that you can build with just these primatives.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In Unit 7, we'll look at a few more interesting applications of cryptography

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and wrap up the course.

00:01:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I hope to see you there.
