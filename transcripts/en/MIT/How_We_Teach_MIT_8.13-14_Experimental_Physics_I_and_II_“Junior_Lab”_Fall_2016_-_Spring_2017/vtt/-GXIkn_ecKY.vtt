RUMEN DANGOVSKI: Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.470
I'm Rumen, and today I'll
talk about three things:

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.710
optical trapping, the Boltzmann
constant, and Brownian motion.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.310
The goal of the
lab is to extract

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.120
Boltzmann's constant
out of Brownian motion

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.820
and there are two key
components to think about.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.440
First one is the
Boltzmann's constant,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.880
which is prevalent in
different types of science.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.760
For example, we can
have it in biophysics

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.630
where people use the Boltzmann's
constant to try to understand

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.570
forces in a cellular level.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.480
We have it in thermodynamics
with the famous equipartition

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.690
theorem.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.230
How does this relate
to the Brownian motion?

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.020
The key thing is to think
about length scales.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.061
Brownian motion is relevant
in terms of microns.

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:57.310
And at the same time, if you
look at a cellular level,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.700
for example, if we
look at our hair,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.180
we have micron-sized hair.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.200
All right.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.570
So there are different ways
to measure the Boltzmann's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.560
constant.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.400
Some people measure the
speed of sound in argon gas,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.810
others do optical
trapping in air.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.930
We will do slightly
different optical trapping,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.150
as you will see,
but the consensus

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.110
among the scientific community
is that it is challenging.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
Our plan is to prepare
Brownian particles

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.760
and control their
Brownian motion.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.760
We take spherical
glass beads of diameter

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.030
of 3.2 microns and
the main tool is

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.040
to concentrate a highly-focused
lasers on top of these beads.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.590
There's interesting
physics going on:

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.610
light carries momentum
thus it generates force.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.820
We have that the net
gradient force opposes

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.050
the motion of the beam while the
net scattering force goes along

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.820
the motion of the beam.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.540
And when these two forces
balance each other,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.360
we have a bead that
is at the center.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.200
When you push this bead
a little bit to the left

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.890
or to the right, then we have
that the gradient forces are

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.560
pulling me back in the
center and essentially we

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.610
observe a simple
harmonic motion.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.820
In a more concrete example,
what we did is we took samples

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.240
and we confined everything
into a two-dimensional plane.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.390
This is very important.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.300
We have two directions:
the x direction

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.730
and the y direction
for the beads.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.050
We put them into water and
a source of Brownian motion

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.110
comes from the collisions
between our bead

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.130
with the molecules
into the water.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.930
These are thermal collisions
that generate Brownian motion.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.350
As you can see, this lonely
bead has it's Brownian motion.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.620
What's interesting is when we
shine light on top of a bead,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.830
we trap this bead and we
can find the Brownian motion

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.840
so it's feasible to
measure the motion.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.030
And the theory behind
this is very beautiful.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.220
It's about the
equipartition theorem,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.680
which relates the
kinetic energy coming

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.070
from the simple harmonic
motion on the left hand side

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.580
with the thermal energy due
to the degrees of freedom.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.690
Now let us recall that we have
a two-dimensional confinement

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.990
so we have a direction
in x and direction in y.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.910
So it means that in
each of the directions,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.500
we have one degree
of freedom, which

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.172
is correlated with this
equipartition theorem.

00:03:33.172 --> 00:03:35.380
Now an interesting thing
about the statistical motion

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.840
of the molecules is that we
have the simple harmonic motion.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.350
However, the things
are moving into water

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.500
so there is a drag
force that dominates.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.130
So we simplified
the left hand side.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.840
What is very interesting
is the f factor, which

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.900
comes from the collisions
between the bead

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.330
with the molecules, this
generates forcing and driving

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.170
of the simple harmonic motion.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.760
I would like to
point out one thing

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.770
about the scales of the forces.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.950
We have piconewtons, which is
relevant for optical trapping

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.100
and for Brownian motion.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.120
This is the first
observation that we did,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.260
and actually Einstein did this
observation a long time ago.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.970
He observed the white noise--

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.740
essentially the
collisions-- they

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.769
generate uncorrelated forcing.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.690
And we can think
of it as something

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.610
that is not biased
with any distribution,

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.020
it's just uniform.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.000
As you can see on
these slides, we

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.910
have the position
plotted in terms of time

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.577
and it exhibits a uniform
distribution of the spectrum.

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:38.410
Another thing that I
would like to point out

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.470
is to look at this plot of
fluctuations in x and y,

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.120
and the power which is linear
with the current of the lasers.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.850
As you can see, as
the power becomes big,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.040
this means that we
are trapping more

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.280
so we have less fluctuations,
which is something as expected.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.460
All right, so let's
figure out what

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.960
we want to do with this lab.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.684
We have the
equipartition theorem

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:06.350
and essentially we
have three components

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.340
that we would like to measure
in order to extract Kb.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.620
We need to find the
fluctuations, which I just

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.010
presented to you.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.370
We need to find a stiffness
coefficient, alpha,

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.892
which is related to the
spring constant of motion.

00:05:19.892 --> 00:05:21.850
And then we need to
measure the temperature, t.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.240
The apparatus that we use
has two main components.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.950
The two components are concerned
with two types of light

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.350
that we use in our experiment.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.340
We use a laser
that shines on top

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.610
of the confined
two-dimensional samples

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.590
and tries to trap a bead.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.760
The scattered light from
the laser goes into a QPD--

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.110
a quadrant photo detector--

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.120
which is an
ultra-fast camera that

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.090
manages to quickly
digitalize the content

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.460
and give us the position
of the scattered light.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.320
So when we trap
the bead, we know

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.220
where it is by observing
the feedback from the QPD.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.760
The other interesting
part of the apparatus

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.800
is the LED light, which
illuminates the sample

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.410
and then it brings
it to the CCD camera,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.730
and this is very important.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.560
So the CCD camera is very slow.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.420
It cannot measure
Brownian motion.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.780
What it can do is it can
tell us where are the beads.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.680
It can allow us to
look at the water

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.310
and find the beads
we want to trap.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.650
So these two components
in combination

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.120
are crucial for the
success of our research.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.080
There is interesting
electronics coming behind this.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.630
Essentially, the
signals from the QPD

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.960
and from the stage position
where we put our sample

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.620
are given in terms of volts.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.780
So a natural
question that arises

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.977
is how are we going to
remember what is important?

00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:54.560
There are two important
things that we

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.970
like to keep track
of, two positions.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.030
The first one is the
position of the stage

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.934
that gives us a relative
point of consideration.

00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:03.350
And the second one
is the position

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.750
of the QPD, which,
as you can recall,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.560
it measures the place of the
bead that we have trapped.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.040
These inputs are given
in terms of volts,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.380
so the natural thing
to do is to find

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.070
the calibration that
converts these volts

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.110
into actual distances.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.110
Here you can see how we do this.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.470
We plot the stage x position--
we can plot the stage y,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.180
it's completely analogous to
the QPD the positions here.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.510
And the conversion factor
hides along the slopes here.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.820
As you can see, we have
two different slopes here

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.450
with different absolute values,
so this type of measurement

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.100
is prone to errors.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.110
How we approach this
problem is that we

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.110
fault by choosing
more data points

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.500
and trying to increase the
statistic thus hopefully

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.850
reducing the systematics
of this measurement.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.330
The second step is to start
getting the components

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.610
that we need in
order to extract kb

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.090
is to measure the stiffness
coefficient alpha.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.306
Now the main idea is to
take the equation of motion

00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:12.680
and to make a
[? free entrance ?]

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.560
from in order to get
the positions in terms

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.020
of frequencies.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.180
There is mathematics behind
this and essentially, the power

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.160
spectral distribution,
and that's

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.960
the distribution
of this motion here

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.900
that we expect obtains
this form here.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.810
From where we can extract
the characteristic frequency,

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.450
F naught, and F
naught gives us alpha,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.030
which is what we really need.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.539
This is a log log plot,
as you can see here.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.080
Another thing I
would like to mention

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.240
is look at the
proportionality here.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.970
As we increase
the power, we also

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.800
increase the stiffness
coefficient alpha

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.610
because we're
trapped more closely,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.700
so it means that F
naught has to increase.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.610
And indeed, when we
increase the power,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.490
we are shifting F
naught to the right.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.230
Having all of these
components, we

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.340
can put this into
the big picture.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.810
And the big picture is the
extraction of kb over here.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.630
I showed you x squared,
the fluctuations.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.860
I showed you alpha.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.450
We can measure the temperature,
t, and then we can get kb.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.550
The essence of
this measurement is

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.380
to look at the inverse
proportionality

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.100
between fluctuations and
the trapped stiffness.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.970
Then we can make a fit with
a reasonable chi-squared

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:28.220
probability, and from
here we can extract kb.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:34.530
The result is
presented on the slide.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.080
We also show you the
measurement that we

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.270
extract from literature.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.790
Our result is within 2 sigma
of the accepted value of kb.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.210
Actually we're very close to
one sigma from the accepted

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.620
value of a kb.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.640
What is driving this
unfortunate outcome?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.650
The thing that drives
this unfortunate outcome

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.490
is the systematic
errors on our picture.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.080
This is our starting error.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.020
This is the uncertainty in kb.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.670
And there are different factors
that contribute to this.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.490
As you saw, the calibration
is very difficult.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.850
We have error from the
laser hitting the water

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.590
and changing the temperature.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.090
We have systematic error of the
electronics, which we safely

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.630
ignore because the first
two factors dominate this.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.450
Our electronics
were very precise.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.490
And then we have the
statistical uncertainties

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.870
that we use which correspond to
some error propagating tricks.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.450
OK, now let's do
our investigation.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.210
The first one is
about the calibration.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.000
As you can see, all of these
slopes should be valid,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.870
but they're actually not.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.490
So what we do is we take them
into account, we average them,

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.580
then we take more data
points, we average again,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.770
and then we propagate
errors in order

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.460
to reduce the systematics.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.020
The second one is due to
the heating of the laser.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.410
Essentially what happens is
when the laser hits the water,

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.810
it starts heating the vicinity.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.150
And this is unfortunate
because yes, we

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.090
can measure the room temperature
by using the thermometer,

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.860
but actual uncertainty
on the temperature

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.850
is much bigger because we have
extra heating due to the laser.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.780
We tried diligently
to avoid this

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.880
by moving the laser
constantly so that it doesn't

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.530
stay in one place
and heat up a lot,

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.400
but it's very hard to quantify
how exactly it heats up

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.500
the water.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.610
And the third one is
concerned with our fit

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:37.500
with the fluctuations in terms
of the trapped stiffness.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.190
Initially, when we did the
fit with the PSD method,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.380
we get a probability of
chi squared equals zero.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.870
And then we quickly
realized that essentially

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.230
what we need to do is take into
account the horizontal errors.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.130
And here what we do is we
transform the horizontal errors

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.270
into the vertical errors.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.540
And this thing we can do by
using addition in quadrature

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.580
and propagation of
the errors, which

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:05.780
gave us a reasonable
realistic Chi squared of 0.33.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.042
In conclusion, I'll
start with limitations.

00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:09.750
As you saw, it's very
hard to distinguish

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.980
between systematic errors and
statistical uncertainties.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.660
The reason for this
is, as you saw,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.610
is that we are fighting
with the systematics

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.600
by introducing more statistics
and everything mixes up

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.460
in the propagation of errors.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.190
The second thing that was
very difficult in this lab

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.800
is that we need to move
the laser constantly.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.870
So one of the people
working on this lab

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.820
has to keep track of
where the laser is

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.590
and whether you're
trapping things

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.660
that you may not want to trap.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.060
The third thing is
the need to find

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.310
better ways of calibration.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.330
And there are people who are
actively working on this topic

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:45.910
here.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.730
As you saw, the
main source of error

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.160
came from the
calibration, actually.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.840
But the plus is that we can
give a reasonable estimate

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.230
to Boltzmann constant
and at the same time,

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.460
we can have a lot of
fun while doing so.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.630
I'd like to thank
to my partner Emma.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.680
And I think collaboration
is very important for JLab

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.860
and more specifically for
this particular experiment.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.440
This experiment is impossible
to be done without a partner

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.990
because it's very difficult.
It's very difficult

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.900
to keep track of where
you want to put the laser

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.180
and also what is going
on around the laser.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.410
While one of the people
is moving the laser,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.240
the other one should be
looking at the CCD camera

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.970
and telling where are
we going and what are we

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:33.819
actually trapping?

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:34.860
What do we want to avoid?

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.800
Like we don't want these
guys in our picture.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.500
I would also like
to thank the staff

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.230
of this class for
their useful feedback

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.100
and their valuable help.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.890
And finally, for your attention.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.842
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.798
AUDIENCE: So in
this experiment, we

00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:07.076
found it useful to consider
the trap being elliptical

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:08.438
rather than circular.

00:14:08.438 --> 00:14:11.370
And so it strengthens
alpha, being

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.758
different in the x
and y directions,

00:14:14.758 --> 00:14:18.150
did you do that in
your calculation?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.820
RUMEN DANGOVSKI: Yeah,
so we have a lot of this

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:27.670
should be trapped stiffness
versus this is the current.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.762
And here, actually I
haven't shown that.

00:14:30.762 --> 00:14:32.470
The trapped stiffness
differs whether you

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.140
are looking in the x
direction or the y direction.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.270
The actual measurements
are analogous because

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.860
the mathematics is the same.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.410
But as you can see here, we
have different data points

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.810
for the two cases.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.370
We account this into
our considerations, yes.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.375
Yes?

00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:53.515
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
earlier that [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:53.515 --> 00:14:55.768
with air or in air [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:55.768 --> 00:14:57.934
Is there any benefit-- or
what's the main difference

00:14:57.934 --> 00:14:59.410
between [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:04.007 --> 00:15:05.590
RUMEN DANGOVSKI:
Everything boils down

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.975
to this consideration here.

00:15:12.196 --> 00:15:15.780
Let me just find my explanation.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:23.374
It boils down to the
viscosity that dominates.

00:15:23.374 --> 00:15:25.290
So in our case, we have
the viscosity of water

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.310
that dominates.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.305
When you look in
different mediums,

00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:30.180
you might have different
types of viscosities

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.490
which would change the motions.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.090
So I have the paper,
I didn't actually

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.490
read through the whole
details of how exactly

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.150
the mathematics
changes, probably does.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.930
Also probably another issues
that may not arise or may arise

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.640
is the laser, like in this case.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.410
The laser heats up
the water, but I

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.010
don't know how exactly the
laser would react with the air.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.720
Maybe it's going to
heat up a little bit,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.020
but how is this heat going
to be distributed in space?

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.470
I'm not very knowledgeable
of this as of now.

00:16:08.853 --> 00:16:12.057
PROFESSOR: Any other questions?

00:16:12.057 --> 00:16:13.723
AUDIENCE: Right there,
what does it say?

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:17.654
Only one degree of
freedom [INAUDIBLE]??

00:16:17.654 --> 00:16:19.570
RUMEN DANGOVSKI: So the
equipartition theorem,

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.470
it breaks into components.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.399
It breaks into the
component of x,

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.940
where you have one
degree of freedom,

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.523
and it breaks into
the component of y,

00:16:26.523 --> 00:16:28.800
where you have another
degree of freedom.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.930
Each of these considerations
is concerned only

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.764
within one movement.

00:16:34.764 --> 00:16:38.677
AUDIENCE: So you have
two degrees of freedom?

00:16:38.677 --> 00:16:41.260
RUMEN DANGOVSKI: OK, well, you
can think about it in this way.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.660
We have two degrees
of freedom in total,

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.184
but in the actual
directions that

00:16:45.184 --> 00:16:46.600
are useful for our
considerations,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.058
we have only one
degree of freedom.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.770
AUDIENCE: You said you
were using the 3.2 micron

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.270
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.738
There were other
sizes available.

00:16:59.738 --> 00:17:01.706
It looks like some
of your photographs

00:17:01.706 --> 00:17:02.690
from the [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:08.038
Did you try data from both the
small beads and the big beads?

00:17:08.038 --> 00:17:11.460
Curious how they
compared in quality.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.139
RUMEN DANGOVSKI:
This is 3.2 microns.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:24.030
Later on, you saw
the one microns.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:29.220
I think our data is concerned
with the 3.2 microns.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.410
My results are not related
with the one micron.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.630
We just played with
it and tried this.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.230
We also tried trapping
cells from onions.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.650
It was very fun to play
with, but unfortunately, we

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:44.770
couldn't get any valuable
quantitative results there.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.970
So even though it's quite a
lot of fun, we have some clips,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.662
it's not worth for
this presentation,

00:17:49.662 --> 00:17:50.870
which concentrates on the kb.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.220
[APPLAUSE]
