00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.820
OK. If the exons are in purple, I count, one,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.010
two, three, four, five, six, seven. You should be able to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.240
count the same up here. One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.510
seven. The number of introns we can't count in the mRNA

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.239
but we see them up here in the gene. One, two,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.110
three, four, five, six. And you'll notice a pattern. Whenever you

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.110
have to count the number of exons and introns in a

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.090
gene, there'll always be one less intron than there are exons.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.970
If there's one exon, then there'll be zero

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.900
introns. If there are two exons, there'll be one

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.340
intron. Now for some of you advanced learners

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.050
out there, there's some mixing and matching of exons.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.900
In certain genes, that's a pretty advanced level

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.890
concept. But right now for most of us just

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.460
learning this, it's generally true that however many exons

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.400
we have in a gene, there's one fewer intron.
