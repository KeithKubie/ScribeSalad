00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.960
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.820
When you’re buying a new car, a new house, or a new pair of jeans, you want to make sure

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.820
you find a good fit.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.030
Statistics are the same.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.360
You want to make sure your models or preconceptions are a good fit for the data you have.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.050
One way to do that is by comparing our observations to our expectations, just like we’ve done

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.849
in statistical tests over the last couple
of episodes.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.810
Today, we’re going to take a break from
looking at continuous variables like height

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.810
and IQ and see how we can measure the fit
of categorical variables like hair color,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.180
or academic degree, or tax bracket.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.320
Turns out a chi-square model fits like that
perfect pair of jeans.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:50.320
INTRO

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.040
Back in one of our data visualization episodes, we talked about frequency tables, which tell

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.790
you the counts--or frequencies--of different
categories.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.920
Maybe you remember pasta madness?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.300
When these tables look at two different categorical variables, like favorite pasta and favorite

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.090
pasta sauce, we often call them contingency tables or cross tabulations.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.619
These tables can help us understand the discrete distribution of one variable, or the relationship

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.680
between two variables.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.270
Just by looking at the data we can see major differences like most people prefer red sauce....

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.579
Or the distribution of favorite pastas seems
to be different for people who like red sauce

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:28.740
vs. white sauce.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.649
But sometimes it’s hard for us to see smaller differences, or to be sure whether differences

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.340
we see are statistically meaningful.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.009
Just like when we were comparing means, we need a test.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.040
A statistical test that can help us extract
the “signal from the noise”.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.740
Statistical tests usually take this form.

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.680
And the test we’ll use here -- Chi Square
-- is only slightly different from the others

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:50.689
we’ve used so far.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.850
The idea in the numerator--looking at the
difference between what we observed and what

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.460
we’d expect if the null is true--is exactly
the same.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.799
The denominator--average variation--is a little different.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.881
Let’s figure out why...in an example.

00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:08.709
A new video game has come out, League of Lemurs, and it has taken the world by storm.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.220
League of Lemurs has hundreds of unique characters you can play as with four main types: Healers,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.300
Tanks, Assassins, and Fighters.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.730
The official League of Lemurs development
team says that on average they see 15% of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.290
players choosing Healers, 20% choosing Tanks, 20% choosing Assassins, and 45% choosing Fighters

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.780
- because who doesn’t want to be a fighting
lemur.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.640
But you wonder whether that distribution holds in the top ranks of LOL players.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.810
The null hypothesis is that the percentages
that LOL gave you are correct:

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.280
And the alternative hypothesis is that at
least one of these percentages or proportions

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.340
are incorrect.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.180
So you record 20 games with 10 players each and count the number of Healers, Tanks, Assassins

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.260
and Fighters.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.120
The data you collected looks like this:

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.810
According to the numbers the LOL developers gave us, we’d have expected 30 Healers,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.260
40 Tanks, 40 Assassins, and 90 Fighters.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.510
So These numbers aren’t EXACTLY what we’d expect.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.080
But we have to ask whether they’re different enough for us to consider it statistically significant.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.340
We need a test statistic.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.160
Our general formula applies, with the numerator being the count we observed for each category

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.030
minus the count we’d expect.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.980
But If you tried to add up all these differences: You’ll always get zero.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.860
So we need a better way to measure.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.290
Using a chi-square, we square them before
adding them all up.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.160
For the denominator instead of a standard
error, we just use the expected counts again.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.400
In this case, the amount that a count deviates from its expected frequency should be scaled

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.050
by the expected frequency.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.470
A deviation of 1 isn’t as big of a deal
if the expected count is 2000, but if it’s

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.810
10...that deviation of 1 matters more.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.610
You might not think it’s worth it to go
back to the store to demand a refund if you’re

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.710
overcharged $1 for a $2000 laptop….but it
might feel more worth it if you were overcharged

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.050
$1 for your morning coffee.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.290
When we add up all these calculations We get a chi-square statistic.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.790
In this case 3.958.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.470
Which, like our other test statistics, helps
us quantify how well our sample data fits

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.290
a certain distribution.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.540
Usually the null distribution.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.420
Like a t-statistic, a chi-square statistic
has a distribution that we can use to find a p-value.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.420
And like t-distributions, chi-square distributions
change their shape as degrees of freedom change.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.060
To find our degrees of freedom we have to
think about what kinds of independent information

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.060
we have.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.850
A frequency table, like the one we just used
for our League of Lemurs example, has a certain

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.139
number of cells.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.650
In this case we had four, one for each character type:

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.150
That means we have four independent pieces of information: each of the four counts.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.229
But as soon as we know the total counts--in this case the 200 players you recorded--the

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.180
four values aren’t ALL independent anymore.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.330
Because if you know 3 of those values and
the total, then with some basic math you can

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.880
figure out the fourth.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.180
So in this case, our degrees of freedom is
the number of categories we have, 4 minus 1.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.160
In this case, 3.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.560
Using our chi-square distribution of 3 degrees of freedom, we can now find our p-value!

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.800
Our p-value here is 0.3, so if our cutoff
was 0.05 we’d fail to reject the null.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.360
The sample we took didn’t give us any statistically significant evidence that the game developers’

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.629
percentages were wrong.

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.779
All Chi-square tests follow the same formula we just worked through.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.009
And there are three main ways that we use
chi-square tests.

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.830
The one we just did is called a chi-square
Goodness of Fit test, because we tested how

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.669
well certain proportions fit our sample.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.039
One way to know that you’re looking at a
Goodness Of Fit Chi-square test is if it only

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.669
has one row.

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.129
We can have many categories, but we’re only looking at one variable.

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.969
Like in our case, character class.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.680
And note: one thing we should always check when doing a Chi-square test is whether the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.759
expected frequency for every cell is greater
than 5.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.720
If the expected frequency is lower than 5,
the results of the chi-square test can be off.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.080
5 is arbitrary, just like many of the cutoffs
in Statistics, but it’s widely accepted.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.210
But chi-square tests aren’t limited to analyzing just ONE categorical variable.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.659
They can even handle TWO.

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.930
Like with the Test of Independence, the second type of chi-square test.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.069
Tests of independence look to see whether
being a member of one category is independent

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.069
of the other.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.520
For example, let’s look at the annual NerdFighteria Survey -- a survey that Hank and John Green

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.370
request their audience of nerdfighters take
every year.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.750
We wanted to take a look at the two most important questions they asked last year: what Hogwarts

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.340
houses nerdfighters were in AND if they liked pineapple on pizza.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.860
What we want to know is whether Pineapple on Pizza

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.379
Preference is Independent of Hogwarts House.

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.750
In other words, does liking Pineapple on Pizza affect the probabilities of you identifying

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.150
with each of the houses?

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.520
Luckily, our writer, Chelsea has that data,
and she took a random sample of 1000 Nerdfighter’s

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.830
responses so we could answer our questions.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.130
She’s a pineapple-loving Ravenclaw, for
the record.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.559
But let’s take a look at the data.

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:02.439
Looks like there’s a lot of Ravenclaw Nerdfighters.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:06.589
Unlike our Chi Square goodness of fit test,
we’re not specifying an exact distribution

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:11.559
for Hogwarts houses and comparing our two groups: Yes pineapple and No pineapple.

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:15.750
In this situation, we’re not too concerned
with the exact distribution.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.129
We just want to know whether it’s different
for people who like and don’t like pineapple

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.129
on pizza.

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:26.969
A Chi-square test of Independence, can test whether or not one Variable--pineapple preference--is

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:28.889
independent of another--Hogwarts House.

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.889
And you’ll soon see that the calculations
we do here are the exact same for the third

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.629
Chi-Square test: the Chi-Square test of Homogeneity.

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:41.710
Test of homogeneity are looking at whether
it’s likely that different samples come

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.930
from the same population.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.710
For example you might want to know whether two samples of water are likely from the same

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.680
lake based on the counts of fish, algae, and
bacteria found in them.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.889
In essence they’re testing similar things,
and the calculations we’re about to do are

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:55.710
the same for both tests.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.770
Back to the Nerdfighters.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.150
To calculate the Chi-Square statistic, we
need our observed frequencies which we already

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.229
have, and our expected frequencies, which
we need to calculate.

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:08.919
But it’s not quite as straightforward as
in the Goodness of fit test.First we’ll

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:11.539
need to calculate some row and column totals:

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:15.030
We already know that there’s 1000 total
people, and we can count up all the people

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.860
who don’t like pineapple on their pizza
to find that there’s 479 of them, which

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.619
means there must be 521 people who do like pineapple on their Pizza.

00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:28.940
We have 3 independent pieces of information here, or 3 degrees of freedom.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.159
In general the formula for degrees of freedom for these chi-square tests is rows minus 1

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.099
times columns minus 1.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.469
Finally, we can calculate those expected frequencies.

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:43.120
Remember, the expected counts are what we would expect if the null hypothesis is true.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.130
In this test, the null hypothesis is that
the distribution of Hogwarts House is the

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.810
same for both pineapple lovers and haters.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.880
But our null hypothesis says nothing about
WHAT that distribution is.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.899
So we can calculate our expected frequencies by taking the total number of Gryffindors

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:02.230
and dividing it by the total number of people:

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.130
This gives us the expected percentage of people who are Gryffindors.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:11.440
Since there’s 479 People in our sample who
don’t like pineapple, we expect 16.1% of

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.949
them or about 77 of them to also be Gryffindors.

00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:20.540
Using this same math, we can calculate the
expected frequency for all of our cells.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.860
Once we have our expected frequency, we just need to use our Chi-square formula on each

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.300
cell, and add them all up to get our Chi-Square Statistic:

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.860
And with our chi-square distribution with
3 degrees of freedom, we can see that our

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.870
p-value of 0.6 is very large compared to our
alpha level of 0.05, so we fail to reject

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:44.100
the null hypothesis that the distribution
of Hogwarts Houses is the same regardless of pizza preference.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.470
If the null were true, we’d expect to see
numbers as or more different than ours 60%

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.680
of the time.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.120
So we don’t have evidence that Hogwarts
House is dependent on Pineapples on Pizza preference.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.720
It’s often useful to check our assumptions
and to see if they’re a good fit.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.680
Whether that’s testing whether a population is distributed the way we think it is.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.820
Are there really the same proportion of Skittles
colors in a bag?

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.420
Or whether two variables affect each other,
like political party preference and cat and

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.440
dog ownership.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.260
Since we, as humans, tend to categorize many things, from dog breed to hair color, it can

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:22.960
be useful to check what we think about how and if those categories interact.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.940
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
