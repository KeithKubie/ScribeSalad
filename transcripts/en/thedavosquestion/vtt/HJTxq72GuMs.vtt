00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.360
I think the whole question that Anita was
asking is about chance and how we can assure

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.099
that girls like Anita and many, many, many
other girls in developing countries would

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.650
have the chance. More access to education
and making their lives better and therefore

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.220
the whole economy better as well as reducing
poverty. Providing that chance means partly

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.340
breaking down cultural values and traditions
about the fact that girls are measured in

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.750
terms of their success in life by getting
married and having children. Girls need to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.160
have access to education. They need to be
able to continue their education. And for

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.329
this affirmative policies may be necessary,
governments, as well as other ways to assure

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.079
that girls are not taken out of school because
of poverty or for other reasons. And Especially

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.649
during this crisis , where poverty rates can
go up, incomes will come down. There is a

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:11.970
real danger of girls being taken out of school
before boys will be taken out of school. In

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.909
designing policies as a policy maker, in designing
policies and managing the crisis I think we

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.680
have to really make sure that we explicitly
include this aspect to make sure that girls

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.280
continue to be in school. For instance you
can build in cash transfer programs to be

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.070
given with the condition that the recipient
continues to have girls and boys stay in school.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.210
In the more medium term, I think how to change
cultural values and traditions become s a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.890
much more longer term issue, but having role
models, having girls understand that their

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.450
self esteem should not just be measured by
that fact that they're married and having

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.490
children needs to be changed. And I think
democracy in the case of Indonesia has played

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.200
an important role. Where you find all the
way from a president being a woman, to ministers,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.690
to governors, to village heads being women.
And making decisions that are in favor of

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.720
women as well as becoming role models become
a very important part of the change. And finally

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.420
I think the legal part, making sure that girls
and women understand their rights so that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.629
if they succeed in business they have the
property rights and they don't lose it just

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.700
because everything is under their husband's
name. So it was a good session. And I would

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.390
hope that a big message coming out of the
world economic from Davos is that all the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.760
crisis messages about trade and finance, in
managing this crisis we must have a very proactive

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.930
and specific policy to ensure that girls like
Anita will continue to have the chance. Thank

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.120
you.
