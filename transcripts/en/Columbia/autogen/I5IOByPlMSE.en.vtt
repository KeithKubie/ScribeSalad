make this real and everything started

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:19.820
make this real and everything started
 

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.299

is we want to make a real car for real

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:49.549
is we want to make a real car for real
 

00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:52.149

people and I think real people would

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159
people and I think real people would

feel a little embarrassed being in a
30-foot teardrop and actually making the

00:19:57.399 --> 00:19:57.409
30-foot teardrop and actually making the
 

00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:59.169
30-foot teardrop and actually making the
corner around here I think that'll be a

00:19:59.169 --> 00:19:59.179
corner around here I think that'll be a
 

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:02.440
corner around here I think that'll be a
little tricky and so we this is where

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:02.450
little tricky and so we this is where
 

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.119

interesting the collaborations get

00:20:05.979 --> 00:20:05.989
interesting the collaborations get
 

00:20:05.989 --> 00:20:08.969
interesting the collaborations get
deeper and we started looking at okay

00:20:08.969 --> 00:20:08.979
deeper and we started looking at okay
 

00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:11.889

let's be the wind and let's start to

00:20:11.889 --> 00:20:11.899
let's be the wind and let's start to
 

00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:13.869
let's be the wind and let's start to
imagine how we can make the wind

00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:13.879
imagine how we can make the wind
 

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.509
imagine how we can make the wind
separate from the vehicle we want it

the wind must think it's leaving this

00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:25.459
the wind must think it's leaving this

you can see in the very beginning we

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:30.829
you can see in the very beginning we
 

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.469
you can see in the very beginning we
started playing with little elements

00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:32.479
started playing with little elements
 

00:20:32.479 --> 00:20:34.690
started playing with little elements
that allow the wind to separate because

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:34.700
that allow the wind to separate because
 

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.329
that allow the wind to separate because
what happens in aerodynamics as the wind

00:20:37.329 --> 00:20:37.339
what happens in aerodynamics as the wind
 

00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:38.909
what happens in aerodynamics as the wind
flows through the car

00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919
flows through the car
 

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:41.190
flows through the car
but as it leaves the car you don't want

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200
but as it leaves the car you don't want
 

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.159
but as it leaves the car you don't want
it to kind of come around the corner and

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:43.169
it to kind of come around the corner and
 

00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:45.899
it to kind of come around the corner and
basically holds the car which an

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:45.909
basically holds the car which an
 

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:48.629
basically holds the car which an
electric vehicle burns battery which you

00:20:48.629 --> 00:20:48.639
electric vehicle burns battery which you
 

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:50.909
electric vehicle burns battery which you
want to save so these early experiments

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919
want to save so these early experiments

want to save so these early experiments
we actually started thinking all this is

00:20:52.979 --> 00:20:52.989
we actually started thinking all this is
 

00:20:52.989 --> 00:20:54.810
we actually started thinking all this is
kind of interesting this is a kind of

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:54.820
kind of interesting this is a kind of
 

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.960
kind of interesting this is a kind of
new way of designing a car and some

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:57.970
new way of designing a car and some
 

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.369
new way of designing a car and some
things that started happening in

00:20:59.369 --> 00:20:59.379
things that started happening in
 

00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:01.289

collaborations we found that as we're

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:01.299
collaborations we found that as we're
 

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:03.869
collaborations we found that as we're
working the body side very smooth the

00:21:03.869 --> 00:21:03.879
working the body side very smooth the
 

00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:06.359
working the body side very smooth the

tricks started to come up like let's say

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080
tricks started to come up like let's say
 

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.289
tricks started to come up like let's say
for the maybe we don't think about

00:21:10.289 --> 00:21:10.299
for the maybe we don't think about
 

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:12.659
for the maybe we don't think about
headlamps that much in our normal day

00:21:12.659 --> 00:21:12.669
headlamps that much in our normal day
 

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:15.539
headlamps that much in our normal day
and but the headlamp itself we

00:21:15.539 --> 00:21:15.549
and but the headlamp itself we
 

00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:17.279
and but the headlamp itself we
discovered that if we create a shape

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:17.289
discovered that if we create a shape
 

00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:19.470
discovered that if we create a shape
that bulged up around the headlamp it

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480
that bulged up around the headlamp it
 

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.710
that bulged up around the headlamp it
would separate the wind and actually

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720
would separate the wind and actually
 

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.349
would separate the wind and actually
bypass the side mirror well okay what's

00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:25.359
bypass the side mirror well okay what's
 

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:27.509
bypass the side mirror well okay what's
the big deal with that except an

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:27.519
the big deal with that except an
 

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:29.509
the big deal with that except an
electric vehicle doesn't have an engine

00:21:29.509 --> 00:21:29.519
electric vehicle doesn't have an engine
 

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:32.070
electric vehicle doesn't have an engine
it has an electric motor which is dead

so you had to get into these deep

00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:44.019
so you had to get into these deep
 

00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:47.789
so you had to get into these deep
studies and go into the clay going to

00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799
studies and go into the clay going to
 

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:50.970
studies and go into the clay going to
wind tunnel computer simulations of how

wind tunnel computer simulations of how
 

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.129
wind tunnel computer simulations of how
the wind flows beautifully and

00:21:53.129 --> 00:21:53.139
the wind flows beautifully and
 

00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:55.739
the wind flows beautifully and
effortlessly through the body of the car

this kind of was a real big learning and

00:22:01.769 --> 00:22:01.779
this kind of was a real big learning and
 

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.049
this kind of was a real big learning and
I'm hoping that we could take this

00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059
I'm hoping that we could take this
 

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:06.060
I'm hoping that we could take this
learning later into you know all forms

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.070
learning later into you know all forms

want sleek effortless design and at this
 

00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:22.649
want sleek effortless design and at this
point is when as designers we start

00:22:22.649 --> 00:22:22.659
point is when as designers we start
 

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:24.479
point is when as designers we start
thinking of some key words to finish the

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:24.489
thinking of some key words to finish the
 

00:22:24.489 --> 00:22:27.869
thinking of some key words to finish the
project so this smart fluidity that the

00:22:27.869 --> 00:22:27.879
project so this smart fluidity that the
 

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:30.720
project so this smart fluidity that the
wind again is the key effortlessness is

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:30.730
wind again is the key effortlessness is
 

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.259
wind again is the key effortlessness is
the key and here we can then start to

00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:34.269
the key and here we can then start to
 

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:36.749
the key and here we can then start to
finish the car and as designers we start

00:22:36.749 --> 00:22:36.759
finish the car and as designers we start
 

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:38.489
finish the car and as designers we start
looking at all the little details and

00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:38.499
looking at all the little details and
 

00:22:38.499 --> 00:22:40.379
looking at all the little details and
let's just you know make sure that the

another story because when you drive the

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.410
another story because when you drive the
 

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.380
another story because when you drive the
first prototype around two years ago

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:22.390
first prototype around two years ago
 

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.300
first prototype around two years ago
you've realized that when you get in the

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.310
you've realized that when you get in the
 

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.800
you've realized that when you get in the
car you put it in forward gear no sound

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:28.810
car you put it in forward gear no sound
 

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.040
car you put it in forward gear no sound
and this is fundamentally different you

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.050

time it's not disproportionate you can
 

01:07:54.329 --> 01:07:57.189
time it's not disproportionate you can
calculate but what represents the total

01:07:57.189 --> 01:07:57.199
calculate but what represents the total

the total amount of investment that we

01:08:00.799 --> 01:08:00.809
the total amount of investment that we
 

01:08:00.809 --> 01:08:03.409
the total amount of investment that we
do on on your yearly basis company like

01:08:03.409 --> 01:08:03.419
do on on your yearly basis company like
 

01:08:03.419 --> 01:08:05.149
do on on your yearly basis company like
ours is four point five percent of

01:08:05.149 --> 01:08:05.159
ours is four point five percent of
 

01:08:05.159 --> 01:08:07.519
ours is four point five percent of
turnover and you'll see that this this

01:08:07.519 --> 01:08:07.529
turnover and you'll see that this this
 

01:08:07.529 --> 01:08:09.649
turnover and you'll see that this this
magnitude represents perhaps a little

01:08:09.649 --> 01:08:09.659
magnitude represents perhaps a little
 

01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:12.019
magnitude represents perhaps a little
bit more than the total investment we do

01:08:12.019 --> 01:08:12.029
bit more than the total investment we do
 

01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:15.469
bit more than the total investment we do
in in one single year so it's reasonable

01:08:15.469 --> 01:08:15.479
in in one single year so it's reasonable
 

01:08:15.479 --> 01:08:17.930
in in one single year so it's reasonable
and the fact that we have this

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940

any data on the net emissions saved I
 

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.510
any data on the net emissions saved I
mean you did some data with the cost but

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520
mean you did some data with the cost but

much emissions would it would it take to

01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:56.460
much emissions would it would it take to
 

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.400
much emissions would it would it take to
charge your car as compared to the

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:58.410

instance you got those batteries and

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:51.070
instance you got those batteries and
 

01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:53.610
instance you got those batteries and
then you can charge during the day or

01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:53.620
then you can charge during the day or
 

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:54.990
then you can charge during the day or
during the night you charge the

01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000
during the night you charge the
 

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.660
during the night you charge the
batteries and then it allows you not to

01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:57.670
batteries and then it allows you not to
 

01:26:57.670 --> 01:26:59.370
batteries and then it allows you not to
have a peak during the day I guess the

01:26:59.370 --> 01:26:59.380
have a peak during the day I guess the
 

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.930
have a peak during the day I guess the
peak is around twenty percent so we have

01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:00.940
peak is around twenty percent so we have
 

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.729
peak is around twenty percent so we have
twenty percent over capacity in the US

01:27:02.729 --> 01:27:02.739
twenty percent over capacity in the US

01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320
let me start with the easy part of the
 

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.720
let me start with the easy part of the
answer and the difficult part will be

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:01.730
answer and the difficult part will be
 

01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:04.390
answer and the difficult part will be
for mark so the easy part of the answer

01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400
for mark so the easy part of the answer
 

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.850
for mark so the easy part of the answer
is that we are selling the car with the

01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:06.860
is that we are selling the car with the
 

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.370
is that we are selling the car with the
battery as one of the components of the

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:09.380
battery as one of the components of the
 

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.560
battery as one of the components of the
car or leasing the car with the battery

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:11.570
car or leasing the car with the battery
 

01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:14.020
car or leasing the car with the battery
and when we sell the car we are going to

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:14.030
and when we sell the car we are going to
 

01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:17.190
and when we sell the car we are going to
sell the car with a battery warranty of

01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:17.200
sell the car with a battery warranty of
 

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.830
sell the car with a battery warranty of
eight years and 100,000 miles which is

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840
eight years and 100,000 miles which is
 

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:25.840
eight years and 100,000 miles which is
quite I think wide wide warranty so that

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:25.850
quite I think wide wide warranty so that
 

01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:28.480
quite I think wide wide warranty so that
we take that anxiety out of the mind of

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:28.490
we take that anxiety out of the mind of
 

01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:29.860
we take that anxiety out of the mind of
the consumer by saying look you have a

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:29.870
the consumer by saying look you have a
 

01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:32.440
the consumer by saying look you have a
wide warrant it even goes beyond the

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:32.450
wide warrant it even goes beyond the
 

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:35.650
wide warrant it even goes beyond the
warranty of the car itself so it's it's

01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:35.660
warranty of the car itself so it's it's
 

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.760
warranty of the car itself so it's it's
our

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:36.770

somewhere puts the pressure on the any
 

01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:53.780
somewhere puts the pressure on the any
government any official to address what

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:53.790
government any official to address what

the consumer things are the society

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:56.310
the consumer things are the society
 

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.250
the consumer things are the society
problem so I don't see any any

01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260
problem so I don't see any any
 

01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.230
problem so I don't see any any
fundamental fundamental different this

01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:00.240
fundamental fundamental different this
 

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.780
fundamental fundamental different this
is a very big big shift it's a very deep

01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:04.790
is a very big big shift it's a very deep
 

01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:09.470
is a very big big shift it's a very deep
trend so I'm very comfortable with with

01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480
trend so I'm very comfortable with with
 

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.420
trend so I'm very comfortable with with
this kind of change I think it's exactly

01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:11.430
this kind of change I think it's exactly
 

01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:14.090
this kind of change I think it's exactly
as it was a few days before on the

01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100
as it was a few days before on the
 

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.450
as it was a few days before on the
second question which is also a great

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460
second question which is also a great
 

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:21.200
second question which is also a great
point I think there is a lot to do to

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:21.210
point I think there is a lot to do to
 

01:32:21.210 --> 01:32:23.930
point I think there is a lot to do to
demonstrate that electric vehicles are

01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:23.940
demonstrate that electric vehicles are
 

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:26.630
demonstrate that electric vehicles are
fun because in the mind of a certain

vehicles are not a real car which we are
 

01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:33.110
vehicles are not a real car which we are
now demonstrating is wrong with the

01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120
now demonstrating is wrong with the
 

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.300
now demonstrating is wrong with the
nissan leaf and secondly they are not

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:35.310
nissan leaf and secondly they are not
 

01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:38.930
nissan leaf and secondly they are not
fun they cannot be agile which is also

01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:38.940
fun they cannot be agile which is also
 

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.840
fun they cannot be agile which is also
wrong and there are two two kinds of

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:41.850
wrong and there are two two kinds of
 

01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:44.180
wrong and there are two two kinds of
people I can meet the ones who did the

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:44.190
people I can meet the ones who did the
 

01:32:44.190 --> 01:32:46.030
people I can meet the ones who did the
test drive and the ones who didn't and

01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040
test drive and the ones who didn't and
 

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:48.680
test drive and the ones who didn't and
there was the ones who did they

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:48.690
there was the ones who did they
