00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.870
Well, I think my
opinion on grief

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.160
can be summed up in the
words of Alan Harrington

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.390
from The Immortalist when he
says, "any philosophy that

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.580
accepts death must itself be
considered dead-- its questions

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.730
meaningless, its
constellations worn out."

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.750
I agree with him.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.860
I don't think there's
any way to make peace

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.020
with death, with mortality,
with the human condition.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.000
The fact that we can
ponder the infinite cosmos,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.860
yet we're ultimately
food for worms

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.410
I find heartwrenchingly,
paralyzing, depressing, sad

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.815
beyond all measurable limits.

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:50.556
The idea that everything
and everyone you love

00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:55.750
is going to be taken away from
you is unacceptable to me.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.340
I think it's just
unacceptable being

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.510
OK with those terms imposed
on us by said universe.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.271
If the cosmos is comfortable
with entropy, that's one thing.

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:07.520
It doesn't mean I have to
be comfortable with entropy.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.780
In fact, I'm a member
of the kingdom of life.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.650
And life is anti-entropic.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.610
Life moves towards greater
complexity and organization.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.100
As Kurzweil says, more
knowledge, more science, more,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.600
more, more sprouting
possibilities.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.020
And some people say that maybe
death is an evolutionary design

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.800
meant to get rid of the old in
order to make room for the new.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.690
That may have been a stepping
stone, a necessary rehearsal,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.590
a way of spreading the
diversity of information.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.550
Sex and death-- genes mixed
together creates something new,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.755
kill off the old shells.

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:40.180
But what if we're able
to create new rules?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.430
What if we master biotechnology?

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.560
We create software that
writes its own hardware.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.650
We start to change
the rules of life.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.155
We start creating
that diversity.

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:51.930
We start to be the sort
of mind at work here.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.815
It would be intelligent
design at last.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.320
But the point being, death
would no longer be necessary.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.035
And we could create
a world without loss

00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:03.430
and without those
encounters with grief.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.300
And that may sound like a sort
of manic fantasy of sorts.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.330
But I think that's
what mankind has always

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.100
done through his art,
is articulate his desire

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.125
to be external, to be infinite.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:18.080
Even Miguel De Unamuno
wrote, "nothing

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.485
is real that is not eternal."

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:21.590
That's why we
write poetry and we

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.760
build cathedrals that try
to create transcendence

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.350
as a topographical statement.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.930
That's why we eternalize
beautific moments,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.125
and make gorgeous statues,
and write amazing songs.

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.270
We love to eternalize ourselves.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.286
We want to say, as
Alain de Botton said,

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:38.410
we want to carve our names.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.305
We want to say, I was here.

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:41.480
I exist.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.410
I felt something and I matter.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.236
And we matter.

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:48.980
And that's why death has become
an imposition on the human race

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.150
and no longer
acceptable, in my words.
