00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.870
While the Ancient Greeks had their celebrated
Sacred Band of Thebes, a legendarily successful

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
fighting force made up of all male lovers,
in more modern times the various branches

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.270
of the United States military have not been
so accepting of such individuals, which brings

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.039
us to the topic of today- that time in the
1980s when the Naval Intelligence Service

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.830
invested significant resources into trying
to locate a mysterious woman identified only

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.770
as “Dorothy” who seemed to have links
to countless gay seamen.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.160
The plan was to find her and then “convince”
her to finger these individuals so the military

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.210
could give them the boot.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.210
This story all starts with a naval crack down
to try to get rid of any gay personnel in

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.210
the early 1980s.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.490
One Mel Dahl, who was completely open about
the fact that he was gay when he was questioned

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.710
about it upon enlisting in 1980, was kicked
out in 1981 after being interviewed for a

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.149
security clearance upgrade and once again
letting the Navy know he was gay.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.100
This time they weren’t so accepting of that
information.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.561
During the course of Dahl’s subsequent legal
battle with the Navy over his discharge, he

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:11.770
noted to the news media that there were quite
a lot of gay men at the Great Lakes base he

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.950
had been stationed at.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.540
This information did not go over well with
the military brass who launched a full scale

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.069
investigation of the base to try to identify
these individuals.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.050
Specifically, as reported in Conduct Unbecoming:
Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military, by

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.521
Randy Shilts, the U.S. Navy spent a considerable
amount of money sending investigators to gay

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:35.700
bars in the Chicago area to try to discover
these gay sailors.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.149
During these trips, investigators noticed
that many gay men in the area identified themselves

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.780
as “friends of Dorothy”.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.100
The Intelligence Service deduced that “Dorothy”
must be a woman that functioned as a sort

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.069
of information hub that gay men could use
to find other gay men.

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.789
If they could only find her, they figured
they could convince her to talk, perhaps outing

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.430
many of the gay navy personnel in the process,
who in turn, with a little pressure, could

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.090
no doubt out many others.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.890
The key was simply to find Dorothy.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.849
Thus, the NIS tasked investigators with returning
to the same gay bars to clandestinely ask

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.120
questions about this mysterious woman.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.900
Unfortunately for them, they failed at finding
Dorothy, wasting an amazing amount of taxpayer

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.370
money paying investigators to pose as gay
men, drinking and breaking it down in 1980s

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.370
era gay bars.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.849
This said, other investigations they conducted
seem not to have been so fruitless, with the

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.989
Defense Department noting that, in total,
1,976 members of the various branches of the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.370
U.S. military were kicked out for being gay
in 1981 alone; a reported 55% of these individuals

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.459
were ousted from the Navy- all at a massive
cost to U.S. taxpayers.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.129
As noted by one discharged gay Air Force captain
interviewed by Shilts, it cost the Air Force

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.939
somewhere in the range of four to five million
dollars to train him when factoring in the

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.220
exceptionally high cost of aircraft time in
that training.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.480
(As an interesting aside, for a time it was
perceived that the military was unfairly targeting

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.520
gay men, while not cracking down nearly so
hard on lesbians in their ranks.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.870
As a result, in 1990 Vice Admiral Joseph S.
Donnell issued a memo urging his subordinates

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.879
to root out lesbians in the Navy, not just
gay men.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.099
As to how lesbians were to be identified,
he wrote, “Experience has shown that the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.940
stereotypical female homosexual in the Navy
is hard-working, career-oriented, willing

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.139
to put in long hours on the job and among
the command’s top professionals…”

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.780
We can’t make this stuff up.)

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.560
In any event, at this point you might be wondering
who exactly was this “Tokyo Rose” of the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.810
gay community and how did she have so many
gay friends?

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.529
As it turns out, she was none other than Dorothy
Gale of The Wizard of Oz…

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.840
You see, for over a half century now the phrase
“Friend of Dorothy” has been considered

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.799
a euphemism for “gay”.

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.590
The phrase, sometimes simply abbreviated to
FOD, is believed to have first popped up sometime

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.280
in the 1940s as a way for gay men to identify
themselves as such to others without outright

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.359
saying it.

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.489
As you can imagine, in areas where the laws
of the land and/or the general populace were

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.310
strongly against said individuals, being able
to say “I’m a friend of Dorothy” instead

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.819
of “I’m gay” was a major boon.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.360
After all, if said individual was speaking
to someone who was also gay, the other person

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.030
would probably know exactly what they were
saying.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.750
If not, likely they’d think the individual
knew some woman named Dorothy who they mistakenly

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.770
thought was a mutual acquaintance.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.540
While there are alternate speculative theories
as to the origin of the phrase, based on the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.930
evidence at hand, as mentioned, it is generally
thought to have been inspired by the popular

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.250
1939 film The Wizard of Oz and/or the 1909
book it is based on.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.680
It is also noted that Judy Garland herself
ultimately became exceptionally popular among

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.300
the gay community throughout her adulthood,
while the film is popular for its message

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.840
of inclusivity in spite of differences.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.490
To quote the Gay Times on the matter:

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.400
Dorothy’s three companions on her trip to
Oz have long been read as gay, and for good

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400
reason.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.750
The Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly
Lion are misfits who do not conform to their

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.960
perceived ‘roles’.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.210
The Scarecrow is unable to frighten anything
– crow or otherwise; the Tin Man constantly

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.710
needs lubing up; and the Cowardly Lion seems
to prefer mincing to roaring.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.940
This ostracisation is familiar to many gay
guys – who are often accused of being less

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.880
masculine than straight guys.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.450
On that note, Dorothy happily accepts the
somewhat effeminate “Cowardly Lion” who

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.830
eventually identifies as a “friend of Dorothy,”
and earlier on states, “I’m afraid there’s

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.990
no denyin’, I’m just a dandy lion,”
with “dandy” generally referring to an

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.320
often effeminate man seen as overly preoccupied
with fashion.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.730
(For more on this, see Why Did Yankee Doodle
Stick a Feather in His Cap and Call It Macaroni?)

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.200
Books continuing the story also include similar
themes, characters and moments that likewise

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.810
resonate with the LGBT communities.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.590
Most famous of all is a quote from the book,
The Road to Oz, in which Dorothy responds

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.740
to a character saying she has “queer friends”
by saying:

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.900
The queerness doesn’t matter, so long as
they’re friends.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.280
Of course, the word “queer” here is roughly
understood to be a synonym for “odd” or

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.130
“unusual”, but, as with so many other
bits of the books that are not actually thought

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.980
to have been references to homosexuality,
it nonetheless struck a chord among gay fans

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.930
who responded well to the idea of accepting
someone regardless of how different others

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.120
found them- it was their character that was
the only thing that was important.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.520
A mere decade after The Wizard of Oz first
made its debut on the big screen, “Friend

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.210
of Dorothy” had become one of the most popular
euphemisms used by gay people to refer to

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.210
themselves- a fact the rest of the world were
largely oblivious to, allowing gay people

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.490
to discretely identify themselves as such
at a time when doing so may have been illegal

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.520
where they lived and/or potentially dangerous.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.380
Unsurprisingly given changing attitudes and
laws today, the phrase “Friend of Dorothy”

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.390
isn’t nearly as widely known among those
of the youthful persuasion in the LGBT communities,

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.190
and many with a few more years under their
belts have less need to use the phrase than

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.860
they once did, so it is dying out somewhat.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.550
However, one place you’ll still occasionally
hear it is aboard cruise ships, where an announcement

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.710
like “Friends of Dorothy are meeting in
the lounge on Deck 7 at 8 pm” is sometimes

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.710
made.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.360
This is similar to how members of Alcoholic
Anonymous have long announced meetings aboard

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.630
cruise ships as a meeting of “Friends of
Bill W”.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.310
This refers to the founder of Alcoholic Anonymous,
William “Bill” Willson.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.210
Similar to the “Friends of Dorothy” announcements,
the idea is to provide a way to announce such

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:59.400
meetings without outing those 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:47.280
who attend.
