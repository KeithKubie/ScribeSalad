00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:02.139
Voiceover: Here's some
questions that I got from

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.032
Brainwave, a children's
science magazine in India.

00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:09.540
The first question right here
is last month, September,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.669
the students of the world
celebrated Teacher's Day,

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.400
an overwhelming number of whom would

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.874
undoubtedly have sent their wishes and

00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:15.809
gratitude your way.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.284
Hopefully and I thank
everyone for all of the

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.473
thank you notes we do get on our YouTube

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:22.139
channel and all the rest.

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:25.934
Who was your favorite teacher while

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.011
studying and why?

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:32.062
I'd have to say I had a
bunch of favorite teachers

00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:34.410
for, I guess, multiple
reasons, but I guess there is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.873
a common thread.

00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:39.116
I would say in high
school the teachers who,

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:40.703
and I don't want to just pick favorites,

00:00:40.703 --> 00:00:42.428
I'm sure I'm forgetting some

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:44.139
very important people here,

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:47.205
but Mr. Hernandez.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:48.810
The first time I had a
class with him was for

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.472
Algebra II, but he was
also the adviser for,

00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:52.870
it was called Mu Alpha
Theta, which was the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.872
Math Honor Society and also

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:56.871
the math competition team.

00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:01.805
He was our adviser for
that and Miss. Kennedy.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:02.935
She was an English teacher

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:04.283
and also a journalism instructor.

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:05.472
When I was on the school newspaper,

00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:09.200
she was our teacher and our adviser.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.472
I think what made both
of them memorable to me

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:16.615
and I think were important
in my own development

00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:20.958
is that they really did
treat me like a peer.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.739
They never talked down to me.

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:24.953
It never felt like,

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:27.410
"I am the teacher, you are the student."

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.804
It was kind of a two-way
flow of information.

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:33.009
It almost felt like we
were working together

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.444
towards a common goal.

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:35.761
Mr. Hernandez with some of the stuff

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.615
we did with the math team.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:38.742
Miss Kennedy with some of the stuff

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:40.538
we would do with the newspaper.

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:42.072
She was just a person who was

00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:43.790
more knowledgeable and more experienced,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.372
but she really respected everything that

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:46.957
we were doing.

00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:48.956
I think probably all of the teachers

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:51.367
that I had that I think
really impacted me,

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:55.866
that's what did it for me is that.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.412
I remember even in 5th
grade I had a teacher,

00:01:57.412 --> 00:02:00.740
Ms. Ellis and she would run her 5th grade

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.372
social studies classes kind
of like a college seminar.

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:07.033
I distinctly remember her being
at the front of the class,

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.117
peeling an orange,

00:02:08.117 --> 00:02:10.539
and just asking us tough questions.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.473
The type of questions where you'd have to

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:13.737
ponder it for a few seconds

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:15.289
before you'd even have an

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:16.455
interesting thought or you would

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.631
continue pondering it when you went home.

00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:22.234
I remember there was Miss Krause and

00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:24.139
Miss Rucell in elementary school.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.136
They were gifted teachers
and once again, they had

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:30.202
the luxury of defining what
their own curriculum was.

00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:33.476
They really used to
challenge us and give us

00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:37.205
truly creative projects to work on.

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:39.787
When you take art class outside of that,

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:42.367
oftentimes it's very
formulaic, it's kind of

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.808
paint by numbers for
lack of a better word,

00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:47.468
but I remember when we did art projects

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:49.656
in the context of the gifted class,

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:51.468
it was really very open-ended.

00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:54.701
It was like here's some
tools; make something

00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:57.368
and I think that was a
really strong message and

00:02:57.368 --> 00:02:59.869
allowed students to really
develop their creativity

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.616
as opposed to just following a formula.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.983
Across the board, I think
it's the teachers who

00:03:04.983 --> 00:03:09.534
really expected something
from the students

00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:12.038
and treated them with
respect, even though these

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:14.668
students were clearly
early in their learning.

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:17.040
Also, assumed that the students were

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.613
capable of true creativity.

00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:20.953
I'll throw another one
in there, Dr. Santania.

00:03:20.953 --> 00:03:24.000
My junior and senior year in
high school, I took courses

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.700
at the University of New
Orleans and Dr. Santania

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.400
was the professor for partial
differential equations.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.701
He brought me under his
wing and for a summer I was

00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.881
essentially one of his researchers.

00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:40.787
He would come into the little
computer lab where I was

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:43.073
working and he would
talk about his research.

00:03:43.073 --> 00:03:48.954
We would bounce ideas off of each other.

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.535
Clearly, here you are a tenured
professor at a university,

00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:54.067
but you're willing to hang
out with a 16- or 17-year-old.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.944
It really sent a very strong
message to me and really

00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:59.202
I think built my own self-esteem and

00:03:59.202 --> 00:04:02.538
made me think that I could do something.

00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:05.470
Question number two;
what sort of a student

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.818
were you at school?

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:17.303
I was a kid who loved,
so I loved - this is kind

00:04:17.303 --> 00:04:20.284
of an interesting answer
I think - I loved a lot of

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:27.020
the subject matter and I
hated a lot of the classes.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.616
I found a lot of the
subject matter really,

00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:29.694
really, really interesting;

00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:33.003
I just didn't like how it was sometimes

00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:34.805
presented and it wasn't
the fault of the teacher.

00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:37.522
It was often more usually
the fault I would say of

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:40.803
the textbook or of just
the curriculum generally.

00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:43.867
The general idea, everything
was devoid of connections.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:47.484
You would learn how to
borrow numbers without anyone

00:04:47.484 --> 00:04:49.538
telling you why you were borrowing that

00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:51.426
or even without anyone
ever asking the students

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:53.006
why does this work,

00:04:53.006 --> 00:04:54.710
without ever having the chance to ponder

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.961
why does it work.

00:04:57.884 --> 00:05:01.539
You'd see peers memorize
one formula for one exam

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.955
and then on the next exam
or by the next month,

00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:07.408
they'd forgotten it and
the next year when there's

00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:09.994
a topic that just builds
off of that same formula,

00:05:09.994 --> 00:05:12.284
if you just intuitively
understood the original formula

00:05:12.284 --> 00:05:13.740
the second one would be intuitive,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.469
they're rememorizing an ex-formula.

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:20.805
I really didn't like that
aspect of what was going on

00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:23.951
and I sometimes, I think
for lack of a better word,

00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:27.551
I think I sometimes
acted up because of that.

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:32.384
I straightened up a
little bit near the end of

00:05:32.384 --> 00:05:34.977
high school, but earlier
on I wasn't like the

00:05:34.977 --> 00:05:38.034
discipline problem kid, but
I definitely got a lot of

00:05:38.034 --> 00:05:42.114
teachers talking to my
mom about Sal not being

00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:45.611
fully engaged in class.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:52.194
I think once I got to
college, I was lucky enough

00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:55.030
to go to a place where there
was a lot of intellectual

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.037
curiosity going on.

00:05:57.037 --> 00:06:02.703
There was a culture of
people wanting to learn

00:06:02.703 --> 00:06:05.076
and I frankly think MIT is
somewhat unique in that.

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:07.449
The culture really is,
there's other things going on

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.947
on campus, but most of
the people there genuinely

00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:12.027
want to learn and there's
no embarrassment of saying

00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:14.842
you're actually fascinated
by something academic.

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:18.157
While at a lot of schools
in the world, you almost

00:06:18.157 --> 00:06:21.335
have to hide that you're
interested in something.

00:06:21.335 --> 00:06:24.137
I know that was definitely
the case in my high school

00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:28.926
experience is that I would
not, even if I was fascinated

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:32.737
by something, I would keep
it to myself and sometimes

00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:35.869
even if I did enjoy talking
to the teacher, I would

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.604
actually keep that to myself.

00:06:37.604 --> 00:06:41.116
I wouldn't want my peers
seeing that I was even or

00:06:41.116 --> 00:06:43.952
sometimes I wouldn't talk
to the teacher for fear of

00:06:43.952 --> 00:06:46.667
looking like you're
trying to be teacher's pet

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:48.237
or something and I think sometimes I would

00:06:48.237 --> 00:06:51.965
maybe overcompensate
in the other direction.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.535
I would say - I'm giving
a long meandering answer -

00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:58.338
I would say as a student, I was

00:06:58.338 --> 00:07:00.471
definitely intellectually curious.

00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:02.678
I definitely liked to ponder things.

00:07:02.678 --> 00:07:05.699
I did not like to be
given; I didn't like to

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.488
paint by numbers I guess is
the simple way to do it and

00:07:08.488 --> 00:07:13.807
I oftentimes butted heads
with parts of the school

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:16.806
system that wanted you to paint by numbers

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:18.539
and wanted you to move lock-step

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.698
with everyone else and wanted you to

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:24.448
just accept things
without questioning them.

00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:27.667
Yes, sometimes that led to some issues.

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:31.950
Number three; could you
tell us about any one

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.700
experience or epiphany
that you may have had

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.452
while growing up that shaped your attitude

00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:38.270
towards learning and teaching?

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.648
There's a bunch.

00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:49.407
I think one story is that
we tell often now because

00:07:49.407 --> 00:07:51.535
Shantanu now works at the Khan Academy,

00:07:51.535 --> 00:07:54.200
he's the president here.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.666
I first met him in 10th
grade at a math competition

00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:59.359
and we met in the finals
at the math competition.

00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:00.940
It was a district wide math competition.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.865
In the last round it was
me, Shantanu and there was

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:06.604
another boy and Shantuna
did beat me and so that was

00:08:06.604 --> 00:08:08.749
a good experience, a
humbling experience, but

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:11.269
above and beyond that
while we were competing,

00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:13.176
we actually had a little
bit of a conversation.

00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:15.658
It actually turned out
that even though we were

00:08:15.658 --> 00:08:16.748
both in the same grade, he was

00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:18.695
a math class ahead of me.

00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:21.069
I asked him, I was like
how does that happen?

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:22.426
He said, "Well, I just
tested out of the math class

00:08:22.426 --> 00:08:24.272
you're taking right now."

00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:25.604
For me, that was an
epiphany that one, that was

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:26.872
even a possibility.

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:29.966
I then went back to my high school and

00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:31.874
went back to the administration.

00:08:31.874 --> 00:08:32.840
I said, "Hey, can I test out of stuff?"

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.113
They're like, "Oh, we're not
aware of anything like that."

00:08:35.113 --> 00:08:38.436
What Shantanu did was he
awakened the possibility

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:39.734
that you can do that.

00:08:39.734 --> 00:08:41.874
It ended up being a lot
harder, not harder in terms

00:08:41.874 --> 00:08:43.810
of the subject matter
mastery, but a lot harder in

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.434
terms of convincing the
system that you should be

00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:47.693
allowed to test out of something and

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.970
once you prove that you know something,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.472
you should be allowed to
go on to the next thing.

00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:55.001
That gave me the energy
to do it and that really

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:57.767
did accelerate my own learning
and frankly that allowed

00:08:57.767 --> 00:08:59.402
me to have a lot of
those experiences that I

00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:01.275
just mentioned; someone like Dr. Santania.

00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:02.604
I would have never ended up taking partial

00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:04.146
differential equations at
the University of New Orleans

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:07.937
while in high school had I
not had that conversation

00:09:07.937 --> 00:09:11.208
with Shantanu that opened
my mind to the idea

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:14.904
that you really can, for
lack of a better word,

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:17.519
fight the system and go at your own pace.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:21.352
I think other learnings,
once I started taking classes

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:24.805
at the university even in
high school, university

00:09:24.805 --> 00:09:28.139
class attendance was
completely optional and I

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:30.608
sometimes I took advantage
of that and I realized

00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:34.267
that I did learn a lot
better from a book than

00:09:34.267 --> 00:09:35.545
oftentimes in a lecture.

00:09:35.545 --> 00:09:37.215
It wasn't that lectures
are fundamentally bad.

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:40.208
I mean here I am making
all these YouTube Videos.

00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:41.463
It's just that the book
allowed me to learn

00:09:41.463 --> 00:09:42.717
at my own pace.

00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:43.957
If I was confused by
something, I could read the

00:09:43.957 --> 00:09:45.975
same passage ten times.

00:09:45.975 --> 00:09:49.471
If I found something easy,
I could just skim something.

00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:52.601
In lecture, it was hard to stay engaged.

00:09:52.601 --> 00:09:55.339
I always found that I was
either lost or I was bored.

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:57.411
Very few times in a lecture that I was

00:09:57.411 --> 00:09:58.460
exactly at the right place,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.957
exactly connecting with
the pace of the class.

00:10:01.957 --> 00:10:05.116
At the Univeristy of New
Orleans, where I spent

00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:09.123
essentially my 11th and
12th grades in high school,

00:10:09.123 --> 00:10:13.059
I, to a large degree,
showed up for the exams

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:15.484
but did a lot of self-paced study and that

00:10:15.484 --> 00:10:18.676
carried with me when I
went to MIT is that I

00:10:18.676 --> 00:10:22.128
realized that class time
maybe it works for some,

00:10:22.128 --> 00:10:23.540
but didn't work a lot for me.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.294
I would have loved class
time that was interactive,

00:10:25.294 --> 00:10:26.631
that was hands on.

00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:27.958
I loved lab time.

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.740
In all my computer science
classes, I would skip

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.077
class and go to the
computer lab and work on my

00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:33.426
projects and I felt I was
learning the material much

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:37.915
better than sitting in a
300 person lecture hall

00:10:37.915 --> 00:10:39.466
and listening to a
lecture about something.

00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:41.793
It was much better to
fiddle with the thing.

00:10:41.793 --> 00:10:43.869
I think the ideal would
have been having videos

00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:46.997
on demand so that if I
was curious about a topic,

00:10:46.997 --> 00:10:48.495
I could get some videos, pause, repeat,

00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:51.266
watch them as much as I
need to, but then have all

00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:53.612
this extra time and
preferably with the rest of my

00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:56.412
peers and professor around so that I could

00:10:56.412 --> 00:10:58.803
actually fiddle with
stuff and build stuff.

00:10:58.803 --> 00:11:01.740
That's where I feel the
best learning happens.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.136
That's what we're trying to
do with the Khan Academy.

00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:08.030
We're trying to make class
time about interaction

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.204
and about fiddling and
about helping each other,

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:13.853
letting humans be humans and allow

00:11:13.853 --> 00:11:16.822
a lot of the core skills to
happen at someone's own pace

00:11:16.822 --> 00:11:20.140
through on demand video
and through exercise.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.872
I want to be clear.

00:11:20.872 --> 00:11:23.005
I said that I liked textbooks
a lot and I still like

00:11:23.005 --> 00:11:26.842
textbooks; I'm reading
many right now, but I think

00:11:26.842 --> 00:11:30.739
a combination of on demand
videos and exercises that

00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:33.646
give immediate feedback can be better

00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:36.945
for the purposes of self-paced learning.

00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:41.372
When I was 16 and I was
trying to chug through

00:11:41.372 --> 00:11:45.736
some type of an analysis book
or a partial differential

00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:49.346
equations book, it's dense
reading and you had to be

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:51.548
very persistent to read through that.

00:11:51.548 --> 00:11:54.868
I would have loved a ten
minute video on the exact

00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:56.947
topic that I was ready
for and I would have loved

00:11:56.947 --> 00:11:59.615
practice problems where
you don't just have every

00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:01.403
other answer at the back of the book.

00:12:01.403 --> 00:12:02.952
You have immediate
feedback; you know how to do

00:12:02.952 --> 00:12:04.365
the steps of that problem.

00:12:04.365 --> 00:12:06.202
You know what videos to
watch if you don't know

00:12:06.202 --> 00:12:08.200
how to do that problem and
the videos are not just

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.808
dry text; it's actually
someone trying to communicate

00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:13.228
intuition to you, trying to communicate

00:12:13.228 --> 00:12:15.017
not just the methodology but really

00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:18.069
the art of the mathematics or science.

00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:22.536
Question number four; what
excites you most about

00:12:22.536 --> 00:12:25.002
learning science?

00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:28.475
It really is that science
is all about really

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:31.369
trying to find the truth in the universe.

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:33.898
We'll never probably
know all the truth in the

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:36.202
universe, but I think
that's what separates humans

00:12:36.202 --> 00:12:38.953
from every other species
that we know is that

00:12:38.953 --> 00:12:42.203
we are just naturally
curious and we are naturally

00:12:42.203 --> 00:12:45.699
in awe of the mysteries of this universe.

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:51.075
Science is our best tool at trying to

00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:53.807
demystify the mysterious.

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.623
Frankly what is does is it
just introduces even more

00:12:55.623 --> 00:12:57.206
and even more profound mysteries

00:12:57.206 --> 00:12:59.474
the deeper and deeper you go into science.

00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:02.951
Just this journey of
working on the Khan Academy

00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.288
videos, I've gone so
much deeper in so many

00:13:05.288 --> 00:13:07.201
areas of science, but
it's given me so much more

00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:10.136
appreciation for how much
deeper the open questions

00:13:10.136 --> 00:13:16.953
are and so I think science,
when someone is really in

00:13:16.953 --> 00:13:24.695
science, it caters to that
part of the human instinct

00:13:24.695 --> 00:13:30.075
that gives you awe, that
you start to appreciate

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:31.953
where you are in the universe
and what the universe

00:13:31.953 --> 00:13:36.754
might be about or how
intertwined and elegant the

00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:39.792
universe that we're in actually is.

00:13:44.207 --> 00:13:46.575
It's just exciting.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:50.806
Question number five; as
a teacher who has impacted

00:13:50.806 --> 00:13:53.472
so many lives, do you
have any advice for our

00:13:53.472 --> 00:13:55.136
young readers who find
it hard to concentrate on

00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:59.333
their studies or perform well in exams?

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:02.841
Yes, my main advice is as much as you can,

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:05.364
try to ponder what you are learning.

00:14:05.364 --> 00:14:08.614
Don't just try to cram for an exam.

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.806
Don't try to memorize formulas.

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:13.202
If you feel that the formulas
you're looking at for

00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:16.139
your current class are just
beyond your understanding,

00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:17.953
then back up, look at what
you learned last year,

00:14:17.953 --> 00:14:19.203
the year before.

00:14:19.203 --> 00:14:20.619
Get to a point where
you can start to see why

00:14:20.619 --> 00:14:22.536
those things are intuitive
and hopefully you watch

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:25.073
Khan Academy videos and
that's what we try and do.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.011
Show you why these things are intuitive,

00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:30.261
why they aren't formulas to memorize.

00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:32.958
Once you start to ponder
things, you'll just start

00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.955
to ponder things all the time.

00:14:34.955 --> 00:14:37.669
My wife jokes that it often
takes me a half an hour

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:40.334
to throw out the trash
because I take out the trash

00:14:40.334 --> 00:14:42.248
and while I'm holding the
trash can, I sometimes am

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:44.866
just staring out at the
sky for like ten minutes

00:14:44.866 --> 00:14:47.119
because I'm pondering something.

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.608
This may be the most
fun thing to be doing is

00:14:48.608 --> 00:14:50.664
pondering something
and the more you ponder

00:14:50.664 --> 00:14:54.954
something, it gets your brain
just building connections.

00:14:54.954 --> 00:14:57.335
Then as you progress through more and more

00:14:57.335 --> 00:14:59.672
advanced courses, they'll
just start to seem

00:14:59.672 --> 00:15:01.000
more and more obvious.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.751
You'll almost say why
is this a new course.

00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.485
This is just a natural
by-product of what I had already

00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:10.100
pondered and frankly it will help you

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.612
not just in your academics.

00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:14.206
I think it will help you
be a more creative person.

00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:16.583
That's frankly what really,
really, really matters

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:19.649
is the ability to see
things where maybe other

00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:21.211
people aren't seeing things,

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:22.528
see better ways of doing things,

00:15:22.528 --> 00:15:23.875
seeing innovations, seeing connections

00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:25.539
that other people aren't seeing.

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:27.542
I would say ponder as much as you can,

00:15:27.542 --> 00:15:29.660
learn as deeply as you can,

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.415
make sure that your foundations are as

00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:37.669
strong as you can and after
that, if there is the mundane

00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:40.337
aspects and there are mundane
aspects of our current

00:15:40.337 --> 00:15:43.827
school systems and our
current exams, just view

00:15:43.827 --> 00:15:46.436
that as a game, as a
game that lets you get

00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:48.299
to the good stuff and
that's how I viewed it.

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:50.622
There are definitely
moments in my own education

00:15:50.622 --> 00:15:51.729
where I was like this is
silly, they're making me

00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:55.259
do this or that, but I
said I have to do this if I

00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:58.068
want to get to a point
where I get to do more

00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:00.663
pondering and I get to look
at the really cool stuff.

00:16:00.663 --> 00:16:06.252
Yes, I would say ponder
as much as you can,

00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:08.207
so that you can really
distill things to what's

00:16:08.207 --> 00:16:10.935
most important and then
the stuff that's still not

00:16:10.935 --> 00:16:15.677
fun after that, just
remind yourself it's a bit

00:16:15.677 --> 00:16:19.758
of a marathon and it's
going to get you to where

00:16:19.758 --> 00:16:21.754
you're going so that your
life will be more fun at

00:16:21.754 --> 00:16:24.322
some point and hopefully it's already

00:16:24.322 --> 00:16:26.902
a little fun right now.
