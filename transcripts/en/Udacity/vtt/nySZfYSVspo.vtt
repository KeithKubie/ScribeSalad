00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.630
The homework scores class may be useful for storing a single student's grades.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.265
And you can get useful information out of a single student's scores. But when

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.683
my friend Sarel was teaching math, that wasn't enough information for her. She

00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:16.831
wanted information about her teaching skills, as well as detailed summaries for

00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:21.462
the students. She wanted to know how well she had taught fractions. And how

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:25.412
well she taught equivalent fractions. And for that, she would need to compare

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:30.365
the data for all of the students for one topic. This is starting to look like a

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:34.666
2-D array. With this structure it would be possible to calculate the total for

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.946
a student. And also to calculate the total for a topic, which would allow her

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:43.550
to compute sums for each topic. And then compare them, to see which topics she

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.050
needed to spend more time on. Once that was done, she could write very

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.130
detailed, customized teacher comments for each student, by looking at what they

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.995
got in each topic, and choosing different sentences based on that grade. We're

00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:01.806
going to implement this together. I'm going to make a class. The GradeBook

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:05.991
class, which will contain a 2-D array, of all of the scores. It'll also

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:10.974
contain, the names of the students, and the names of the topics. Since you

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:13.769
probably don't want to enter these scores over and over again, I wrote a method

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:16.392
that will read the GradeBook scores, from the files, and put them into the

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.490
array for you.
