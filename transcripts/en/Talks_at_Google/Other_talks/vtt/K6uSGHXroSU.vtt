[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.420
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: Hello,
can everybody hear me?

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.197
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:14.280
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: Great.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
Good afternoon and welcome
to Talks at Google today.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.430
I want to say a special welcome
to all our external guests, who

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.290
made an effort to
come all the way here.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.170
I hope you have a
really good time.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
Today's talk is
particularly special to me,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.100
because for the first time ever
two employee resource groups

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.670
have come together to present
this talk in front of you.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.022
Gayglers and Allies
and Women at Google.

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:40.230
Big round of applause for
them for all the great work

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.855
they do for us.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.540
So today, we will
touch on a few things.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.330
One of them is resilience.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.050
Building resilience can be one
of the most difficult lessons

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.350
people learn in the formative
years of their career.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.020
The ability to
cope, bounce back,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.750
and the will to go
through adversity

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.400
is something that is
different for everyone.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.710
Some people exceed, some
manage, some simply fail.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.040
How can we develop a sense
of purpose for ourselves

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.370
and make sure that the workplace
at Google, or wherever you're

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.614
working, is a place
where you feel safe,

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:20.780
and you feel like that you
can be yourself and bring

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.270
your whole selves to work?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.040
Without further
ado, I would like

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.720
to introduce you to
our guest speaker

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.340
today, the CEO of Stonewall,
a nonprofit organization

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.730
in the UK, who are doing
some amazing work fighting

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.400
against homophobic bullying in
schools amongst other things.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.278
So give a warm
welcome to Ruth Hunt.

00:01:41.278 --> 00:01:50.869
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.160
RUTH HUNT: Thank you very much.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.390
And thank you for having
me here this afternoon.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.340
I am afraid I don't use
PowerPoint because I

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.360
think it's really dull.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.140
And I also don't
write long speeches.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.480
Mainly because I'm very
dyslexic, so reading

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.456
long speeches is impossible.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:08.080
And also because I
really like to panic

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.140
that the Stonewall comes to,
because they never quite know

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.790
what I'm going to say.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.440
And I treat every space as if
it's off record and informal.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.490
So I'm a very honest speaker.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.190
So I'm not even aware
that you're filming.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.960
But that means if I
speak in universities,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.767
I'm expected to
provide a content note,

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.350
because we now live
in a culture where

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.100
I have to warn people
about what I might say,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.100
which also makes it very
difficult for my style.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.850
Because who knows?

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.670
I'm going to talk a little
bit today about Stonewall's

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.030
history, the history of
the gay rights movement,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.510
and the trans movement,
and the lesbian movement,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.460
and the bisexual movement,
and how my career has kind of

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.280
dovetailed throughout all
that, and some of the things

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.640
I've learned along the way.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.620
And I hope that at
my stage in life--

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.067
I'm 37 at the moment--

00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:56.650
I've still got a
huge amount to learn.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.420
If you'll be forgiving
of the things

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.720
I don't know and kind of
see me for where I'm at.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.590
So Stonewall was set up in
1989, in response to Section 28.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.690
And Section 28 was a
piece of legislation

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.320
that prevented the promotion
of homosexuality in schools.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.290
It came at a time where
culturally Britain

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.870
was in quite a complex place
about sexual orientation.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.660
And I think it's
worth just pausing

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.570
and going back to what we've
been celebrating this week.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.190
Fifty years ago, gay men were
persecuted, actively imprisoned

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.360
for who they loved.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.659
And we talk a lot about love,
more on that in a moment.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.200
But actually for
what they were doing

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.330
quite a lot of the
time in toilets,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.630
but also for who they loved,
and were persecuted and told

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.700
that who they were was illegal.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.920
So there are
generations of older men

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.617
now, men who have sex
with men, gay men, who

00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:49.450
were told that what
they were was completely

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.060
illegal and unlawful.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.730
In around the 1970s,
what we were seeing

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.950
was that transgender
people were pretty much

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.940
able to fully transition
to their desired gender

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.680
without much fuss
from the state.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.500
So if you're rich enough,
if you're confident enough,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.000
you could pretty
much transition.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.250
That changed when
a woman attempted

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.247
to get a better settlement
for divorcing her husband,

00:04:12.247 --> 00:04:14.830
and the high court judge ruled
that their marriage was invalid

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.720
because she wasn't
really a woman.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.519
And thus, every
informal mechanism

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.150
that existed for trans
people faded away.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.480
In the 70s, things started
to seem to be changing.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.950
We had more civil
rights movements,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.910
more things happening.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.470
But then HIV hit.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.980
And what we saw was a
significant decimation

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.470
of the lesbian
and gay community.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.650
And men were dying,
absolutely just dying.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.660
And the state didn't respond.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.250
The state did not respond
to this absolutely national

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.510
traumatic event.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.030
And it was lesbians
running clinics

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.070
with gay men, who
were running clinics

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.450
for HIV positive from South
Africa, HIV positive women, HIV

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.080
drug dealers.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.480
You know, there was
a much greater sense

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.480
of a community and desperation.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.310
Section 28 then came in.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.822
So section 28 came in
when I was seven years old

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:06.655
and I was at school.

00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:10.630
And Section 28 was the
kind of third big bit

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.660
of rubbish to hit a
community that was already

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.850
feeling pretty rubbish.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.580
And I just give that
context, because that's quite

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.800
a hard core legacy.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.060
For any young LGBT kid growing
up, they know that legacy,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.860
they know that history.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.300
When I went to school, we didn't
talk about gay stuff at all.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.860
I realized I was different
when I was about 12,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.970
which is very young.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.860
It's even young in
these terms really.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.400
But I was always a tomboy.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.710
I was always different,
a bit other, a bit odd.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.050
I was never very cool.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.590
And never really fitted in.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.530
I didn't really, and I still
don't, like small talk.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.090
I find the banality of talking
unnecessary nonsense deeply

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.780
frustrating.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.863
That doesn't make me a
particularly good lobbyist,

00:05:57.863 --> 00:06:00.140
more on that later.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.270
So I was always a bit queer,
a bit different, a bit other.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.710
When I was 12, I
realized I was gay.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.830
And I went to Cardiff Library.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.130
I was brought up in Cardiff.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.120
And I read "The
Well of Loneliness,"

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.620
and "Orange is not
the only Fruit,"

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.770
because those are the two
books on the lesbian section.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.181
Now, if you know anything
about lesbian fiction,

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:22.680
"The Well of
Loneliness" and "Orange

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.060
is not the only Fruit,"
the single most depressing,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.850
soul destroying books
in the entire world--

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.910
they are really not top 10 tips
on how to meet a girlfriend

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.780
and kiss her.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.710
It's a bit more
hardcore than that.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.020
So "Well of Loneliness"
doesn't end well.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.120
"Orange is not the
only Fruit" gave me

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.250
a love of Jeanette
Winterson, and gave me

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.630
a language and a narrative of
how to do dating from 15 to 22,

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.910
that meant most of my
adolescent relationships

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.900
were really intense and full
of very, very good constructed

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.130
sentences, but not a lot of fun.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.260
So Cardiff was pretty harsh.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.860
And my parents were
desperately, desperately keen

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.650
that I didn't let myself down.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.320
So they had come from
nontraditional backgrounds.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.400
My mum had trained
to be a nurse at 18.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.380
Then she was a midwife.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.880
Then she did a PGCE.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.290
Then she did an MSC.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.110
Then she did her PhD when
the second child was coming.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.340
And then--

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.069
And so she was a teacher
in [INAUDIBLE],, and very,

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:22.360
very pleased to have got there.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.770
But if she'd had a
different education,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.000
she could have been a doctor.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.580
That was her whole,
and is her whole story.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.025
If she hadn't been one of five
children who was the girl,

00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:32.650
and made to bring up
her four brothers,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.970
she could have been a doctor.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.300
That was absolutely
how she saw it.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.290
And my dad-- and I
think that's true.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.306
And my dad dropped
out of school.

00:07:40.306 --> 00:07:41.680
And he trained to
be an architect

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.090
by working as a jobbing
lad in different shops.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.025
So they done good, and they
had money, not that much money,

00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:49.900
but they'd done good.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.500
But they did not want their
kids to in any way not

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.730
have the most opportunity.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.970
So me and my brother we just
had to work really, really hard.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.340
And it didn't really
matter what we did,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.380
as long as we
worked really hard.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.140
So when my parents learned
that I was different,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.220
and was coming out,
they were so frightened.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.840
They were so frightened
that I would experience

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.220
huge levels of discrimination.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.170
That I wouldn't get
into university.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.336
That I would struggle, that
I would really struggle.

00:08:16.336 --> 00:08:20.050
Their fear was absolutely
palpable and contagious.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.300
Section 28 didn't help that.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.710
The lack of visibility of
lesbian, gay, and bisexual,

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.100
and trans issues on
television didn't help that.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.530
The lack of employers
talking about these things

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.820
didn't help that.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.797
The fact that midwives
were being trained then

00:08:32.797 --> 00:08:34.630
and didn't even talk
about lesbian parenting

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.338
didn't help that.

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:38.919
That absence, even
if it was neutral,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.669
was deeply damaging to two
people who were just scared.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:49.780
And I, being assertive,
clear, teenager-ee

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.115
was just like, well, I am gay.

00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:52.240
Have you done anything gay?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.980
No, but I am.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.300
I read "Well of Loneliness."

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.970
So I was kind of
much more defiant

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.630
than I probably
should have been.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.350
And what I see now with
Stonewall's youth work

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.170
is they're much more relaxed
about where they might end up

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.870
on that journey.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.661
And I probably would
have been more relaxed

00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:10.840
had I been growing up now.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.184
So a real tension.

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:14.350
And Stonewall was kind of
just forming and Stonewall

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.960
in those days.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.480
It was a [INAUDIBLE]
organization,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.240
lobbying and campaigning.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.857
At 16, I moved to Birmingham.

00:09:20.857 --> 00:09:23.440
Now when you move to Birmingham
from a small Welsh school that

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.990
was mainly boys, and you
know that you're gay,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.280
Birmingham has the potential
to be quite a high risk taking

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.540
period in one's life, I think.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.960
And I really enjoyed Birmingham.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.520
I also started
writing for something

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.280
called "Diva Magazine," which
is a magazine for lesbians.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.260
And in those days, I
was getting 400 pounds

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.040
a month check sent to me.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.110
And that so much money
when I was basically on 15

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.897
quid a week, you know
paper round or something.

00:09:49.897 --> 00:09:51.730
So I was getting these
checks for 400 pounds

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.340
and putting it into my instant
savers Abbey National Bank

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.390
account.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.690
And my mom found it.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.740
She goes why-- she thought
I was dealing drugs,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.670
because I had all this money and
didn't have much to do with it.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.040
So I had this big blow
up with my parents,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.950
and my parents were like you
cannot, you cannot be gay.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.230
You cannot tell
anyone you're gay.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.200
They will really, really
have a problem with you.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.864
And I was in school, and
I'd been elected head girl,

00:10:15.864 --> 00:10:17.280
and the school
said, actually, you

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.880
can't be head girl because
we've got 11-year-olds here.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.980
And if they see that
you're head girl,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.950
they might think that your
decisions and choices you make

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.980
are the right ones.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.890
So we're going to make
you deputy head girl,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.510
because that's the party one.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.680
And, yeah, that seems
really reasonable to me.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.710
And all I could
hear is my mom going

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.300
this is going to get in
your way, get in your way.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:36.910
And I thought it is.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.868
It's getting in my way.

00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:41.290
I've got to be really
careful about this.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.459
And I did a speech at
school, school's speech day

00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:45.000
or something.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.870
And my mom was in the queue.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.703
And the woman in front
said to her daughter,

00:10:47.703 --> 00:10:48.930
Ruth was very good.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.910
She said yeah, she's gay though.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.640
Oh, it's a shame.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.440
And my mom absolutely
collapsed with anxiety,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.000
and love, and fierceness.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.170
And she didn't know what
to do with that stuff.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.720
And I feel it now.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.360
So she said you're not
going to get into Oxford.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.940
Whatever you do, don't
let them know you're gay--

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.190
and don't-- so I
got into Oxford,

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.130
but with that voice ringing in
my ear that I wouldn't be OK.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.910
Don't tell anyone.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.680
Now, you can't go
to Oxford and not

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.560
tell anyone you're gay, because
that would make you different,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.240
because most people
in Oxford are gay.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.419
So pretty much-- so I
came out straightaway,

00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:24.210
became president of
the junior common room,

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.376
and then was elected president
of the student union.

00:11:26.376 --> 00:11:29.610
So at that stage,
was really learning

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.320
how to develop a very strong
narrative about identity,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.460
a real awareness of how fear
gets in the way of you being

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.070
able to be yourself, but also
very aware of how utterly

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.030
privileged I was.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.040
I was smart, educated, white,
had good chat, could work hard,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.400
I knew all those things.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.820
But what I was very aware
of is how deeply unfair

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.670
it is that barriers are
created to people getting on

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.141
through fear, and
through discrimination,

00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:58.140
and through prejudice,
and through, and through,

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.740
and through, and through.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.132
And I'm a good campaigner.

00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:00.840
I'm a campaigner.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.220
That's what I learned at Oxford.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.920
I didn't learn how to translate
streets of Old English,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.030
I barely scraped my T1, but I
did learn I was a campaigner.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.640
And on that, when
I left university,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.610
I went and worked in
various different places,

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.270
finding my way.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.120
But at 25, when I was 25,
a job came up in Stonewall.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.510
So I started in Stonewall, baby
dike, number three haircut,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.220
20 Marlboro lights.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.170
And when I was-- as the
president of course,

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.680
student union president, I got
lots of calls from companies.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.240
We're really interested in you.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.880
I thought you're not.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.630
They never saw me.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.950
It was pre-internet days.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.120
I mean, they saw my CV,
but they didn't know--

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.130
I thought, if they
knew who I was.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.230
It was that voice of my
mother ringing in my ear,

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.880
you're not going to get on,
you're not going to get a job,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.250
they're not going to like
you, they're not going to--

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.370
I thought I can't work for the
big five or wherever they are.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.690
I can't do that.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.602
I am not going to be a good fit.

00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:52.060
I did a careers
test, and they said

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:52.800
you should go for the army.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.357
And I laughed, and
laughed, laughed.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.940
Now, actually, I'd have probably
been a good fit for the army.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.695
I mean, the stigmatism and
general day daydreamingness

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:00.570
wouldn't have helped.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.800
But I probably would--

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.880
I'm a good leader.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.890
You know, that might
have been a good option.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.098
Any of those companies could
have been a good option.

00:13:07.098 --> 00:13:09.850
But I ruled myself out, ruled
myself out, ruled myself out.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.990
So I started in Stonewall, baby
dike, 25 years old, 25 staff,

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.550
1.4 million at that time.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.400
And Stonewall was
assiduously campaigning for--

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.420
what's this counting
down-- oh, no, sorry--

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.520
Stonewall was assiduously
assimilationist.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.370
So Stonewall's campaigning.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.240
And we are really good at it.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.900
It was all about saying
gay people are normal,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.730
we're just like you.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.902
We want to pay taxes.

00:13:36.902 --> 00:13:37.860
We want to have babies.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.090
We want to get married.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.875
Look how sensible
and normal we are.

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:42.750
We're not going to talk
about sex in toilets.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.580
We're going to talk about love.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.980
We're not going to
talk about complex,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.560
messed up relationships
that everybody has.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.580
We're going to talk about good,
solid, monogamy, and good gays.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.080
We're going to talk
about nice gays.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.690
We're going to talk about
the gay men who not too camp.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.106
We're going to talk about the
women who are not too butch.

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:05.340
We're going to talk about the
really nice side of being gay.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.930
And that was the mission.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.510
The mission was in
every boardroom,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.050
in every institution, gay
people are just like you.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.427
And I really struggled a bit.

00:14:15.427 --> 00:14:16.260
You know, I really--

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.930
I softened up, I wore
blouses, my hair was longer.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.920
And I thought I'm not going
to get on here, actually.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.620
I can never be chief executive,
because the politicians

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.520
won't like me enough.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.590
I'm too, I'm too--

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.300
I'm not neat enough.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.220
So ruling myself out
even at that stage,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.440
in a place where I should
have been most comfortable.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.110
Now history will judge
whether Stonewall

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.560
was right to pursue this kind
of assiduously assimilationist

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.460
approach.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.650
We have the best
legislation in relation

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.780
to sexual orientation
in the world.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.524
And we got that
because while we were

00:14:48.524 --> 00:14:50.440
changing the law about
lesbians having babies,

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.250
they didn't notice.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.740
Because they just looked this
nice shiny thing over here.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.680
You know, the polite
courteous approach

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.160
has been really effective.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.170
And as a change agent, I totally
believe that the biggest power

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.500
influence, our employers.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.730
You know, when Barclays puts
MX on their credit cards

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.800
to acknowledge
non-binary identities,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.310
that is more powerful than
anything Stonewall can ever do.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.330
When Accenture
work in the Sudan,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.976
and talk about same
sex relationships,

00:15:17.976 --> 00:15:18.850
that's more powerful.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.240
You know, all these things,
these power agencies,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.010
these centers of power are
changing and falling away.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.720
Capitalism is changing.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.320
Social change is at the heart
of any capitalist state movement

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.130
right now.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.920
The need to work with
everyone, and be courteous,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.530
and work well, and match
them, and match their style

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.190
is essential.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.620
And I still do that.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.490
I can move in any
space, in any place.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.460
But what I had to learn when
I became chief executive,

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.019
is that actually we couldn't
leave people behind.

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:49.810
So I did seven different
jobs in Stonewall.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.990
And part of my narrative is I'm
very loyal to the institutions

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.950
I belong to.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.380
Oxford University is
absolutely my family.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.704
Stonewall is my family.

00:15:57.704 --> 00:15:59.620
Quite what I'm going to
do next, I don't know.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.960
But I know I will need
to belong to something.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.836
I will need to belong
to an organization that

00:16:03.836 --> 00:16:05.918
feels like that family,
because that's how I work.

00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:06.940
I can't dip in and out.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.070
I have to feel part of it.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:14.140
Six jobs-- Stonewall's now 120
staff and 7.5 million turnover.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.730
We take no core
government funding.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.140
We take a bit for projects.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.797
Very diverse income portfolios.

00:16:18.797 --> 00:16:20.380
So being chief
executive of Stonewall,

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.420
I have to be quite shrewd
businesswoman, to be honest.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.961
I have to understand
profit and loss.

00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:26.014
I have to understand
where income comes from,

00:16:26.014 --> 00:16:28.180
and how much we can spend,
and how much we can save.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.130
I have to understand all that.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.080
And then I have
to be a chief gay.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.570
And that kind of professional
gay role is quite hard.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.820
It's quite hard
to juxtapose that

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.340
with actually managing
a small enterprise,

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.450
with all the things
that come with that.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.642
And it's a big ask.

00:16:45.642 --> 00:16:47.350
And one of the things
that I was actually

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.260
committed to in 2014 when
I became chief executive

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.510
was quite major cultural change.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.760
I wanted us to be
able to do both.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.950
I wanted us to be able to
work with the Archbishop

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.060
of Canterbury.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.030
My three clients, Archbishop
of Canterbury, Premier League

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.220
footballers, and
security services.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.579
You know, my ability to
navigate in those three spaces

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.010
is absolutely crucial to
my ability to do my job.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.160
I want that.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.032
But I want the
queer non-binary kid

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.990
who's bullied because he
doesn't know what he's

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.630
doing to be part of that too.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.524
So I wanted trans people to
be involved in Stonewall.

00:17:19.524 --> 00:17:20.940
Much of our big
work at the moment

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.109
is around black, Asian,
and minority communities

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.506
coming into Stonewall.

00:17:24.506 --> 00:17:25.880
I want people who
are left behind

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.310
to feel part of Stonewall.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.977
And that require a
significant cultural change.

00:17:29.977 --> 00:17:31.810
And that's where the
stuff got scary for me.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.440
That's where I suddenly
stopped coasting, and was like,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.110
OK, now I'm a little
bit out of my depth.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.550
How do you do
culture change when

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.190
you've been part of an
institution for that long,

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.785
when you've learned to
another CEO for that long?

00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:45.660
How do you challenge?

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.999
So this is what I've learned.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.540
I've learned that people emulate
the style of leadership they

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.420
deem to be successful and
they generally do it badly.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.080
The whole issue of
inclusion is about people

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.410
trying to be something that
they're not all the time.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.767
Diversity is something
that people obsess about.

00:18:01.767 --> 00:18:03.100
They talk a lot about diversity.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.080
Diversity should
be your outcome.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.580
So even in an
organization where you

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.000
have a Benetton advert of staff,
if they are all desperately

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.795
trying to please me, and
act like I want them to act,

00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:16.036
their different
experience is irrelevant.

00:18:16.036 --> 00:18:17.410
So the first thing
I had to do is

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:21.220
give up power and stop being
a bit of an idiot around that.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.625
I had to actively bring people
in a room who annoyed me.

00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.860
The second thing I
learned, most people

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.930
only like to work with
people who think like them.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.740
It is deeply frustrating
to work with someone

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.489
who doesn't think like you,
who thinks differently,

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.780
who doesn't get it quite as
fast as you'd like them to,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.650
who doesn't keep
up with you, who

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.858
doesn't blow smoke up your
ass in the most polite way

00:18:40.858 --> 00:18:41.680
possible.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.431
It is really difficult.

00:18:43.431 --> 00:18:45.430
And I see the army, when
I worked with the army,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.580
they are working--

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.487
they've been six weeks in a
tin can with two other people.

00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:52.570
Of course when there's a
call to go to war in Iraq

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.890
they're going to get
those two people that

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.467
were in a tin can within six
weeks and only talk to them,

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:59.050
and ignore the trans woman over
there, going, I don't actually

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.940
think Iraq can fire
bombs that fast.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.690
No, no one?

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.040
OK, bye.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.910
We like to draw people
around us who think like us.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.880
We like to recruit
people who think like us.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.130
And what I realized is what
we were doing at Stonewall

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.920
is recruiting in a way that
said look how diverse we are,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.980
but then making them assimilate
into our way of working,

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:23.500
make them think, act, and
work as the Stonewall way.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.834
So I had to throw all that away.

00:19:24.834 --> 00:19:26.041
I had to throw all that away.

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.430
I had to do a big
culture change.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:28.660
I had to get rid
of lots of staff

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.535
without leaving blood
on the floor, which is,

00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:33.330
a bit difficult. All
under scrutiny of a public

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.840
who were going well, we're not
ready for a lesbian running

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.130
Stonewall, are we?

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.200
And who does she think she is?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.095
And she's not very sociable.

00:19:41.095 --> 00:19:42.590
And she doesn't drink.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.572
And actually it's gay men
that paid for Stonewall.

00:19:45.572 --> 00:19:47.030
Who the hell does
she think she is?

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.077
And that level of scrutiny
is pretty relentless.

00:19:51.077 --> 00:19:53.410
When you are being held to
account on every social media

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.691
platform for everything
you might think or do,

00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:58.690
and you're trying to do
a culture change, that's

00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.980
pretty hardcore.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.470
So that combination--
I was young.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.060
34, I was too young to be
doing some of this stuff,

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.120
even though I had
all the chatter.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.210
That is quite hardcore.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.140
So how did I do it?

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.890
Well, personally, I
had to really change

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.480
how I thought about things.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.120
I had to accept the things
I wasn't so good at.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.220
I had to accept that I
needed people around me who

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.770
disagreed with me and
actively make those steps.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.664
And I had to accept
that sometimes I

00:20:23.664 --> 00:20:26.080
would get things wrong and how
was I going to handle that.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.670
And I had to make
time for myself.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.490
So I made sure I had all
the things around me,

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.510
the staff around me.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.970
The things I did wrong, I
hired people, wrong people,

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.720
too quickly.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.180
I should have taken longer,
and hired the right people,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.860
and relaxed a bit about it.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.360
But I had to role
model the behavior

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.890
I wanted to see in
Stonewall, which

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.140
means I lead the work on
[INAUDIBLE] inclusion.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.240
I lead the work on
trans inclusion.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.700
And I make sure that at
every available opportunity

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.410
I'm reiterating our vision,
mission, and values.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.890
So we've got to a stage is
an organization where we

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.165
feel much richer as a culture.

00:20:57.165 --> 00:20:58.540
But when I look
at organizations,

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.190
when I go into
organizations, Stonewall

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.660
works with 750
employers, 2,000 schools.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.660
We're out there.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.030
We're doing lots of things.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.270
That chat about
diversity is so dull.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.550
Here's our gay member of
staff, he's really happy.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.730
It's all going really well.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.520
We are fundamentally a
meritocratic organization,

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.050
and therefore we don't
need to worry about this.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.620
So what I just want to finish
on is a note about meritocracy.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.720
Meritocracy is an
absolute fallacy.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.480
There is no such
thing as meritocracy.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.310
Because meritocracy
presumes that people

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.360
have the same starting
chance in life.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.560
And nobody has the same
starting chance in life.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.880
My ability to do my job was
of course helped by the fact

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.200
that I had slightly bonkers
parents, albeit bonkers,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.430
who did love me and
wanted me to do very well,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.650
who gave me a desk
at the age of two

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.080
so I could do my homework,
who made sure I had books

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.960
around me, who, even though
they were a little bit

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.850
tonto at times,
wanted me to do well.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.260
You compare that to a kid
who doesn't have that,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.600
and has no income, and
no access to resources,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.920
and gets to the
same place as me,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.730
double their salary immediately.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.430
Because the lengths they've
gone to get to the same place

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.000
as me should tell you more
about their potential than what

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.860
I am telling you.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.480
We don't do that.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.540
We don't recognize that people
come from different places

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.190
to reach the same place.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.410
And therefore, when we recruit,
we pretend that we are blind.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.500
We don't care if you're
blue, pink, gay, straight,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.083
green, yellow, we just want you
to be the best damn programmer

00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:30.400
in the world.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.790
Without realizing that actually
what you're talking about

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.250
is not leveling the playing
field and not creating a space.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.690
So the best employers
are starting

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.190
talking about potential.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.710
And if I look at MI5, MI5
five looked around the room

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.392
and went maybe all these
men in white chinos

00:22:44.392 --> 00:22:45.850
with their modern
languages degrees

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.808
aren't going to help us
solve Muslim terrorism.

00:22:47.808 --> 00:22:51.430
It's like no, no they're not.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.410
But the thing is you
employ more Muslims,

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.540
it's all a bit more
difficult, because, yes,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.340
you have to change.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.550
If you want to change
how your staff think,

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.092
work, act, and feel, it is not
about putting another chair

00:23:02.092 --> 00:23:02.800
around the table.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.920
You have to redesign the table.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.100
You have to create new
ways, and new opportunities,

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.630
and new ways of working.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.980
And I adore Google.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.440
But you think you're
so marvelous, my loves.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.900
You really do think
that you are the dogs

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.520
bollocks in this regard.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.430
And you do not know how many
people are ruling themselves

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.480
out of working with you, how
many people presume that they

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.960
will not succeed and do well
with you, how many people are

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.380
just thinking that you have to
be a certain type, all be it

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.520
a particularly interesting
kooky type, yes.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.550
You will not continue
to succeed if you do not

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.490
start thinking differently about
how you bring the people who

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.340
live less than a mile
away into this building

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.230
to be part of what
you're trying to achieve.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.230
Unless you put social change
at the heart of your mission,

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.700
you will very quickly find
that this is becoming outdated.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.890
So that's what I've
learned in my life.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.400
And the last three years
have been pretty hardcore.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.300
I'm immensely proud of
the team at Stonewall.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.070
I'm immensely proud
of what we do.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.960
50% growth in three
years is something

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.100
I'm very pleased with.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.790
And I hope that we will continue
to do marvelous things with you

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.610
and others.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:08.758
Thank you very much.

00:24:08.758 --> 00:24:09.754
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.660
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY:
Thank you, Ruth.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.570
That was very, very good.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:31.206
So, OK, it's my first
time, so bear with me.

00:24:31.206 --> 00:24:33.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.530
Thank you.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.545
So now onto the next
phase of today's event.

00:24:41.545 --> 00:24:44.560
And I would like to
invite Liz Cunningham, who

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.990
is director of finance
here at Google,

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.930
and Mick Hodgins, who
is director of solutions

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.220
and innovations at Google.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.170
And just a note
to everyone, there

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.700
will be time for questions
and answers at the end.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.660
So get those questions ready.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.377
Great, so, welcome everyone.

00:25:07.377 --> 00:25:08.460
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: Thank you.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.160
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: Please--

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.493
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: Thank you, Ruth.

00:25:10.493 --> 00:25:12.234
MICK HODGINS: Hi,
Ruth that was great.

00:25:12.234 --> 00:25:13.650
I'd just like to,
before we start,

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.566
to point out that I
wasn't quite the diversity

00:25:15.566 --> 00:25:17.610
hire from within a mile.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:18.600
Maybe two miles.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.266
RUTH HUNT: Good.

00:25:22.047 --> 00:25:23.130
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: Great.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.050
I heard this really great quote.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.280
I thought it was great.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.320
It was from Verna Myers,
who was a TED X speaker.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.820
She said diversity is
being invited to a party,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.250
and inclusion is
being asked to dance.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.930
So that made me think that
they really go hand in hand.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.590
So maybe, Liz, you can
tell us a little bit more

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.330
about what diversity
and inclusion mean

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.540
for you and your org.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.820
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: Yes, I actually
look after the tax team,

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.860
so we're probably one of the
least diverse organizations,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.290
because it's actually all women.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.370
We sent the one male
we had off to the US.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.080
So I'm very passionate
about inclusion.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.610
And that's where my
passion really lies.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:10.720
And inclusion for me
is just making sure

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.110
that you're listening to
everybody's perspective.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.520
I look around the team
and broader finance

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.380
regularly to make
sure that we're

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.890
listening to everybody's voice.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.096
And I've some good
examples, which

00:26:24.096 --> 00:26:25.720
I think we'll get
onto later, but where

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.610
my voice wasn't heard At times.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.350
And for me, that's
what inclusion is.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.000
It doesn't matter what
your background is.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.420
And I'd encourage people
in the room and managers

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.470
to make sure that they are
really conscious, that they're

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.610
listening to
everybody in the team,

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.120
because everybody's
voice is very important.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.500
I picked up a quote
that Ruth gave.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.452
The need to work with
everyone is essential.

00:26:47.452 --> 00:26:49.410
I'd add to that, the need
to listen to everyone

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.050
is essential, making sure that
everybody's voice is heard.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.480
That to me, is critical in
the diversity and inclusion

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.080
conversation.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.420
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: And,
Mick, same question to you.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.850
What about in your org?

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.180
How does it implement?

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.970
MICK HODGINS: Yeah,
look, for me, I think,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.500
we've got lots of
different people in my org,

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.560
and that's great.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.180
So different people,
different backgrounds,

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.220
different cultures, different
perspectives, that's diversity.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.660
I think we've got a
really diverse team.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.730
I think when you think
about inclusion, inclusion

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.850
for me is about respect.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.370
It's about creating a
culture, environment,

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:29.420
forum for people to
contribute an idea,

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.650
an opinion, whatever
that looks like.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:36.230
But it's also about recognizing
that people's opinions will

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.055
be very different to yours,
and that's sort of OK,

00:27:39.055 --> 00:27:42.380
and creating that space
for a healthy debate,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.930
and for a healthy sense of
collective responsibility.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.140
And I think that's really
important in the context

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.750
of if you don't
get to know people,

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.560
and you don't create that type
of environment, where people

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.955
feel sort of safe, then you can
really, really be inclusive.

00:27:58.955 --> 00:28:01.580
And it's critical
for us as a business.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.410
You talked about it earlier on.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.440
If we don't drive the
inclusion agenda--

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.390
diversity is an
outcome, I agree.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.370
If we don't draw the inclusion
agenda we're going to fail.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:16.420
And it's being proven in
millions of different studies

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.570
that diverse and inclusive
teams just get better results

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.890
for businesses.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.840
And you bring a
different perspective,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.180
you make it a little
bit richer, and then

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.300
you get better results.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.216
It's a really, really
straightforward equation

00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:28.716
for me.

00:28:28.716 --> 00:28:31.049
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: And Ruth,
you mentioned in your talk

00:28:31.049 --> 00:28:33.400
that sometimes the
conversation around diversity

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.350
can come across as a bit dull.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.590
And I think everyone here
wants to do their bit,

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.750
and wants to get involved,
but sometimes life happens.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.900
So what would be your
advice as to how can

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.870
we develop that well
from within to help out

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:47.846
and do the right thing.

00:28:47.846 --> 00:28:50.470
RUTH HUNT: I think your quote at
the beginning was interesting.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.710
So diversity is inviting
people, inclusion

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:53.710
is asking them to dance.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.440
I think probably the next
stage of that is letting

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.902
people host their own parties.

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.110
You know, there's a kind of--

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.750
inviting back people
to dance is one thing.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.960
Letting black people have
a party is quite another.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.630
So I think it is about
changing our way of seeing.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.150
And it is about
cultural and values.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.790
And I think that
once people realize

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.940
that they are complicit
in creating the barriers,

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.687
then that will
naturally fade away.

00:29:17.687 --> 00:29:19.270
The problem with
diversity is that you

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.896
get told a list of
things you can't do.

00:29:20.896 --> 00:29:23.269
I'm sure Google was never
approached about this, promise.

00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:25.439
But particularly in the
public sector, you know,

00:29:25.439 --> 00:29:27.730
every police officer, do not
say this, do not say that,

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.605
do not say the other.

00:29:28.605 --> 00:29:30.790
And that doesn't
change how they respond

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.370
when they see a Muslim woman
who's experienced a hate

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.650
crime to think differently
about how they're going

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.180
to have that conversation.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.100
I think, to talk about
my mom for a moment

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.540
again, because she's on my mind
at the moment, when she came

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.207
round to the idea, and read
everything I'd ever written,

00:29:46.207 --> 00:29:48.040
she was the dean of
nursing in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.404
And she started every
new year by saying turn

00:29:50.404 --> 00:29:51.820
to the person next
to you, they'll

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.750
be your friend for life.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.120
You may marry them or you may
enter a civil partnership.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.950
Cardiff University is fully
committed to LGBT inclusion.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.450
We're part of the
Stonewall program.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.240
That's all she'd ever do.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.187
And it just sent a very clear
signal to every undergraduate

00:30:05.187 --> 00:30:07.270
that she wouldn't tolerate
homophobia on her watch

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:07.970
and that was OK.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.770
And they all came out
as a result of that.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.400
So these little
moments of indicating

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.739
your ally-ship, your
commitment, can actually

00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:18.280
start making people feel more
comfortable in the environment.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.655
I think the more people worry
about what they mustn't do,

00:30:20.655 --> 00:30:21.910
the more frozen we become.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.326
And we have something called
kind eyes at Stonewall, which

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:26.170
is presume people
are basically good,

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.494
and then help them along
the way to be better.

00:30:28.494 --> 00:30:30.410
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: We
have something similar,

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.950
which is assume good intent.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:37.536
Similar to that, and I think you
made a really good point there,

00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:39.910
everybody kind of needs to
just think about these things.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.020
And it's really good to see
Mick our Liz joining us today.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.040
You are both directors.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.990
I'm sure you have
really busy schedules.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.620
So what advice would you give to
people who want to get involved

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.120
but just can't find the time?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.636
How does it work
for both of you?

00:30:54.636 --> 00:30:56.350
MICK HODGINS: You
just got to make time.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.860
Look, again, I sort of echo what
Ruth is saying in one sense,

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.220
that the more that
it becomes a pain,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.860
the more that we've got
to do something about it.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.200
So we can be vocal, and
we can give our support.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.050
Or we can just really just get
on with it and get involved.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.710
And we've got so many
different ways to get involved.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.430
And down the years
in Google, we've

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.590
had so many programs that
have been successful.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.954
We've run the Stretch Program,
Women Us, Take the Stage.

00:31:22.954 --> 00:31:24.370
We've got all of
the stuff that we

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.101
do in Pride, senior citizens.

00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.350
I'm going to give you a
shameless plug now by the way.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.730
So the one thing that we're
working on at the moment,

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.120
as many of you might be aware
of, is Project Doorstep.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.120
So you've heard me
stand on this stage

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.230
before and tell that
it's great to live

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.540
in this beautiful Google bubble.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.850
And it's lovely to be in silicon
docs, and this is amazing.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.910
And the business
is going forward.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.020
And we're creating an ecosystem
here that's going forward.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.570
And some of the most socially
disadvantaged parts of Dublin

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.540
are within one mile
of this building.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.740
Really crazy stuff.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.320
Like we have a resource
center down the road

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.440
that provides free services
on a volunteer basis

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.280
under one roof to
the local community,

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.840
including a creche
for unmarried mothers,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.690
and drug rehabilitation
clinic, a job seeking clinic

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.160
to try to get young men and
young women back to work.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.190
You name it, it's all
there under one roof.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.200
And we never really
engage with those guys.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.760
That's shameful, shameful.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.310
So in March, we
launched a program

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.740
to engage with our
local neighbors,

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.720
because our
responsibility-- you use

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.300
this language with yourself--
our responsibility is

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.390
to ensure that as the whole
community moves forward,

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.320
nobody gets left behind.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.560
We are part of this community,
inclusion is really important.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.950
So we started in
March, 1st of May.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.905
We went down to a
community parade

00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:52.910
down in Ringsend and Irishtown.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.380
We marched around the streets.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.191
We hung out, beautiful
summer's day.

00:32:56.191 --> 00:32:58.690
Actually, it was probably the
only day of summer in Ireland.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.560
And the weather was fantastic.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.020
We volunteered, kids,
bouncy castles, great fun.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.770
And [INAUDIBLE] from
the [INAUDIBLE] team,

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:07.460
she may be here, she
might not be here--

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.320
oh, there you are.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.260
[INAUDIBLE] is running the
senior citizens monthly program

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.850
in the org at the moment.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:17.329
The first one was basically
described as this crazy disco.

00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:18.620
But everybody had a bit of fun.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.850
No agenda.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.800
Just come in and let's
hang out with you.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.110
And it's cooking up a storm.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.380
Next week, we've got a thing
called the South Docs festival.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.150
We've got about 15 or 20
different events happening

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.640
within a couple of
miles of the building.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.070
So right here in
this auditorium,

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.700
we're going to have a
local kids talent show.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.100
Bring your earplugs, right?

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.110
We're going to do walking tours.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.010
We've got a fair in the square.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.460
There's loads of stuff.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.860
That for me is how
you get involved.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.150
It's not a chore.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.140
It's just part of what we do.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.410
It's not an agenda.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.660
And by the way, if you want
to volunteer, go/doorstep.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.255
Forward

00:33:56.255 --> 00:33:58.130
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: I've
already volunteered.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.505
I'm really looking
forward to it.

00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:01.796
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: I just wanted
to add one point to that.

00:34:01.796 --> 00:34:03.950
I think they're all
brilliant initiatives, Mick,

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.200
and I'd encourage everybody
to get involved with them.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.404
I think, particularly the
space people may struggle with,

00:34:10.404 --> 00:34:11.570
how they can have an impact.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.199
So we had our finance
directors and VPs offsite,

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.110
and we had a talk from
the finance BGN group.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:22.610
And they were so
passionate about not

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.920
being afraid to get involved.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.940
So people are
concerned in the space

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.170
about doing the wrong thing.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.810
And it's so easy to say, well,
I'd rather not make a mistake,

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:32.630
and so I'm not going
to get involved.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.860
And they were so encouraging
of the VP and director

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.210
group that were there to--

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.230
it's OK to make a mistake.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.510
It's OK.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:42.710
Even dipping your toe in.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.251
So while all these initiatives
are great, Mick, and I really,

00:34:45.251 --> 00:34:47.360
really encourage
people to get involved,

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.320
just look within your own team,
and wider team, your neighbors

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.880
around you, and see where you
can even make one small impact,

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.470
and not to worry about
doing the wrong thing.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.670
Because doing something
means that you're

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.840
making a difference.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.760
So that would be
my word of advice.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.080
RUTH HUNT: And Stonewall
wouldn't have achieved anything

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.120
if we berated everybody every
time someone did something

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:08.620
wrong.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.922
We'd be in the wrong business.

00:35:09.922 --> 00:35:12.380
You know, the Premier League,
sometimes those conversations

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.559
we have, I do have to
go home and go-- what?

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:17.934
And the Church of
England, I mean

00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:19.850
it's similar, similar
conversations.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.430
And you just kind of
have to really just

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.390
be kind to each other, really.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.180
But see that you have power.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.160
You have power to
change the dynamic,

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.369
and that's what it's
all about really.

00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:33.410
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: You
mentioned about mistakes,

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:37.430
and I'm pretty sure that we
are having this conversation,

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.170
the awareness is
starting to happen.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.090
We were chatting about
it at lunch as well,

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:44.990
using the right pronoun, or
saying the appropriate thing.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:49.010
Have any of you ever made
a mistake in a workplace

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.220
where you said the wrong
term, or you weren't sure?

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.980
And if you did, what
lesson did you learn?

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.170
And how would you tell
others to deal with that?

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:02.100
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: I
never make mistakes.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.290
MICK HODGINS: I try to
work out what a pronoun is.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.130
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: That
was a hard question.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.690
RUTH HUNT: Yes,
I've made mistakes.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.130
Stonewall has 120 staff.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:15.955
I'm 37.

00:36:15.955 --> 00:36:18.330
That means I'm probably about
twice as old as most people

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.800
there, because we
obviously don't pay enough.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.560
So there's lots
and lots of staff

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.330
who are constantly
exploring identity

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.150
in ways that has not even have
made it onto your internet.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.890
So there's all sorts
of things happening.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.410
And the odds of me getting
that right every single time

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.600
are pretty slim.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.920
Non-binary pronouns
are quite complex.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.760
So for somebody who wants
to get by they add them,

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.920
that confuses my
grammatical lexicon.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.272
But that doesn't
mean it's not hard

00:36:44.272 --> 00:36:45.480
for me to get my head around.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.650
I just needed to think
about it for a bit longer,

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:50.010
and go, OK, that works.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:50.950
Where are they going?

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.900
Where have they gone?

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.160
When are they coming back?

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.110
Is as straightforward
as when is she going?

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.250
and where is he going?

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.860
But people are very forgiving
if your intentions are good.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.200
That's why Stonewall has
a philosophy of kind eyes.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.636
And I think the more panic--

00:37:04.636 --> 00:37:06.010
I've just read a
really good book

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.040
called, "Why I Stopped Talking
to White People About Racism".

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.990
And it really
explores-- read it.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.740
It's really slim.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.120
You can do it really quickly.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.700
It really talks a lot about
how white people respond

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.150
really guiltily every time
they're racist in some way.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.509
And it makes it all about them.

00:37:20.509 --> 00:37:22.300
And actually, for
someone who's non-binary,

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.820
they don't want it to be all
about you, and your feelings,

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.920
and your anxiety, and
what you've done wrong,

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.753
and how that makes you
feel, and whether you

00:37:28.753 --> 00:37:31.120
need to go to HR about it.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.020
Just apologize and move on.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:33.940
And I think that's--

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.710
don't keep doing it.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:36.510
Be mindful.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.700
But if you get it wrong,
just apologize and move on.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.160
MICK HODGINS: Yeah, I agree.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.500
Anyone who's in
this audience who

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.975
works with me knows
that sometimes when

00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:51.100
you're really, really busy,
you go from one meeting

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.280
to another meeting--

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.300
I only talked about this
recently and people I work

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.440
with have coined
this phrase as drive

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.240
by meetings, where you
arrive in, ask a question,

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.450
answer it yourself, move
on, job done, right?

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.120
And I did a lot of this.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.940
And I'm very personally aware of
how I'm trying to change that.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:15.280
So I get it wrong all the
time, I absolutely assure you.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.780
But I think the
most important thing

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.210
is that we're all human beings.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.010
I've got a life
outside of Google.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.150
I've got two kids.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.150
Things can be stressful.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.965
We have crazy jobs.

00:38:25.965 --> 00:38:27.340
And you're going
to get it wrong.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.630
You're going to mess it up.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.490
You're going to make mistakes.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:31.900
But I think as
Ruth said, you got

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.900
to acknowledge it and put it
right as quickly as you can.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.870
However, you cannot be a
slave to political correctness

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:38.960
and putting it right.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.190
That's when it becomes
a real pain in the ass

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.180
and you turn it into
something that it's not.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.250
RUTH HUNT: And it
makes no difference.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:45.640
It doesn't change culture.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.880
And it doesn't help.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.300
So it just kind of
reduces all of us.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.520
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: And you
mentioned as well in your

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.000
or the majority is women.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.790
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: All women.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.900
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: I spent two
years working in engineering,

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:05.190
or hiring for them, and as
all of you probably are aware,

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:08.380
women are a minority in
the engineering world.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.960
So you also mentioned that you
have been part of a minority

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.410
group, whether it be your
gender, sexual orientation,

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:16.290
ethnicity.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.902
How was that experience, and
would you like to share it?

00:39:19.902 --> 00:39:22.110
LIZ CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, so
women make great tax people.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.380
That's why we've--

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.180
I see some of my team
here, so shout out to them.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.890
I don't experience it often.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.660
Or if I do, I sort of--

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.170
we've got a very
technical background.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:40.230
And I always revert back to my
core job and my core training.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.430
So that makes it easy.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.190
So I kind of go I'm here
not because I'm a woman

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.870
or whatever, I'm here
because I'm here to do a job.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.190
But I wanted to share
one example of where--

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.350
and I think it goes to
your previous question--

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.654
where I made a mistake.

00:39:54.654 --> 00:39:56.070
And I made a mistake
about myself.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.840
I was on the advanced
leadership lab directors.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.850
You've done that,
Mick, haven't you?

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:06.540
So we do this scavenger
hunt, but it's

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.590
run by a team who trained Nasa,
so it's a serious scavenger

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:11.370
hunt.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:14.760
And I was the only
woman in the group.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.500
And it was at a time when Google
was buying a lot of companies.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.710
So there was a lot of CEOs from
companies that we had acquired,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.050
and a lot of engineers, and
a couple of sales people.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.132
And I don't know, I
was in a funny space

00:40:29.132 --> 00:40:30.840
because there was
stuff going on at home.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.950
I had to organize--

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.584
I don't know if any, for you
in the audience have children,

00:40:34.584 --> 00:40:36.000
but you know those
Christmas boxes

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.977
they do for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:39.435
So I forgot about
the Christmas box

00:40:39.435 --> 00:40:41.060
and my husband was
in a bit of a panic,

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.587
and I said look, just go and
grab like some of her stuff

00:40:44.587 --> 00:40:45.170
and put it in.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.300
She's not going to notice.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.820
She has too much stuff already.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.820
So some poor child got a lot
of my child's second-hand stuff

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.675
for Christmas.

00:40:51.675 --> 00:40:52.694
But anyway, it's fine.

00:40:52.694 --> 00:40:54.360
So I was in that kind
of funny mind set,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.859
I didn't listen to
the instructions.

00:40:55.859 --> 00:40:57.300
I was sort of in a funny mood.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.770
But anyway, to cut
a long story short,

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.690
I literally set myself
up at the bag carrier.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.690
So everybody had their role.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.724
So I took the very traditional
female role of well,

00:41:06.724 --> 00:41:08.640
I'll carry the bag, like
literally, physically

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.940
carry the bag.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.480
And so with had these really
complicated clues to work out.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.111
And I just didn't do anything
for the first couple of clues.

00:41:16.111 --> 00:41:17.860
And then eventually I
was like, these guys

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.340
actually have no clue
what they're doing.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.880
So one guy was [INAUDIBLE],, one
guy was doing something else.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.430
And it was all about their
roles and their jobs.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.920
And they were very, very--
and not offending any men

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.250
in the audience, but they were
very clear about their role.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.590
I made the mistake of
going well, I just work--

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.170
I just take whatever
they don't take.

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.060
And so I really let myself down.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.920
And so, eventually,
because I've got

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.310
quite a technical
background, I worked out

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.507
that I was actually
working out the clues.

00:41:46.507 --> 00:41:48.090
And so there was one
particular clue--

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.631
and I was so frustrated, because
one of the rules of the game

00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:52.192
was you had to stay together.

00:41:52.192 --> 00:41:54.150
And I was like, I am not
following those idiots

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.840
up that hill.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.152
I am sorry, I'm done.

00:41:57.152 --> 00:41:59.610
So I did a time out with the
facilitator, and I said, look,

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.070
can you somehow intervene here.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.660
I said, OK, I'll intervene
in this particular case.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.030
And so they said, look, Liz
is right, you guys are wrong.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:10.380
And the clue's across the water.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.330
So we worked out the clue.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.680
Then four or five clues.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.890
And eventually, I became the
sort of the clue worker-outer,

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.720
or whatever.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.940
So we won the thing, and we high
fived, and it was all amazing.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.020
And the facilitator turned
round and said to the guys

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.050
why did it take you so
long to listen to Liz?

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:37.170
And they were like, well,
we had to wait and see

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.210
how many clues she worked out.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:43.650
And then when she worked so
many, we listened to her.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.300
Now, my reaction to
that was, oh, my gosh.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.520
And they felt really bad.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.610
They were really torn, and they
said they realized that they

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.825
weren't-- they learned that
maybe they weren't listening

00:42:53.825 --> 00:42:55.200
to their team,
and in particular,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.680
listening to the
women on their team.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.840
Now my immediate reaction was--

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.620
I'm not a great listener--

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.161
I was like crap, I'm probably
not listening to people either.

00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:03.840
And now I know what it
feels like to have to--

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.280
taken so long to be listened to.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.752
So there's so many
lessons in that.

00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:09.460
I'm not sure I'm
answering your question.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.330
But I wanted to make sure to
get that example out there.

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:15.170
I let myself down as well.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.240
So I'm not saying that
those men singled me out.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.150
I think part of the problem
was I set myself up as well.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.420
I didn't think I was worthy
of having a role on that team,

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.270
for whatever reason, whatever
bias was going on in my head.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.160
I definitely
contributed to that.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:33.890
So anyway that was my
director leadership lab story.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.760
MICK HODGINS: That was great.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.740
Note to self, on
the next course,

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.500
find the gay community to
sort out the scavenger hunt.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.817
I've been lucky
enough, I've worked

00:43:45.817 --> 00:43:48.870
in lots of different countries
during the years, worked

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.590
at different organizations.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.680
Before I joined Google, I
worked for a wines and spirits

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.790
business, a large multinational.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:00.310
I spent a bit of time down
in South Africa in Cape Town.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.700
So I joined what was
a pretty early phase

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:09.600
business, and 100% white male.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.850
All of them Afrikaans.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.570
They would speak Afrikaans
first and English second.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.350
It gets better.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:19.230
Many of them had fought together
in the South African defense

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:22.624
forces in the Angolan
war in the 1980s.

00:44:22.624 --> 00:44:24.540
They would barbecue
together and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.130
and hang out together.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:29.980
And then this Irish guy, who
was like early to mid-20s,

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.060
arrived down to help
them with their strategy

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.620
and show them how to
grow their business.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:40.250
So that just didn't really
work out at the start.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:44.400
I was a novelty for
maybe about eight weeks.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.070
There were a lot of,
look, the Irish guy.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.510
His skin is pale
blue type of jokes.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:51.570
And many potato comments.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.865
And you're in the situation
where you sort of laugh it off.

00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:57.240
But you're thinking, Christ,
this is just not good enough

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.530
for us.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.030
It was really,
really uncomfortable.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:03.780
I would go to social events with
them, and after a few beers,

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.859
they would go back into
their native language.

00:45:05.859 --> 00:45:07.150
And they'd speak for two hours.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.877
And I'd just be
on the periphery.

00:45:09.877 --> 00:45:11.460
And every time that
there was a laugh,

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.215
you'd sort of feel
the laugh, because you

00:45:13.215 --> 00:45:15.090
didn't know whether or
not they were actually

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.830
cracking a joke about you
or laughing about you.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.020
So that was really
tough, and not cool.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.295
I learned a lot from
that experience.

00:45:22.295 --> 00:45:24.420
I think the way I sort of
dealt with that over time

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.690
though was to try and just
get to know people as people,

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.650
and always have your voice
heard, whether or not

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.990
it's in that meeting or
that group environment,

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.704
or whether you can
find a way to get

00:45:35.704 --> 00:45:36.870
your voice heard afterwards.

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.900
Just always make sure
they respect you.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.190
And then the novelty wore off.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.780
They moved on to
different things.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.917
Men like shiny stuff, you
know we're very simple beings.

00:45:46.917 --> 00:45:49.250
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: I believe
at some point in our lives

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:52.400
we've all been part of a
majority or minority group.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.410
And when we are in
the majority group,

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.870
it is our responsibility
to advocate on

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.820
behalf of those who are
not in the majority.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.960
So thank you so much for
sharing your examples.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.020
Ruth, one question that I
would have is obviously,

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.570
as somebody who you said
you are a campaigner,

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.270
and you've done some really
good campaigning for the LGBT

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:14.900
plus issues, I heard at
Pride this year-- obviously,

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.010
I've been going for the
last three years-- really,

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.060
really good fun, and just
really great to be out there.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.620
Some of the feedback
that I heard

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:26.480
was that the LGBT plus community
wasn't very happy about how

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.930
the straight people were
taking over and just showing

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:30.690
their presence.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.560
So I mean, just from
your point of view,

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.752
is that a valid thing to say?

00:46:35.752 --> 00:46:37.460
RUTH HUNT: No, and to
be honest, as we're

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.140
in this confidential space,
the concern about Pride

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.650
is more than that.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.420
So what's happening
with pride is

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.990
that lots and lots
of corporates turn up

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.630
to Pride who've never
done any active LGBT work.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:54.260
So they hire a van that
cost 30,000 pounds.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:58.100
They put 200 people on that
bus who got drunk on champagne,

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.590
quite openly, while the
community groups can barely

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:03.080
afford to send their
youth group along.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.750
And it seems like such
a tone deaf PR disaster,

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.900
I don't really understand
why they're struggling.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.200
Other groups, other companies
who march, who literally walk,

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.640
go down fine.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.000
Or if you want to go on a
bus, give over half your bus

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.940
to a community group.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.840
In my mind, I think
it's quite simple.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.950
So what the community is
talking about in terms

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:23.910
of straight people come
into Pride is about that.

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:27.256
It's about people
coming on a bus.

00:47:27.256 --> 00:47:28.880
It used to be the
fact that used to get

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.640
shouted and spatted at at
Pride by straight people.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.980
So now the fact that there
are straight people marching

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.740
and celebrating is great.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:39.050
We sponsor UK Black Pride,
which is the next day,

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.980
that has a budget of 7-1/2
grand to the 750,000 of Pride

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.710
in London, and really struggles.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:51.000
And the way in which
organizations and companies

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.260
work with UK Black Pride,
Pride for LGBT people of color

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.400
is really indicative.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.719
So there's a lot going on,
on lots of different issues.

00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:00.510
But in Stonewall's
view, there are far more

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.490
heterosexual people than LGBT.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:05.540
Number two, two pints, and
we're all on a journey.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.189
And the more people
you can get involved--

00:48:08.189 --> 00:48:10.230
the more people you can
get involved, the better,

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.950
to my mind.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:14.330
And that's always been
how Stonewall's worked.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:16.216
Can I just share
a story my sexism?

00:48:16.216 --> 00:48:17.590
I know we're
running out of time.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.140
So when I took
over as chief exec,

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.500
we had this moment where the
chair, the treasurer, who's

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.080
on our board, and my MD
and me were all women.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.140
And I said on the board we're
a women's lead organization.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.830
And one of the men on the
board was so concerned about

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.880
that I had to write a
full paper scrutinizing

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.020
our approach to recruitment, why
I was not demonstrating gender

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.810
bias in any of my
recruitment or restructuring,

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.640
how I was going to
ensure that men felt

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.240
able to be themselves
and welcome

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.974
in this new matriarchal
dominant organization

00:48:49.974 --> 00:48:53.820
and give myself
targets around that.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.950
I had to do this full scrutiny.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:59.610
We'd been a male lead
organization for 15 years.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.440
I had two weeks of a
handover where it was women.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.514
And it absolutely--
it really saddened me.

00:49:07.514 --> 00:49:09.180
And it really frustrated
me, considering

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.910
the amount of sexism
I was getting in the--

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:14.910
I just thought this is
your moment, trustees,

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.440
to shut up and back up.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.590
And instead actually you've held
me to account about something

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.220
that is meaningless.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.350
So there we are.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:23.100
That's off record.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:23.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.350
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: Thank you,
thank you so much for sharing.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:26.070
MICK HODGINS: Not anymore.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:26.986
RUTH HUNT: No, I know.

00:49:26.986 --> 00:49:27.890
Just--

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:28.590
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY:
Things are changing.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.189
Change is what makes
us better, right?

00:49:30.189 --> 00:49:31.230
RUTH HUNT: Yeah, exactly.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.730
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY:
So, I would like

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.160
to open it to the audience
for some questions.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.920
So please raise your hand and
wait for the mic to get to you.

00:49:41.807 --> 00:49:43.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, can you hear me?

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.440
Great.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.110
You talked about the
fallacy of meritocracy,

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.670
and I think here at Google,
while hopefully we're

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:53.380
very much ahead of
a lot of companies,

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.270
otherwise the world
is in deep trouble,

00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:00.380
we are still deeply
flawed in that sense.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.360
So you mentioned that
that is a problem.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.980
But what could be the solution?

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.550
What is the fair way
to evaluate people?

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.640
RUTH HUNT: I think there's macro
and micro responses to that.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.890
The macro responses to that
are about actually getting

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.410
into your local schools
and helping them improve,

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.837
and helping kids who may not
have those circumstances do

00:50:17.837 --> 00:50:20.170
better, so that when they get
to your recruitment stage,

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:21.753
they're on a more
level playing field.

00:50:21.753 --> 00:50:23.740
So there's a kind of
macro issue there.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.770
Looking at degree
programs, entrances,

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:27.520
making sure that there's
more scholarships

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.470
available for young people
going into university.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.219
Because we've adopted
an American approach

00:50:31.219 --> 00:50:33.280
to higher education,
without any of the packages

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.540
around that to manage that.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.810
It's a kind of messed up system.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:39.460
I think in terms
of recruitment, it

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.680
is about measuring
potential as well as skills.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.230
It's about one on
one interviews,

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:46.510
repeated, rather than a panel.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.450
Because panels always reinforce
each other's unconscious bias,

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.700
unconscious bias, continually.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.920
One on one conversations
make people

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.650
more likely to talk
about their feelings

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.180
and how they're
going to perform.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.510
But also, it is about
more internal recognition

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.000
that there is
potential in people.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.600
So what I often see
in organizations

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.308
is that the majority
of [INAUDIBLE] staff

00:51:06.308 --> 00:51:08.380
are entry level
posts, secretarial,

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.740
or administrative roles.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.670
And nobody ever talks to
them about the possibility

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.230
of maybe doing
some in-house work,

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:15.940
and moving on to something else.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.982
I remember talking to
someone yesterday who said,

00:51:17.982 --> 00:51:20.189
I don't even know what her
educational background is.

00:51:20.189 --> 00:51:21.700
It's like, well
you don't need to.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.116
She's been a really good
assistant to your team.

00:51:24.116 --> 00:51:25.990
Let's find a way of
actually bringing her in.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:28.720
We typecast people
really easily.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.610
And in something
as big as Google,

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.587
there is enough room to
actually think differently.

00:51:33.587 --> 00:51:35.170
So at Stonewall,
we've actively worked

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.960
with our [INAUDIBLE] staff who
are in more junior positions

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.450
and sent them on more
specific training courses,

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:42.555
but also made sure
they can shadow me.

00:51:42.555 --> 00:51:44.680
So they've been shadowing
me for a couple of weeks,

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.554
getting access to my
inbox, things like that.

00:51:46.554 --> 00:51:49.750
So really just breaking
down some of those rules

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:55.049
around some of those things can
be a big help as a sure answer.

00:51:55.049 --> 00:51:57.090
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: I saw
some hands in the back.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.260
Do you mind throwing it?

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.730
We all saw the health
and safety video.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.910
AUDIENCE: Actually, I'll
give it to Philip first.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:12.410
AUDIENCE: Hi, Ruth, thank you
very much for coming in today.

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:14.400
It was a fantastic talk.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.070
My question is
specifically about what

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:21.630
is increasingly seeming to
become the silent B in LGBT,

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.100
which is bisexuality.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.920
So it's obviously quite a hard
thing to represent in media,

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.500
and it's a relatively
hard thing to discuss

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.880
in corporate environments,
because any corporation sort of

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.329
wants boxes to put people in.

00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:35.870
And it's much easier
to have straight

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.190
and gay than bisexuality.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:39.930
How do we overcome
that as a challenge

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.910
and make sure that
we're putting people,

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.730
if we have to categorize
them, on a scale,

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:46.590
rather than just in a box.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:48.450
RUTH HUNT: So I think
it is that difference

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:51.180
between scale and a
box is hard for people

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.010
who are new to the journey.

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:56.850
Stonewall has done bi-only role
model programs, run bi people.

00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.190
So we're developing
quite a critical mass

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.960
of people who identify
as bisexual who

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.120
work for corporations, including
men, which is really exciting.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.750
So some of our old bi stuff
was very female dominated

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.120
and heavy, for lots
of different reasons.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.070
But more men are
getting involved now.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.070
I do think-- Stonewall changed
its tagline from the lesbian

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.380
and gay charity,
under my predecessor,

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.570
to acceptance without exception.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.859
So I don't really talk about
words at all like lesbian, gay,

00:53:21.859 --> 00:53:22.650
bisexual, and tran.

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:24.608
It's all about where are
you at on your journey

00:53:24.608 --> 00:53:25.530
and let's accept you.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.307
I think that the media really
struggle in terms of bi phobia.

00:53:28.307 --> 00:53:30.390
And I think that there's
a lot to be done in terms

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:31.830
of challenging bi phobia.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.080
All our data points show
that bi people experience

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.380
greater incidence of poor
mental health and well-being,

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.640
compared to lesbian and gay men.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.840
And corporations have been doing
this work for a long time well.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.180
Gay men are the most
satisfied group,

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.970
according to monitoring terms,
compared to any other group.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.030
And you test it all
down, and then bisexuals

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:51.030
are at the bottom of it.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:54.270
So more bi specific events,
more bi specific conversations,

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:57.120
more bi role models, encouraging
people to tell their stories

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.400
and their experiences
is really important.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.900
Because young people
are very rarely

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.820
identifying as either
lesbian and gay now.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.430
All our youth work--

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.035
I'm a bit old fashioned for
being a standard lesbian.

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.270
So your new recruitment
drive is going

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:16.200
to be much more bi centered
than lesbian and gay centered.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.630
So that is going to have to
just shift in time as well.

00:54:21.149 --> 00:54:22.440
MICK HODGINS: Food for thought.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.685
Just looking to see
where our HR and hiring

00:54:24.685 --> 00:54:25.810
people are in the audience.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:26.480
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's not me.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.521
MICK HODGINS: It's
real food for thought.

00:54:28.521 --> 00:54:30.770
AUDIENCE: Ruth, what's one
thing we could all do today

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.770
and when we leave to make sure
we don't leave others behind?

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.430
RUTH HUNT: So find three
people with less power than you

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.000
and go and share.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.210
Because by being in this
room, you have more power.

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.490
By working for Google,
you have more power.

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:44.720
Go and volunteer.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.890
Go and ask somebody.

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.470
Go and find three junior
people in this organization who

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.230
are feeling a bit lost and
mentor them, and show up,

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:53.210
and make yourself
available to help them.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.160
Everybody thinks about
themselves in relation

00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.480
to the things that are
going less well for them.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.181
I think if you start
looking beyond,

00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:00.180
that's really important.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:03.980
So I mentor two young
women who are refugees,

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.870
who live in Bethnal
Green, who are just

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:07.002
trying to do their GCSEs.

00:55:07.002 --> 00:55:08.710
And I meet them once
a month and we talk.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:11.690
And I tell them to go along to
meetings at their local labor

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:12.710
party and get involved.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:13.460
It doesn't matter.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.552
People need to know
the rules of how

00:55:15.552 --> 00:55:16.760
to get involved in something.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.250
People exclude themselves
based on not knowing the rules.

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.750
And I think if you
share your power,

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.150
you can do amazing things.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:24.321
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:26.570
MICK HODGINS: And that fear
is-- just too add to that,

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.241
that fear is illusory.

00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:29.990
It's just totally the
fear of the unknown.

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.470
RUTH HUNT: Exactly.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:31.980
MICK HODGINS: So if you don't go
and dip your toe in the water,

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:32.840
you just-- you're
never going to know.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.090
RUTH HUNT: You need some help.

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:37.280
You need someone to hold your
hand through that sometimes.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.961
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY: Do we have
time for one more question

00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:40.460
perhaps?

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.100
This question in the back there.

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:56:00.900
So I just have a quick question
related to all how can we do

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.960
things that are-- like how
do we behave when we have

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.130
conversations with people who
think completely different,

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.290
who are not so open
minded, who don't--

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.660
because we all come from
different countries and places,

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.060
and it's all great that
we think that we're so

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.250
open minded and Google and
a bunch of other companies.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:22.740
But when we go back home or
and we have this really--

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:26.850
and we talk about what we
talk about here, or like all

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:30.360
the events we
have, and how do we

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.120
have those hard conversations
when people just start

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:37.580
making fun of these things, and
just make jokes, in societies

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.230
where things are
not open minded,

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:44.430
and 80% of the population
against all these things?

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.260
RUTH HUNT: So I was
in Poland last week.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.290
And I don't talk about
the multi nature gender

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:54.720
identity and the
inclusion of FUCO

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.520
and people's changing
sense of life.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.220
I talk about human rights,
and I talk about hate crime,

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.240
and I talk about wasted
talent and potential.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.600
So to a certain extent,
it is about working

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.040
with people where they're at.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.520
I mean, Premier League, I
don't mention bisexual identity

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.520
with the Premier League.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.541
I talk about gay footballers
being scared about scoring.

00:57:11.541 --> 00:57:14.040
It is a little bit about making
sure you match your audience

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.166
and then taking it through.

00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:16.915
A lot of the work we're
doing at Stonewall

00:57:16.915 --> 00:57:19.260
is working with Diaspora,
from some of those countries,

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:22.050
and bringing them together, and
helping them talk about some

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:25.320
of the ways in which they can
develop new conversations.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.710
So bringing 36 gay and
straight people from Russia

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:30.522
into a room, who
now live in Britain,

00:57:30.522 --> 00:57:31.980
is really helping
those people kind

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.370
of talk about these things.

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:35.370
We did some great work
with teenage girls

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:37.500
from evangelical
Pentecostal communities,

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.850
who are just awesome.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:40.170
They're just amazing.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:45.390
So really kind of thinking about
what level of empathy exists.

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:47.940
So we've just come
from Armenia, where

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:50.970
we've worked with women's
groups on employment rights.

00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:52.680
And then they talk
about LGBT rights.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.545
But we've gone in
talking about gender.

00:57:54.545 --> 00:57:56.670
We've not talked about
sexual orientation or gender

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:57.960
identity at all.

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:02.220
So going at the level that
we're at and accepting that,

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.600
and just doing the best we can.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:08.450
Because the last thing that
helps is British and European

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:12.169
imperialistic lecturing
to other communities.

00:58:12.169 --> 00:58:14.460
And the trouble I have with
the conservative government

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:16.815
in Britain is that we're
going on to other countries,

00:58:16.815 --> 00:58:18.270
going we're really good at this.

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.740
It's like well 20 years
ago, you were rubbish.

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.080
And it would be more helpful
if you talked about the fact

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.788
that you were a bit
rubbish 20 years ago,

00:58:23.788 --> 00:58:25.710
and how you've made that
change, to pretending

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:27.000
that you've got
something to patronize

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.041
these black people about.

00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:30.870
So it's kind of really
understanding our role in that,

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.192
I think.

00:58:32.192 --> 00:58:34.056
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:34.056 --> 00:58:35.430
ANAM AKHTAR TREACY:
All right, so

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:39.260
thank you so much to all of
you for joining us today.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.350
I learned a lot of things.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.900
Lots of great quotes as
well, and a motivation

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.080
to do a little bit more
and help this cause.

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.640
Thanks everyone for joining us.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.070
And a big round of applause
for all our panelists.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:53.720
[APPLAUSE]
