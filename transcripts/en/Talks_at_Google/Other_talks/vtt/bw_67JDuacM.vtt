00:00:04.311 --> 00:00:07.580
ALAN EUSTACE: So hello everyone,
I'm Alan Eustace,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.220
and I have the great pleasure
of introducing Arlene Blum,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.710
who will talk about her new
book "Breaking Trail." You

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.580
know, it's a big pleasure
for me.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.090
I was telling her the highest
peak I've ever climbed is

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.050
14,500 feet or something like
that, but I read her book very

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.160
early on, and it was very
inspirational on Annapurna,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.780
and I like several
things about it.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.740
Later, I found out that
Annapurna is the hardest and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.560
most difficult of all the 8,000
meter peaks, but the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.820
other thing was inspirational
was the fact that it was an

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.460
all women's expedition.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.780
And I felt like it really
showed both the planning

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.440
ability, the creative genius,
the athletic ability, the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.800
sense of adventure that I
thought was kind of--

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.990
there weren't married many role
models in mountaineering

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.630
for women, so I was really,
really happy to see it.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.670
And also, I thought the book
gave a prospective.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.100
Women writing books, I think,
bring a different passion.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.270
It's less conquering, and it's
more communing with nature in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.740
ways that I think are really
good, and it showed both the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.770
tragedy and the triumph that's
involved in mountaineering.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.400
Later, when we talked earlier, I
found out that she obviously

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.500
likes challenges that are
practically impossible,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.440
because she also spends time, as
you'll hear today, working

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.260
on legislation to protect people
from the environment,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.090
and you'll hear a lot
about that today.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.260
And I think I her definition
was, in many ways it's even

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.610
more challenging, because it's
a fight against the chemical

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.150
industry, and billions of
dollars, and trying to find

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.320
ways to actually protect people,
costs them less money,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.450
and make them more
safe overall.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.400
So with that, I'd like
to introduce Arlene.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.560
Thank you very much
for coming.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.110
Oh, let me say one other
thing on this book.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.340
I looked on Amazon.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.730
This book has 41 reviews.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.120
Of those 41 reviews, 37 are five
stars, the maximum, and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.420
three are four stars.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.990
It is probably the highest rated
book I have ever seen,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.540
and the reviews are amazing.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.600
And I already bought mine, I
just want to let you know.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.750
This is the first author that
I've ever paid money for their

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.630
book, so I want you
to know that.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.880
ARLENE BLUM: And if you
ever need a job as

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.130
my marketing manager.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.150
And actually, the mountain that
he talked about, even

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.570
though it's 14,000 feet, North
Palisade is one of the more

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.010
challenging and beautiful
mountains I've ever climbed,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.960
so being 14,000 feet can still
be quite an accomplishment, so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.490
I recommend North Palisade
right, good mountain.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.300
So as we said today, I'm going
to talk about mountains and

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.640
molecules, and you
might end up--

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.780
we'll see at the end.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.925
How many people here came to
learn about mountains?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.215
How many came to learn
about molecules?

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:13.920
Oh, OK, a lot of molecules
people here, that's good.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.050
So my career of both mountains
and molecules began in my

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.600
freshman chemistry lab
at Reed College, and

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.470
this is in the '60s.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.350
My professor was a 23 year old
woman with a PhD In chemistry

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.390
from MIT, and you can imagine
that was pretty

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.940
unusual in the '60s.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.380
She thought chemistry was the
coolest subject on the planet,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.230
and there were four girls in my
freshman chemistry class,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.990
and we all got PhD's in
chemistry, which says

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.800
something about the importance
of role models.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400
My lab partner was a very
handsome young man from

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.220
Portland, Oregon, and we studied
chemistry till late

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.400
one starry night, and
he said, do you want

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.040
to climb Mount Hood.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.080
Well, I was from Chicago.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.600
I'd never done anything physical
in my life, had been

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.790
raised by an overprotective
family where I wasn't even

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.190
allowed to ride horses,
but he was very

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.760
handsome, so I said sure.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.710
And so we drove up to Timberline
Lodge, he put a big

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.010
pack on my back, and
we started up,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.980
and I started gasping.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.730
He said he didn't think I was
going to make it out of the

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.540
parking lot, because I was
gasping so loudly, but he was

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.850
very handsome, so
I persevered.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.765
And when the sun rose, I was in
the most beautiful place I

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:30.810
had ever been, high above the
clouds, and I fell in love

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.050
with him, and with mountain
climbing, and with chemistry,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.500
and kept doing mountain climbing
and chemistry until I

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.890
was a grad student
at UC Berkeley.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.640
And I just passed my qualifying
exams, and wanted

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.280
to go on an adventure, and one
of my lab partners said,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.160
there's an expedition to Denali
and I'm going to go.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.260
Do you want to go?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.170
And I said, great, when
I pass my qualifying

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.970
exams I'll go to Denali.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.820
And I wrote for the information
and it said women

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.130
can go on a Denali trip at a
reduced price, as far as base

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.360
camp, to help with
the cooking.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.760
So I called the guy who is
leading the trip and I said, I

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.600
want to go to Deanli, but
I want to climb it.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.830
And he said, women aren't
physically strong enough or

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.950
emotionally stable enough to
climb mountains like Denali.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.520
And I said, I was climbing with
my friends from Reed in

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.670
Peru, and we climbed higher
than Denali in the Andes.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.820
And he said, were you
the only woman.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.120
And I said, yeah.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.140
And he said, did you really do
your share of the leading.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.150
And I said, no, I probably
didn't, but I thought I

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.050
participated.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.140
And he said, you are probably
just carried up the mountain.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.540
So I realized as long as I
climbed with all guys, and in

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.730
those days most of the climbers
were guys, people,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.650
and maybe even me, would
question had I done my share.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.590
So I thought, I wonder if we
can organize an all women's

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.170
team to Deanli, and that was
a very revolutionary

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.050
idea back in 1970.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.590
So we organized the Denali
Damsels, and here we are on

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.150
the mountain.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.710
And nowadays, people carry their
loads on the low slopes

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.760
on sleds where they pull them,
but we hadn't thought of that

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.450
back then, and to climb Denali
you need about 200 pounds of

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.220
food and gear, 30
days of food.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.930
And so the reason people thought
women couldn't do it

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.910
is because they thought
women couldn't carry--

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.540
you saw that big pack
we're carrying--

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.720
but we could, and we headed
up the mountain.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.030
It was a beautiful place.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.040
We got up to our high camp.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.390
I was the deputy leader.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.280
I'd organize the trip.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.090
I was 25 at the time, but the
leader was a 50 year old woman

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.270
who was one of Alaska's
leading climbers.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.540
But most of the peaks in Alaska
aren't very high, and

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.000
it turned out she had an
altitude problem, so she was

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.420
really strong up to about 14,000
feet, but she didn't do

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.060
very well above 14, and
Denali is 20,000.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.630
So we're at the high camp
here at 17,000 feet.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.290
It's summit morning, she has a
headache, she hadn't actually

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.300
been carrying her load.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.280
She'd been feeling really badly,
and I said, Grace,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.880
maybe you shouldn't try for
the summit when you have a

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.630
migraine and you
feel terrible.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.070
But she was really determined,
and so we headed up.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.485
She was going slowly, but
it was a gorgeous day.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.000
We reached the summit-- she's
the person slumped down to the

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.790
right of the flag.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.040
She wasn't eating, drinking.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.420
We weren't so happy.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.850
We were very happy, because we
hadn't even know if women

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.700
could climb Denali.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.680
Every step of the way it was
like, can we actually do this,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.290
and we did it.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.450
We were on the top, but we
saw thick clouds coming.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.570
We heard a big Arctic storm
was forecast, and she was

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.700
really ill, and so we sort of
supported her down a little

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.990
way below the summit, she
collapsed unconscious.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.310
And I was now the expedition
leader at age 25, with six

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.030
people, an Arctic storm coming
in, and a unconscious person

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.910
near the summit of Denali.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.090
So we put her in a sleeping
bag with a

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.900
pack frame as a structure.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.670
We wrapped a climbing
rope around.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.370
We kind of made a stretcher, and
we hauled and lowered her

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.080
down the mountain.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.100
And I think you can see the
place where the summit is, the

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.475
place where grace collapsed, and
then we hauled and lowered

00:08:18.475 --> 00:08:22.370
her down that slope to where
it says bivvy site.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.100
I can't quite see in the back.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.350
And then another woman and I
stayed up with her on the

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.320
bivvy site watching the clouds
massing, this big

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.520
storm coming in.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.710
It was getting dark, and I'll
always remember that moment,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.860
thinking if the storm comes,
what do we do.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.334
Do we stay here?

00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:42.010
Do we leave her?

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:47.050
It was a horrible moment, and
then fortunately she got a

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.080
little bit better, and we were
able to get her down the

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.410
mountain before the storm really
hit, and we're down now

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.340
at 14,000 feet.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.600
You can see the amount of snow
on our snow shoes, and we were

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.290
going out every three hours to
shovel the snow off the tent,

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.580
but I was a different person.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.130
That happening gave me so
much more self esteem.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.510
If you read "Breaking Trail"
you'll see I had a really

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.010
tough childhood where I was
always said pretty negative

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.720
messages, and really never felt
very good about myself,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.460
and I do remember a long time
ago though, sitting in that

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.190
tent thinking, I'm not
such a bad person.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.710
I got Grace down alive.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.570
We climbed Denali.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.490
I'm actually OK.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.990
And it really gave me a lot of
confidence to have had such a

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.450
challenge, and to be
able to have gotten

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.690
her down the mountain.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.180
So by the time we flew out, I
felt like I'd gone from being

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.040
a 25 year old girl from Chicago
who climbed some

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.310
mountains, to a woman who could
lead expeditions, and

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.190
dream up impossible things.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.560
So my next big adventure
happened when I was back at

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.230
grad school, hard at work
not writing my thesis.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.835
Has anybody engaged in
such an activity?

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.660
So I went to the movies, North
Side Theater if any of you

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.610
know it, Berkeley, and "The
Endless Summer" was playing.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.010
It was the Beach Boys going
around the world with big surf

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.730
boards looking for the perfect
wave, and I watched them and I

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.660
thought, when I got my PhD I
want to go around the world

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.990
and find the perfect mountain.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.000
So I told my adviser, who
thought this would not be good

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.050
for my career as a chemist,
and I said, don't worry.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.160
I was studying a molecule
called Transfer RNA.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.660
I said, I'll make a flag that
says tRNA, and I'll fly it on

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.340
all the summits.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.000
I'll think about my research.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.320
So we planed to climb
in Europe for

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.140
a summer, in Africa.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.300
By going up and down across
the equator, we could have

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.740
five climbing seasons in 15
months, so it was Europe,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.280
Africa, Asia, Australia, New
Zealand, back to being a

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.350
chemist for the rest of my
life, one adventure.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.990
So I'll go quickly.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.260
We missed Europe, because my
thesis was late, but we

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.050
started in Ethiopia where we
climbed, in the background,

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.690
the highest peak Ras Dashen,
which is 15,000 feet.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.820
And then we went to these
mountains, the Rwenzori.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.140
Would you believe you're
looking at

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.900
Uganda and the Congo?

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.160
They're on the equator on the
Congo-Uganda border, and

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.510
they're the source
of the Nile.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.360
Ptolemy said a long time ago,
the Nile came from snowy

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.930
mountains on the equator.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.440
And the weather is so bad there
that nobody hardly knew

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.730
they existed, and we actually
climbed about all the peaks in

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.830
the Rwenzori.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.090
Here I am on the summit at
17,000 feet on the equator,

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.660
and you see my flag says tRNA.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.180
I was thinking about
my research.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.880
This is Mount Kenya, which is
about a five eight rock climb,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.090
about 18,000 feet.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.460
Kilimanjaro--

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.450
I have now a unique slide that
I've only shown a few

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:54.700
audiences, but I actually a
couple months ago gave the big

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.230
lecture for the American Alpine
Club dinner in New

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.560
York, and at the lecture was a
guy I had met on Kilimanjaro

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.290
that I hadn't seen since
Kilimanjaro.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:08.020
This was 1972, and at that
time we said no money.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.510
We were poor students doing this
on no money, carrying our

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.310
own packs up Kilimanjaro.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.440
He was part of a guided party,
and the day we climbed

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.910
Kilimanjaro it was snowing, and
the guided parties went to

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.000
the crater rim and turned back,
but we didn't have a

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.380
guide so we walked around the
crater rim to the real summit.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.060
Anybody climbed Kilimanjaro
here?

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.840
Yeah, so right there's a couple
miles, I think, you

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.430
walk up high where you hit the
crater to the high point.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.780
But anyway, when we were going
by, I don't know how this

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.530
happened, but I said something
like, I think I'm going to sun

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.550
bathe in my bikini
on this summit.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.240
And he said, I'll give you
$10 for a picture.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.650
Well that was a lot of money
for us in those days, so I

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.420
hadn't seen this guy since 1972,
but there he was at the

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.160
Alpine Club dinner, and I was
able to squirrel through all

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.080
my slides quickly and add
my summit picture from

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.330
Kilimanjaro.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:03.470
It was fast.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.840
It was cold.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.310
It was a very fast picture.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.020
So he gave me the $10.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.410
It's not it's worth as
much as it was 1972.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.640
So we carried on to Mount
Damavand, which is the highest

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.870
peak in Iran, and then
we went to Kashmir,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.940
so we were so lucky.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.340
We went to all these places you
can't go to now, and we

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.110
joined up with the local
Kashmiri Mountaineering and

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.860
Hiking Club, who knew about
all these mountains that

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.950
they'd tried to climb but never
could, because they

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.230
didn't have the techniques
and the gear.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.130
And mostly the idea of getting
up at 3:00 in the

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.160
morning when the--

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.030
they would get up at 8:00 and
make chapatis, and not get up

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.950
the mountain.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.320
And we would get up at 3:00
and cook over our little

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.760
primus, and be up at the summit
when the sun rose.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.980
Anyway, so they told us about
all these mountains that had

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.420
never been climbed, and then
we climbed them all.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.870
So here I was at age
26 doing first

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.050
ascents in the Himalayas.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.560
It was a long way from Chicago,
and I wasn't that

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.510
good a technical climber, but
I was really determined.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.300
So when there was really deep
snow and everybody said, the

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.360
snow is too deep, let's just
not bother, I would sort of

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.500
break trail through the deep
snow to the face of the ice

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.220
cliff where the guys who
were the good ice

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.360
climbers would take over.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.650
So my specialty was indeed
breaking trail, plodding

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.430
through snow, and as you'll
hear, doing science policy is

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.110
just like breaking trail.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.820
Does anyone do anything in your
work where you feel like

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.160
you're plodding through
deep snow?

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.040
These were some peaks in Kashmir
we did not climb that

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.950
were really hard, but we were
so lucky to be at all these

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.200
places that we were practically
the first

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.000
Westerners.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.030
Then we went to Afghanistan
and did an expedition, and

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.800
again, I felt so privileged to
have this wonderful time in

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.930
Afghanistan at a very happy
time for that country.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.200
There was a king, it was
modernizing, and in fact,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.040
after September 11, I showed
this slide show about

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.820
Afghanistan, which led to
founding the Society for

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.700
Preservation of Afghan
Archaeology.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.940
From having climbed there, have
been involved with things

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.820
around Afghanistan.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.530
So here I am at 20,000 feet in
Afghanistan, thinking about my

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.420
tRNA research, right.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.540
But this was a very
memorable day.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.940
At this point it was 1973.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.880
All the world's highest
mountains of 8,000 meters or

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.640
higher had been climbed by men,
but no woman had ever

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.870
climbed to 8,000 meters, and
we were climbing a mountain

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.560
that was 7,500, and there was
a Polish expedition there.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.410
We're heading up to the summit,
and we met coming down

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.510
Wanda Rutkiewicz, who went on to
become the world's leading

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.300
moment mountaineer.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.410
She was the first woman to climb
K2, the third woman to

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.660
climb Everest.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.900
But meanwhile, we were on Noshaq
and she had just come

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.420
down from climbing, it's like
24, five, 7,500 meters, and I

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.630
was heading up, and she gave
me a big hug, and said, we

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.360
will climb Annapurna together,
all women.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.400
And so that moment in
Afghanistan was where the idea

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.760
came to climb Annapurna.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:20.560
Meanwhile, I did lots of other
expeditions, I got my PhD, I

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.090
post doc'ed at Stanford in
bio-chem, and alternated

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.460
climbing expeditions,
research.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.330
I was studying intermediate in
protein folding, and I went on

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.440
an expedition in India
that changed my life.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.430
And it was an easy mountain
called Trisul, but it was,

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.040
again, high, over
7,000 meters.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.350
It had been climbed back in
1890, very easy, and on it was

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.360
Bruce Carson, who was at that
time America's leading young

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.380
rock climber.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.900
He had pioneered climbing the
hardest faces in Yosemite

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.210
without pitons.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.540
People used to drive pitons
into the rock, now Bruce

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.680
pioneered putting chalk stones
in that don't scar the rock,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.130
and he had led people like
Yvon Chouinard and Royal

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.900
Robbins, if you know those
names, up the first grade

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.000
sixes ever done in the valley
without pitons.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.060
And so we were on this
easy mountain.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.930
I'm a slow walker.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.470
He was ahead with some
of his friends.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.839
I got to the summit and
his friend said, we

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.750
think Bruce is lost.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.260
I don't think I have
a pointer.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.710
I don't have a pointer do i?

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.619
We're going to imagine.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.960
So you see those footprints
on the left?

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.710
Do you know what a cornice is?

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.280
A cornice is where the wind
blows, like you have a rocky

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.550
place, and the wind blows, so
you can have snow over air.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.650
It's like a big wave of snow,
and so Bruce got to the top

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:46.350
with his friends.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.900
He was very careful climber,
always roped, but he unroped.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.660
He thought that point that you
see there was a higher summit,

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.360
and where his footprints are
on the left, he went out on

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.010
the point, but he was on a
cornice and fell to his death.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.570
And you can see, this is from
the other side, that big

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.190
cornice on the top, and we had
no idea that there was a--

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.430
India was very secretive in
those days about maps.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.240
We had no real map.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:21.240
We didn't know there was a
face, and so Bruce was 23

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.840
having done all this, and
fell to his death.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.310
And I was really depressed, and
I came back to Stanford,

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.760
and I didn't really want to
study protein folding.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.310
I wanted to do something
for the world, for the

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.100
environment, because Bruce
had been an early

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.610
environmentalists, like he did
the first big cleanups in

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.860
Yosemite Valley, getting
rid of all the trash.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:48.550
He was very much, and so a guy
who had been on my PhD orals

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.110
committee called Bruce Ames--

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.635
anybody here ever heard
of Bruce Ames?

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:55.690
If you're in biology, but he had
something called the Ames

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.570
test, where you could take
a chemical, put it on a

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.670
bacterial plate, if it changed
the bacteria it was likely to

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.140
cause cancer.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.860
It was a cancer screening
tool that was kind of

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:10.385
revolutionary, and so I went to
see him and I said, I don't

00:19:10.385 --> 00:19:11.580
want to do protein
folding anymore.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.160
It's not important.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.000
It turns out protein folding
is really important, how

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.740
proteins fold, for
lots of things.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.140
But I want to do something
environmental, and he said,

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.570
you know, I'm kind of worry
about this flame retardant in

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.910
kid's pajamas.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.040
It looks like it's a carcinogen
to me, and it's

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.260
actually 10% of the weight of
all the kid's pajamas in the

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.440
country, and I think it
gets inside the kids.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.470
Do want to study that?

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.730
He said it's so practical,
even the undergraduates

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.170
won't-- you know scientists like
to do theoretical things,

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.140
nothing too practical.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.080
He said, nobody will
look at it.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.030
Would you look at it?

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.190
I was sufficiently depressed.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.420
I said sure.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.860
So I found a child who--

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.940
and the chemical is called
brominated tris.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.465
All the pajamas pretty much
kids in America were

00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:55.850
wearing were 10%.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.270
I found a mom who'd bought her
children's pajamas in England,

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.060
so they'd never worn
the tris pajamas.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.470
So we put a child in
the tris pajamas,

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.650
collected their urine.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.240
The next morning there were tris
breakdown products in the

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.860
child's urine, which meant the
tris was going from the

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.790
pajamas into the child.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.560
And then we ran a screen to see
if it was a mutagen, did

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.720
it change DNA, and it was
one of the strongest

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.190
mutagens we'd ever seen.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.540
And I thought, oh my goodness,
we have to write a paper.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.320
We have to alert the
parents of America.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.870
This is a disaster.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.030
And then I got invited
to this mountain.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.860
Do you know what mountain
this is?

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.350
Anybody know?

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.550
Big mountain.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.232
Everest, Mount Everest, and at
that point, Everest had been

00:20:40.232 --> 00:20:41.710
climbed once by Americans.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.570
1963, and this is the 50th
anniversary of the first

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.120
American ascent of Everest.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.560
And if anyone's interested, I'm
on the honorary committee

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.420
for the 50th anniversary party,
which is in Richmond,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.110
California in the
end of February.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.550
If anybody wants to go,
see me afterwards.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.440
I'll give you an invitation.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.740
So there's a 50th anniversary
party for Everest.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.210
So Everest was climbed
by Americans in '63.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:11.030
This was '76, the bicentennial
year, and no American woman

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.500
had ever eve tried Everest,
and so I had

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.320
this terrible choice.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.280
Did I write the paper about the
cancer causing pajamas, or

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.460
did I climb Mount Everest.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.475
So how many of you would
climb Mount Everest?

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.815
How many of you would write
the paper about the cancer

00:21:28.815 --> 00:21:31.610
causing pajamas?

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.740
So I did both.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.410
So here is our team, and we
climbed in beautiful places

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.290
like the Khumbu Icefall, rigged
ladders, but every

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.160
night I would get to
camp and I would

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.010
write more of my paper.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:51.500
And here we are in the great
Khum, and when I reached my

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.810
high point, now my flag
says the mutants.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.490
That petri dish has no tris,
the one with only two

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.010
colonies, and you can't see
blowing in the wind the one

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.310
with lots of tris where there
are lots of mutations.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.550
But I'd finished my paper.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.760
I sent it by mail runner back to
Berkeley, and we did reach

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.970
the summit of Everest on October
15, 1976 for the

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.880
bicentennial, and then the next
January our paper was

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.540
published in "Science."

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.380
And I always include the title
of this paper in my talks,

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.250
because it really says what our
Institute is now doing.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.060
So the subtitle, which I can't
read back there, "The main

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.680
flame retardant in children's
pajamas is a mutagen and

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.540
should not be used." For those
of you read scientific papers,

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.360
is that an unusual title?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.720
What do all scientific papers
recommend as the next

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.900
steps at the end?

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.800
More research, and that's
pretty much all they

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.480
recommend, and we went, oh my
god, every kid in the country

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.530
is wearing toxic pajamas, and so
we really recommended that.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.890
We did media, and three months
after the paper came out, tris

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.050
was banned from kid's pajamas.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.070
So some of you might have
been those kids.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.000
It was only used for a couple
years, '74 and '75, or maybe

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.250
those were your parents who
didn't wear the tris pajamas

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.450
for that long.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.050
And it made me realize that
it's really important for

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.680
scientists to, at some point,
go from saying more research

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.640
is needed, to taking a stand and
saying there is a problem

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.100
here, and something needs to
be done about it, and so we

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.500
now have the Green Science
Policy Institute.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.050
Our mission is to bring the best
science to change policy

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.760
in the public interest.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.300
So brominated tris was banned,
and when something is banned,

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.970
industry likes to keep things
as similar as possible.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.540
So what do you think
the replacement for

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.130
brominated tris was?

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:52.270
Chlorinated tris, and so we
ran mutagenicity tests.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.200
It also changed DNA.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.330
It was also banned from kid's
pajamas, but chlorinated tris

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:03.230
turns out to be the number one
chemical in furniture, and

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.700
other baby products today.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.790
So anyone here have
a couch from Ikea?

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.810
What year did you buy it?

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.780
AUDIENCE: Just this year.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.430
ARLENE BLUM: Oh, this year.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.490
Well, it's maybe not too bad.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.700
What about yours?

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.970
AUDIENCE: Who knows.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.900
ARLENE BLUM: OK, so if you
bought your couch between 2005

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.550
and 2011, it contains
chlorinated tris, all the Ikea

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.570
couches, and pretty much
all the couches.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.000
But basically anyone in
California who has a couch has

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.370
tris or a related chemical in
it, so it was banned from baby

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.090
pajamas, but not
from furniture.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.650
But we didn't know
that back then.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.160
We though, yay, we've
solved the problem.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.830
And I thought, it's time to give
women a chance to climb

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.180
an 8,000 meter peak.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.310
I'd met Wanda in Afghanistan.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.950
She said, let's climb
Annapurna.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.350
It seemed like a
good mountain.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.070
It was the first 8,000 meter
peak ever climbed.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.280
On my way back from Everest
I got a permit for it.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:08.250
We put together a team who
ranged in age from 20 to 50.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.580
Actually, there is Dan.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.680
Irene is not here, is she?

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.566
Dan's wife Irene was the first
woman to climb Annapurna.

00:25:17.566 --> 00:25:19.120
Sorry if I'm embarrassing
you, Dan.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.960
Anyway, so there's Irene and
the rest of our team.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.390
Thank you for coming again.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.580
I'm sure Dan has seen--

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.300
the later part's different,
you'll see.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.560
So we're all still friends.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.800
We have reunions.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.940
We had to raise $80,000 to fund
our expedition, and We

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.890
raised it selling these
t-shirts, and if anyone wants

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.470
it, you just Google Annapurna
t-shirts, and you can get them

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.130
from our website.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.265
So I'll quickly go through--

00:25:49.265 --> 00:25:50.270
see how we're doing on time--

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.620
some of the beautiful pictures
on Annapurna.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.810
It was one of the most gorgeous
places I've ever

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.590
been, but one of the
most dangerous.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.400
We didn't know it then, but
Annapurna has the highest

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.470
fatality rate of any of
the 8,000 meter peaks.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.370
It's really high precipitation,
so there are

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:11.090
these huge avalanches, really
amazing steep slopes.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.740
It's considered the most
difficult and the most

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.640
dangerous of the 8,000
meter peaks.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.960
Not the best choice, but we
persevered, broke trail, and

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.970
reached the summit.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:27.070
There's Irene in the center,
and two Sherpa teammates.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.570
Two of the women on
our team, two

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.930
Sherpas reached the summit.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.800
We unfurled a Nepali flag,
American flag, women's place

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.240
is on top flag, all
held together by a

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.490
save the whales pin.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.820
Headed down there was a second
summit attempt, and the two

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.220
women on that fell to their
deaths, so climbing mountains

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.450
like this can be very,
very dangerous.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.700
So after Annapurna--

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.260
there's Irene in front
of Annapurna--

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.290
I wanted to do an expedition
to a safe, quote, "easier"

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:05.870
mountain, and we did a hard
first ascent in India with an

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.000
Indian American women's team.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.240
We're congratulated
by Indira Gandhi.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.150
I said I'd always dreamed of
walking the whole length of

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:14.400
the Himalayan Mountain range.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.620
It's a thing, once you get a
dream or a vision in your

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.550
mind, you kind of have
to make it happen.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.540
So I thought, walk across the
Himalayas, but the borders

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.890
were closed to Westerners, but
Mrs. Gandhi said she thought

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:29.200
she could help, and we got
permission, and we started in

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:35.510
Bhutan and walked all the way
across Bhutan, India, Nepal.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.310
I turn out to not have a very
good sense of direction, but

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.420
Hugh Swift, who I was walking
with, had just finished

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.270
writing a guidebook, so he knew
how to find the way, and

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.400
I was pretty good
at the politics.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.480
And so we crossed 19,000 foot
passes, and drop down, down,

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.240
down terraced valleys.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.990
Everywhere we came it seemed
like a very auspicious day.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:59.180
This was the annual archery
festival in Bhutan.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.370
Most places, almost the whole
time we were in places, there

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.150
had never been a Westerner
before, so we were greeted

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.860
like visitors from the gods
by the local people.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.970
The one day we were in
[INAUDIBLE], the Dalai Lama

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.540
was there giving a
talk in English.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.340
Yeah, it was like auspicious
day all the way.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.420
Every day was an
auspicious day.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.790
We entered Nepal on the Day of
the Dog when dogs were given

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.280
little marigold wreaths,
and little

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.420
tikas and special treats.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.225
We funded out trip by having
trekking groups that met us,

00:28:31.225 --> 00:28:34.460
and brought us supplies, and
walked with us for a few days.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.880
And I still lead treks, one or
two a year, and indeed we have

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.010
sign up sheets.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.570
This is a cue to pass
out sign up sheets.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.080
If anybody wants to be on our
mailing list, we'll pass out

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.580
sign up sheets, and basically
you'll hear for

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.480
me if we have trips.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.095
I think I'm doing a trip--

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.765
now there's a scientific meeting
in Switzerland, so

00:28:57.765 --> 00:29:01.880
then I'm going to do a trip
from Charmonix to near the

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.110
Matterhorn, along the Haute
Route in August.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.470
So I do one or two
trips a year.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.560
We're really lucky last year.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.790
We did a great trek in Burma
right when it opened, so

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.440
starting from this--

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.960
and then you actually get to
hear a lot about flame

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.900
retardants if you sign the list,
so if you don't want to

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.970
hear about flame retardants,
write adventures only.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.850
So we send out flame retardant
messages once a month, and

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.710
adventure messages about
four times a year.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.400
So we took pictures of the
beautiful women who lived in

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:38.230
the Himalayas as we walked
across, who did a lot of work.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:43.930
And namaste, the greeting, I
respect the spirit in you.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.310
From that trip, I came back and
wanted to share all these

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.860
auspicious days in the Himalayas
with my friends back

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.990
in Berkeley.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.650
We started to Berkeley
Himalayan Fair.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.585
Has anybody here been to
the Himalayan Fair?

00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:58.510
Sorry, I can't read the dates.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.440
I'll turn around.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.690
Yeah, so next May 18th and 19th,
if you want to come to

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.490
Berkeley Live Oak Park, we'll
have a big Himalayan party,

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.410
food, dancing, and all the
Himalayan people from the West

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:10.940
coast come.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.850
It's a great match-making
thing.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.180
Nepali people in different
cities, they all come and they

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.875
meet their husbands and
wives and things at

00:30:16.875 --> 00:30:19.160
the Himalayan Fair.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.800
And I have the best booth
since I founded it.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.420
Come say hi.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.180
I'm under the big tree right
across from the stage.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.230
Everyone's invited to hang
out at my booth.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.040
So my most recent adventures
were with my daughter

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.460
Annalise, and I rightfully
figured she might not like

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.040
walking, so when she was a baby,
her dad and I decided

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.370
we'd have a last big adventure,
and we carried her

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:45.140
across the Alps from Yugoslavia
to France in her

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.755
cute, Gor-Tex baby suit.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.120
Anyway, and then here's Annalist
on her gap year

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.660
teaching English in Guatemala.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.010
Annalise, she's an environmental
engineer.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.560
She doesn't like hiking
and camping.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.240
She complains bitterly about
sleeping on the ground, but

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.000
she's an environmental engineer
who studies water and

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.970
sanitation in developing
countries, so

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.160
I'm proud of her.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.290
She cares about the world.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.600
And meanwhile, I wrote
two books.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.720
"Annapurna," which took
about a year to write.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.260
Anybody here read "Annapurna?"
Some of you.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.840
A few people, yeah.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.400
And then after that I thought,
well I'll spend another year

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.620
and write a book about how I
came to Annapurna, and wrote

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:33.430
"Breaking Trail," which tells a
lot of stories, and it ended

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.190
right before my daughter
started college.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.900
It took me 20 years to write
"Breaking Trail"-- not an easy

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.860
book-- about my childhood,
and it was a tough book.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.040
But I wrote it, and then I
actually hadn't done science

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.350
for 26 years.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.140
I'd been a mom.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.220
I'd done leadership training
here in Silicon Valley, and I

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.360
thought, I want to go back to
science, but I really don't

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.570
know anything.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.300
And that was six years ago, and
this six years have been

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.180
the biggest adventure of my
life, much harder than

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.190
climbing Annapurna, and
way more important.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.070
And the problem--

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:06.360
before I do that,
maybe just ask.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.360
How many people here think if
a product is in your shampoo

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.180
or your toothpaste, someone's
making sure it's

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.430
safe for your health?

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.310
OK, and how many people think
there can be cancer-causing,

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.560
harmful chemicals in an everyday
product, and the EPA

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.580
knows about it and are powerless
to do anything?

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:35.850
And unfortunately, the second is
true, and the reason is we

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.840
only have one law--

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.310
so in America, foods, drugs, and
pesticides are regulated.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.180
All other chemicals are
regulated by something called

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:53.030
the Toxic Substances Control
Act of 1976, and when that

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.880
passed, it wasn't a very good
law, and it has no authority.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.570
So asbestos, which kills
thousands of people every

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.260
year, the EPA tried and tried
and cannot regulate.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.370
So chemicals can be really
harmful, the EPA can know, and

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.330
they can be in your
toothpaste.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.480
And indeed, if anyone
uses Colgate Total.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.650
Anybody use Colgate Total
toothpaste here?

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:14.530
My daughter did.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.310
It has triclosan in
it, which is a

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.720
potentially harmful chemical.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.970
It's banned at Kaiser.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.670
There are really only a handful
of these real horror

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.410
stories, and we can learn
these horror stories and

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.790
protect ourselves, so don't
get too depressed.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.810
There really aren't tens
of thousands of evil

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:37.630
chemicals out there.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:41.070
There's a small number, and we
can say what they are, and we

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.155
can be healthier.

00:33:42.155 --> 00:33:46.530
But the EPA has no authority
basically to regulate.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.860
When they passed the Toxic
Substances Control Act, all

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.400
the chemicals then were
grandfathered as being OK, and

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.060
with new chemicals they have
no authority to require

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.350
information, so there's
no information on

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.120
most of the new chemicals.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.790
So the thing that I have
been working on, and

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.560
I've come to realize--

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.710
maybe you've heard that I work
on flame retardants--

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.520
but I've come to realize the
problem really isn't flame

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.449
retardants.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:15.710
And flame retardants are
chemicals that are used at

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.350
really high levels, like 5% of
the foam in your couch is a

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.290
flame retardant.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.760
But the problem is flammability
standards, and

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.639
back in the '70s, several
flammability standards were

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:32.239
passed where no on really
thought about do they provide

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.030
a fire safety benefit, and
is there a harm from the

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.620
chemicals that are used
to meet them.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.310
And the chemicals are
very profitable.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.449
The companies that make them do
a lot of lobbying to make

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:48.420
new laws that require more of
the use of their chemicals.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.969
And this is a very major health
problem, but a solvable

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.770
health problem, and we're going
to talk about in the

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.920
'70s, there was a furniture
flammability standard passed

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.000
called Technical Bulletin 117.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.870
There was a code for foam
plastic insulations in

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:08.590
buildings passed with something
called the Steiner

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:13.190
Tunnel Test, and their
flammability standards for

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.270
electronics, and we're going
to say the most about

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.200
Technical Bulletin 117.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.450
If you go home and look at your
couch, they're all going

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.260
to have a sign saying
it meets TB117.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.810
That means the foam inside won't
burn for 12 seconds with

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:32.160
a small flame, but the reality
is if you drop a candle on

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.900
your couch, the fabric
burns first.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.080
You have a large flame, the foam
burns, and there's really

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.770
not much benefit.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.790
The chemical used to protect all
the furniture uses a flame

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:48.820
retardant until it was banned
globally in 2005.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.830
In that picture of chemicals,
the top one is PCBs, which are

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.820
carcinogens and harmful.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.960
The center one is that flame
retardant, and then the bottom

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.090
ones are dioxins and furans,
which are really harmful, so

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.940
it's a chemical that's
halfway in structure

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.300
between a PCB and a dioxin.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.850
When I asked a chemist what do
you think about students at

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.960
Berkeley being exposed
to this chemical?

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.310
He said, only in a fume hood
with full protective gear.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.160
But that's what's in your
furniture if you have

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.090
furniture from before 2005.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.450
So why is this important?

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.640
We're exposed to these flame
retardants in our homes, in

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.930
our office place, in cars, and
they're slowly making their

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.040
way into the food chain.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.410
Right now, about 90% of the
exposure is in our homes.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.170
If you look at levels in dust,
on the left you have outside

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.270
the US very low levels, other
states in the middle.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:45.290
California has the highest
levels, because we, uniquely,

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.890
have a furniture flammability
standard.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.960
No other state has a standard.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.610
Sadly enough, toddlers have
three times the level in their

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.020
bodies compared to adults,
because they get their mothers

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.470
level through the placenta.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.690
The chemicals are lipophilic,
fat loving, so they go into

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.980
breast milk, and then toddlers
crawl in the dust and put

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.320
their hands in their mouths.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.060
So a woman who has a higher
level of this flame

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.130
retardant-- this is the one
that was banned, but is in

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.360
older furniture--

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.850
it takes longer for her to get
pregnant, and then there are a

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.010
number of neurological
impairments.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:22.180
And these are actually

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.700
epidemiology studies in people.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.730
There's maybe 20 or 30 studies
showing harm in people, and

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:33.310
then this is the number
of studies in animals.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.470
This is well studied.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.710
There's an industry of
scientists around the world

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.100
studying these flame retardants,
but yet this

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.010
information never reaches
decision makers.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.610
So there's this many peer
reviewed papers, and if you go

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.150
to a typical hearing in
Sacramento, you will hear from

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.240
the chemical industry there is
no valid science showing any

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.950
harm for many flame retardant.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.350
So this is a huge disconnect
that we're trying to bridge

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.710
and can bridge, bringing good
science to decision makers.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.760
So to give you an example of
what happens, remember back

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.880
with the children's sleepwear,
we had brominated

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.410
tris, it got banned.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.760
We got chlorinated tris,
it got banned.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.030
In our furniture, we had
[? penta ?], it got banned.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:19.050
Then we got chlorinated tris,
and it is on the way out.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:22.790
Chlorinated tris been listed
as cancer causing, and we

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.840
stopped making it in the US.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.690
Most of the furniture from 2005
till now has chlorinated

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.480
tris, and the replacement is
something called Firemaster.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.870
The manufacturers will not give
out samples to study, but

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.710
colleagues of mine got one
sample, and it looks like it

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:48.640
causes obesity and anxiety, so
it's an obesogen, so this is

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.740
the newest flame retardant.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:57.630
So I got my dust tested.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:01.200
I had some of the highest levels
in the world, very high

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.880
levels of this toxic flame
retardant, 97 parts per

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.410
million in my dust.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.330
So I got rid of my couch.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.900
That's my couch going into the
dumpster, and then three years

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.490
later my level was down to
three parts per million.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:16.850
So getting rid of toxic
furniture works, but where

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:17.840
does the couch go.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.580
Into a landfill where it can
leech out into wildlife, and

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.170
all these top of the food chain

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.390
carnivores have high levels.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.240
So is there a fire safety
benefit, and the

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.620
answer is not much.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.810
If you compare the blue, the
furniture without flame

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.790
retardants, to the red, with,
you can see there's a few

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.880
seconds delay in ignition,
three seconds longer, but

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.720
twice as much smoke, five times
as much carbon monoxide,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.770
and 80 times as much soot.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.870
So that means you delay your
fire three seconds, but you

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.636
get lots more of the smoke
and toxic gases.

00:39:52.636 --> 00:39:53.980
Let's just skip to
the next one.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.690
So what about legislation?

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.270
we have tried in California
for six years.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.750
There's been four bills to
change our furniture standard

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.730
to have increased fire safety
without toxic chemicals.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.560
Doesn't that's sound
like a good idea?

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.720
Who do you think might
not like that idea?

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:16.130
Right, this is part of a $6
million campaign from Citizens

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.760
for Fire Safety, and
who are they.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.410
Albemarle, Chemtura, Israel
Chemicals Limited, the

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.170
manufacturers of the chemicals,
and why do they

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:29.100
spend $6 million, because the
chemicals are so profitable.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.910
I don't think they do press
releases like this anymore now

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.540
that I've put them on my
slides, but I found in

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.770
chemical and engineering news
Albemarle proudly announcing a

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:42.730
377% increase in their profits
from their sale of brominated

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.200
flame retardants.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.700
And then Chemtura announcing
they're raising their prices

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.810
25%, in part to pay for
global advocacy.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.370
25%, that's pretty good.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.360
So these three companies
have a global monopoly.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.760
They can charge anything they
want, and people have to get

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.260
their products to abide with
laws, so then they have huge

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.320
money to make laws, which
used to pass.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.210
But if someone happens to bring
a little bit of good

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.490
science into decision making
they don't pass, and that's

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.120
what we've been doing, and we've
had some recent help.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.660
The Chicago Tribune, if anybody
wants to know all the

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:23.600
dirt, this is one of about 20
front page stories in the

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.555
Chicago Tribune.

00:41:24.555 --> 00:41:28.420
And again, I can't quite
remember it, but the subtitle,

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.750
"A deceptive campaign by
industry brought toxic flame

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.580
retardants into our homes and
our bodies, and the chemicals

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.460
don't even work as promised."
And this is a total front

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.040
page, four more pages, issue
after issue of the Tribune

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.350
exposing the duplicity of this
industry, and that's been a

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:51.630
huge help to our science to
inform policy, which led to,

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:55.350
after six years of failed
legislation, last May the

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:59.640
governor directed the state
agencies to change our

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.120
flammability standard to
increase or maintain fire

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.350
safety without toxic
flame retardants.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.420
And that process is
moving forward.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.020
It's a yearlong process.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.480
February 1st there'll be a
public comment period.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.930
If any of you signed my mailing
list-- has it made it

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.930
all the way around?

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.520
Anyway, if anyone hasn't gotten
the mailing list, if

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.150
you raise your hand it
might come your way.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:23.070
If you sign it, you will get
a chance to comment in the

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:26.200
public comment period that you
might like a couch without

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.020
flame retardants.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.830
And if the process moves, and
it's moving well, the foam

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.550
industry, everybody's in favor
of the change except the three

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.770
chemical companies.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:39.280
So by next June you should all
be able to buy safer furniture

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.630
without flame retardants
thanks to the governor.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.600
This is a paper where we looked
at what was in 100 baby

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.590
products, and 80% of them had
toxic flame retardants at

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.750
levels up to-- there was
a changing pad that

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.290
was 12% tris by weight.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.370
And it was funny when we submit
the paper, it was first

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:02.010
turned down for not being novel
enough, and then it was

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:05.160
the top paper of the year
in this journal,

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.230
had the most readers.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.570
Right, anybody with a child
read the paper.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:12.820
And indeed, based on that, three
baby products have been

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.140
exempt from requiring the flame
retardants, and when the

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.030
standard passes all the rest
will be, so the chemicals will

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:22.070
not be in our furniture
or our baby products.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.640
Just to say something about
building insulation, all these

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.120
plastic foam insulations that
make buildings energy

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.550
efficient are treated with
some of the worst flame

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.630
retardants.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.390
There have only been 21
chemicals globally banned,

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.770
which include several flame
retardants, and the HBCD,

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.280
which is a--

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:46.330
polystyrene is going to be the
22nd globally banned chemical.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.770
This is a form of tris that's
used in blow in and spray

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.060
insulation.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.200
But again, you don't
really need it.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.900
The insulation materials are
behind fire block wall, so

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.900
before you hit the insulation
you have to burn through the

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.740
wall, and then at that point
the insulation doesn't make

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.470
much of a difference.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:10.490
So we wrote a paper, "Flame
retardants in building

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.500
installation: a case for
reevaluating building codes,"

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.730
which is free online
until January 26th

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:18.950
if you want to copy.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:21.780
We got them to make it
free for two months.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.510
But based on this paper there's
a code change proposal

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:33.730
for the 2015 residential code,
that plastic foam insulations

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.690
behind fire block walls or
below grade will not be

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.315
required to have flame
retardants.

00:44:43.765 --> 00:44:45.900
Oh yeah, and this
was supported--

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.750
these are the proponents, which
is the US Green Building

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.670
Council, the Cancer Firefighters
Organization.

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.420
You can see these are all the
sponsoring organizations who

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.640
are sponsoring the code change,
so we have a lot of

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.400
great organizations.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:04.650
And Nancy Skinner, our local
assembly woman, to my great

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:11.640
surprise on Monday released
AB127 to change California law

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.600
so that we are not required
in our codes to have flame

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.870
retardants in building
insulation, so this is great

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.890
news, and her staffers that
they plagiarized from our

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.980
paper for their whole
legislation.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.540
So this is a case directly, you
write a good scientific

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.670
paper, it can be used
for legislation.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:36.710
And to have green buildings,
having good water and all that

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:40.390
is important, but if you're
going to have flame retardants

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:43.860
in the insulation it's never
going to be totally green.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.530
So I'm going to put in a word
for our newest thing I'm

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:52.310
planning, is the Blue Mountain
Toxics Reduction Retreat.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:57.270
We'd like to get leaders in
government industry, business,

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:01.080
nonprofits all together to talk
about the big picture.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.180
What are the biggest toxic
threats that we can solve,

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.400
because I think there are a
handful of things like flame

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.220
retardants, stain repellents,
triclosan in toothpaste, that

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.990
are known to be harmful, but
things we just don't need.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.430
So it's not how do we replace
it, it's like let's just not

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:22.640
use it, and so I'm hoping
someone from Google might

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.760
attend our retreat.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.800
So when I spoke here last
year, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.360
said make a slide on how Google
can help solve the

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.890
flame retardant problem, and so
these are some suggestions.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:41.130
Support California code changes
and legislation for

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:45.230
fire safety without toxicity,
and so we have the governor's

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:49.940
initiative, which the chemical
industry maybe $100 million to

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.360
spend to try to defeat it, so
we're all waiting to see what

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.180
they're going to do.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.940
I've heard that people are
getting phone calls sort of

00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.970
saying, do you know the governor
is going to get rid

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.890
of this good standard
that saves lives.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.630
Are we going to go back
to the bad old days

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.940
where we all burn.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.515
So if you get any of those phone
calls, take notes, let

00:47:07.515 --> 00:47:13.180
us know, but support the
governor Nancy Skinner's

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.880
legislation.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.050
Specify no flame retardants
if you can in purchasing.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.160
There are products that use
flame retardants where it's

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.680
not required.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.690
Hopefully you don't use flame
retardants in Google products

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.460
if you can.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.250
We don't have much time, but
there are a couple minutes.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.410
Are there other things?

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:35.390
OK, I'm almost done, and let's
come back to what other things

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:37.960
Google might be able to do.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.520
So if you want more information,
you already got a

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.660
chance to sign our list,
or leave a card

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.390
at the basket outside.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.390
If you want to know more about
us, Google green science

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:52.280
policy, and there's lots and
lots of information about how

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.140
to have less flame retardants,
safer and healthier products,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.040
and I am optimistic.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.480
I think the toxic chemical
problem is solvable.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.770
We can reduce toxics and have
a healthier world, and it's

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:07.780
just like mountain climbing.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.260
You just have to put one step
ahead of the other, and we can

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.450
reach the summit of a world
with less toxics.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:15.700
Thank you.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:23.620
Do you have a question?

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.310
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was wondering if
you can talk about how you

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.020
went about organizing the
expeditions, at the same time

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.500
having, I assume, a lot of
work to do at school and

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.200
everything to follow
up on that.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.520
As well as, how did you go
about writing the paper

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.560
without having all
the materials

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.640
and everything there.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.300
How did all of that work out
about being at Everest?

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.670
ARLENE BLUM: By multitasking
big time.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.400
I am a hard worker,
and it was hard.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.900
In graduate school I probably
slowed my progress a bit,

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.520
because I get pretty focused
on these different climbing

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.230
expeditions.

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.310
But it's a good question.

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.830
Somehow when you're young you
have a lot of energy, and I

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:10.450
think on Everest it was
pretty much written.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.780
I was in the editing.

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.370
I had the figures an the data.

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:17.170
I just had to do a bit more
and do some editing, so I

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.760
didn't really write
it from scratch.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.740
AUDIENCE: But in terms of
planning the expeditions, was

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.720
it just you didn't sleep, and
you just did the planning, and

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.380
then going to school in the day
time, or were there some

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.900
days that you would just plan
the expedition, not care about

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.300
school, and then go back.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.000
How did you juggle that?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.850
ARLENE BLUM: The whole time I
was in grad school, I would

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.260
climb a lot, every weekend, so
I think it really cut into my

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.760
climbing when I was planning
an expedition.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.040
I probably did less climbing,
but I kept doing my school

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.290
work, kind of.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:57.540
AUDIENCE: So when you had the
slide up about the TSCA Act,

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.290
one of the bullet point said
that there's 20,000 chemicals

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:05.150
roughly, and 85% we have
no health data about.

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:08.330
But you also said that of all
these chemical, there's really

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.653
only a few that are
really bad.

00:50:10.653 --> 00:50:12.940
ARLENE BLUM: Really bad and at
high levels in our homes.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.620
A lot of them are industrial
chemicals.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.920
They're used in processes.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.960
We have a lot of chemicals in
our home, but flame retardants

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.890
are 5% of the weight of the
foam, maybe even 10%, so you

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.110
have pounds of flame retardants
in your home.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:31.100
AUDIENCE: I guess my question
is, we don't even have data

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.510
about 85% of that chemical
inventory, so how do we know

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:38.440
that there's not a lot more
chemical stock out there and

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.756
in our products that
does provide, or

00:50:41.756 --> 00:50:43.810
put us close to harm?

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.770
ARLENE BLUM: One of the
interesting things that we're

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:50.520
talking about now is looking
at classes of chemicals, so

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.600
similar chemicals have similar
properties so you can sort of

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.460
generalize, so the class I work
on, organohalogens where

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.850
you have carbon bonded to
bromine, chlorine, and

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:03.290
fluorine are super persistent,
and they stay around

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:04.650
a really long time.

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:08.580
So anything that stays around
a really long time and is at

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:13.310
high levels in your home is
going to be a big problem.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.450
So if you're a chemist,
you can kind

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.470
of look at a chemical--

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.900
not always-- but you
can kind of guess.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.280
And there's a lot of--

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.320
certain metals are problems.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.090
We sort of know what the things
are in our homes that

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.100
are the biggest problems.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.610
There could be others, but
I'm saying is that

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.800
there are these obvious--

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.820
like your red list.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.942
There's kind of low hanging
fruit, toxic things that you

00:51:36.942 --> 00:51:40.780
know are bad, and in many cases
you don't need them, so

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.280
why don't we just get rid
of the really bad

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.870
things we don't need.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.100
Flame retardants, because
there's an industry, they're

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:46.950
profitable.

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:48.750
Most of them, the reason we're
using them is because they're

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:51.790
profitable, but I think that
that can be solved.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:02.740
AUDIENCE: I have a
tiny question.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:06.660
I think I saw one of these
notices on a backpacking tent.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.100
Are they also treated with
flame retardants?

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.760
ARLENE BLUM: They are,
unfortunately.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.540
And again, that might be a
time you might want flame

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:19.280
retardants, and there are ones
that are safer, and there are

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:23.440
ones that are less safe, and
it's a problem that because

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.690
the EPA can't regulate.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.720
One of the projects we haven't
done is to just give the

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.450
outdoor industry a list of what
they really harmful flame

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.900
retardants are, and maybe they
could move from the harmful

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.780
ones to the less harmful ones.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.900
And maybe they're already doing
that, I haven't looked

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.720
into it, but lots of industries
are trying to move

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.790
from more harmful to less
harmful flame retardants and

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.590
other chemicals.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.900
And I'm sure at Google when
you're doing your products,

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.460
you're trying to move--

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.660
there's something called the
green screen, where you can

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.180
compare chemicals.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.320
So for backpacking tents you
might want flame retardants,

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.730
maybe your stove's going to
explode, but you want to try

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.610
to have the safest possible
flame retardants, or use

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:12.770
materials that are inherently
fire resistant.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.370
So there are lots of ways you
can solve the flammability

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:17.050
problem without putting
lots of toxic

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:18.300
chemicals into things.

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:25.460
AUDIENCE: In terms of affecting
policy decisions,

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.830
what's the step between
publishing the paper and

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.470
actually talking to the people
that are making the decisions?

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.330
ARLENE BLUM: That's a great
question, because in this

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:38.910
field of flame retardants, I go
to meetings with hundreds

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:43.210
of scientists who do paper after
paper about the harm and

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:46.800
how their accumulating in
everything in the environment,

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.820
and I'm like, write a
"Scientific American" article,

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.400
do something.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.355
And they're like, well it's on
our website, or they can read

00:53:54.355 --> 00:53:55.640
it in the journals.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.400
But scientists have to realize
people aren't going to read it

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.470
in the journals, and they're
not going to go to your

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:05.030
website, and scientists have
to take the trouble to put

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:08.560
their science in a form
that's accessible.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.430
I've been working with
epidemiologists who do studies

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:17.950
showing harm in humans, which
is big news, and if they can

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:22.010
effectively tell the press, at
least people can find out.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:25.340
So I think not all scientists,
but a small number of

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.420
scientist, if they could make
that part of their mission,

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.350
and that's what we're
trying to do.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.850
There are some scientists who
care about this, and we're

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:37.430
helping do some communications
courses, facilitating

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:40.400
scientist talking to decision
makers, because scientists

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.650
have a lot of credibility.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.430
In other words, in addition to
writing the peer reviewed

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:51.440
paper, write the white paper,
write the public article.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.810
And the problem is, at least
academic scientists are not

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.120
rewarded for this.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.050
It's almost looked down on.

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.420
But what I think, in the old
days in academia it was

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.200
considered bad form
to make money, and

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.540
bad from to do policy.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:08.410
Nowadays, making money is great,
and I think we have to

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:11.460
make it so the doing policy is
great too, that there's a

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.560
reward system for taking your
science and using it in the

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.790
public interest.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:19.260
Because scientists are paid by
the public, and I think they

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:23.570
have a responsibility to take
their information and bring it

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:27.550
to the decision makers, and it
is a huge vacuum, and very

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:28.800
effective when people do.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.850
So, other questions.

00:55:37.232 --> 00:55:37.720
Yes.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.038
AUDIENCE: As a former grad
student, how were you able to

00:55:40.038 --> 00:55:41.910
fund your expeditions?

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.490
ARLENE BLUM: We funded our
Annapurna expedition selling

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:47.350
those t-shirts, the woman's
place is on top Annapurna.

00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:52.160
The title got a lot of
attention, and when we walked

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:55.030
across the Himalayas, we funded
it by having people

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:57.360
come trekking with us
and supporting it.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.770
So I think nowadays people get
sponsorships from companies a

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.550
lot, like the North Face and
stuff have sponsored athletes,

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:07.010
and in those days we really
didn't, so we kind of, as I

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:09.270
said, sold t-shirts or treks.

00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:11.290
We had support treks.

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:13.000
It was not easy.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.260
Before Annapurna, I thought
that the mountain of

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.330
t-shirts-- the t-shirt business,
remember we sold

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.620
80,000 t-shirts, the business
was in my house, and I thought

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.100
that was even harder
than climbing the

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.100
mountain, but I was wrong.

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.350
The mountain was harder.

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:31.760
AUDIENCE: About a month ago, I
read a few places, including

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.650
your newsletter, about
brominated vegetable oil

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:37.410
showing up in Gatorade and a
few other sodas, and I was

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:41.260
wondering what should we be
avoiding, and also what's

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.300
being done since then to try
and get those removed?

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.430
ARLENE BLUM: Yeah, I'm glad
you brought that up.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.460
That is one of the dumbest
ideas around.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:52.700
Back in the '70s, Europe and
Japan all banned brominated--

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.630
we're like the Wild West in
terms of regulation of

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.920
chemicals, sadly enough.

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:02.240
Anyway, so brominated vegetable
oils are used--

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.380
but it's very specific--

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:08.120
in certain orange sodas, like
orange Fanta, Mountain Dew,

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.170
certain kinds of Gatorade.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:11.180
Just look on the label.

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.960
It'll say brominated vegetable
oils, and they are

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:20.930
metabolized, stored in our fat,
and I actually was like a

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:24.570
referee for a paper from Germany
on how bad they are,

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:27.890
calculating that if a kid lived
on orange Fanta they'd

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:32.770
get a pretty high dose, and we
can't seem to regulate it.

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.840
We do not have a will to
regulate chemicals, and it's

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.300
really sad, because prevention
is the old thing, but

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.070
prevention is so much cheaper.

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.840
There's a limited number of
really bad chemicals in our

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:50.070
homes that end up in our bodies,
and they are causing a

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:53.750
lot of our cancer, infertility,
neurological

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.430
problems, and I feel like we
know what they are, and they

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:57.320
could be regulated.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:03.460
And I think that's an example of
a thing that we don't need.

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.470
It makes it look like the
orange Fanta has fruit

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:07.120
floating in it.

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.090
It's kind of a density thing
they put in brominated

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.120
vegetable oils.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.600
So I actually sent out a press
release about that about a

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.490
year ago, and it got some media
attention, but it's

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:20.050
nobody's business to regulate
it, I guess.

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:24.320
So you read my newsletter, but
I think if people knew that,

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.850
orange Fanta would
find something.

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:28.230
In Germany, they have orange
Fanta without brominated

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.240
vegetable oil, so that's the
kind of perfect example of

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.300
something that if we have
information we can solve, and

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.870
where scientists can share
that information.

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:42.100
I have to say, I reviewed the
paper, gave it high scores,

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.050
and it was not published because
it was not novel

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:49.880
enough, so how science measures
things is not--

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.780
the people measuring it aren't
measuring it in terms of

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.710
public health.

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:57.560
The analytic techniques probably
weren't novel enough,

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.830
so somehow there's got to be
some points in paper review

00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:05.240
and in funding for things that
impact public health, and I'm

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.660
afraid there isn't yet.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.320
I guess last question.

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:17.070
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, is
there an easy, cheap tool that

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:18.730
anybody can put--

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:20.390
I understand for different
class of chemicals it's a

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.850
different things-- but that
anybody can put some kind of a

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:26.660
chemical, or the dust in their
homes, and easily measure

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.120
levels of certain toxins?

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:29.930
ARLENE BLUM: That
would be great.

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:31.790
Maybe someone could
develop that.

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:35.480
But when we did our
studies of--

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:38.410
we just did a study of what's
in America's couches--

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:41.100
we were using GC Mass
Spec, which is very

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.095
expensive and difficult.

00:59:42.095 --> 00:59:45.480
No, there aren't, and people
want to know what's in their

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.930
couch, and I say, if you live in
California, you don't need

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:50.910
to bother measuring it.

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:55.010
But it's expensive, so there's
no easy way, and the other

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.070
part is we don't really
have labeling.

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.770
There's no requirement, and
that's a very simple thing,

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:02.190
and I don't know if you guys
know that Google has made a

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:05.580
huge contribution to
transparency in what's in

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.890
buildings, so the US Green
Building Council has had a big

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:13.490
effort just to say what's
in a building.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:16.470
Shouldn't we know, and the
American Chemical Council

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:19.890
completely squashed it in an
ugly way, and Google gave $3

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:23.750
million to the US Green Building
Council to increase

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:24.700
transparency.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.480
Am I saying that right?

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.180
OK, and I guess some of the
people in this room--

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.020
Thank you--

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.270
were, in part, responsible for
this, so you guys are really

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.760
contributing, and it's
really important.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.960
When someone builds a building
to be able to know what's in

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.115
it, and say--

01:00:42.115 --> 01:00:44.310
and I think the example I always
give is, one of the

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:47.590
most persistent chemicals around
are stain repellents,

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:49.240
like they put on carpets.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.900
And I always think, if you say
to a mom, so you can have a

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.440
stain repellent carpet, but when
your baby crawls on it,

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.270
chemicals are going to go into
their body that they're going

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:58.820
to be there for the rest of
their life, and they're

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.740
harmful, or you can not have
such a good stain repellent.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.320
What would a mom pick, but
we're not given that

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.310
information, so transparency
information, those are things

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:09.870
we really, really
should demand.

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:11.490
And maybe they're things
Google can help with.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:14.690
You're so into free information,
so maybe that's

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:16.950
the connection of why
you gave $3 million.

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:21.940
Really great, I hadn't thought
about that before, but I think

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.760
with information--

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.940
that's really smooth--
information,

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.780
we can all be healthier.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.330
So anyway, the world thanks
you for that $3

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:32.770
million, the USGBC.

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:34.530
Well I think we're out of time,
but does anyone else

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:36.740
have any ideas of how
Google can help?

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.490
That was my question in my
slide, just since you're all

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:43.050
here with information.

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:45.460
Well send me an email
if you have one,

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.400
Arlene@greensciencepolicy.org,
and I hope some of you will be

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.280
on our list, and come to the
Himalayan fair, come on a

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.970
trek, or write in the comment
period that you want furniture

01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.130
without flame retardants.

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:00.380
So thank you.
