00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.800
Oil spills suck.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.790
Some of them gush millions of barrels worth
of oil into the ocean.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.470
How do you even clean up a mess like that?

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.699
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.830
On April 20th 2010 an oil rig in the Gulf
of Mexico exploded, spewing thousands of barrels

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.040
of oil into the coastal waters a day.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.320
The pipe was finally capped 87 days later.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.210
5 years later, 2-16 percent, or possibly more,
of the oil still lays on the ocean floor.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.009
Scientists are still assessing the damage
to ecosystems and the people who live there.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.149
So how do spills like that get cleaned up?

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.379
What happens to the all that oil?

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.019
The first step, contain the spill.

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.699
Oil is insoluble so it doesn’t mix with
water.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.160
Instead it floats on top in a layer just a
few centimeters thick.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.229
Temporary floating barriers called booms corral
the oil.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.569
Above the surface the barriers look like a
string of floating body pillows, circling

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:52.569
the oil.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.499
Below the surface they have a little “skirt”
of material that extends a few feet to catch

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:56.839
any oil below.

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.729
Once the oil’s rounded up, it can be scooped
up with skimmers, kind of like what you might

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.820
use to get bugs out of a pool.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.300
If that doesn’t work so well, dispersants,
or chemical emulsifiers can be sprayed.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.360
Some dispersants contain
surfactants, the stuff that makes detergents

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.500
clean your clothes.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.290
They break up the oil and other dirt because
their molecules have opposite ends.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.100
One end is hydrophilic, mean it likes water
and the other is oleophilic, meaning it likes

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.100
oil.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.140
These break up the surface tension that stops
water and oil from mixing.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.310
By breaking up the oil, it makes the oil disperse
more easily into the water.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.300
Which could keep the oil from reaching the
shoreline and damaging fragile wetland ecosystems.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.530
But some research shows that dispersants are
toxic to coral, so maybe dispersants aren’t

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200
the best idea for every spill.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.580
What other tools do we have?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.640
Absorbents, like clay and straw soak up some
of a spill but they also soak up a lot of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
water.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640
So they’re not ideal.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.840
Fortunately, science is on the case!

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.380
Researchers from a Swiss materials research
institute called Empa have developed a kind

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.250
of sponge made of chemically modified wood,
called

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.850
Nanofibrillated Cellulose.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.090
The material soaks up oil but leaves water
behind, and in lab tests they’re said to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.860
have absorbed up to 50 times their own weight
of oil.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.130
Another really cool engineered sponge was
recently created by Ohio State University

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.130
scientists.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.229
The nature-inspired technology is described
in a paper published in the journal Scientific

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.229
Reports.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.480
Inspired by lotus leaves, the stainless steel
mesh is coated with silica to create a bumpy

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
exterior.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.120
On top of that bumpy layer is another layer
of surfactant.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.150
And finally it’s sealed with a polymer coating
that repels water.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.160
One of the researchers says that a combination
of these layers makes for nano-particles that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
bind to oil.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.910
They’re hoping the mesh could one day be
used like a giant spongesoaking up a nasty

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.910
oil spill.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.950
Both of these technologies are still in the
early development phase though, so it may

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.840
be a while before they’re put to use in
real disasters.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.110
As for the oil that washes up on shore, Sometimes
nature can take over, sometimes with a little

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.110
help.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.310
Biological agents like, enzymes or microorganisms,
can be added to help speed up the biodegradation

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.310
process.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.430
According to the EPA this can either involve
“bioaugmentation, where bacteria is added

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.100
to the spill site to help biodegrate the oil
or

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.490
biostimulation, where nutrients are added
to already present oil degraders to stimulate

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.490
growth.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.780
So while oil spills can be pretty nasty, scientists
are always looking for new and better solutions

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.040
to cleaning them up.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.860
Another solution might be more environmentally
friendly cars!

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.120
Speaking of, the new Toyota Mirai is looking
to the future with sustainability in mind;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.610
fueled by hydrogen and leaving zero emissions
behind.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.110

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:40.680
he explains where all our oil comes from.
