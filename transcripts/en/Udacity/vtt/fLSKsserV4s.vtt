00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.850
If you have followed
everything in the lesson so

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.660
far, then you are ready to understand
NP completeness, an idea behind

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.650
some of the most fascinating structure
in the P versus NP question.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.860
You may have heard optimists say that
they are only one algorithm away

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.360
from proving that P is equal to NP.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.910
What they mean is that if we could
solve just one NP complete problem

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.870
in polynomial time, then we could
solve all of them in polynomial time.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.230
Here's why.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.697
Formally, we say that a language
L is NP-complete if L is in NP,

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:35.896
and if every other language in NP can
be reduced to it in polynomial time.

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:39.763
Recalling our picture of P and
NP from the beginning of the lesson,

00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:43.730
the NP complete problems were
the ones at the very top.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.710
And we called them
the hardest problems in NP.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
We can't have anything higher that's
still in NP, because if it's in NP,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.500
then it can be reduced to
an NP complete problem.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.760
Also, if any one of the NP complete
problems were shown to be in P

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.470
then P would extend up and
swallow all of NP.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.660
It's not immediately obvious that
an NP complete problem even exists.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.790
But it turns out that there are lots
of them and in fact they seem to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.060
occur more often in practice than
the problems in this intermediate zone

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.690
which are not NP complete and so
far have not proved to be an NP either.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.710
Historically, the first natural to
be proofed to be NP-complete is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.840
boolean formula satisfiability,
or SAT for short.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.110
This was shown to be NP-complete
by Stephen Cook in 1971 and

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.680
independently by Leonid Levin in
the Soviet Union around the same time.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
The fact that this problem is
NP-complete is extremely powerful,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.150
because once you have one NP-complete
problem, you just need to reduce it

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.600
to other problems to show that they,
too, are NP-complete.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.680
Thus, much of the theory of complexity
can be said to rest on this theorem.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.450
This is the high point of
our study of complexity.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.210
So what exactly is this
satisfiability problem?
