00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.410
So let's look at the convolution method.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.689
This is the mathematical formulation of the convolution method.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.850
Some of you may remember the cost correlation method,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.710
you might actually find some similarities.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.350
And we'll compare them side-by-side in a bit for

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.570
giving you a sense of how what the differences this would be between the two.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.920
One thing to note in here, is we would denote this by a symbol here.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.960
So now, rather than using the symbol which was this for

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.960
cross correlation, we use a star for doing convolutions.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.048
Again, the h kernel and F, and it basically allows you to generate an input,

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:40.170
or output G.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.170
One thing we notice is that basically in how we use cross-correlation,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.190
the filter is flipped in both dimensions.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.070
So first it's flipped bottom to top.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.180
That is, the top row is now at the bottom here.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.280
And of course the other flip is when it's right to left.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.380
And then we can apply cross correlation.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.099
So in essence we would have been able to do cross correlation, we're using this

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.120
formulation if you've taken the kernel, and process it to has two flips.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.620
One a flip in the horizontal axis, so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.170
the top row would be switched with the bottom.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.270
And then the second flip where we would actually do a flip from the right to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.450
left, where the right row and the left rows would be swapped.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.430
So that would be a complete flip to generate a new kernel, and

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.680
if you applied this kernel in this formulation,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.290
this would become a colon to a cross correlation method.
