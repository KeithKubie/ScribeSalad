00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.870
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Good
 morning.

00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:12.380
 This is such an exciting
 morning for us.  My name is

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:15.780
 Sridhar Ramaswamy.  I run the
 Ads and Commerce team here at

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.160
 Google.
 Music occupies a really

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:22.272
 special place in all of our
 hearts.  We all remember our

00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:25.185
 lives by our favorite
 melodies and the times when

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:28.696
 we
 we heard them.

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:34.376
 The time when Roja first came
 out, I distinctly remember as

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:39.687
 a time that my life with my
 fiancee, my wife, then was

00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:44.622
 forming.  So music really
 touches all of us in ways

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:49.992
 that are incredibly perm and
  personal

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:51.802
 and special.
 And the people who create

00:00:51.803 --> 00:00:54.912
 this music literally can move
 entire countries and

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.219
generations.
 And A.R. Rahman is one of the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.432
 world's most renowned
 musicians.  And when I heard

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.542
 that he was visiting the
 area, the first thing, of

00:01:09.543 --> 00:01:13.332
 course, I did was buy tickets
 for me and my wife to see his

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.123
 concert this evening.  And I
 am very excited about that. 

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.830
 And then when I was given the
 opportunity to actually have

00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:22.460
 him here, have him be in
 front of all of you, I jumped

00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:26.840
 at that opportunity.  And,
 you know, it's going to be

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:32.450
 quite an amazing time.
 A.R. Rahman is, of course, as

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:37.482
 I said, one of the world's
 most famous, most renowned

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:42.643
 moo sigses, known
 musicians, known for his

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:46.253
 unique style of blending
 instruments, performers,

00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:48.264
 working with people across
 the world.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:55.156
 His accomplishments are also
 stunning.  He, of course, has

00:01:55.166 --> 00:02:00.905
 won two Academy Awards, two
 grammy awards, and in

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:05.465
 addition, he's won four
 national music awards in

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:11.655
 India, 15 film for music
 awards, and 13 film for south

00:02:11.656 --> 00:02:15.448
 India music awards.
 And while he's an amazing

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:20.860
 musician, he's also a deep
 humanist that has contributed

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:24.670
 heavily to the cause of
 impoverished women and

00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:29.895
 children.  And he's also
 started the K.M.

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:32.885
 conservatory.  This was in
 2008, to help aspiring

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:35.825
 musicians reach their true
 potential.

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:42.175
 And it's my incredible
 privilege, honor, and

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:45.925
 pleasure to have A.R. on
 stage with us today.

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:47.835
 Please give him a big round
 of applause.

00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:49.836
 [ Applause ]

00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:53.641
 [ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:59.082
Welcome.

00:03:01.142 --> 00:03:03.142
 [ Applause ]

00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:11.063
Welcome to Google.  We are so
 delighted to have you here. 

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:17.243
 We have about a 500 Googlers
 here, and we also have a live

00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:20.863
 stream on YouTube that tons
 of people are watching. 

00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:23.483
 We'll get you the stats on
 how many people are watching. 

00:03:23.484 --> 00:03:26.773
 I know my mom is watching
 from Austin.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:29.026
 [ Laughter ]
 And I thought, you know, I

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:33.092
 would kick this off with a
 few questions.

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:36.177
 But before that, I was told
 by your team that you

00:03:36.178 --> 00:03:39.787
 actually wanted to be,
 believe it or not, a computer

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:41.705
 engineer when he was growing
 up.

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:45.995
 [ Laughter ]
 Well, I am happy to say that

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:50.285
 Google's loss is the world's
 gain.  So we're very happy

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.095
 you decided not to be a
 computer engineer.

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:56.395
 But in case you change your
 mind, if you decided to be,

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:59.505
 we will keep a spot reserved
 for you, and that you can

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.506
 have this --
 [ Cheers and applause

00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:06.197
 ]
  &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Thank you. 

00:04:06.198 --> 00:04:09.387
 I'm very, very pleased to be
 here.  And nice to see all of

00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:12.108
 you.
 I don't get up in the morning

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.808
 normally, but I had to do
 especially for --

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:15.843
 [ Laughter ]
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  So this

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:18.223
 is someone who will make all
 of our engineers proud.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:22.513
 I asked him, you know, where
 do you come from?  He said he

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:24.723
 flew over from L.A. this
 morning.  And I said, okay,

00:04:24.724 --> 00:04:26.663
 you must have gotten up
 early.  When did you go to

00:04:26.664 --> 00:04:32.113
 sleep?  He said, normally, I
 sleep by 4:30.  And so it's

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:35.053
 really early for him.  And
 it's quite a treat for us.

00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:39.714
 You know, you have an
 incredible musical style that

00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:42.917
 blends traditional, modern,
 religious, and uses so many

00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:44.337
 different, you know,
 instruments.

00:04:44.338 --> 00:04:47.332
 Where do you draw the
 inspiration for this kind of

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:51.437
 music?  And how do you bring
 it all together?

00:04:51.438 --> 00:04:55.147
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I grew up
 listening to various kind of

00:04:55.148 --> 00:05:00.337
 music, and nobody told me
 what to listen to.  So when I

00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:04.237
 started composing, it was a
 part of my pallet.  It was

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.817
 not negsal, I'm going to do a
 beat here or a -- it came

00:05:07.818 --> 00:05:11.247
 naturally.
 And it felt right.

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:14.327
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And,
 you know, when you're

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:17.847
 thinking about composing, how
 does this music come to you? 

00:05:17.848 --> 00:05:22.626
 Is it something that you sit
 quietly to imagine?  Or do

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:25.052
 you think about a situation
 and the Melody flows into

00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:28.658
 your head?
 What is that like?

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.158
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I come from
 various sensibilities,

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:38.158
 because I was playing with
 the southern Indian composers

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.868
 before.  And I knew how the
 tunes would be, kind of. 

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.768
 Then I did commercials.  So
 in commercials, it's always,

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:50.349
 like, how do you catch the
 listener in five seconds, ten

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:54.988
 seconds, how do you make a
 tune memorable.  Constant --

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:58.675
 today, you look at them, and
 as if they want to say

00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:01.478
 something new and say the
 same thing.  It should be

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.084
 catchy, it should be
 memorable.

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:05.776
 I said, okay, I know that. 
 For three years, and then I

00:06:05.777 --> 00:06:09.056
 got sick of it.
 And when movies came in, when

00:06:09.057 --> 00:06:12.206
 I started scoring movies, all
 these things were in my head. 

00:06:12.207 --> 00:06:16.736
 So I used parts of different
 ideas from different

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:19.736
 experiences.
 Then later, now, after 20

00:06:19.737 --> 00:06:24.646
 years, I feel like I should
 move on.  And since I have a

00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:31.341
 classical conservatory back
 in chennai, to write more

00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:36.950
 pieces with more depth in it
 so people can play on piano

00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:39.961
 and write.  There's still
 time for that, I guess.

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:42.167
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy: 
 Speaking of movies, you know,

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:50.167
 you composed amazing scores. 
 But the whole process just

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:54.367
 seems so very daunting, of
 composing a score for an

00:06:54.368 --> 00:06:57.687
 entire music that is two
 hours long.  You know, for us

00:06:57.688 --> 00:07:00.977
 nonmusicians, you know, here,
 how do you even begin to

00:07:00.978 --> 00:07:04.657
 think about, you know, a
 process like that?  Do you

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:06.187
 work closely with the
 director and producer to get

00:07:06.188 --> 00:07:09.657
 a feel for what the story is? 
 How does this all, like, come

00:07:09.658 --> 00:07:13.629
 together from beginning to
 end?  It seems like such a

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.453
 Mammoth undertaking.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  It's simple,

00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:23.943
 yet complicated.
 First of all, you go into

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.143
 what the movie needs.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Yep.

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:30.323
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  And sometimes
 you go with it, and sometimes

00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:33.053
 you go against it.  Because
 if that kind of movie has

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:35.984
 come before, then you try a
 different treatment.      And

00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:38.594
 that treatment makes the
 whole movie newer.

00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:45.994
 So the various attributes we
 sit and brainstorm and get to

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:49.606
 a position where, okay, let's
 treat this movie like this.

00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:55.424
 Like in -- he was doing a
 romantic thing.  And I said

00:07:55.425 --> 00:07:59.304
 the sound of today has
 changed.  It has become very

00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:04.704
 (indiscernible).  But we need
 to have our style, our

00:08:04.705 --> 00:08:07.904
 footprint on it.
 So it took a while, probably

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:14.654
 two, three months to get a
 hybrid tone but still having

00:08:14.655 --> 00:08:17.874
 traditional stuff in it.  And
 people liked it, I guess,

00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:19.574
 so....
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And,

00:08:19.575 --> 00:08:23.864
 you know, of course, in
 India, language is another

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:28.179
 huge dimension.  So you have
 composed music now for, you

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.376
 know, films in a dozen
 languages.  And sometimes,

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:33.891
 you know, the same movie gets
 released, of course, in many,

00:08:33.892 --> 00:08:37.782
 many different languages.
 So how do you think about the

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:41.991
 interaction between music and
 the lyrics that you have put

00:08:41.992 --> 00:08:43.992
 into the modeldy?  How

00:08:47.802 --> 00:08:49.281
 Melody?  How many
 languages do you speak, by

00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:50.801
 the way?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I don't speak

00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:53.301
 any language properly.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Well.

00:08:53.302 --> 00:08:57.012
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  A little bit
 of English, a little bit of

00:08:57.013 --> 00:09:00.602
 TILAGU.  Hindi I can sing,
 but I can't speak.

00:09:00.603 --> 00:09:02.603
 [ Laughter ]

00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:05.607
 [ Applause ]
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  And I can

00:09:05.608 --> 00:09:10.117
 read a bit of Arabic.  So
 those are the things.  I

00:09:10.118 --> 00:09:14.122
 tried to learn Mandarin, but
 I --

00:09:14.123 --> 00:09:18.502
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And so
 when you are, you know --

00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:20.022
 when you're --
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Your question

00:09:20.023 --> 00:09:20.712
 about --
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  The

00:09:20.713 --> 00:09:23.422
 lyrics, who writes them.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  So last year,

00:09:23.423 --> 00:09:31.913
 I had done Hindi, TAMIL,
 Persian, and

00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:38.227
 Portuguese,
 which is a movie coming next

00:09:38.228 --> 00:09:46.243
 year, based on PELE.  And a
 Persian movie.

00:09:46.244 --> 00:09:50.528
 And then one movie was a
 (indiscernible) movie, a

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:56.248
 Hindi movie.  Yeah.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And do

00:09:56.249 --> 00:10:00.138
 you have, then, people
 translate some of the lyrics

00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:02.658
 that you write into these
 other languages?  Do you hear

00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:06.758
 them?  How much do you --
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  The director

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:09.148
 works very close with the
 lyric writer.

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:15.145
 But what the song has to say
 is one of my decisions, too. 

00:10:15.146 --> 00:10:18.365
 The title of the song and the
 notion of it, and -- so that

00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:21.847
 I work very closely, and the
 rest of the stuff they fill

00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:26.277
 up beautifully.
 And so half the -- it's a --

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:28.477
 when you're working on a
 movie, it's beautiful,

00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:34.347
 because if -- you have
 competent people working.  We

00:10:34.348 --> 00:10:37.767
 kind of have a healthy
 competition, and all of us

00:10:37.768 --> 00:10:41.177
 come to create one product,
 which is beautiful.

00:10:41.178 --> 00:10:43.777
 Sometimes it works.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy: 

00:10:43.778 --> 00:10:47.067
 That's -- well, I think it's
 worked more than sometimes,

00:10:47.068 --> 00:10:53.061
 as we all can attest.
 So I heard, by the way, that

00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:55.160
 you were at the White House
 recently.

00:10:55.161 --> 00:10:58.564
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Yeah.  There
 was a screening of (saying

00:10:58.565 --> 00:10:59.585
 name).
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:01.871
 amazing.  Did you get to meet
 President Obama?  What was

00:11:01.872 --> 00:11:03.376
 that experience like?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  No.  I met

00:11:03.377 --> 00:11:07.396
 him last time for the Indian
 state dinner.  He was a big

00:11:07.397 --> 00:11:13.376
 fan of Slumdog.  They send me
 Christmas cards.

00:11:13.377 --> 00:11:15.276
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Oh. 
 Woo-hoo!

00:11:15.277 --> 00:11:18.466
 [ Applause ]
 Yeah.  He hasn't sent me any.

00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:20.467
 [ Laughter ]

00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:23.986
How do you keep your energy
 up?  You know, there is --

00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:26.800
 you said you did a concert
 yesterday in L.A.  There's

00:11:26.801 --> 00:11:30.910
 the concert this evening in
 San Jose.  You're traveling

00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:33.514
 in between.  How do you just
 keep your energy up?

00:11:33.515 --> 00:11:35.804
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  All of it --
 where I started and people

00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:38.018
 saw all the listings, they
 were, like, what are you

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:41.517
 going to do?  Are you going
 to come back alive?

00:11:41.518 --> 00:11:43.527
 [ Laughter ]
 So -- but -- so when you're

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:46.434
 performing, it's a whole new
 energy.  And different places

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:50.644
 have different -- and people
 make you regenerate it, the

00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:52.124
 kind of love they give.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  You get

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:54.824
 that energy from the crowd?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Amazing.  So

00:11:54.825 --> 00:11:57.234
 far so good.  We just have
 three more to go.

00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:58.324
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  How
 many more?

00:11:58.325 --> 00:11:59.804
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Three more
 out of 18.

00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:01.416
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Okay. 
 So you're at the very end of

00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:04.136
 it.  That's amazing.  That is
 amazing.

00:12:04.137 --> 00:12:07.206
 And, of course, you had a
 number of celebrated

00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:11.241
 collaborations with many
 different people.  Anything

00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:14.543
 that you would highlight as
 being an amazingly special

00:12:14.544 --> 00:12:19.953
 experience, you know, a
 movie, an actor, a singer,

00:12:19.954 --> 00:12:22.003
 one of the, you know, other
 amazing folks like Mick

00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:24.353
 Jagger that you have
 collaborated with?  What

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:26.643
 stands out for you?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I've been

00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:30.953
 very, very lucky.  I'm very
 content, because I got --

00:12:30.954 --> 00:12:34.033
 first of all, one of my dream
 directors worked with me for

00:12:34.034 --> 00:12:38.158
 the first film, ROJA.     
 Then I worked with Andrew

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:41.258
 Lloyd Weber.  I worked with
 (saying name), all of them

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:46.458
 who I admired.
 I worked with (saying name). 

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:48.552
 And just before he passed
 away.

00:12:48.553 --> 00:12:55.665
 And I worked with Danny
 BOYLE, very sympathetic

00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:59.855
 towards music.  And I just
 met Terrence MALIC recently. 

00:12:59.856 --> 00:13:03.995
 We just met.  He was based in
 Austin.  He couldn't come for

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:06.605
 the show, but he
 (indiscernible) music.

00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:13.287
 And the one I want to work
 with may be Stevie Wonder.

00:13:13.288 --> 00:13:15.517
 I have met him twice, but,
 unfortunately, we couldn't

00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:16.697
 work together.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's

00:13:16.698 --> 00:13:19.917
 very cool.
 So I think we are going to

00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:25.207
 now take questions that have
 been submitted on the G+ page

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:28.609
 and on YouTube.  So it will
 be a mixture of questions

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.617
 that we are going to play on
 the monitor and things that

00:13:32.618 --> 00:13:38.620
 I'm going to read off that
 were submitted to us via G+.

00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:41.920
 So the first question, which
 is going to be on YouTube,

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:46.240
 it's from, of all places,
 Australia.  That's amazing. 

00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:49.832
 From Australian fans Fred
 Taylor and Daniel Lee.

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:53.002
 Could we roll the video
 number one, please.

00:13:53.003 --> 00:13:56.122
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.  My name is Fred.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; My name is Daniel.

00:13:56.123 --> 00:14:00.432
 &gt;&gt;&gt; We're from Australia, and
 we're big fabs fans of your 

00:14:00.433 --> 00:14:01.832
work. 
 We've both got some questions

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.134
 today.  My question is, can
 you tell us more about your

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.736
 latest technology that you
 use when composing music.

00:14:06.737 --> 00:14:09.648
 &gt;&gt;&gt; And on that note, I just
 want to know how you feel

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:13.662
 about the use of
 (indiscernible).

00:14:13.663 --> 00:14:15.663
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks a

00:14:17.463 --> 00:14:19.463
 lot.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:

00:14:20.463 --> 00:14:23.942
  My philosophy
 about using technology is,

00:14:23.943 --> 00:14:26.444
 you have to master them.  It
 needs to work for you, and

00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:30.934
 you shouldn't work for that.
 And so when I come to a

00:14:30.935 --> 00:14:36.254
 stage, if I'm using software,
 I wait till I master it and

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:39.984
 my thoughts go straight into
 that rather than taking the

00:14:39.985 --> 00:14:43.845
 manual, oh, how do you use
 this?  How do you edit?

00:14:43.846 --> 00:14:47.754
 So even if it takes two
 years, I'll be in another

00:14:47.755 --> 00:14:51.258
 room, jamming with it.  And
 one day, I'll say, guys,

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:53.568
 change it, bring it to the
 main room.  So that's been

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:55.368
 going.
 I used to work with hardware

00:14:55.369 --> 00:14:59.978
 sequences before.  And to
 switch to logic, which is

00:14:59.979 --> 00:15:05.270
 what I'm using, Logic Pro, it
 took two years.  I watched a

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:10.180
 German programmer who worked
 with me, (saying names), he

00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:13.360
 was using it, and a couple of
 Australians were using it. 

00:15:13.361 --> 00:15:18.380
 And it took me probably '97
 or '98 is when I switched to

00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:23.990
 total software.
 And so I'm using Logic Pro,

00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:29.790
 to answer your question,  
 and then we use PROTOSE for

00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:32.800
 mixing.  And then we use a
 bit of (saying name) to add

00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:39.012
 harmnies and everything.
 We use (indiscernible)

00:15:39.013 --> 00:15:41.802
 sometimes intentionally just
 to give an effect.  Because

00:15:41.803 --> 00:15:43.702
 we have amazing singers.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's

00:15:43.703 --> 00:15:47.602
 cool.  I think that -- we all
 see the inspiring work that

00:15:47.603 --> 00:15:52.802
 comes out.  But, clearly,
 you're saying just to change

00:15:52.803 --> 00:15:55.112
 one instrument or one aspect
 of the music, you literally

00:15:55.113 --> 00:15:58.348
 go through years of training
 and practice.  I think there

00:15:58.349 --> 00:16:02.522
 is a lot to be learned there.
 The second question is from

00:16:02.523 --> 00:16:07.206
 G+, from Google+.  And it's
 from user Balaji T.  And his

00:16:07.207 --> 00:16:10.616
 question is, what is your
 advice and motivation for

00:16:10.617 --> 00:16:13.720
 young people who want to
 pursue a career in music? 

00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:17.500
 With what amount of knowledge
 and content does one break

00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:20.220
 through?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I feel

00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:22.740
 whatever -- first of all, you
 need to have an ear for

00:16:22.741 --> 00:16:26.920
 music.  You need to love
 beautiful stuff.  Then it

00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:31.520
 becomes part of you.
 It's even within spirituality

00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:34.220
 or music, the same thing, the
 more you start getting into

00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:37.732
 something, and then it
 becomes you.

00:16:37.733 --> 00:16:41.648
 And so if you're
 halfheartedly doing something

00:16:41.649 --> 00:16:44.228
 and you don't give enough
 time, it's not worth it. 

00:16:44.229 --> 00:16:47.838
 But -- and you don't even
 think about sustenance,

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:50.555
 nothing, just go and do it
 and become a master of it,

00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:52.556
 people will come following
 you.  And that's the

00:16:56.156 --> 00:16:56.855
 truth.
 [ Applause ]

00:16:56.856 --> 00:16:58.275
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's
 wonderful.

00:16:58.276 --> 00:17:03.946
 Next up, we have a video
 question from Kevin Jenkinson

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:07.745
 from Dublin, Ireland.
 Let's roll video number two,

00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:09.345
 please.
 [ Video ]

00:17:09.346 --> 00:17:12.458
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Kevin Jenkinson here,
 journalist in Dublin,

00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:17.962
 Ireland.  With the success of
 Slumdog Millionaire and the

00:17:17.963 --> 00:17:20.734
 super bands, performing with
 Mick Jagger, you've been a

00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:23.264
 global icon.  What is the one
 wish you have for the world? 

00:17:23.265 --> 00:17:25.724
 And how do you think your
 fans can contribute to that

00:17:25.725 --> 00:17:27.667
 one wish globally?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  What is --

00:17:27.668 --> 00:17:30.757
 what did he say?
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  He's

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:33.147
 saying what is the one wish
 you have for the world and

00:17:33.148 --> 00:17:36.057
 how do you think your fans
 can contribute to that one

00:17:36.058 --> 00:17:38.968
 wish globally?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:

00:17:42.358 --> 00:17:48.557
  There is a
 lot of I would say impatience

00:17:48.558 --> 00:17:53.169
 with many things, you know. 
 Sometimes even on the table,

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.854
 if your food comes late, you
 start questioning and saying,

00:17:56.855 --> 00:17:59.556
 why did you bring it late and
 starting trouble.  But you

00:17:59.557 --> 00:18:03.172
 can also be patient, you can
 be calm, in the Zen mode, so

00:18:03.173 --> 00:18:06.372
 that you don't spoil the, you
 know, aura of the place.

00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:07.682
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Yeah.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  And that

00:18:07.683 --> 00:18:12.862
 comes even in a major level. 
 And in a street, in a state,

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:18.582
 in a country, in the world,
 even on the net, you see

00:18:18.583 --> 00:18:21.962
 YouTube.  You just put
 anything, and you have 30

00:18:21.963 --> 00:18:27.766
 comments down about the race,
 about sex, about everything. 

00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:30.776
 And it's so unfortunate.  And
 then nobody wants to see the

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:33.781
 video.  They want to see what
 the comments are.

00:18:33.782 --> 00:18:35.993
 [ Laughter ]
 They're so (indiscernible).

00:18:35.994 --> 00:18:41.685
 So I'm going to probably have
 albums, comments are off. 

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:44.915
 Just listen to the music and
 internalize it and speak to

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.085
 yourself.
 And to deal with many major

00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:51.575
 situations, I think we are
 all judgmental, we are -- for

00:18:51.576 --> 00:18:54.185
 me, I think I'm judging
 myself constantly.  So I

00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:58.276
 don't have time for judging
 outside.

00:18:58.286 --> 00:19:01.595
 And that's the basic thing. 
 I think today's, if we are

00:19:01.596 --> 00:19:05.265
 more patient, then we are
 more open and nonjudgmental,

00:19:05.266 --> 00:19:06.897
 I think the world would be a
 better place.

00:19:06.898 --> 00:19:08.987
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  I love
 that.  More patience, more

00:19:08.988 --> 00:19:10.920
 tolerance.  That's wonderful.
 [ Applause ]

00:19:16.494 --> 00:19:20.393
The next question is from
 Ashutosh Gupta.  And he asks,

00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:24.403
 name the one album, by any
 artist, that has influenced

00:19:24.404 --> 00:19:26.884
 and inspired you and your
 music the

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:31.103
 most.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  There is not

00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:33.123
 one.  There are many,
 actually.

00:19:33.124 --> 00:19:43.013
 Peter Gabriel, John Williams,
 and (saying names).  Then in

00:19:43.014 --> 00:19:50.733
 south India, we have (saying
 names).  And north India,

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:56.209
NOSHAD, (saying name).
 So if you look at the beauty

00:19:56.219 --> 00:20:00.828
 in everything, you -- as I
 told you before, it affects

00:20:00.829 --> 00:20:06.718
 you in a good way.  And it
 restarts all of you.  And

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:10.198
 even music, it's very
 important.      Rather than

00:20:10.199 --> 00:20:13.418
 shutting off and thinking --
 and then you can go further

00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:17.428
 from there, where they left.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's

00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:20.418
 great.
 And, you know, personally, I

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:24.520
 think the loss of (saying
 name) is one of the most

00:20:24.521 --> 00:20:27.308
 tragic things that's happened
 to music in many, many years

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:31.544
 at such a young age.
 We have another YouTube

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:35.624
 question.  This is from
 Google intern Shailee Samar. 

00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:39.084
 And she wants to know what
 shaped your path when you

00:20:39.085 --> 00:20:42.544
 were younger.
 Let's roll the video, please.

00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:46.494
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is SHAILEE. 
 I'm 19 years old.  I'm one of

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.734
 the very excited interns in
 this audience.

00:20:48.735 --> 00:20:51.214
 When you were 19 years old,
 what sorts of ideas,

00:20:51.215 --> 00:20:53.924
 thoughts, and dreams did you
 have in your head and heart? 

00:20:53.925 --> 00:20:58.054
 And how have those shaped you
 to become who you are today?

00:20:58.055 --> 00:21:02.597
  &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  When I was
 19, I was working, I

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.560
 guess. 
 I was very confused.

00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:10.830
 [ Laughter ]
 I didn't know whether anybody

00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:14.250
 would give a girl to me to
 get married.

00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:16.040
 [ Laughter ]
 Because I left school.  I

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:20.450
 left high school.  I was
 playing the studios.  And

00:21:20.451 --> 00:21:23.360
 there was constant gossip in
 the studio that said music

00:21:23.361 --> 00:21:25.770
 and all the film industry
 will end very soon, we will

00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:29.060
 go jobless.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  What

00:21:29.061 --> 00:21:32.060
 kept you going?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  There was no

00:21:32.061 --> 00:21:35.360
 other job I knew.

00:21:42.662 --> 00:21:45.972
 when did you really begin to
 feel like what you are doing

00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:48.672
 was a profession, that --
 something that you could, you

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:52.522
 know, keep doing for a long
 time?

00:21:52.523 --> 00:21:55.172
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  After the
 first movie, after ROJA, I

00:21:55.173 --> 00:21:59.232
 think the whole
 (indiscernible), and when I

00:21:59.233 --> 00:22:02.632
 realized I have to learn a
 lot is when, you know, the

00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:06.732
 motivation to -- and I was
 getting paid for learning.

00:22:06.733 --> 00:22:08.732
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's
 right.  I mean, that's --

00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:11.822
 that's what the best jobs
 have, which is what I tell my

00:22:11.823 --> 00:22:14.816
 children, for example.  It's
 not a job if you love it. 

00:22:14.817 --> 00:22:17.037
 And the fact that you get
 paid for it just becomes,

00:22:17.038 --> 00:22:19.649
 like, this big bonus on the
 side.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.608
 Next question is from
 Srikanth Marthi.  This is

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:26.718
 from G+.
 How do you choose your

00:22:26.719 --> 00:22:31.218
 movies?  Based on the
 director or the script?  And

00:22:31.219 --> 00:22:35.148
 she also says, since Slumdog,
 your Indian film scores have

00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:39.278
 had a distinct international
 flavor to them.  Was this a

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:44.068
 conscious effort?  And will
 you do a pure Indian album,

00:22:44.069 --> 00:22:46.268
 taking us back to our early
 days?

00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:47.168
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Many
 questions.

00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:49.358
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Lots of
 questions.  Four questions.

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:50.768
 [ Laughter ]
 Let's start with the simple

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.375
 one.  How do you choose your
 movies?  Is it the director? 

00:22:53.376 --> 00:22:56.175
 Is it the script?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I choose with

00:22:56.176 --> 00:22:59.886
 the necks of intention of a 
team.  If

00:22:59.887 --> 00:23:01.889
 they have good intention and
 they have done something good

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.969
 before, at least I know they
 are going to try to do

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.789
 something good.  Most of the
 times, it's good.  Sometimes

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.489
 it goes down the wrong path.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.269
 then the other ones were,
 after you did Slumdog

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.333
 Millionaire, your music has a
 very international feel.  Is

00:23:14.334 --> 00:23:18.183
 this conscious?  Do you want
 to, you know, go back --

00:23:18.184 --> 00:23:20.413
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I think the
 expectations were, like, if

00:23:20.414 --> 00:23:22.593
 you take iTunes or
 anything, anybody can access

00:23:22.594 --> 00:23:23.303
 that music.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's

00:23:23.304 --> 00:23:24.293
 right.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  It doesn't

00:23:24.294 --> 00:23:30.112
 have to be, you know, certain
 people.  If they want to

00:23:30.113 --> 00:23:33.604
 listen to my music.  So it
 had to have a consistency in

00:23:33.605 --> 00:23:36.827
 it.  And maybe because of
 that.

00:23:36.828 --> 00:23:39.834
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And you
 know, of course, you also

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:42.734
 have a lot of fans on
 YouTube.  How do you think

00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:45.404
 about YouTube as a medium? 
 I was checking your channel

00:23:45.405 --> 00:23:48.634
 last night.  You have, if I
 remember correctly, something

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:52.374
 like 150,000 subscribers to
 your channel.  What do you

00:23:52.375 --> 00:23:54.094
 think of the medium.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I think

00:23:54.095 --> 00:23:58.534
 YouTube is a blessing. 
 Because there was a

00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:00.614
 bottleneck before.  If
 anybody was talented, they

00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:03.234
 had to go through sources,
 and they -- oh, can you put

00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:06.538
 me on this thing, can you put
 me on the cover.  Nobody

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:10.255
 cares anymore.  Even --
 they're good or bad, they put

00:24:10.256 --> 00:24:11.545
 it on YouTube.
 [ Laughter ]

00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:14.767
 I discovered this dancer was
 with us, called (saying

00:24:14.768 --> 00:24:20.876
 name), she's from Croatia. 
 And so I saw -- suddenly

00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:24.186
 stumbled on her.  And I said,
 oh, she's good.  I know I was

00:24:24.187 --> 00:24:27.866
 doing a music video for my
 assistant.  And I asked my

00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:33.677
 assistant, Vivian, to call
 her.  And she said, A.R., I'm

00:24:33.687 --> 00:24:35.496
 Marilyn Monroe.  She never
 believed that.

00:24:35.497 --> 00:24:39.696
 And, of course, I just got
 on YouTube, JANITA, who is

00:24:39.697 --> 00:24:42.280
 singing this thing on
 YouTube  .  Many people,

00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:42.890
 actually.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  That's

00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:45.890
 wonderful.  So you really are
 seeing a lot of people,

00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:47.982
 amazing people, express
 themselves through YouTube

00:24:47.983 --> 00:24:51.094
 and get discovered in ways
 that have not really happened

00:24:51.095 --> 00:24:51.964
 before.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  They don't

00:24:51.965 --> 00:24:54.107
 have to count on anybody. 
 They can just do it.

00:24:54.108 --> 00:24:55.311
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Just do
 it.

00:24:55.312 --> 00:24:58.792
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  It opens your
 mind, gives a sense of....

00:24:58.802 --> 00:25:02.101
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And you
 would consider, for example,

00:25:02.102 --> 00:25:05.991
 you know, broadcasting your
 jam sessions just for people

00:25:05.992 --> 00:25:10.911
 to get inside, into how you
 think and work?

00:25:10.912 --> 00:25:13.151
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Just that
 when you expose yourself too

00:25:13.152 --> 00:25:16.301
 much, they don't want you.
 [ Laughter ]

00:25:16.302 --> 00:25:18.302
 [ Applause

00:25:20.797 --> 00:25:21.186
 ]
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  I hear

00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:26.410
 that.  I hear that.
 The next question is from

00:25:26.411 --> 00:25:29.113
 Halima Zaman, from
 Bangladesh.

00:25:29.114 --> 00:25:33.919
 And she says, sometimes a
 person is blessed with lots

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.019
 of potential but doesn't have
 support from their family. 

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.019
 What advice would you have
 for them to follow and

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.029
 fulfill their dream?
 Was your family supportive,

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.019
 by the way, when you wanted
 to pursue music?

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.209
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Yeah.  It was
 opposite.  My mother wanted

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.829
 me to do music, and I didn't
 want to do music.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.909
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Oh.
 What advice would you have

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.711
 for her?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I think she

00:25:57.712 --> 00:26:01.031
 should believe and pray, and
 God will send somebody to

00:26:01.032 --> 00:26:03.231
 her.
 That's what -- I feel that

00:26:03.232 --> 00:26:04.703
 there's always support,
 biggest support.

00:26:04.704 --> 00:26:06.143
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Right,
 right, right.

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:14.271
This is a good one.
 This is from Prasanna

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:18.121
 Ramachandran on G+.  And he
 says, what's the one thing

00:26:18.122 --> 00:26:21.841
 about A.R. Rahman that nobody
 knows yet?

00:26:21.842 --> 00:26:23.931
 [ Laughter ]
 This might go back to your

00:26:23.932 --> 00:26:28.231
 too much exposure point.
 [ Laughter ]

00:26:28.232 --> 00:26:33.137
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I think
 mostly everybody knows

00:26:33.138 --> 00:26:34.947
 everything about me.  Maybe
 my --

00:26:34.948 --> 00:26:37.927
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Your
 life's an open book.

00:26:37.928 --> 00:26:41.367
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  My wife
 should say something.

00:26:41.368 --> 00:26:44.239
  &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  We have
 a question from YouTube

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.248
 now.  This is from Somas
 Thyagaraja.  And he wants to

00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:50.849
 know more about the creation
 process.  I think that's the

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.149
 thing that we are all
 fascinated by.  How does this

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.429
 amazing processor of process of
 such

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.659
 beautiful music happen.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; My question for you today

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.639
 is I've always been curious
 how you come up with these

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.229
 amazing songs one after the
 other for 25 years.  I'm

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.650
 curious to hear right from
 the inception of the track

00:27:09.651 --> 00:27:12.140
 and the basic tune that you
 have, how do you develop that

00:27:12.141 --> 00:27:14.830
 into the final song that we
 all get to hear?  It would be

00:27:14.831 --> 00:27:17.329
 great if you can share, you
 know, your experiences from,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.051
 like, a couple of memorable
 tracks of how it came about

00:27:20.052 --> 00:27:23.262
 and how you ended up with
 that final magic that we all

00:27:23.272 --> 00:27:25.251
 get to hear.  I'm sure
 millions of people in the

00:27:25.252 --> 00:27:27.598
 world would love to hear that
 as well.

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:33.128
 Thank you so much.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  No, like an

00:27:33.129 --> 00:27:38.388
 artist, who reflects whatever
 is inside on a painting,

00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:43.079
 music is also like that.  If
 I am in a Zen mode, if I am

00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:48.000
 peaceful, and then the music
 which comes out mirrors it.

00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:50.089
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  So do
 you have to get angry to --

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.069
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  No.  I just
 need to put a beat and start

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.499
 playing with it.
 Mostly, I don't do stuff like

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.775
 that in dark.  I don't know
 why.  The world is, anyway,

00:28:02.776 --> 00:28:11.151
 dark.
 So then what I do is, I do a

00:28:11.152 --> 00:28:14.901
 lot of ideas, and probably
 two sessions or three

00:28:14.902 --> 00:28:18.171
 sessions, have 20 ideas. 
 It's very, very important to

00:28:18.172 --> 00:28:22.903
 have a lot of ideas.  And
 then listen to it back and

00:28:22.904 --> 00:28:28.103
 compare it to my work and
 compare it to greater works

00:28:28.104 --> 00:28:31.293
 which you've heard before,
 where does it stand.  So what

00:28:31.294 --> 00:28:32.793
 does it take to make it
 beautiful.

00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:36.695
 So if it's very simple as a
 tune, then the arrangement

00:28:36.696 --> 00:28:38.696
 actually implements it in

00:28:40.908 --> 00:28:42.621
 complements it in a
 different way.  If you have

00:28:42.622 --> 00:28:45.912
 both together, you get a
 beautiful lyric.      So

00:28:45.913 --> 00:28:48.842
 there are many, many stages
 where you can achieve.  Still

00:28:48.843 --> 00:28:51.332
 it's not good, you throw it
 off and do something else.

00:28:51.333 --> 00:28:53.532
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  How
 often do you end up

00:28:53.533 --> 00:28:56.231
 discarding melodies and songs
 which you have created.

00:28:56.232 --> 00:28:58.538
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  5%. 
 Sometimes we do a song and I

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:02.808
 say, no, I don't like it.  If
 you're trying too hard, I

00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:06.028
 don't think it's worth it. 
 It has to come fresh.

00:29:06.029 --> 00:29:07.248
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Right,
 right.

00:29:07.249 --> 00:29:13.238
 What do you see in the future
 for you, next five years? 

00:29:13.239 --> 00:29:16.031
 What are things that you
 would like to get done?

00:29:16.032 --> 00:29:18.337
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  There are
 many things, actually.  After

00:29:18.338 --> 00:29:22.154
 starting the school, the
 college, we have amazing

00:29:22.155 --> 00:29:23.144
 talent --
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Tell us

00:29:23.145 --> 00:29:24.954
 a little bit about this
 college.  I don't think we

00:29:24.955 --> 00:29:26.354
 know.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  The college

00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:28.024
 started in 2008.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Yep.

00:29:28.025 --> 00:29:29.743
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  It has a
 conservatory.

00:29:29.744 --> 00:29:31.053
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  This is
 in Chennai?

00:29:31.054 --> 00:29:36.358
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  In Chennai.
 The idea was to give the best

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:40.158
 training in classical and
 Hindustani.

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:43.268
 So we have -- we've been
 doing it five years.  We

00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:47.928
 opened a campus now two years
 back.  (indiscernible) came

00:29:47.929 --> 00:29:51.658
 and opened it up.
 And the main motive is to

00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:57.668
 give the kids who want to
 learn music something unique

00:29:57.669 --> 00:30:01.452
 which India doesn't give. 
 And to get underprivileged

00:30:01.453 --> 00:30:06.061
 kids to -- to make them
 trained in classical. 

00:30:06.062 --> 00:30:09.161
 Because for studio musicians,
 studio work, we don't have

00:30:09.162 --> 00:30:12.983
 string players or brass
 players or anything.  The

00:30:12.984 --> 00:30:15.073
 previous generation is there. 
 But the younger generation

00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:17.863
 don't want to learn that.  So
 probably in a few years,

00:30:17.864 --> 00:30:20.723
 we'll have an orchestra then.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  So this

00:30:20.724 --> 00:30:22.653
 is -- this is, like --
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  In fact, we

00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:25.573
 have one on YouTube.  It's
 called the sunshine

00:30:25.574 --> 00:30:26.683
 orchestra.      You can check
 it out.

00:30:26.684 --> 00:30:28.193
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Okay.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  It was based

00:30:28.194 --> 00:30:29.273
 on that.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  And

00:30:29.274 --> 00:30:32.876
 these students go through a
 structured curriculum?  Is --

00:30:32.877 --> 00:30:33.686
 so --
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Yes.

00:30:33.687 --> 00:30:35.589
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  So this
 is not the traditional, like

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.293
 the (saying name).
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  No.  We have

00:30:38.294 --> 00:30:43.496
 teachers from Armenia,
 Scotland, the U.S., U.K., all

00:30:43.497 --> 00:30:46.006
 over the place.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Wow.

00:30:46.007 --> 00:30:49.894
 And how big is this?  How
 many students are part of the

00:30:49.895 --> 00:30:51.274
 school?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  It's -- I

00:30:51.275 --> 00:30:55.004
 think we have around 200, 300
 students.  And the campus is

00:30:55.005 --> 00:30:56.904
 around 40,000 square feet.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Okay. 

00:30:56.905 --> 00:31:00.004
 That's a big campus.  That's
 wonderful.  That's really

00:31:00.005 --> 00:31:02.494
 wonderful.
 And --

00:31:02.495 --> 00:31:06.694
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  So the
 question is because we have

00:31:06.695 --> 00:31:09.004
 this access to all these
 beautiful things.

00:31:09.005 --> 00:31:12.738
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Yeah.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  My -- my part

00:31:12.739 --> 00:31:17.438
 would be to write more
 things.  I will probably set

00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:23.138
 up musicals, coming from the
 product of the conservatory.

00:31:23.139 --> 00:31:26.530
   So India can watch
 something unique coming from

00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:32.610
 our culture, yet having the
 sensibilities of whatever any

00:31:32.611 --> 00:31:34.850
 of us would like.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  and how

00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.140
 do you see Indian music
 evolving?  Of course, you are

00:31:37.141 --> 00:31:39.640
 in -- you know, you are in
 Chennai, which is also the

00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:45.619
 heart of things like CARNATIC
 music, which continues to be

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.727
 a very vibrant art form.  How
 do you see Indian music

00:31:48.728 --> 00:31:52.449
 itself evolving, again, over
 the next several years?

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.542
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Things are
 opening up, I think.  You can

00:31:54.552 --> 00:31:58.475
 see a lot of innovative
 things starting to come.  I

00:31:58.476 --> 00:32:02.800
 think when that goes to the
 next stage, I think I feel

00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:05.603
 there will be something in
 it.  Right now, it's still in

00:32:05.604 --> 00:32:09.513
 a shell, I feel.  Classical
 music -- it has to be

00:32:09.514 --> 00:32:13.023
 protected.  But some people
 can be more liberal and then

00:32:13.024 --> 00:32:17.122
 can go and do some wilder
 things without spoiling the

00:32:17.123 --> 00:32:18.222
 sanctity of it.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  I think

00:32:18.223 --> 00:32:21.222
 you have done an amazing job
 of being innovative, of

00:32:21.223 --> 00:32:25.012
 pushing boundaries, of
 blending things in a way that

00:32:25.013 --> 00:32:27.776
 all of us have felt reflects
 who we are as people.  I

00:32:27.777 --> 00:32:32.322
 think that's part of what is
 amazing about your music.

00:32:32.323 --> 00:32:34.437
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I get bored.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  What's

00:32:34.438 --> 00:32:35.607
 that?
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  I get bored

00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:36.727
 of the same thing.
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  We are

00:32:36.728 --> 00:32:39.529
 happy, because your music
 keeps changing.  It keeps

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.539
 engaging us.  So I think that
 is wonderful.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.529
 So this is actually a great
 segue to the last part of the

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:52.739
 show.  I am told that you're
 going to do a little

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.740
 performance for us.
 [ Cheers and applause

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.253
 ]
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Yeah.  If you

00:33:05.254 --> 00:33:08.746
 want to hear us all sing, you
 should come to the show.

00:33:08.747 --> 00:33:09.636
 [ Laughter ]
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  We'll

00:33:09.637 --> 00:33:12.143
 be there.
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Okay.  Sure.

00:33:12.144 --> 00:33:16.670
 It's -- last night was wild,
 actually.  Very nice people.

00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:18.170
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Lots of
 audience participation?

00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:19.160
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  Yeah. 
 Beautiful.

00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:21.270
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  We look
 forward to that.

00:33:21.271 --> 00:33:23.280
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  What's this? 
 Oh.

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.530
 &gt;&gt;Sridhar Ramaswamy:  Please
 give him a big round of

00:33:28.531 --> 00:33:31.390
 applause again.
 [ Applause ]

00:33:53.068 --> 00:33:55.068
 [ Music ]

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:44.294
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman: 
 (indiscernible) what I am

00:36:44.295 --> 00:36:45.034
 doing.
 [ Cheers and applause ]

00:40:30.682 --> 00:40:32.682

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.619
 &gt;&gt;A.R. Rahman:  That's it.
 [ Laughter ]

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.928
 Thank you so much.
 [ Applause ]

 you, A.R. for coming.  We are
