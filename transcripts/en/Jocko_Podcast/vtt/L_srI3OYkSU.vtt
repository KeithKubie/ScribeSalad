1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.850
What would be a good approach to effectively

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.480
what would be a good approach to effectively leading a team where instead of

3
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:12.750
taking ownership of their responsibilities and working towards team goals,

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.530
each team member is just trying to be the boss.
Okay,

5
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.960
so a couple things here.

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.920
The e you want to let them be the boss of their tasks,
right?

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.340
That's what you're trying to do.
So that,
that makes sense.
And one of the ways,

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:28.290
if they're,
if they want to be the boss of everything,

9
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.260
maybe you give them a little bit more as much decision making process that you

10
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.810
can as to what tasks or what projects they're in charge of.

11
00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:37.740
So that makes them feel a little bit like they're empowered and I shouldn't say

12
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.530
makes them feel like they're empowered.
You actually are in Palo.
Yeah.

13
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.650
You know what I mean?
So there's a,

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.130
there's a pretty significant distinction because once again,

15
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.240
people will recognize if you're just letting them do it to make them feel good

16
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.690
about it,
they're going to know that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jocko,
thanks for the decision.

17
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.250
You gave me a choice of one thing.
Thank you.
The color of pants.
Yeah.
So,

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.930
so you know,

19
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.960
maybe let them really express their authority and leadership on owning what it

20
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:06.150
is that they're owning it.

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.900
But the question says they're not taking ownership of their responsibilities.

22
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.180
So let's make sure first that we're not,

23
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.950
that we're giving them full reign and full ownership of their responsibilities

24
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.040
and we're not micromanaging in there.
Now,
if that,

25
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.180
if we're beyond that and,

26
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.710
and we got people that just want to be in charge of the whole thing.

27
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.160
Well cool.
That's,
that's actually awesome.

28
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.250
You want to be in charge of everything of Echo isn't in our team and he wants to

29
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.420
be in charge of everything.
Hey guys,
check it out right now.
This next,
you know,

30
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.460
project that we're working,
echo is going to run it.

31
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.140
I'm going to sit back and by the way,
next project bill,

32
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.140
you're running and next project,
Fred,
you're running.

33
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.280
Now we're all going to get to actually get in the hot seat and he,

34
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.170
and I'll tell you what you're going to see.
Number one,

35
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.190
you're gonna see some people that go,
oh,

36
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.830
they wanted to sit in the back of church,

37
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.890
but they don't actually want to be responsible for anything.

38
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.770
So that puts them to rest right away.
You're also,

39
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.110
what's going to happen with everybody is they're all going to see that this

40
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:07.110
thing that looks so easy from the back of the room is a lot harder than they

41
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:09.210
think.
That's what it's like running a seal mission.

42
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.490
The guy in the back that's never been in charge before,
is it?
Oh,

43
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.540
we should just do it like this and that guy you said,
okay,

44
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.890
here you run this,
and then you know,
in six hours they come up and say,
Hey,

45
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.600
oh yeah,

46
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:25.380
you give me a hand with how we were supposed to contact and deconflict with

47
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:28.140
these other units.
Oh,
okay.
It's a little drunker than you thought.
Maybe isn't it?

48
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.820
But you actually put people in charge of things if they want to be in charge of

49
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.130
things,
put them in charge of things.
It's great.
And you know,

50
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.590
don't let them fall on her face.
Don't let him get anyone killed.
Don't let them,

51
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.180
you know,
get anyone injured or losing any strategic ground.

52
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.320
We're not going to do that,

53
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.610
but we're going to let them have the opportunity to step up and lead it if they

54
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:52.290
do a good job.
Sweet.
Sweet.
Now you've got them.

55
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.330
You can rely on them.
You can actually put them in charge of projects.

56
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:56.280
Now you don't have to micromanage them.
You don't have to watch over them.

57
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.980
This is a,
this is a no lose situation.
This happened actually one of my,

58
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.240
one of my platoon was going through training and one of the platoon commanders

59
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.390
came up to me and we're just putting the platoon through training and he comes

60
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.800
up and he's like,
oh,
Mike Platoon chief wants to run everything and is said good.

61
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.680
Let them run everything.
Let them run everything.
That's perfect.

62
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.690
Then you can focus on,
you know,
other things.
Don't worry about it,
but ego,

63
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.040
right?
We want to be running everything we want the,
I'm the guy in charge.

64
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.510
No,
let him run it.
And it's just,
it's,
it's,
it's the,

65
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.550
the reason,

66
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.760
the thing that holds people back from letting other people run things is

67
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:37.360
insecurity.
If I think echo is going to do a better job than me,

68
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.540
or I think you're gonna do a really good job and you're going to shine and I

69
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.860
don't feel like I do a good job,

70
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.490
I'm going to hold you back as the best of my ability to be like,
no.
I go,
oh,

71
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.220
you go ahead.
You go ahead and just stay in your lane.

72
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.420
They're putting this over here,
you know?
But if I,
if I,
if I know,

73
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.590
if I'm securing my leadership
man Echo,
oh,

74
00:03:56.591 --> 00:04:00.100
you want to run this dude?
Awesome.
Here you go.
Here's the plan.
Once you know,

75
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.980
here's the,
here's the portfolio.
Why don't you put the plan together?

76
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.180
I'm going to be over here looking down the road on their next project and

77
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.900
looking for our next thing down the road,

78
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.390
going out and getting another client to bring into the game.

79
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.490
We're gonna make this app no factor.
Yes.
Seems like counterintuitive,

80
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.220
isn't it?
Yeah,
it is.
You want to,
you want me to say,

81
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.870
here's how you keep the people in their lanes.
Yes,
exactly.
Yeah.

82
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.310
Let me tell you what you do.
Let him out of their lanes.
Let them into your lane,

83
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.360
let him run some stuff.
Build a new leader.

84
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.640
It's a beautiful thing
when
you,

85
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.270
you know,
when you're insecure,
you want,
you don't want them to shout,
shine you,

86
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.500
you know?
You can tell that where I think it's natural though,
you know,

87
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:44.460
when people maybe a little insecure,
you know,

88
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.720
or if you're not as good as maybe you hope or what,

89
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:49.140
I think it's natural to be a little bit insecure.
Of course.
Here's how,

90
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.620
here's how,
in my experience anyway,
where I could tell where I'm being insecure,

91
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.060
where if someone's performing a certain thing and you're kind of like,

92
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.930
you can feel it consciously,
you kind of hope that they don't do that good.

93
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.670
But man,
that I know of,
that's bad.
It's bad.
But that's how you can tell.
Yeah.

94
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.390
That's how you came to tell you.
If you have that feeling,
oh,
you should.

95
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:13.840
You should definitely.
If you have that feeling,
check yourself.
Yeah.

96
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.920
Know what here I am hoping that my own team member Nova.

97
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.630
Yeah.
That's passing bad situation real bad.

98
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.680
You want to hope everyone's doing great.
Yeah.

99
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.460
And you know this happened on deployment and I talk about it in the book.

100
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.690
Extreme ownership was,
you know the Delta platoon commander,

101
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.900
he was worried that this element that had come in to work in his AOT,

102
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.480
he was worried that they were going to be better than him and take his job.

103
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.220
And he told me that and I said,
hey bro,
if they take your job,
good,

104
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.620
I'll find a new job for you.
There's so much work we got work to do.

105
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.000
Don't worry about it and help them,

106
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.240
help them take your job and I'll find you a new job.

107
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.110
It turns out that their egos were too big and they couldn't let that happen.

108
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.430
But that's the same situation you've got that thinks going to take your job and

109
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.120
do better than you help them and then find new work.
Mm.

110
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.030
Cause cause we're trying to help the team.
Right.
There's a mission,

111
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.990
there's an overall mission.
And if echo can do something better than me,
hey,

112
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.820
here's the turnover,
here's the lessons I learned.

113
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:13.250
You'd be better at this than I am.
You keep running with it.

114
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.180
I'm going to go find something that I'm good at or an area that I can help.

115
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.180
That's just supporting the whole team.

116
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.200
That's a window sill and you know what,

117
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:27.950
sitting in the podcast studio,

118
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:32.240
it's so easy to talk about that,
but it's so hard for people to do that.

119
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.990
It really is really is one of those things where you're dealing with your actual

120
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:37.400
feelings in the situation.

121
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:39.770
We're not dealing with our actual feelings in this situation right now,

122
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.470
but which,
but it doesn't.
That mean that it's good.

123
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.300
You know you're giving a fresh like view.
You are.
Yeah,

124
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.950
you are detached,
accurate advice and the more detached,

125
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:53.810
and you pointed out some red flags,
right?

126
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.450
If I'm hoping that these guys go on the mission and fail,

127
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.370
that's a red flag that you're being selfish and insecure about your job and what

128
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.900
you're doing and if someone can do a job better than you,
let them do it.

129
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.620
That's going to help.
The whole team.
Yeah.

130
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.410
So it's like your us in the podcast room where like,
you know,

131
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.050
if you get a guy in the maze,

132
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.130
the maze of emotions and we're outside of the mains on top,

133
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:22.490
we can see the whole maze.
We're not in the maze of emotions.
We're on top.

134
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:24.350
We can look at the whole scenario,
the whole maze.

135
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.040
So we can tell that guy what to do effectively.
Echo,

136
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:31.960
you just described detachment.
There you go.
What the attachment is like that.

137
00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:34.340
That's what,
that's what,
that's what it's like for me.
Yeah.

138
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.430
I can see the maze and I remember learning how to step back and step above and

139
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:43.700
look to maze.
I remember.
Yeah,
I remember learning that and going,

140
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.240
oh that's all you gotta do.
Yeah.

141
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.080
And then I remember taking it from the training ground,

142
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.980
the battlefield and then realizing that that's what you need to do in the

143
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:53.960
everyday interactions with people.

144
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.670
And especially once I got in the business world,

145
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.240
the thing that was cool about when we started echelon front,

146
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.980
now I would be witnessing,
like we,
I'd go into a meeting and I would be detached.

147
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:08.750
I would be up above the maze.
Yeah.
Of emotions in turmoil.

148
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.700
And so now I would get to see it and then I would start bringing the leadership

149
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.570
and saying,
look at what this looks like to me.
Know they'd go Google fit.

150
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.860
I don't like that into the video to go into the video and,

151
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.770
and so then that's how you learn.
We didn't go to the video.

152
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.710
Look what it looks like from up above the maze and now you see,

153
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.630
you see what you are doing here in your meeting.

154
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.320
You had everybody so intimidated that no one said anything.

155
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.510
You just gave a 15 minute meeting.

156
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.570
No one responded in any way to anything you said.

157
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.630
Do you think everyone in that room agreed with everything you said?
Not a chance.

158
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.060
They didn't say a word.
Why is that?
You intimidated him,

159
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.460
you bully them and now you're not getting any feedback and they're going to

160
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:48.260
execute the plan that they don't believe in.

161
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.920
And that's probably less effective than the one that they have come in from the

162
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:55.280
field.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
No,
not congratulations.

163
00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.030
Let's get this fixed.
It of congratulate,
like,
you know,
so,
uh,

164
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.470
I was in the,
in traffic and somebody to think about,

165
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.850
I was in traffic and you know how the,
you have the two lanes,
right?

166
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.180
So I'm going to turn left on the light in the lane next to me.

167
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.014
They're going straight.

168
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.790
So whoever the person in front of the person that was next to me,

169
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.720
both going straight,
they were taking too long.
So the lady next,

170
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.830
she's getting the horn,
Kurt like going like this,
all crazy.

171
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.640
So of course I look over at her and she's going crazy.
She looks over at me.

172
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.640
She's like,
like,
do you believe this kind of thing?
All going nuts.

173
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.270
Meanwhile I'm looking at myself,
you know,
other people around me,

174
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:38.670
they're just like,
well,
this lady's going nuts,
you know?

175
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.710
So that's an example of being on the outside looking in her.

176
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:47.880
She thought it was justifiable,
honking the horn,
looking nuts.
But meanwhile,

177
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:49.830
we're on the outside looking at her like,
by,
you know,

178
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.630
how you look and you know what that situation is.
You didn't have anywhere to be.

179
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.350
She did while I was at a red light shoes,
you know?

180
00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.071
You know what I'm saying though?

181
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:04.071
She's a person that hadn't left for late work late and she was going to be in

182
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:08.880
trouble and blah,
blah,
blah.
That that 30 set that,
that 10 seconds,

183
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:12.030
that eight seconds,
it was probably like three maternity for her.

184
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.760
She's just going nuts.
Just like I was talking about in the airport.

185
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.460
If I'm running late for the flight,
TSA takes five minutes.

186
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.700
It could be no factor or it could drive me completely insane meal and that's,

187
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.270
that was her,
and you know what?
These days when I screw something up,

188
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.060
I don't get frustrated like that.
You know?
That's what we're talking about.

189
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:32.870
The first question,
I'm like,
oh my God,
I look at myself and God,

190
00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:36.600
I can't believe I left late.
Yeah,
do this.
I'm an idiot.
Yeah.

191
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.770
I won't let that happen again.

192
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.020
I said that in 1996 and I haven't had to let it happen,
so

193
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.120
see what I mean though?
I was outside.
The main thing.
I know she,

194
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.210
I know she's feeling,
oh,
these guys not going to go green light go.

195
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.450
It's time to go.
Universal.
Yeah.
So I understand the feeling,

196
00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:59.220
but look how you look from the outside.
You know,
did she check herself at all?
No.

197
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.380
When she saw,
you know,
she looked at,

198
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:05.790
to me for some emotional support as if you believe this guy,
you know,

199
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:09.570
get crazy with me kind of thing.
That was the look.

200
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.860
Yeah,
man.
It's like,
dig it.
That's,
I think that's another,
uh,

201
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.170
understand the difference between feeling and behavior as well.
You know,

202
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.940
like I feel,
I know that's a frustrating thing.
It can be.
Don't behave like that.

203
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:24.480
Calm down.
