00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.430
We know that if we have some
linear transformation, that

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.240
the transformation from x to y
-- and these are just sets,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.170
sets of vectors, and T is a
linear transformation from y

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.850
to z-- that we can construct a
composition of s with T that

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.360
is a linear transformation
from x all the way to z.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.440
We saw this several
videos ago.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.860
And the definition of our linear
transformation, or the

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.930
composition of our linear
transformation.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.040
So the composition of s with t,
applied to someone vector x

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:45.980
in our set x, our domain,
is equal to s of t of x.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.340
This was our definition.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.770
And then we went on and we said,
look, if s of x can be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.770
represented as the matrix
multiplication a x, the matrix

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.280
vector product, and if T of x
can be represented -- or the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.850
transformation T can be
represented-- as the product

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.690
of the matrix b with x, we saw
that this thing right here --

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.820
which is of course, if we just
write this way, this is equal

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.220
to a times T times x, which is
just b x -- we saw in multiple

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.580
videos now that this is
equivalent to, by our

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.030
definition of matrix products,
the matrix a b -- right?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.130
When you take the product of
two matrices you just get

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
another matrix -- the
product a b times x.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.760
So you take essentially the
first linear transformation in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.200
your composition, its matrix,
which was a, and you take the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.880
product with the second one.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.230
Fair enough, all of this
is review so far.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.440
Let's take three linear
transformations.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.710
Let's say that I have the linear
transformation h, and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.900
when I apply that to a vector
x, it's equivalent to

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.220
multiplying my vector
x by the matrix a.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.490
Let's say I have the linear
transformation g.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.400
When I applied that to a vector
x, it's equivalent to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.250
multiplying that vectrix -- that
vector, there should be a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.320
new concept called a vetrix --
it's equivalent to multiplying

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.170
that vector times
the matrix b.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.410
And then I have a final linear
transformation f.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.380
When it's applied to some vector
x, it's equivalent to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.280
multiplying that vector
x times the matrix z.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.810
Now what I'm curious about is
what happens when I take the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.570
composition of h with g, and
then I take the composition of

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.070
that with f -- these are all
linear transformations -- and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.350
then I apply that to
some vector x.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.070
Which is necessarily going to be
in the domain of this guy.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.800
I haven't actually drawn out
their domain and co-domain

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.020
definitions, but I think
you get the idea.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.290
So let's explore what this
is a little bit.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.610
Well by the definition of
what a -- let's go back.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.320
By this definition right here
of what composition even

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.270
means, we can just apply that
to this right here.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.240
So we could just imagine this as
being our s, and then this

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.520
is our T right there.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.280
Then what is this going
to be equal to?

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.640
If we just do a straight up
pattern match right there,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.530
this is going to be equal to
s, the transformation s,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.620
applied to the transformation
f, applied to x.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.830
So s is h of g.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.750
So it is h -- or I should say h
of g -- the composition of h

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.180
with g, that is our s.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.300
And then I apply that
to f applied to x.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.360
f is our t.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.470
I apply that to f applied
to x, just like that.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.740
Now what is this equal to?

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.225
Now we can imagine that
this is our x.

00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:14.670
If we just pattern match,
according to this definition,

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.480
that this and this guy right
here, that this is our t, and

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.160
that this is our s.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.790
And so if we just pattern
match here,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.040
this is equal to what?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.430
This is just straight from the
definition of a composition.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.720
So it's equal to s of -- s is
our h -- so h of t, which in

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.010
this case is g, g
applied to x.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.200
But instead of an x, we have
this vector here, which was

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.650
the transformation
f applied to x.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.960
So g of f of x.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.980
That's what this is equal to.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.550
The composition of h with
g, and the composition

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.710
competition of f with h, the
composition of h and g, all of

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.370
that applied to x is equal
to h of g of f of x.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.310
Now what is this equal to?

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.700
Well this is equal to -- I'll
do it right here -- this is

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:18.210
equal to h, the transformation
h, applied to -- what is this

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.530
term right here?

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.570
I'll do it in pink.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.080
What is this?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.100
That is the composition of
g and f applied to x.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.620
You can just replace s with g,
and f with T, and you'll get

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.920
that right there.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.160
So this is just equal to the
composition of g with f

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.110
applied to x.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.420
That's all that is.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.190
Now, what is this equal
to right there?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.280
And it's probably confusing
to see two parentheses in

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.730
different colors, but
you get the idea.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.300
What is this equal to?

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.270
Well, just go back to your
definition of the composition

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.760
-- I just want to make it very
clear what we're doing.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.500
This is, if you imagine this
being your T and then this

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.700
being your s, this is just the
composition of s with T,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.270
applied to x.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.730
So this is just equal to --
I'll write it this way.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.530
This is equal to -- I shouldn't
write s's -- this is

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.820
a composition of h with the
composition of g and f.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.210
And then all of that
applied to x.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.190
Now why did I do all of this?

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.330
Well one, to show you that the
composition is associative.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.710
I went all the way here and then
I went all the way back.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.880
And essentially it doesn't
matter where you put the

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.490
parentheses.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.130
The composition of h with g with
f, is equivalent to the

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.050
composition of h with the
composition of g and f.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.020
That these two things are
equivalent, and essentially

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.800
these two things, you can
just re-write them.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.210
The parentheses are essentially
unnecessary.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.020
You can write this as a
composition of h with g with

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.070
f, all of that applied to x.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.400
Now, I took the time to say
that each of these linear

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.520
transformations I can
represent as matrix

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.250
multiplications.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.930
Why did I do that?

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.860
Well we saw before, that any
composition, when you take the

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.220
composition of s with T, the
matrix version of this

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.900
transformation of this
composition is going to be

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.520
equal to the product -- by our
definition of matrix matrix

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.480
products -- the product of the
s's transformation matrix and

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.690
T's transformation matrix.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.010
So what are these going
to be equal to?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.810
So this one right here --
if you think of this

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.260
transformation right here, this
statement right here, its

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.540
matrix version of it--
so let me write that.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:49.930
A matrix version of the
composition of h with g, and

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:57.300
then the composition of that
with f, applied to x, is going

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:03.930
to be equal to -- and we've
seen this before -- the

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.510
product of these matrices.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.500
So this composition, its matrix
is going to be a b.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.620
h and g, their matrices
are a and b.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:19.220
So it's going to be a b -- and
I'll do it in parentheses.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.380
And then you take that matrix,
and you take the product -- so

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.420
this guy's matrix representation
is a b, right?

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.840
And this guy's matrix
representation is c.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.690
So the matrix representation
of this whole thing is this

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.480
guy, taking the product of a b,
and then taking the product

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.380
of that with c.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.640
So a b.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.929
and then c.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.179
And then if you look at this
guy right here -- and of

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.110
course all of that times a
vector x, all of that time

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.430
some vector x, right there.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.860
That's the vector x.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.730
Now let's look at this
one right here.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:59.220
If we take the composition of
h with the composition of g

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.550
and f, and apply all of that to
some vector x, what is that

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.750
equivalent to?

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.180
Well this composition right
here, the matrix version of

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.170
it, I guess we can say, is going
to be the product b c.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.012
And we're going to
apply that to x.

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:18.340
So we're going to have
the product b c.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.770
And then we're going to take the
product of that with this

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.980
guy's matrix representation,
which is a.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.530
And we've shown this before.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.020
We never showed it with
three, but it extends.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.430
I kind of showed it extends, so
you can just keep applying

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.420
the definition.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.290
You can keep applying this
property right here, and so

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.900
it'll just naturally extend.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.160
Because every time, we're
just taking the

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.630
composition of two things.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.030
Even though it looks like we're
taking the composition

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.160
of three, we're taking the
composition of two things

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.150
first here.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.640
And then we get its matrix
representation.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.310
And then we take the composition
of that with this

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.240
other thing.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.850
So the matrix representation of
the entire composition is

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.640
going to be this matrix
times this matrix.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.820
Which I did here.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:04.240
Similarly, here we take first
the composition of these two

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.430
linear transformations, and
their matrix representation

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.900
will be that right there.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.550
And then we take the composition
of that with that.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.120
So its entire matrix
representation is going to be

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.390
guy's matrix times this
guy's matrix.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.220
So a times b c.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.530
And of course, all of that
applied to the vector x.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.990
Now, in this video I've showed
you that these two things are

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.840
equivalent.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.800
If anything, the parentheses
are completely unnecessary.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.920
And I showed you that there.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.420
They both essentially boil
down to h of g of f of x.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.410
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.620
So we could say, essentially,
that these two things over

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.520
here are equivalent.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.390
Or that a b, the product a b,
and then taking the product of

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.290
that matrix with the matrix c,
is equivalent to taking the

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.040
product a with the matrix b c.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.290
Which is just another
product matrix.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.590
Or another way of saying it is
that these parentheses don't

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.030
matter, that all of these
is just equal to a b c.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.430
Or -- I mean, this is just a
statement that matrix products

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.315
exhibit the associative
property.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.040
It doesn't matter where you
put the parentheses.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.080
And you know, sometimes it's
confusing me, the word

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.680
associative.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.840
It just means it doesn't matter
where you put the

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.780
parentheses.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.040
Matrix products do not exhibit
the commutative property.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.140
We saw that in the last video.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.050
In general, we cannot make
the statement that a b

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.280
is equal to b a.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.020
We cannot do that.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.550
And in fact in the last video
-- I think it was the last

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.720
video -- I showed you that if a
b is defined, sometimes b a

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.660
is not even defined.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.030
Or if b a is defined, sometimes
a b isn't defined.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.820
So it's not commutative.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.630
It is associative, though.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.050
In the next video, I'll see if
matrix products are actually

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.300
distributive.
