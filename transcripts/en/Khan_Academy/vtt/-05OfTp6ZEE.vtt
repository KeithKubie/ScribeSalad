00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.304
Before we talk about
the debt ceiling,

00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:03.970
it's important to
realize the difference

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.130
between the deficit
and the debt.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.940
Because these words
are thrown around

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.370
and it's clear that they're
related, but sometimes

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.550
people might confuse
one for the other.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.240
The deficit is how
much you overspend

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.510
in a given year,
while the debt is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.260
the total amount, the
cumulative amount, of debt

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.980
you you've gotten
over many, many years.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.660
So let's take a look, I guess
a very simplified example,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.600
let's say you have
some type of a country.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.630
And that country spends,
in a given year, $10.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.510
But it's only bringing
in $6 in tax revenue.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.290
So it's bringing in taxes.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.730
It's only bringing in $6.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.930
So this country in this
year, where it spends $10,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.030
even though it only has $6 to
spend, it has a $4 deficit.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.610
Def is the short for deficit.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.470
And well, let me
just write it out.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.220
You might think it's
defense or something.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.769
It has a $4 deficit.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.270
And you might say,
well, how does it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.728
spend more money
that it brings in?

00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:10.100
How can it actually
continue to spend this much?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.160
Where will it get the $4 from?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.970
And the answer is, it
will borrow that $4.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.410
Our little country
will borrow it.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.640
And so the debt, maybe
going into this year,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.400
the country already
had some debt.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.750
Maybe it already
had $100 of debt.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.390
And so in this
situation, it would

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.230
have to borrow
another $4 of debt.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.470
And so exiting this year,
it would have $104 of debt.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.880
If the country runs the same
$4 deficit the year after this,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.970
then the debt will
increase to $108.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.360
If it runs another $4
deficit, than the debt

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.649
will increase to $112.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.190
Now that we have
that out of the way,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.930
let's think about what
the debt ceiling is.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.810
So you could imagine, the
United States actually does.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.710
It's continuing
to run a deficit.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770
It's continuing to spend
more than it brings in.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.270
And actually, for
the United States,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.420
these ratios are appropriate.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.610
For every dollar that the
United States spends right now,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.850
40% is borrowed.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.370
Or another way to
think about it,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.820
it only has 60% of
every dollar that it

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.960
needs to spend right now.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.350
So it has to go out into the
debt markets and borrow 40%

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.900
to keep spending at
its current rate.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.400
And so if it's
continuing to borrow,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.225
you could imagine that the
debt keeps on increasing.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.360
So let me draw a
little graph here.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.490
So that axis is time.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.180
This axis right over here is the
total cumulative amount of debt

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.280
that we have.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.077
We continue to have to
borrow 40% of every dollar

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:44.910
that we're spending.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.230
And so our debt is
continuing to increase.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.700
And Congress has the power,
or Congress has the authority,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.950
to essentially limit
how much debt we have.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.320
So right now we have a current
debt limit of $14.3 trillion.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.489
And even though Congress
has this authority,

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.030
the way that it's
worked in the past,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.570
is this kind of
just a rubber stamp.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.660
Congress has just always allowed
the debt ceiling to go up

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.645
and up and up to fund
our borrowing costs.

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.520
And if you think about
it, that kind of makes

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.560
sense because right
now Congress is

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.500
the one that decides
where to spend the money.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.981
What are the obligations.

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.480
And so the debt
ceiling is like, OK,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.500
we've already agreed what you
have to spend your money on.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.870
Congress is the one that figures
out what we spend our money on,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.210
and what our taxes are.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.710
And so they say,
look, we've already

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.900
determined how much
you have to borrow.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.650
It would seem kind of ridiculous
for us after we've determined

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.920
how much you borrow to say
that you cannot borrow it.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.910
You cannot you cannot actually
do what we've told you to do.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.309
And so historically,
Congress has just kind of

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:52.100
gone with the flow.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.516
They said, OK,
yeah we've told you

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:57.200
we need to borrow more
money to execute--

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.590
the executive branch has to
run the government-- for you

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.820
to actually run the
government based on the budget

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.320
we told you.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.550
So they just keep upping it.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.425
And the last time the
debt ceiling was raised

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:08.740
was actually very recently,
February 12, 2010.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.650
It was raised from
$12.3 trillion,

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.230
point actually $12.4 trillion
to the $14.3 trillion.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.769
And this happens
pretty regularly.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.790
It's happened 10 times since
2001, 74 times since 1962.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.080
So it's just a regular
operating thing.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.930
And right now the Obama
administration says, look,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.340
we've actually come up
against our debt ceiling.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.370
We want to raise it, and ideally
for the Obama administration,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.880
they want to raise it
by about $2.4 trillion.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.220
So they want to raise
it to $16.7 trillion,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.810
which will kind of put it off
the table for a little bit.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.430
Put it past the
elections so that we

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.740
don't have to
debate this anymore.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.010
The Republicans on
the other the side,

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.260
want to essentially
use this, and this

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.940
is a little bit unusual,
to use this as leverage

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.470
to essentially
reduce the deficit.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.160
And not only to
reduce the deficit,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.810
but it's in particular to reduce
the deficit through spending

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.500
cuts.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.890
And so that's why it's become
this big game of chicken

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.090
and why we're going
up against this limit.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.480
Now, one thing that you
may or may not realize

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.620
is that we've
actually already hit

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.330
the debt limit, the
current debt limit.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.680
And we hit that debt
limit on May 16, 2011.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.990
I'm making this video at
the end of July in 2011.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.330
And the only reason why
the country's continuing

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.100
to operate, and the only
reason why the country has

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.860
been able to continue to pay
interest on its obligations,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.780
and pay issue social
security checks,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.730
and support Medicare, and buy
fuel for aircraft carriers,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.650
and all the rest,
is that Geithner,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.850
who's the Treasury
Secretary, has

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.470
been able to find cash in other
places, cash normally set aside

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.610
for employee pensions
and all the rest.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.580
And has essentially done a
little bit of a bookkeeping,

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.250
taking money from one
place to feed another.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.750
But what he said, what
he's publicly said,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.010
is that he won't be able to do
that anymore as of August 2,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.690
2011.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.520
So this right here is
the date that everyone

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.820
is paying attention
to, August 2, 2011.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.050
According to Geithner,
at that point,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.260
he won't be able to find random
pockets of cash here and there

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.650
and shuffle it around.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.570
And what he calls
extraordinary measures.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.200
And at that point,
the United States

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.497
will not be able to fulfill
all of its obligations.

00:06:24.497 --> 00:06:27.080
And so if you think about all
of the obligations of the United

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.070
States, this is a huge
oversimplification here.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.590
So this bar represent
all of the obligations.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.840
Some of those obligations
are things like interest

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.250
on the debt that
it already owes.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.270
It already owes a huge amount
of debt, $14.3 trillion.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:54.130
And things like social security,
Medicare, defense, and then

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.710
all of the other stuff that
the country has to support,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.530
all of their other obligations.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.810
So if as of August 2, 2011,
we cannot issue any more debt,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.580
and Geithner doesn't have any
extra cash laying around with

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.100
these extraordinary
measures, then,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.540
if those are the only
options on the table,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.820
The only option is to somehow
reduce some of these things

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.780
by 40%.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.820
Because 40% of
every dollar we used

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.420
to spend on all of these
obligations, 40% are borrowed.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.260
And so something over
here is going to give.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
We're not going to fulfill
our obligations to one or more

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.030
of these things,
all of these things

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.130
that we are legally
obligated to fulfill.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.210
That Congress has said,
these are the things

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.270
that the United States should
be spending its money on.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.660
And so at that point,
it is perceived

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.570
that we would have to default.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.210
And a default actually would
be on any of its obligations.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.950
But in particular, we
could be, especially

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.750
if we have to cut
everything by 40%.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.910
And we don't want
to see retirees not

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.310
be able to get evicted from
their houses, or aircraft

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.550
carriers not have
fuel, or whatever else.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.590
We might defer, or
try to restructure,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.660
or do something
weird with our debt.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.500
In which case, we
would be defaulting.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.990
And I want to be clear,
a default, it's usually

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.260
referred to not fully paying the
interest on debt that you owe.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.815
But a default would be
any of its obligations.

00:08:14.815 --> 00:08:16.960
The United States
has this AAA rating.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.670
If the United States says it's
going to give you a Social

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.000
Security check, you trust that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.859
If the United States
says that it's

00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:24.150
going to pay for that Medicare
payment, you trust that.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.900
If it says it's going to
give you an interest payment,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.671
you trust that.

00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:28.420
All of a sudden, if
United States does not

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.170
fulfill any of those
obligations, then

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.830
all of the obligations
becomes suspect.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.900
And the reason why this is a
big deal, as you can imagine,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.380
if you borrow money, you've
always been good at paying back

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.980
that money, you're
going to pay lower

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.562
interest than other
people would have to pay.

00:08:47.562 --> 00:08:49.270
But all of a sudden,
for whatever reason,

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.609
one day you default.

00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:52.150
You either delay
your payment, or you

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.200
say you don't have the
cash to pay your payments,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.520
then people's like, wow
you're a much riskier person

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.960
to lend money to.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.350
So now I'm going to increase
the interest rates on you.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.500
And so the perception
is if the United States

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.960
were to default on its debt,
or any of its obligations,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.490
that interest rates would go up.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.610
And the reason why this
would really not great

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.020
is because it would make
the debt and the deficit

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.180
even worse.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.400
Then this chunk is
going to have to grow.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.240
Our obligations are on debt.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.122
As new debt gets
issued, we're gonna

00:09:24.122 --> 00:09:25.580
have to pay more
and more interest.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.288
So it's going to just
make matters worse.

00:09:27.288 --> 00:09:28.880
It's going to make
the deficit worse.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.691
And on top of
that, it's not just

00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:33.190
that the government's debt, the
interest on the government's

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.290
debt will go up, but interest
on all debt in the United States

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.560
will probably go up.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.080
Because government debt is
perceived to be the safest,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.237
it's the benchmark.

00:09:42.237 --> 00:09:44.070
A lot of other debt
contractors are actually

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.650
tied to government debt.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.560
So you'll have interest rates
throughout the economy go up,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.350
which is exactly
what you do not want

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.620
to happen when you are
either in a recession,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.066
or when you are recovering
from a recession.
