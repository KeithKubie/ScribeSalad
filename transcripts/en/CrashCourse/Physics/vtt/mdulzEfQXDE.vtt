00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.400
Last time, we talked about how charged particles exert electrostatic forces on one another.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.640
We calculated these forces using the charge of each particle: which can be either positive or negative, and the distance between them, and we did it with the help of Coulomb's Law:

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.040
the equation that tells us the force generated by two charged particles on one another.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.620
But what if we want to talk about more that two charges, or if we're dealing with charged objects of various shapes and sizes?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.780
Coulomb's Law is great for finding the force between small objects, like particles but in physics, we deal with all sorts of shapes and sizes.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.120
Electric forces are used to bring power to your home, charge your computer, and light up the screen that you're using to watch this video.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.600
These everyday electric phenomena require physical components that manipulate charged particles in amazing ways.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.460
We make electrical components that excite millions of electrons in each pixel on this screen.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.340
But how to we design then to transmit just the right amount of electric force?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.420
We've got some equations and concepts under our belt already, but we'll need a few more to understand how to control charged particles and expand the possibilities of electricity.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:14.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.600
So we want to describe complex situations involving charged particles using more than just Coulomb's Law.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.660
If we have an object with a knows amount of net charge, can we predict how other electric charges will react when they pass nearby?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.380
Well, British scientist Michael Faraday came up with a way to do just that.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.600
He hypothesized that every charged object generates an electric field that permeates space and exerts a force on all charged particles it encounters.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.900
And he was right: an electric field is a measurable effect generated by any charged object.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.560
A field carries energy and passes it on to other charged materials by exerting electric forces.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.980
And we can get to know how electric fields work in a couple of different ways.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.540
First there's good old math.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.980
Let's consider a positive point charge which we'll call capital Q.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.520
To study the effect that big Q has on other charges, we'll bring in a small positive test charge, small q, and measure the force that's acting on it.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:14.420
Now, when we express it as an equation, the electric field created by a charged object is the electric force between the objects and the test charge divided by the magnitude of that test charge.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.800
To find F, you just have to use Coulomb's Law.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.240
And you only need to know the value for big Q, the point charge.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.700
In fact, you can plug the equation for Coulomb's Law into this equation, in place of capital F.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.840
And if you do, you'll see that the magnitude of the test charge cancels out and we're left with an expression that relies solely on big Q.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.960
Now we've got an equation to calculate the electric field generated by any point charge.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.520
But let's make this field even easier to picture.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.480
Another way of understanding what's going on between these charges is to diagram it with vectors using what we've learned about Coulomb's Law and force vectors.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.620
Again, let's start with our positive point charge, capital Q located at Point A and our small positive test charge, small q.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.760
While both big Q and small q generate electric fields, we're going to assume that big Q has a much larger magnitude than small q.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.080
Now let's plot a series of vectors that result from placing small q at various points around big Q.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.060
These vectors are called electric field lines and their purpose is to show the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on any nearby positive test charge.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.100
The density of these field lines signifies the magnitude of the electric force on small q and the closer small q is to big Q, the greater the force.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.820
And the same logic applies to how we represent negative charges although we do implement it in a slightly different way.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:35.760
The electric field line diagram for a fixed Q that's negatively charged would look like that of a positive Q, but with arrows pointing inward to signify that positive test charges would be attracted to Q.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.340
Now let's see what an electric field looks like for a more complicated situation.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.200
Say we have one positively charged particle and one negatively charged particle that are some distance apart with an equal and opposite magnitude of charge.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.380
This pair of particle is known as an electric dipole.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.400
Since we have two particles that each generate their own electric field, we can add the fields together to create a total electric field.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.640
This is the principle known as superposition.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.140
Now let's examine the electric field created by this electric dipole because along the way, that's going to show us four important properties of electric field lines.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.600
First: the field lines must be tangent to the direction of the field at any point.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.200
This means if we place a positive test charge anywhere the field lines will point in the direction of the force exerted on a positive test charge.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.260
This also means that a negative test charge would feel a force in the exact opposite direction.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.080
Next: the greater the line density, the greater the magnitude of the field.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.840
As a test charge moves closer to one of the fixed charges, the forces on it will be larger, thus the greater number of lines in that area.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.900
All of this together means that the number of lines leaving a charged object is proportional to the magnitude of its charge.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.040
If the magnitude of the positive charge in our electric dipole is doubled, then twice as many lines leave the positive point charge.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.840
The third property of electric field lines is that the lines always start from positively charged objects and end on negatively charged objects.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.560
And if there are no negatively charged objects around, then the lines just keep going on forever

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.660
into infinity, seeking out negatively charged objects wherever they can find them.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.460
So in our electric dipole the lines start at the positively charged particle and move toward the negatively charged one.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.620
And the same number of lines come out of each particle because the magnitude of their charges is equal and opposite.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.060
Finally, the fourth property of electric field lines:
the lines must never cross.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.780
Criss-crossing lines means the field acts in different directions for charges in the same location which is impossible.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.160
Now that we know these properties, we can create field lines for any set of charged objects.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.580
So lets look at a scenario with one negatively charged particle with charge -Q and a positively charges particle with charge +2Q.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:43.640
If a positive test charge were placed directly between the particles the force exerted on it would be in the same direction that the electric field points toward the negative particle.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.740
If we zoom out: looking at this pair of particles from far away, you can see that it looks like the field lines for a single positive point charge.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.140
Keep in mind, groups of charged particles can look totally different when viewed from far away.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:02.620
All right, you're probably wondering why we're still talking about particles when I spent all that time earlier talking about configurations of things that we see in real life.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:10.940
Now that we know how to build electric field lines based on a set up of charged objects let's try to do the reverse and set up charged objects to achieve a certain purpose.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.180
Let's say we want to create an electric field where all positive test charges move uniformly in a single direction.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.540
We can model this as a field created by two infinitely large conductive plates one positive, and one negative.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.880
All positive test charges between the plates would move from the positive plate to the negative plate.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.740
So we construct the electric field as a series of lines moving from the positive plate to the negative one.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:42.660
This pair of plates is known as a capactior and is an integral part of almost every electronic system partly because it can use its electronic field to store an electric charge.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.380
But so far we've only talked about electrical fields between charged objects like particles and plates.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.880
So can an electric field exist in a conductor, where electrons can move around freely in the material?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.940
To figure this out, let's imagine we have a conductive sphere with a net negative charge meaning it has too many free electrons.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.940
These extra free electrons want to move as far away from one another as possible.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.380
This means they redistribute themselves on the surface of the sphere.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.840
When they do, they've reached electrostatic equilibrium.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.540
In this state, the excess charges have moved as far as possible to reduce their forces on one another.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:21.200
Once these free charges are at equilibrium, their acceleration is zero, which means that there are no longer any net forces acting on them.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.760
And since the electric field represents electric forces acting on nearby charges, when the net forces are zero, the electric field must also be zero.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.540
So what do these observations tell us?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:37.020
Well for one thing, it shows that the electric field inside conductors is always zero when the system is in electrostatic equilibrium.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.080
And it also shows that the net charge is distributed on the surface.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.880
These conditions hold true for all conducive materials.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.560
While the electric field inside the material is zero,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.480
an electric field exists outside the surface of the conductor.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.820
Let's look again at the capacitor and see what I mean.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.840
You can see that all excess charge is on the surface of the plates.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.140
And while no electric field exists inside the plates themselves, a field is generated between the two.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:05.060
Now, what if we take a neutral conductive sphere, hollow out the inside, and stick a positively charged particle in the center?

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:12.480
The positive charge inside the sphere attracts the negative charges inside the shell while it's pushing the positive charges to the surface of the sphere.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.500
Once the system is at electrostatic equilibrium, the observations we made before still hold true.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.020
The charges stop moving, so no electric field exists inside the shell.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:29.120
Now the inside of the shell has a net negative charge due to the attraction of the central positive particle leaving the outer shell with a net positive charge.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.400
So an electric field is generated from the outside of the shell, because of the net positive charge.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:40.200
And while no field exists inside the shell, there is an electric field between that particle in the center and the inside surface.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.700
Any positive test charges in the region would follow the field lines and be pushed toward the negative interior of the shell.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:54.680
So we've managed to use our knowledge of electric charges and Coulomb's Law to figure out a way to describe the effect of any charged object on the entire universe surrounding it.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.620
Later we'll learn about how electric forces and fields are just half of the story in our pursuit of understanding the larger concept of electromagnetism.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.700
Today we learned how all objects with net charge generate electric fields that affect all other charged materials.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:13.460
We learned how to construct electric field lines and how to calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric field for a charged particle.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.640
Finally, we learned how electric fields interact in capacitors and conductors.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.600
