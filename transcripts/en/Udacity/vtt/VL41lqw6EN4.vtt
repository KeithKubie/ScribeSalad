00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.630
-2 &lt; x &lt; -1.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.180
So, x is between -2 and -1.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.380
This is an and
inequality written without the word.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.930
When solving this type of compound
inequality, you must add,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.960
subtract, multiply, or divide to all
three parts of the compound inequality.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.090
The easiest way to do this is
to break it up into two parts.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.690
Let's do this part first.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.760
So here we have the regular inequality
5 &lt; 2x + 3 times the quantity x + 5.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.360
We'll solve this the way we normally do
with it, just a regular linear equation.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.522
So the 3 gets distributed to the x and

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:43.570
to the 5 and we get 5 &lt; 2x + 3x + 15.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.194
To simplify it, we get 5 &lt; 5X + 15,

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:54.920
subtract 15 from both sides and
we get -10 &lt; 5X.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.860
To isolate x, we should get rid of
the 5 so divided by 5 on both sides.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.709
And we're left with -2 &lt; x.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.270
All right, so
we have one half of the inequality.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.972
Next, we should just take
a look at the right side.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:17.428
So we have 2x + 3(x + 5) &lt; 10.

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:24.140
Again we distribute the 3 to the x and
to the 5, and we get the same thing.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.760
2x + 3x + 15 &lt; 10.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.236
Simplify a bit to get 5x + 15 &lt; 10,

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:35.799
subtract 15 from both sides.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.375
And we get 5x is less than -5.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:45.320
We divide by 5 on both sides,
and we're left with x &lt; -1.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.440
So -2 &lt; x, and x &lt; -1.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.639
So x is between -2 and -1.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.670
So let's draw this on our number line.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.930
And -2 is less than x is
another way to say x &gt; -2.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.110
So on the number line our arrow will
point towards positive infinity.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.840
And for x &lt; -1, find -1 here and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.310
our line should point
towards negative infinity.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.260
This is where the two lines overlap.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.731
This is our solution set and
it's true x really is between -2 and -1.
