00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:03.112
- [Voiceover] Let's build our
intuition for visually adding

00:00:03.112 --> 00:00:05.152
and subtracting vectors.

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:09.552
So let's say that I have
vector a, and I add that

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:13.292
to vector, to vector b,

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:17.154
and the resulting vector is a vector c,

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:19.514
is vector c.

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:21.634
So what could this look like visually

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:25.034
if we assume that a, b and c
are two-dimensional vectors?

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:28.414
Well, I'm just going to draw
what vector a might look like.

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:31.762
So let's say that this
right over here is vector a,

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:36.346
and vector b, vector b,

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:38.658
since I'm adding it to
vector a, I'm going to put

00:00:38.658 --> 00:00:43.098
its initial point at the
terminal point of vector a,

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:44.978
and then I'm going to draw vector b.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.618
So let's say vector b looks like that.

00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:51.260
So that is vector b, let me label these.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.660
That is vector a, this is vector b.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.580
And I did that so that I can
figure out what the sum is,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.700
what vector c is going to be.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.240
So that is vector b,
and what would that be?

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.098
Well, we would start at the
initial point of vector a

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.250
and then go to the
terminal point of vector b.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.152
So this right over there

00:01:15.152 --> 00:01:17.392
would be the sum.

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:21.094
So that would be vector
c right over there.

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:24.814
So the important realization
is if I add two vectors,

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:28.934
I would put the tail of one
at the head of the other.

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:30.976
And now what's neat
about this if I'm adding,

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:32.454
the order doesn't matter.

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:33.976
I could've done this the other way around.

00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:35.496
I could've started with vector b.

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:39.622
I could've said vector b plus vector a

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:43.784
is equal to vector c,
is equal to vector c,

00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:45.024
and you could see that visually.

00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:47.984
It would be a slightly
different visual diagram

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:49.824
but you get to the same place.

00:01:49.824 --> 00:01:53.304
So if I start with vector b,
let's say I start over here,

00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:55.628
In fact, you don't have
to start at the origin

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:57.268
but let's say that was the origin.

00:01:57.268 --> 00:02:00.988
So I could start with
vector b, draw vector b

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:05.128
just like that, and
then add vector a to it.

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:09.168
So start vector a at the
terminal point of vector b,

00:02:09.168 --> 00:02:12.648
and then go to (mumbles)
just draw vector a.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:13.772
So vector a.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.330
So once again, a vector,
I can shift them around

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.594
as long as I'm not changing the direction

00:02:17.594 --> 00:02:19.332
or their magnitude.

00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:22.054
So vector a looks like that.

00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:24.724
And notice, if you now go and
start at the initial point

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:27.952
of b and go to the terminal
point of a, you still get

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:29.072
vector c.

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:32.792
So that's why a plus b and b
plus a are going to give you

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:34.752
the same thing.

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:37.112
Now what if instead of saying a plus b

00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:40.992
I wanted to think about what
a minus b is going to be?

00:02:40.992 --> 00:02:42.482
So let me write that down.

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:47.472
Vector a minus vector b, minus vector b.

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.814
And let's call that vector d.

00:02:50.814 --> 00:02:53.834
That is equal to vector d.

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.194
So once again, I could start with vector a

00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:57.794
and here, order matters.

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:01.794
So vector a looks something like this.

00:03:01.794 --> 00:03:03.714
this is hand-drawn so it's not going to be

00:03:03.714 --> 00:03:05.434
completely perfect.

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:07.314
So vector a, just like that.

00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:09.954
And one way of thinking
about subtracting vector b

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:12.474
is instead of adding vector
b the way we did here,

00:03:12.474 --> 00:03:15.114
we could add negative b.

00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:17.114
So negative b would
have the same magnitude

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.434
but just the opposite direction.

00:03:19.434 --> 00:03:20.914
So that's vector a.

00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:24.194
Vector negative b will
still start right over here,

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:26.394
but will go in the opposite direction.

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:27.794
So let's do that.

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:31.114
So negative b is going to look like this,

00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:33.726
is going to look something like this.

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:37.016
So that is negative b.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:41.576
Notice, same magnitude
exactly opposite direction.

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.476
We've flipped it around 180 degrees,

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:46.598
and now the resulting
vector is going to be d.

00:03:46.598 --> 00:03:50.758
So vector d is going to look like that,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.240
vector d.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.530
So c is a plus b, d is a minus b.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.510
Or you can even call this
a plus, a plus negative b.

00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:07.662
Now with that out of the
way, let's draw some diagrams

00:04:07.662 --> 00:04:08.584
and go the other way.

00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:10.104
See if we could go from the diagrams

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:12.724
to the actual equations.

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:16.384
So let's start with, let
me draw an interesting one.

00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:18.474
So let's say that this...

00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:22.268
Let's say that's vector a.

00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:23.918
Vector a.

00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:27.728
I'll use green.

00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:32.488
Let's say that, that is vector b,

00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:35.458
and I will now use magenta.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.980
And let's say that this is vector c.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.970
Vector c.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.670
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.130
and see if you can write an equation

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.950
that defines this relationship.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.170
Well, this is interesting
because they're all going

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.070
in a circle right over here.

00:04:57.322 --> 00:04:59.764
Let's say that you started at...

00:04:59.764 --> 00:05:01.124
This is your initial point.

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:03.844
You said, okay, a plus b,

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:07.004
well, if you're trying to
figure out what a plus b

00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:10.744
is going to be, the resulting
vector would start here

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.864
and end here.

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:14.464
But vector c is going in
the opposite direction.

00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:17.284
But we could, instead of thinking
about vector c like this,

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:20.024
we could think about the
opposite of vector c,

00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:21.584
which would do,

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:24.064
so instead of calling this
c, I could flip this around

00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:25.984
by calling it this negative c.

00:05:25.984 --> 00:05:29.416
So I could flip this around,

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:33.526
and now, let me do the same color,

00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:37.256
this would be equal to negative c.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.246
Notice, before I just had vector c here

00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:43.646
and it started at this point
and ended at this point.

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:45.886
Now I just flipped it
around, it has the exact

00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:47.606
opposite direction, same magnitude.

00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:48.966
Now it is negative c.

00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:51.092
And this makes it easier for
us to construct an equation

00:05:51.092 --> 00:05:54.012
because negative c starts at
the tip, at the initial point

00:05:54.012 --> 00:05:58.232
or the tail of vector a,
and it goes to the head

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:00.832
of vector b or the
terminal point of vector b.

00:06:00.832 --> 00:06:02.612
So we can now write an equation.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:06.612
We could say vector a plus vector b,

00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:09.694
plus vector b,

00:06:09.694 --> 00:06:13.336
is equal to, is equal to not c,

00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:17.456
it's equal to the negative of vector c.

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:19.986
So hopefully, you found that interesting.
