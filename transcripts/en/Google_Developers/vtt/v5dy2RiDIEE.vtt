TIM ANDERSON: Hi, my
name's Tim Anderson,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.970
and I'm part of the Google
Play for Education team.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.960
As a middle school teacher
in Denver, Colorado,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.190
I was able to see first
hand the incredible impact

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.630
that technology can have
on student learning.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.470
Today we're seeing an
unprecedented level

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.850
of adoption of technology
across all subjects in school.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.340
From math to science, literacy
to the fine arts, more and more

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.090
teachers are taking
on technology

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.580
and integrating it into
their classroom practice

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880
to unlock creativity
among their students

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.710
and to facilitate
amazing collaboration.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.250
Our team here at Google works
closely with app developers.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.340
And they often ask us,
what do teachers want?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.140
We worked with
countless educators

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.960
to help understand
what distinguishes

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.140
a good app from a great one and
what key elements help to drive

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.510
engagement and adoption.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.230
In this video series,
Tech Tips From Teachers,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.240
we'll share those insights so
that educators and developers

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.390
can work together to
enable amazing learning.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.640
We hope you'll check them out.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.670
Enjoy them.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.460
Thanks so much.
