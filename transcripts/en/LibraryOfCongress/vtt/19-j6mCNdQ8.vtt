coat, Gilroy is a bully goat.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.480
Gilroy, this is not okay.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.820
Stop it or we'll go away.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.300
Being bullied is no fun.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.010
Walk away and tell someone.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.210
Gilroy fusses, frowns and pouts.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.700
Gilroy gets a long time out.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.960
Teacher says, let's try again,
Gilroy can you be a friend?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.090
No more kicking, no more names,
time to play a nicer game.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.570
End of recess, back inside.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.540
Gilroy sits by teachers side.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:17.370
Everybody sings the song and
this time Gilroy sings along.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.340
Gilroy goat has fun with Llama

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.680
but school is over,
here comes Mama.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.430
Tomorrow has more games to try.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.880
See you then.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.920
Friends wave goodbye.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.220
Goodbye. [Applause]

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.520
&gt;&gt; Caroline Quandt: Good book.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:44.080
Alright. So, now we're going to
sing about having good manners

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.740
and being kind and caring
with our friends, right?

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.510
So this is to I'm
a Little Teapot.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:16:11.040
[ Music ]

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.660
I have super manners yes I do,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.020
I can say please
and thank you too.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.360
When I play with
friends I like to share

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.650
and that's the way
to show I care.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:33.020
I have super manners, yes I do.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.660
I can say please
and thank you too.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.170
When I play with
friends I like to share

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:47.180
and that's the way
I show I care.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.480
[Applause] Oh good job.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.190
So now we're going to do
a little extended version

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.980
of that classic round.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.740
We won't try around though.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.270
Make new friends.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.510
So the tune goes--

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:12.040
[ Music ]

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.610
[Singing] Make new
friends, but keep the old,

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:21.510
one is silver and
the others gold.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:26.330
A circle is round,
it has no ends,

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:31.630
that's how long I want
to be your friend.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:36.830
A fire burns bright
it warms the heart,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.480
we've been friends
from the very start.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.470
You help me, and I'll help you

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.250
and together we will
see it through.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.550
One more time.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:57.360
[Singing] Make new
friends but keep the old,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.470
one is silver and
the others gold.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.510
A circle is round,
it has no end,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:12.190
that's how long I want
to be your friend.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:17.270
A fire burns bright,
it warms the heart,

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.890
we've been friends
from the very start.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:27.650
You help me and I'll help you

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:32.270
and together we will
see it through.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.260
Oh you sound lovely.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.010
[Applause] Alright so now we're
at the end of our story time,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.800
thank you so much Thea and
let's do our goodbye song

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.510
which is the opposite
of our hello.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.280
So goodbye is a simple
wave right?

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.680
And then we're going
to do the friends

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.830
and it's time to say goodbye.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:19:05.320
[Singing] Good bye friends, good
bye friends, goodbye friends,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.910
it's time to say goodbye.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:15.500

time at the Library of Congress.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.200
