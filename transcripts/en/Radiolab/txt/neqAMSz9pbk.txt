Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey I'm Jad Abumrad, I am Robert Kobish this is Radiolab and today

Speaker 2:          00:04          things, and I just, I wanted to check in. This is the usual radio lab style, which means that I can basically natter on forever.

Speaker 1:          00:13          All right, so this is Alison Gopnik. She's a professor of psychology and philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of the philosophical baby. And the reason we called her up is that, you know, truthfully after the egg situation, we broken egg to make this program. And if you're just joining us, we weren't planning to, it just happened. We feel really crappy about it frankly. But, um, you got us thinking about the fragility of objects and for me that call to mind, um, an idea that I've always been thinking about, uh, you know, being the father of two young kids about object permanence, which is this whole idea in a child's psychology that when babies are really young, when an object disappears from their view, they think it's gone forever. So that's the peekaboo game. Exactly. It's what makes it fun because like from their perspective thought is you're gone forever and then you're back and you're gone forever and then you're back. So, uh, I thought this would be a cool idea for us to explore about how, like from the very beginning, we're born with no concept that objects should stick around. But when we talked with Alison Gopnik, the first thing she told us was that, uh, well, it's, it's a little more complicated than that.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Of course, right? It's science. And so we got into a conversation that went in some strange directions, but she began by telling us about some new research, which shows that actually babies do have an idea that objects stick around. You know, if you do these experiments where you show them an object behind a screen and then you make disappear, they think, Whoa, where did it go? It should be there.

Speaker 2:          01:44          Exactly. Whoa. You know, the wo because babies look much longer at things that they don't expect it or surprising. It's as if they're sitting there saying, you know, what's the, um, they very rarely finish, right? So I was wrong, fine. But here's the really surprising thing. Now suppose what happens is a yellow duck goes behind the screen moving left to right and then out the other side instead of the yellow duck, there's a little blue bunny. No, most adults, if they saw this would be like what the, but the babies are totally blahzay about that. What if a yellow duck goes in one side of the screen and then magically the blue doc appears on the other side of the screen until they're about a year old. Babies don't seem to be fazed by that.

Speaker 1:          02:31          And she suspects that the reason for that is that the most important thing about the duck to the babies is not that it is yellow or round or duck. Like in any way it was its trajectory, its story, what it did in the past, what its history is like. This is an object that was moving left to right and when it emerged from the screen it was still an object moving left to right.

Speaker 2:          02:51          And there are experiments with adults that are kind of amazing, where you sort of see the same thing. You take a room full of divide them in half. You say, okay, everybody on the left, half of the room is now going to get a, you know, university kept California at Berkeley Mug and then you say to them, all right, all of you guys who have a Mug, how much would you sell your monk for? And then you ask the people on the other side of the class, how much would you pay to buy that Mug? And you get people to write it down on a piece of paper. Well, it turns out the people who actually already have the Mug on their desk think that it's much more valuable than the people on the other side. So they, they would demand much more for their mug.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Keep in mind they've only spent one minute with this Mug, but somehow over that minute she says the Mug gets imbued with something, some kind of essence.

Speaker 2:          03:41          There's something, and again, you can see this even with children, there's something about mindness, there's something about possession. About the relationship that I have to the objects that I care about that goes beyond just what their superficial features are.

Speaker 3:          03:55          Oh, I think that makes such deeply obvious sense to me. I'm surprised that it was even in discovery. If I have a relationship with the thing like, ah, I'm going to see my girlfriend and the railroad man gives me the ticket and it turns out to be a fabulous date. Then I put the ticket in my pocket and I saved the ticket for 40 years. Anytime I want to go back to the day that I had the great date, I just touched the ticket.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Yeah. I don't have that at all. You don't have that at all? Well, no. I have it a little bit, but I just know I s I throw it I, yeah, you throw them away. Hey, throw them away. You got a purge man. You know, some of us are more sentimental about the past and about objects than than others are, and she says, ah. Interestingly, that for those Weirdos like you, Robert who gets super romantic about there's things, there might be a deep evolutionary reason for it. Now you always have to take these evolutionary reasons with a grain of salt. But she says if you look at patterns of passion, for example, is what it's called in biology. You know, like the squirrel who hides is nuts. Um, the squirrels keep really good track of which nuts they have and what their histories are. And one possibility is that some of our relationship about at least physical objects stems from this history of the history of being mammals who keep track of what we've got and what we don't have.

Speaker 1:          05:17          It's my inner squirrel. Right? You know, we do talk about people squirreling things away. Is there something that's got this kind of deeper evolutionary background and I think there is some evidence that, but isn't there also like a counter squirrel instinct? I mean like there's that famous thing with observation that young male baboons when they get to a certain age will get gripped by wanderlust and then just wander away from the troop. And which is good because it prevents inbreeding. Yeah. I think there is actually reason to think that we all live on this kind of emotional, bungee cord, you know, boiling between the Squirrel and the baboon. And she says it's interesting to think about like what's gonna Happen to our bun genus now that we're entering a world where objects are becoming just information. What will happen when we have three d printers that are going to be like the replicators on Star Trek that can, uh, just keep producing replicas of, of objects might actually mess with some of our most basic instincts. Philosophers, philosophers are always great about having wonderful, crazy, um, thought experiments to try to demonstrate this. So one of them is the swamp man. It's a famous thought experiment, not exactly clear why it's a swamp man and not some other kind of man. But here's how it goes. Here's the story of the swamp, man. Magine you're standing next to a swamp, you're you and in the swamp it's a bunch of bubbling gases, chemical reactions, bubbling and interacting in some weird organic way. But whatever you just standing there, but then,

Speaker 4:          06:46          okay,

Speaker 1:          06:46          a bolt of lightning comes out of the sky and kills you and that,

Speaker 1:          06:51          oh, the other one comes out of the sky, hits the swamp, catalyzing all that chemistry into overdrive and somehow miraculously, for just a moment, the reactions come together and just the right way to form. Hi, I'm Robert. Oh Man. Completely identical to you, Robert, Robert, and brand new you. If you took every single molecule in the swamp man's body, it would be exactly like yours at this very moment. So here's the question. Does swamp Robert Remember that date or does swamp Robert Care about the ticket? You're saying that swamp gas rubber is molecule for molecule Adam for Adam molecule for molecule. This Robert Right here. Exactly. So you're saying, are the memories and experiences of his life suddenly contained in that facts? Emily, that's the question. And most people's intuition is no, no, absolutely not. Absolutely not. I'm not even hesitated. Why? Why not? Why didn't I believe that my date and the ticket that took me to that date, they belong to me and not to Adams and, but I don't have you asked me what's the difference between me and my Adams?

Speaker 1:          07:58          I don't know, but I know it's there. Right? Well, because the atoms have you sitting right there actually went on that date. Where's the atoms of swamp gas? Robert weren't there. Right? You think you got it? Exactly right. Yet it's something about the history. It's the fact that, you know, Robert's Adam's really were in that place. They really were there with that person. And, um, although I could, I could tell a version of the swamp gas Robert that would, I think, solve this problem if Robert, this Robert instead of the lightning, he just got into the swamp, submerged himself, commingled his Adams with the swamp gas Adams, and then he got out, went on his way. If then later, even like years later, the swamp, I'm Robert spat out of copy. The fact that the real Robert was there to begin with and that the copy somehow touched on almost like a baton passing. I could see that the date would be in the copy. I think you might be [inaudible] or do you get with me? I think I'm right. I've always it to myself

Speaker 3:          08:56          with you list a sense of touch that is, my wife has a very different view of this to me, but I one day was sitting around in the office, get a letter unbidden from the first man on the moon from Neil Armstrong. Just write something about I written, he sort of who you got to do it and it says commander Neil Armstrong and it's very flattering. And if it had come in any other form, but by email I would've framed it. I would've given it a special place of honor. But since it arrived from a machine to my machine and then out of a machine to another machine to a flat piece of paper, you can't give it to thank here. Give it to the ticket to the deep thing. Huh? Can't, that's weird. Why? Because Neil Armstrong never touched it. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:42          yeah, but you and I are old Roberts, so maybe that's

Speaker 3:          09:46          no, well, yeah. So, so Chad, you don't have that feeling? Well, no. The moment you said it, I thought I was, I was constructing an image in my mind of Neil Armstrong at a computer touching the keyboard and there is an unbridgeable gulf between his fingers and that paper you're holding, they never actually touched each other. I mean if you think about it as touch, then you're right. I guess he, he's now dead. And I think if just touching the paper, he would, he would just be a little, I don't know, a closer somehow.

Speaker 2:          10:20          It's a funny tension I think because you know what? Both science and at least some philosophical and even religious traditions tell us is that the world is impermanent. Nothing in it stays the same. Our, our, we don't stay the same. Our bodies don't stay the same. The people that we love and the things we love don't stay the same. That's just the truth of the matter is that there's this constant impermanence and this constant flux and some philosophers have argued over the years, we should just embrace that we would be freer if we didn't, if we didn't try to hold that flux for a moment. I have to say my feeling about it is part of what makes everything so precious to us is exactly the fact that we know it's going to disappear. We know it's impermanent, we know it won't last, but what we love is this thing now.

Speaker 2:          11:07          We love our I. For me, the most dramatic example of this is our relationship to our children. So yeah, we know they're going to go. We know that in 20 years from now, if we, they treat us with affectionate contempt will be doing really well, but that doesn't change the fact that right now it's this child and not any other child in the universe just do this one. And I think that's, there's something really deep and profound about our human lives that the fact that we can do both of those things. We recognize the impermanence, but that we feel the attachments that that seems to me to give our life its its very special texture.

Speaker 3:          11:44          Wow. That's exactly, I could just put that whole thing. You just hit it in the frame, right. Just bow down. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:52          People don't bow too soon friend, because

Speaker 5:          11:53          the next segment, uh, is going to hurt. It's going to hurt and it's a Tamar wind is blowing. That's all I'll say.

Speaker 4:          12:09          [inaudible].
