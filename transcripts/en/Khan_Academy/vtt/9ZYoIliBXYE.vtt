00:00:00.311 --> 00:00:02.028
- [Voiceover] What I wanna
do in this video is prove

00:00:02.028 --> 00:00:05.952
that parallel lines have the same slope.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:09.528
So let's draw some parallel lines here.

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:14.110
So, that's one line and then
let me draw another line

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.789
that is parallel to that.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.288
I'm claiming that these
are parallel lines.

00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:22.081
And now, I'm gonna draw
some transversals here.

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.787
So first let me draw a
horizontal transversal.

00:00:25.787 --> 00:00:27.160
So, just like that.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.894
And then let me do a vertical transversal.

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:31.439
So,

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.858
just like that.

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:34.987
And I'm assuming that the
green one is horizontal

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:36.212
and the blue one is vertical.

00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:38.861
So we assume that they are
perpendicular to each other,

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:41.244
that these intersect at right angles.

00:00:41.244 --> 00:00:43.772
And from this, I'm gonna figure out,

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:48.406
I'm gonna use some parallel
line angle properties

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:49.942
to establish that this triangle

00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:52.075
and this triangle are similar

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:55.864
and then use that to establish
that both of these lines,

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:59.703
both of these yellow
lines have the same slope.

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:01.597
So actually let me label some points here.

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:05.347
So let's call that point
A, point B, point C,

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:09.507
point D, and point E.

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.439
So, let's see.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.369
First of all we know that angle CED

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.536
is going to be congruent to angle AEB,

00:01:21.627 --> 00:01:23.253
because they're both right angles.

00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:25.525
So that's a right angle and
then that is a right angle

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:26.779
right over there.

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:29.628
We also know some things
about corresponding angles

00:01:29.628 --> 00:01:33.352
for where our transversal
intersects parallel lines.

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:36.705
This angle corresponds
to this angle if we look

00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:39.794
at the blue transversal as it
intersects those two lines.

00:01:39.794 --> 00:01:41.505
And so they're going to
be, they're going to have

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:43.503
the same measure, they're
going to be congruent.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.031
Now this angle on one side of this point B

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:47.844
is going to also be congruent to that,

00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:49.549
because they are vertical angles.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.370
We've seen that multiple times before.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.945
And so we know that this angle, angle ABE

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:57.059
is congruent to angle ECD.

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:59.862
Sometimes this is called
alternate interior angles

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:03.030
of a transversal and parallel lines.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.197
Well, if you look at triangle
CED and triangle ABE,

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:10.280
we see they already have
two angles in common,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.757
so if they have two angles in common,

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:15.059
well, then their third
angle has to be in common.

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.163
So, because this third
angle's just gonna be

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:20.031
180 minus these other two,
and so this third angle

00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:22.960
is just gonna be 180
minus this, the other two.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.973
And so just like that, we
notice we have all three angles

00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:29.170
are the same in both of these triangles,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.060
well, they're not all the same,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.234
but all of the corresponding angles,

00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:34.916
I should say, are the same.

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:38.556
This blue angle has the same
measure as this blue angle,

00:02:38.556 --> 00:02:40.392
this magenta angle has the same measure

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.355
as this magenta angle,
and then the other angles

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:44.698
are right angles, these
are right triangles here.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:47.115
So we could say triangle AEB,

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:49.975
triangle AEB

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.225
is similar, similar

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:58.814
similar to triangle DEC,

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:05.006
triangle DEC

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.700
by, and we could say
by angle, angle, angle,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.851
all the corresponding
angles are congruent,

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.936
so we are dealing with similar triangles.

00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:17.119
And so we know similar
triangles are a ratio

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.800
of corresponding sides
are going to be the same.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.996
So we could say that
the ratio of let's say

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:28.163
the ratio of BE, the ratio of
BE, let me write this down,

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.720
this is this side right
over here, the ratio of BE

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.387
to AE, to AE, to AE,

00:03:40.764 --> 00:03:44.931
is going to be equal to, so
that side over that side,

00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:47.094
well what is the corresponding side?

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:50.189
The corresponding side to BE is side CE.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.623
So that's going to be the same

00:03:51.623 --> 00:03:54.873
as the ratio between CE and DE, and DE.

00:03:58.252 --> 00:03:59.528
And this just comes out of similar,

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:03.028
the similarity of the triangles, CE to DE.

00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:07.613
So once again, once we established

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:09.269
these triangles are similar,
we can say the ratio

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.406
of corresponding sides
are going to be the same.

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:15.739
Now what is the ratio between BE and AE?

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.956
The ratio between BE and AE.

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:24.070
Well that is the slope of
this top line right over here.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.634
We could say that's the slope of line AB,

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.717
slope of line connecting,

00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:35.256
connecting

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.313
A to B.

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.257
All right, let me just use,
I could write it like this,

00:04:41.257 --> 00:04:43.674
that is slope of, slope of A,

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.302
slope of line AB.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.270
Remember slope is, when
you're going from A to B,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.103
it's change in y over change in x.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:00.563
So when you're going from A
to B, your change in x is AE,

00:05:01.717 --> 00:05:04.550
and your change in y is BE, or EB,

00:05:05.487 --> 00:05:06.585
however you want to refer to it.

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:09.428
So this right over here is change in y,

00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:12.142
and this over here is change in x.

00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:13.991
Well, now let's look at
this second expression

00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.324
right over here, CE over DE, CE over DE.

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:22.544
Well, now, this is going to be change in y

00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:26.044
over change in x between point C and D.

00:05:27.182 --> 00:05:32.005
So this is, this right over
here, this is the slope of

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:33.422
line, of line CD.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:38.601
And so just like that, by
establishing similarity,

00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:39.571
we were able see the ratio

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:41.465
of corresponding sides are congruent,

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:44.425
which shows us that the
slopes of these two lines

00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:45.788
are going to be the same.

00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:47.121
And we are done.
