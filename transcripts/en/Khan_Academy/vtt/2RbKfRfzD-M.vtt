00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.366
Voiceover:What I want to
attempt to do in this video

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:07.236
is figure out what the
sine of seven pi over 12 is

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.100
without using a calculator.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.966
And so let's just
visualize seven pi over 12

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.601
in the unit circle.

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:18.300
One side of the angle is going
along the positive x-axis

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.966
and then let's see,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.837
if we go straight up, that's pi over two,

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.767
which is the same thing as six pi over 12,

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:25.234
so then we essentially just
have another pi over 12

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.036
to get right over there.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:29.234
This is the angle that we're talking about

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:33.034
that is seven pi over 12 radians,

00:00:33.034 --> 00:00:33.967
and the sine of it,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.367
by the unit circle definition of sine,

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:39.356
it's the y-coordinate of where this ray

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:40.966
intersects the unit circle.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.167
This is the unit circle,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.366
has radius one

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.766
where it intersects the unit.

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.633
The y-coordinate is the sine.

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.033
Another way to think about it,

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:52.834
it's the length of this
line right over here.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.567
I encourage you to pause
the video right now

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:56.567
and try to think about it on your own.

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:59.501
See if you can use your
powers of trigonometry

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:02.902
to figure out what sine
of seven pi over 12 is

00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:05.333
or essentially the length
of this magenta line.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.848
I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:09.633
and if you're like me,

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.033
your first temptation might have been

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.181
just to focus on this
triangle right over here

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.033
that I drew for you.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.576
The triangle looks like this.

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:19.834
It looks like this,

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:23.100
where that's what you're
trying to figure out,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.034
this length right over here,

00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:26.510
sine of seven pi over 12.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.134
We know the length of
the hypotenuse is one.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.633
It's a radius of the unit circle.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:36.833
It's a right triangle right over there.

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:39.500
We also know this angle right over here,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.233
which is this angle right over here,

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:43.566
this gets us six pi over 12,

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:44.633
and then we have another pi over 12,

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.233
so we know that that is pi over 12,

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:48.433
not pi over 16.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:51.266
We know that this angle right
over here is pi over 12.

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:52.700
Given this information,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.499
we can figure out this,

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.300
or we can at least relate
this side to this other side

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.767
using a trig function
relative to this angle.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:02.800
This is the adjacent side.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.834
The cosine of pi over 12 is going to be

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.766
this magenta side over one,

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.700
or you could just say it's
equal to this magenta side.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.334
You could say that this
is cosine of pi over 12.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:16.100
We just figured out that
sine of seven pi over 12

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.967
is the same thing as cosine of pi over 12,

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:20.100
but that still doesn't help me.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.100
I don't know offhand what the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.767
cosine of pi over 12 radians is

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.400
without using a calculator.

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.300
Instead of thinking about it this way,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.570
let's see if we can compose this angle

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.500
or if we can decompose it into some angles

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.566
for which we do know the sine and cosine.

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:35.633
What angles are those?

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:37.953
Those are the angles in
special right triangles.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.566
For example,

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.968
we are very familiar
with 30-60-90 triangles.

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:46.670
30-60-90 triangles look
something like this.

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:49.934
This is my best attempt
at hand drawing it.

00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:53.566
Instead of writing 30-degree side,

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:54.700
since we're thinking in radians,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.071
I'll write that as pi over six radians.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:59.033
The 60-degree side,
I'm going to write that

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:00.547
as pi over three radians,

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.701
and of course, this is the right angle.

00:03:02.701 --> 00:03:05.501
If the hypotenuse here is one,

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.773
then the side opposite the 30-degree side,

00:03:07.773 --> 00:03:09.233
or the pi over six radian side,

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:10.501
is going to be half the hypotenuse,

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:12.367
which, in this case is 1/2.

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:15.233
Then the other side that's
opposite the 60-degree side

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.501
or the pi over three radian side,

00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:19.779
is going to be square root of
three times the shorter side.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.701
It's going to be square
root of three over two.

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.978
We've used these types
of triangles in the past

00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:28.100
to figure out the sine
or cosine of 30 or 60,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.100
or in this case,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.900
pi over six or pi over three.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.104
We know about pi over
six and pi over three.

00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:37.366
We also know about 45-45-90 triangles.

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:42.036
We know that they're
isosceles right triangles.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:43.434
They look like this,

00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:45.300
my best attempt at drawing it.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.033
That one actually doesn't
look that isosceles,

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:50.799
so let me make it a little bit more ...

00:03:51.592 --> 00:03:52.176
I don't know.

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:57.533
That looks closer to being
an isosceles right triangle.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.966
We know if the length of
the hypotenuse is one,

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:02.967
and this comes straight
out of Pythagorean theorem,

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:04.966
then the length of each
of the other two sides

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:07.433
are going to be square
root of two over two

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:08.233
times the hypotenuse,

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.433
which, in this case, is the
square root of two over two.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.366
Instead of describing
these as 45-degree angles,

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:15.500
we know that's the same
thing as pi over four,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.266
pi over four radians.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.367
If you give me pi over six,
pi over three, pi over four,

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:22.900
I can use these triangles

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.567
either using the classic definition,

00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:25.766
SOHCAHTOA definitions,

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.300
or I could stick them
on the unit circle here

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.033
to use the unit circle
definition of trig functions

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.115
to figure out what the
sine, cosine, or tangent

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:34.039
of these angles are.

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.366
Can I decompose seven pi
over 12 into some combination

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:41.133
of pi over sixes, pi over
threes, or pi over fours?

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:42.166
Think about that.

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.968
Let me rewrite pi over six, pi over three,

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:44.900
and pi over four

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.766
with a denominator over 12.

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:47.566
Let me write that.

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:52.633
Pi over six is equal to two pi over 12,

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:57.500
pi over three is equal to four pi over 12,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.266
and pi over four is equal
to three pi over 12.

00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:05.233
Let's see.

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:07.033
Two plus four is not seven,

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:08.367
two plus three is not seven,

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:10.846
but four plus three is seven.

00:05:10.984 --> 00:05:15.166
So I could use this and this.

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:17.436
Four pi over 12 plus three pi over 12

00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:20.166
is seven pi over 12.

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.233
I could rewrite this.

00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:27.980
This is the same thing as
sine of three pi over 12

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.700
plus 4 pi over 12,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.700
which, of course, is the same thing,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.779
sine of pi over 4,

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.100
I'll do this in another color,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.933
sine of pi over 4 plus ...

00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:45.766
let me do this ...

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:51.026
plus pi over three,

00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:55.368
Now we can use our angle
addition formula for sine

00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:57.971
in order to write this
as the sum of products

00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:00.900
of cosines and sines of these angles.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.174
Let's actually do that.

00:06:03.174 --> 00:06:06.300
This right over here is
going to be equal to,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.033
this is going to be equal to the sine,

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:22.001
the sine of pi over four times
the cosine of pi over three

00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:24.237
plus the other way around,

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:30.900
cosine of pi over four times
the sine of pi over three,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.233
sine of pi over three.

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:34.833
Now we just have to
figure out these things,

00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:36.833
and I've already set up
the triangles to do it.

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:39.357
What is sine of pi over four?

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:40.500
Sine of pi over four,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.401
well, let's think about ...

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:44.366
This is pi over four right over here.

00:06:44.366 --> 00:06:48.066
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.067
That's just going to be
square root of two over two.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.379
This is square root of two over two,

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.234
square root of two over two.

00:06:55.234 --> 00:06:57.900
What is cosine of pi over three?

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.566
This is a pi over three
radian angle right over here.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:04.556
Cosine is adjacent over a hypotenuse.

00:07:05.632 --> 00:07:07.445
It's adjacent over a hypotenuse,

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:09.852
so this is going to be 1/2.

00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:12.234
What is cosine of pi over four?

00:07:12.234 --> 00:07:13.300
Go back to pi over four.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.302
It's adjacent over a hypotenuse.

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:16.967
It's square root of two over two.

00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:20.903
It is also square root of two over two,

00:07:20.903 --> 00:07:23.301
square root of two over two.

00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:25.833
What's sine of pi over three?

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:28.966
Sine is opposite over a hypotenuse,

00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:31.100
so square root of three over two over one.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.500
Square root of three
over two divided by one,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.234
which is square root of three over two.

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:38.701
Now we just have to simplify
all of this business.

00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:43.501
This is going to be
equal to the sum of this,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.700
or the product, I should say,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.966
is just square root of two over four,

00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:54.033
and then plus the product of these.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.033
Let's see.

00:07:55.033 --> 00:08:00.433
We could write that as
square root of six over four,

00:08:00.433 --> 00:08:03.767
square root of six over four,

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:06.566
or we could just rewrite
this whole thing as,

00:08:06.566 --> 00:08:12.302
and we deserve a little bit
of a drum roll at this point,

00:08:12.302 --> 00:08:13.833
this is equivalent to,

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:15.767
let me just scroll over
to the right a little bit.

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:18.501
This is equivalent to square root of two

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:21.980
plus square root of six,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.977
all of that over four.

00:08:25.977 --> 00:08:29.704
That's what sine of seven pi over 12 is,

00:08:29.704 --> 00:08:31.248
or cosine of pi over 12,

00:08:31.248 --> 00:08:33.333
what that is equal to.
