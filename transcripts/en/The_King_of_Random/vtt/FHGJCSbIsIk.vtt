00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.040
What's up guys welcome back. I'm Grant Thompson The King of Random. I'm Brian Brushwood from the Modern Rogue

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.210
And did you know that during the American Civil war soldiers would go out and get brass knuckles or steel knuckles?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.670
But if they weren't available, they would take bullets and melt them down for the lead content to make a pair of lead knuckles

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.199
using the enemy's ammunition against them right in their faces, for this project

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.169
We thought it would be fun to replicate that experiment although, we don't have any ammunition

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.750
yeah, but this is fishing Country Central, Texas. We got plenty of lead fishing weights. Here's the theory

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.630
We're going to take some play-doh and build kind of a little base that will accommodate play sand. Now Brian got this play

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.329
out of his kids play pit. So we thank you for the donation

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.140
Brian's family

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.480
Once the sand is packed in there in the consistency of about Sandcastle sand we want to dig out

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.779
Something that resembles the mold for brass knuckles

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.120
we're going to melt down the fishing weights with a propane torch and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.500
Carefully pour it into that mold and let it set and see if we can make ourselves an improvised pair of knuckles

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.040
that's not safe

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.140
so what we've done here is we've fashioned a retaining wall all the way around the edge of this rock and

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.340
We put a little play doh bottom in there as well

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.559
We're gonna go get some sand Moisten it down pack it down there and really good

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.739
And then we're gonna carve out the groove of the type of knuckles

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.180
We want to make hard to not just keep touching it it feels real good. It does feel really good all right

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.689
What do you think?

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.189
I think this is looking pretty good

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.509
So we're not sure if this is gonna work or not

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.479
But we're using play-doh stubbs to represent the fingers so the question is will a Molten lead flow around the Play-doh

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.849
Or will it just take it out cause like this is actually yeah, I'm kind of thinking it will actually just float up

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.160
oh, what if we put a stick across now. It's time to look like a proper mold

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.260
there we go

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.960
Okay, cool. So we got a really rough mold set

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.369
This is just proof of concept we're not going for perfection here, but now that we've got our mold ready

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.280
Let's go ahead and melt the let pour it in and just see if we can get this thing to even work at all

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.920
Oh Wow! It looks exactly like it's done

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.220
Those are brass knuckles. That's already solidified

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.680
Yeah, just like that. I think I think we got a winner so we literally just poured this stuff and it looks amazing

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.740
It's already factory finished

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.140
So we're just gonna rip it out of the mold it's still really hot, but I can't believe it's already solidified

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.130
Yeah, no, no, I would imagine look

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.050
I don't want to get punched in the face by these no

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.199
And I don't think they're perfect but I think for proof of concept this is pretty good

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200
Oh my God 100% let's see what we got

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.859
This is all hard already. We pulled the stick out our little retaining device. Look at that. Is it burning you at all? No?

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.640
Cool

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Look at that. oh

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.650
Grant it's perfect. Oh wow

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.120
So you can actually just pop the play-doh. Yeah, and we have our finger holes, whoa

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.000
whaaaat!

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.680
That worked unbelievably well! lead knuckles are nothing wow. I am so surprised that the Play-doh held up to the lead

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.520
Yeah, I thought it would have caught on fire and just incinerated it look at that

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.520
Wow, I'm gonna touch yeah. Oh my gosh. Is that still hot? What are you really ah?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.339
does that actually fit your hand? yes! It fits perfectly

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.089
try this try this this is amazing first try. I cannot believe it was that simple. Let's go clean these things up. Yeah, you got it

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.220
Do we even need to use the sand or could We just make the mold out of the Play-doh itself?

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.009
It's an awesome psychedelic mold it is look at that. That's cool.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.200
Oh wait, that's how we make it. Yeah, don't worry

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.020
[laughing] how easy is that?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.920
The Civil war soldiers should of probably, they should have been using play-doh. What were they thinking? oh, that's ideal

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.560
Space things looking okay to me there

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.100
its bubbling

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.640
Oh Wow, is it leaking do you think?

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.220
I Think it's uh removing the water from the, oh the water is boiling off. Yeah I think the water steaming

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.960
Well at least gives us a reason for the sand, but that looks great though. I think it just solidified right there.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.860
smoking!

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.920
let's pull this thing apart and see how we did. well the nice thing is it just peels back Huh? look at that

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:44.949
uh, it's got some slimy residues. Its left the psychedelic ehh buzz all around it look at that

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.169
Oh look at that actually it's not it's not as hot as you'd think it cools off pretty fast right well our playdough

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.019
Placeholders seemed to serve their purpose guys

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.409
This is unbelievable, so these are the ones that just came out of the play-doh. They're rough

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.968
But you know what if you put a little more time into making your mold. oh it would look amazing, and look at this

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.179
Let's work the fingers through there these things are legit

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.709
The best part is once you've made one good pair that becomes your basis for all your copies, right?

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.669
So once you make one pair you just use it and push it down in the play-doh and push it in there you got an

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.438
Instant mold this is the one that we made using sand and you can see how it's really coarse on the bottom

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.659
It's actually a pretty cool texture comes out nice and smooth on the top though where everything levels out and the one that we made

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.499
with the Play-doh comes out a little bit smoother, so a couple cool options

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.500
It's amazing to see how quickly this came together

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.349
Especially when we really didn't spend much time on them at all. question, Do you think when I slammed this down

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.200
Do you think these will buckle under? well That's good point. You could try yeah, all right you ready, yeah.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400
oooohhhhh

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.540
This is tough, wow! look at that you can see a dent in it, but it it is not going anywhere

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:53.559
Wow, these are tough pretty cool. So apparently this is a very viable idea it really does work

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.430
Yeah, we use Play-doh

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.829
And sand that I could totally see using clay and just some random stuff you found on the ground to create these bad boys you

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.219
Could probably even do it with cow poop you know what you can do it with cow poo

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.889
I may be from Texas and I have my limits sir

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.660
as we prove that this concept really does work now of course knuckledusters like these are illegal in most states including the state of

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.899
Texas so we're just gonna melt these down and use them for lead ingots instead

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.429
But you can see how this idea is very plausible and can be duplicated very easily and Mr.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.669
Brian brushwood anything you want to tell the folks before we go. Hey come check out our channel

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.369
We're on a quest to become the ultimate Modern rogues. I think you'll dig it

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.569
I'll put his link down in the description so go check them out, and as for you guys we looking for the next project

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.120
talk to you then

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.340
[laughing]

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.640
remember this trick to use Play-doh to pick up Play-doh
