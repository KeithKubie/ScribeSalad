00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.740
 The world is now deeply divided by 81% of liberals and conservatives alike 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.079
 Anti views towards those on the other side 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.200
 But is there a fundamental biological difference between liberals and conservatives? 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.160
 Floating on the surface can see some interesting differences like 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.340
 Conservatives tend to eat more meat and potatoes while liberals tend to try to eat from other cultures more 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.170
 In general, conservatives prefer original dogs while liberals prefer mixed breeds and liberals are fine with free hair, while conservatives prefer it to rhyme 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.469
 But when we study it more, we recognize that the differences are much deeper when a magnetic resonance scan is performed 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.729
 It turns out that liberals are more likely to have a larger frontal frontal cortex 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.960
 Which is associated 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 Understanding and monitoring the conflict, while the tonsil-conservatives have a larger 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.320
 Which helps to address fear and anxiety, this is logical given the years of research that have shown that people tend to be more conservative 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 When they feel threatened or afraid? 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.749
 After Sept. 11, for example, the United States has become more politically conservative with studies showing increased support for issues 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.589
 Such as national security and military spending, but studies have also found that conservatives and liberals employ different cognitive styles 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.029
 Conservatives are superior when it comes to more structural problems or organizing issues 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:20.008
 While liberals tend to be more flexible and less likely to make mistakes with issues that involve conflicting information and require fast reaction times 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.979
 One study looked at the bedrooms so found that on average 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.519
 Conservative student rooms were less messy than liberals 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.790
 But they also suffer from pain in many different ways. So that one of the studies was able to predict who is a liberal or conservative 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.780
 Just by showing them scanning the brain looking at the pictures 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.989
 Containing amputation. In this case, the liberal minds were more active in the somatosensory region to the region 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.729
 Which is usually activated when you are in pain, but also when you see someone else suffering 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.078
 It is an essential scientific evidence of the stereotype of liberal heartfeltism 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.319
 This does not mean conservatives are indifferent, but only respond to images in a different way 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.969
 In America this can explain how Democrats and Republicans view the world in fundamentally different ways 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.559
 It's hard to understand how someone thinks on the other side of politics because we tend to overstate the extent to which our views are believed 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.899
 That some values ​​are natural, psychology refers to this bias as a false consensus. For example, if you hear Yani 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.870
 In the Latina versus Laurel debate, you may feel like an ordinary person 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.659
 It was crazy that anyone who could hear Laurel apply this logic to politics and you can see why people have 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970
 Polarized ideas on issues such as immigration 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.799
 Rights of gun and abortion ... etc 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.759
 But where do these differences emerge from? One study has shown that genetics can represent about thirty to forty percent 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.030
 Of the political tendencies of the individual that may seem as much but there are still many other important factors such as the environment 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.479
 And personal experiences that play enormous roles in your political views 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:55.129
 Neuroscience is a relatively new area of ​​study with striking results and in an increasingly fragmented world 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.378
 An important aspect of unity may involve the use of neuroscience to better understand the differences between them 

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:02.378
