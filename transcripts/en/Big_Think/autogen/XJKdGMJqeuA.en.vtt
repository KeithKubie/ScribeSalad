you<00:01:00.460><c> know</c><00:01:00.640><c> I</c><00:01:00.670><c> think</c><00:01:00.879><c> that</c><00:01:01.300><c> the</c><00:01:01.510><c> question</c><00:01:01.870><c> I</c>

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 align:start position:0%
you know I think that the question I
 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
you know I think that the question I
guess<00:01:02.440><c> for</c><00:01:02.649><c> the</c><00:01:02.739><c> counterparties</c><00:01:03.370><c> at</c><00:01:03.520><c> AIG</c><00:01:04.000><c> and</c>

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 align:start position:0%
guess for the counterparties at AIG and
 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.510 align:start position:0%
guess for the counterparties at AIG and
this<00:01:04.239><c> is</c><00:01:04.360><c> a</c><00:01:04.390><c> major</c><00:01:04.659><c> issue</c><00:01:04.809><c> and</c><00:01:05.320><c> not</c><00:01:05.950><c> just</c><00:01:06.190><c> swaps</c>

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
this is a major issue and not just swaps
 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.030 align:start position:0%
this is a major issue and not just swaps
but<00:01:06.909><c> in</c><00:01:07.180><c> the</c><00:01:07.600><c> wholesale</c><00:01:07.900><c> market</c><00:01:07.960><c> and</c><00:01:08.560><c> that</c><00:01:08.799><c> is</c>

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
but in the wholesale market and that is
 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.999 align:start position:0%
but in the wholesale market and that is
to<00:01:09.820><c> what</c><00:01:10.030><c> extent</c><00:01:10.450><c> do</c><00:01:11.080><c> participants</c><00:01:11.799><c> in</c><00:01:11.890><c> their</c>

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 align:start position:0%
to what extent do participants in their
 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.999 align:start position:0%
to what extent do participants in their

position of their counterparties and I
 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.850 align:start position:0%
position of their counterparties and I
think<00:01:17.979><c> the</c><00:01:18.100><c> answer</c><00:01:18.130><c> is</c><00:01:18.460><c> people</c><00:01:18.970><c> don't</c><00:01:19.000><c> ask</c>

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
think the answer is people don't ask
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
think the answer is people don't ask
they<00:01:20.860><c> just</c><00:01:20.890><c> deal</c><00:01:21.729><c> with</c><00:01:21.970><c> each</c><00:01:22.119><c> other</c><00:01:22.360><c> and</c><00:01:22.810><c> this</c>

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
they just deal with each other and this
 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
they just deal with each other and this
