00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.800
It's amazing how deletion of a single

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.375
letter can make the entire protein non-functional.

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:08.650
&gt;&gt; Exactly. That single deletion of guanine and

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.530
position 258 causes an early stop codon which

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.610
completely shortens the protein, making it non-functional in

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.160
a way that it can't even add the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.950
A antigen or the B antigen, it can't add any antigen at all, so you end

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.520
up with type O. That's really awesome, but

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.570
okay there is one question that's been bugging me.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.800
&gt;&gt; How does somebody end up with an AB blood type?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.060
&gt;&gt; That is a good question. What do you think? Put in the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.560
text box here how you think someone can have an AB blood type.
