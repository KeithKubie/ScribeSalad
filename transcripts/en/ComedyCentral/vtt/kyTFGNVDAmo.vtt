00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.768
Hey, girls. Janice,
is that really you?

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.172
Wow, you look amazing.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:14.459
You must have had 75 different
expensive surgeries over the course of many years
to get a great look like that.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.920
Nope, I just called Dr. Ron
and Cut 2 The Chase.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.260
Aren't you tired
of plastic surgeons

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.057
who tell you to slow down or
think about what you're doing,

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.593
forcing you to undergo one
surgery after another

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.395
till you get the look you want?

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.831
Who has
the time or money for that?

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.067
At Cut 2 The Chase,
we do it all

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:37.637
in just one affordable,
apocalyptic procedure.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.738
Would you like to look
like a human-cat hybrid

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.373
who eats bees?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.542
Of course you would.

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:44.210
You have
crippling body dysmorphia,

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.312
and no one can talk
sense into you.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.549
(woman lisping)
I used to hate people
knowing if I was happy or sad.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.918
Now my face and labia
look the same.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.054
Thanks, Dr. Ron.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.196
My college-aged daughter
is really cute,

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:05.298
and that was threatening to me.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:09.502
But now, my face is the one
threatening her

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.871
and all children.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:13.673
Thanks,
Dr. Ron.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.941
When I was a human,
I hated it.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.443
Now I poop in sand.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.644
Thanks, Dr. Ron.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.779
(meows)

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.082
With my patented
Hail Mary technique,

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.684
I can perform five divorces'
worth of surgery

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.487
in one easy procedure.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:31.758
Hmm.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.793
Don't you owe it to yourself

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.795
to look like you fell into
a tank of chemicals

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.797
while fighting Batman?

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:41.801
Come to Cut 2 The Chase and get
your first and last procedure.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.202
Cut 2 The Chase.

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:44.903
Because
you're (bleep) shattered.
