Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. So the, I guess my first question is like what? What conceivable set of circumstances led to you doing what you did? I just thought it would be a weird thing to do. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's like, well that would be weird. We don't know if it's funny, but we try it out. So yeah. Is it going to be weird? We'll do it. Yeah. Is it going to alienate half the audience? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35          No.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Okay. Wait, just to set things up, you'd better. Those two people that you just heard her wrist and show and Kurt Brown? No. Hello?

Speaker 3:          00:49          They are comedians. That's it. And we first heard about the bit you're about to hear from Jesse Thorn. Yes. The host of the sound of young America. Yes. Great. Yeah. Are you rolling over there, Jessie? No, let me record you. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02          From my phone. Okay. Yeah, I'm rolling.

Speaker 1:          01:06          So you said that when Kurt and Kristen walk on stage, what happened? Well, there's a cuddle of jokes up top. You know, they joke about this, this TV show that they hosted in the 70s uncle Ben's farmyard courthouse. I explained the American judicial system using a court house made completely of animals. Yeah, it was canceled immediately. Yeah. And so the audience is kind of laughing at the jokes, thinking like, oh, this is going to be a regular comedy sketch sketch from it tonight. All right. Hey Harrigan. I got ready. I'm ready. Okay. Okay. And then they go into this song.

Speaker 4:          01:41          Oh, okay. Tom. Oh good. Tom Is does this maniacal singing, clapping. Christine is doing this horsey day. It's like, Oh wow, wow, wow.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Can you do this viewer in like why Titian Jad like when we do it, we like at the, after the third [inaudible] my last name. They get it like, oh, they could just going to do over and over

Speaker 4:          03:00          and then somewhere around like four AV around the fourth time. Then it's not really enough. Money I use is quiet. They're like, I'm done with this, I'm done. I don't want to watch this anymore. Why are they still doing it? And then, and then that changes the actual hatred and they're like, you stupid people, you to stupid people, but somewhere between like nine and 11 and they then they're like, oh, I like this. You could be like [inaudible] you get this next level, which is they can't continue doing this and then they do continue doing it. Okay. But again, they really, their eyes are starting to cross by that point. I'm dripping sweat. Kristen's angry that I've gone that long. It's like look good. I mean you can hear a Kurt in that thing like losing track of the song because he's going into some kind of fuse. Wow. Have had her on stage whisper, stop it. I love here I walk in my house [inaudible] this is maybe my favorite thing in the history of the world.

Speaker 5:          04:50          What I love about it is that your brain is trying to make it into what you want it to be, which is a joke, but there is no joke happening. And so what these two people are doing is creating the expectation that the expectation is going to be broken, but then breaking that expectation that the expectation is going to be broken by just delivering the thing that they've been delivering over and over for the past 10 minutes. What's the longest

Speaker 1:          05:16          10 minutes in Australia? Cause you were drunk? Yeah, it seemed like it seemed like 10 minutes. We can't be sure if it was 10 minutes. It seems like there's no way it's 10 minutes. You what? It was 10 minutes and the audience went crazy.

Speaker 4:          05:34          No, but you really do

Speaker 6:          05:38          Kristen Schaal as a whole. Justin Scholl is a home. The good or okay to go look good or dance like, Oh hey, I'm Chad at boom. Ron's in Charlotte. I'm Robert Krulwich dance. This is Radiolab and today, oh today it's all about loops. Things

Speaker 1:          05:58          that happen over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Coming up. Lipstick hurt you stream loops that heal you. Dangerous sleeps, that scare you. Loops and loops and loops that incomplete you at what? Kristen's

Speaker 7:          06:14          a [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:21          So where, where are you guys? What? We were in San Francisco. You're in San Francisco, you're not in Texas? No, just sounds like we're in Texas. Yes. She's from Texas. So like can you guys actually just a, if you don't mind, introduce yourself so we know we have your name and all that. Sure. I'm Mary Sue Campbell. I live in Novato, California and my daughter Christine is 30 years old. I live in San Francisco. Um, and I was raised in Nevato in the house that said this didn't happen. That shall we begin. Okay. Tell me the beginning w how this story starts from the beginning. I thought it was odd. Christine actually called me Tuesday morning about 10 o'clock and just said, oh, what are you doing mom? And I said, Oh, I'm just going to go out in the yard and do some yard work and run some errands.

Speaker 1:          07:08          And she said, we ought to do the yard work early because it's going to be hot today. So we're in, we're in the summertime. It's summertime. Yeah, it was August, August 24th and apparently what, 10 minutes later, half an hour later, she said, I called her, she had left me a voicemail, something like, Hey Christine, it's mom. Something's, something's not right. Something's wrong. I need you to call me back. So I gave her a call back and, and she said something thing about the house isn't right. There's things look weird in here. What's weird? What are you talking about? And then she said, well, I'm looking at the calendar and it says August, 2010 and I'm like, uh Huh. No. She's like, well that's not right. And I said, well, yes it is August 24th, 2010 and as soon as I said that out loud, I grabbed my purse

Speaker 8:          08:00          to leave. Oh my God, she's had a stroke. That was my, my, my first reaction. And um, oh, that makes me feel emotional. And so Christine says she walked out of her house to the car, keeping your mom on the phone. What else do you see? I'm just trying to keep her talking to me. All the while. Her mom's telling her one thing after another just doesn't look right. She says there's a strange black truck on the driveway, which is the truck that belongs to her boyfriend that has been parked there for 10 years. So I'm of course, increasingly, I mean, I'm just freaking out at this point. So she hangs up with her mom and then calls the the

Speaker 1:          08:36          paramedics and a half hour later, Christine arrived at the hospital. By the time I walked in, she had been there for five or 10 minutes at the most, and as soon as I walked in, the doctor greeted me and said, I said, uh, yeah, this is her doctor, Jonathan bellows. Christine. It's immediately evident. It's not a stroke, not an infection. That's, that's a huge relief. But I said, your mother has, has transient, Global Amnesia, fancy and global. Transient. Global. How did those words hit you? I'll be honest with you. I had no idea what that meant. I think the word I heard the most was amnesia. Oh, your mother has lost her ability to form new memories. She can't remember, but said it's not going to last forever. Um, it usually lasts between one and 24 hours and we're not sure what causes it. And it's at this point where the story goes from something kind of frightening to something a little more surreal.

Speaker 1:          09:31          Yes. So when I came in, um, her mother is sitting up in bed, she's a smiler and she immediately started asking, yes. Okay, so what's the date? I said, well, it's Tuesday, August 24th. Yes. And of course we have a video on youtube of this. My birthday's any pants. Yep. Do you remember how I remember that? I'm trying to remember the last date. I remember. I don't remember if never. Yeah, we hung out. You came over to my house and we watched a video that I made for you when I was in Texas and all of your sisters and some of your brothers said, happy birthday to you on the video. Yeah. But we still have the videos. You can watch it again, but you're going to remember eventually they say it's just temporary. Where it was, it was at home. You're at home yet. You're at home doing some gardening and you called me and you're feeling confused.

Speaker 1:          10:23          So I called the paramedics had been come and get you. And then we came here. You defend your tests on you. Okay, so what's the date? August 24th it's Tuesday. I'm trying to remember the last day I remember. Yeah, I don't remember my birthday. Do you remember your birthday? Yeah. Yeah. That must've just been recently. Yeah, a couple weeks ago. Now you might've missed it, but this conversation, they're having just started over August because every 90 seconds Mary Sue's memory resets. August 24th what's strange is the repetition, like we started that last clip. You heard with her saying this, trying to remember the last day. Damn, remember 90 seconds later after her memory resets, she says, try to remember the bias. A date. I remember 90 seconds later, I'm trying to remember the last day. Damn remember. And as you watched this video for a few minutes, you realize what's happening here. Is that Mary Sue Dan Week? It is, no, it's in a loop and it goes like this.

Speaker 1:          11:23          First, the date. What's the date? August 24th she then responds in almost the same way every time. Birthdays. Yes. She's missed her birthday. All right. Yep, Yep. And every time she says that, darn in exactly the same way. If you fast forward, it's already past my birthday though. Yeah. She must enjoy your birthday quite a bit. Eventually. Then she laughs, Hey, what happened? Then they recapped. You're working in the garden and you gave me a call. Christine explains the whole thing. It's usually when she says the word paramedic called the paramedics right there and have them come and pick you up. The Mary Sue's eyes get really wide in this look of sheer and utter disbelief. Yes. Yeah. Isn't that creepy? I mean, every single, and you say that. Isn't that creepy? Creepy. 90 seconds later is some creepy 90 seconds later and it's often at this point right after creepy that you was sets.

Speaker 1:          12:26          Okay, so I don't know. Tuesday, like somebody put it on rewind over and over and over again. Yes. Add repeated the birthday summit that the nurse apparently was behind me mouthing the words. Yeah. Oh, that's my birthday. Yeah. Girls like groundhog day in here, groundhog's Day, every two minutes we're doing a list. The same thing. Yes we do that. We have had the same conversation over and over again. Every two minutes for the last two and a half hours. Two and a half hours. No, they, we can't seem to talk about anything else. That is what we're talking about today.

Speaker 1:          13:09          What Day of the week is it? Tuesday, August 24th you didn't miss it. You were there. Yeah, I'm watching it. I wanted to slap me and you know I wanted to reach out and slap me and say damn it. I just told you that for the record I would never slept. My mom would not. No she would not. And here is a clear, this is a person who's lost her memory. Yeah. But why would her behavior from one cycle to the next be so precisely and consistently the same? I mean sometimes exactly the same. Yeah. Why? I think what it is is one of the things the nurses said is that when you have something like this, your true self comes out. Your true. The word true is interesting. So yeah. Is that what we're saying on the video? Is that your true person, your true self? Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:00          I mean that's my mom through and through right there. I mean, she's, what Christine means is not the repetition, but that her mom keeps asking so many questions. She's inquisitive. She just wants to know what's going on with, with all sorts, you know, across the board. I love problems. I love puzzles. Are you like a Sudoku fiend? You know, I am. I am. I hate to admit this, God, I play Escape Room Games on the Internet escape room. What are those? They're stupid little games where they have little hidden pixels that you find you're, you're stuck in a room and you have to get out. You've got to find the key to the door and there's all these little hidden places. Oh, this is the perfect, perfect metaphor then. Oh yeah. I was my own escape room. I'd be like, Hey, didn't get it Tuesday. There's a different way of seeing this. First of all, Jonathan blow that er doctor who's seen a bunch of these cases, he said, well, that puzzler instinct, that's not just Mary sue. What everybody does is struggle over and over again with where am I and when am I? It's just the brain in survival mode. And another thing that everybody does, and he's seen him about six of these patients so far, is it everybody, not just Mary sue, but everybody becomes a broken record right down to the, the phrasing of the sentences, which keeps them out a little bit.

Speaker 9:          15:21          It makes, you know, it makes the brain seem a little bit more like a machine. You know, you give the machine the exact same set of inputs every 90 seconds, give it the same doctor, the same hospital room, same beeping machines and see if the output ever varies. And it doesn't, it almost seems like the patient, uh, has no free well.

Speaker 1:          15:46          And so sometimes in the back of his head he thinks, God, if I had that condition and someone videotaped me, I would love to see, see my own tape. Why, you know, I think, uh, I want to see, could I somehow escape the loop? Huh? Or, or would I, would I had depth and depth with the rest of us? Now, thankfully, according to Jonathan, what normally happens in this condition is that as time goes on, that 92nd loop starts to slowly expand. So it's actually more like two minutes or three minutes. Eventually four minutes. Now it's five minutes. And for Mary Sue, after a few hours as her loop got longer and longer, her old memories started to creep back in. By that evening, she was remembering up until um, like that Sunday, few hours later, her memory began to extend into Monday morning. By the time we left the hospital, she remembered Monday night. And then finally, shall we begin? Okay. Tell me the beginning how this story starts beginning. Uh, I, it was odd. Christine actually called me Tuesday morning about 10 o'clock and just said, oh, what are you doing mom? And apparently 10 minutes later,

Speaker 2:          16:59          hour later,

Speaker 1:          17:08          hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Jad Abumrad man, we'll be right back.
