00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.330
Now I want to talk about two more ideas.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.260
Recall when I had the centers
[INAUDIBLE] a frog,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.170
I said let's focus on the verb formula.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.920
That was indeed correct, but
one can have frames for nouns as well.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.070
So one could have a frame for
Angela, or for lasagna, or for

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.970
Olive Garden, or for night.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.410
If one had a frame for Angela and
lasagna, and so on, in that case,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.380
one could, instead of saying Angela
here, point to a frame for Angela.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.520
Here is an illustration
that shows you that.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.880
We may have then
information about Angela,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.520
quite apart from the sentence about
Angela having lasagna with her dad.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.910
And that information might be pulled
together, with this frame for

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970
ate to the pointer.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.190
So that now this frame for ate is
connected with this frame for Angela.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.030
Similarly we may have some information
for the restaurant of Olive Garden.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.530
We may know for example, that
the Olive Garden is located in Atlanta,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.689
or that it has a particular price range.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.110
So, two ideas.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.040
First, not only frames for
words, but also for nouns, and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.690
second frames can get
connected with each other, so

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.638
that the filler of a slot in one frame,
can point to another frame.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:16.500
So Ashok [sp?] it sounds like this kind
of representation can be used to make

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260
even more advanced inferences.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.010
So if I have a frame for
Angela, my frame for

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.300
Angela might have a slot
that says food preferences.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.730
And under that food preference slot,
the filler might be Italian food.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.730
And then, when I see this
representation, based on that slot and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.450
that filler, I can then infer
that she's not only happy,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.020
she's very happy because she
had one of her favorite foods.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.310
&gt;&gt; That's a good point, David.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.590
So far we have been talking about
sentence level understanding.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.410
The sentence that Angela ate lasagna at
Olive Garden with her dad, for example.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.340
But we can also talk about this
cost level understanding, or

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.240
this cost may contain a series of
sentences, one after the other.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.580
So the first sentence, for instance,
may say something about Angela and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.010
her food preferences.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.490
And we may construct a frame for Angela.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.150
The second sentence may say something
about, a restaurant called Olive Garden,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.870
which is located in Atlanta.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.090
And we may construct a frame for
the Olive Garden.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.340
When the third sentence comes, and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.060
says that Angela had lasagna
with her dad at Olive Garden,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.100
we construct a frame, and then we
can hook up these various frames.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.260
And now we beginning to get
a disclosed level understanding.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.810
Not just a sentence level understanding.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.350
So indeed, just like a frame enables
us to understand some unit of language.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.720
For example, a sentence or a phrase.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.750
When we start hooking up these frames
together, we can start understanding

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.690
larger units of language, for example,
a group of sentences of discourse.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.500
As we go along, we will see these
frames also allow us to pull

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.960
information from the input sentences,
to put in the [INAUDIBLE] of this slot.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.110
So indeed, the ability to hook these
frames together, allows for a lot

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.830
of complex inferences and they will be
a major part of common sense reasoning,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.310
as we continue with this course.
