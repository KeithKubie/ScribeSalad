BRIAN DORSEY: Hello, everybody.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.240
My name is Brian.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.060
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I'm Laurence.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.310
BRIAN DORSEY: And we are
both from Developer Relations

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.115
on the Google Cloud
Platform, and we're

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.490
going to try an
experiment today.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.430
So tell us more about it.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.830
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, we'd like

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.550
to start just really having
a good, open conversation

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.970
with you developers, talk with
you about Google Cloud Platform

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.612
and about Cloud as a whole.

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.570
Obviously it's a little
too late for this video

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.010
to answer any of your questions.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.269
But for future videos,
if you've any questions,

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.810
just put them in
the comments section

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.665
down here, like under
the video window,

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.680
not on the floor of this studio.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.130
And we'd love to answer them.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.682
And if we can't answer them--
I mean, between Brian and I,

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:47.390
we should be able to
answer most of them.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.265
Mostly Brian answering, not me.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.640
BRIAN DORSEY: It's a given we
won't know all the answers,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.264
but--

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:54.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: If we don't,
we know the people that do,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.110
and we'd love to bring it out
there and answer them for you.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.650
BRIAN DORSEY: Fantastic.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.150
So, yeah.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.880
So, questions,
conversation topics,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.800
like things you'd like to
hear about Cloud platform,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.496
or anything goes.

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:07.120
Give us a shot.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.170
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Speaking of go?

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.878
BRIAN DORSEY: Go.

00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:10.600
Anything goes.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.980
So for today, I think we'll
try little, few questions here

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.380
between us, to get things going.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.222
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Totally unrehearsed.

00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:19.000
BRIAN DORSEY:
Completely unrehearsed.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.455
So you will see
flubs here and there.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:23.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: I think
we've seen a few already.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.510
BRIAN DORSEY: So, Laurence,
what is Cloud to you?

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.356
How would your
previous experiences

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.105
developing software
and designing software

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:35.830
have changed if you
had Cloud as an option.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: I guess I'm
quite experienced in designing

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.690
software, and developing
it a little bit.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.356
And experienced
probably to the length

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:44.730
that it made me
a little cynical.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.130
So forgive me if it
comes across as that,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.740
but I think Cloud for me is
like, it's one of those terms

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.980
that we, as an industry--
and I don't mean

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.850
any particular company, but
just we as an industry-- haven't

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.375
done a great job in the past of
really articulating what it is

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:01.750
and what it means.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.980
And I guess I could give
one example that-- it's

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.860
a funny little story
if you'll indulge me.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.210
I used to be an architect on
a financial services platform.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.237
And we built products
for Wall Street.

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:17.070
And we built products
for financial analysts

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.200
on Wall Street.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.500
And generally the way that
you'd build the product

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.059
is that an architect
would come in.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.850
The architect talks to
the business people,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.524
gathers the business
requirements,

00:02:25.524 --> 00:02:26.940
takes a look at
the infrastructure

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.010
that we have in place
and joins the dots.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.500
So for example,
it might be, we'd

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.940
build a product
that is providing

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.270
some financial analytics.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.730
And so we have a
feed of fundamentals.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.060
And we have a speed of data.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.100
And we have a feed of history.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.940
BRIAN DORSEY: At this point,
is it all lines and boxes?

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
all lines and boxes.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.000
Exactly.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.710
BRIAN DORSEY: Not software yet.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.168
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Not software yet.

00:02:46.168 --> 00:02:49.460
It's lines and boxes
and Visio diagrams.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.390
And cylinders.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.140
Don't forget the cylinders.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.630
BRIAN DORSEY: Cylinders

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.380
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Databases are cylinders.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.590
They're not boxes.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.390
So we'd draw all
these things up.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.920
And before we'd get
developers involved,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.260
we'd draw all this up.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.880
And then we'd generally have
a big fluffy cloud, right?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.330
So we have all our
lines and boxes

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.390
of our feeds and our databases,
and a big fluffy cloud.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.660
And then a PC connected to it, a
mobile device connecting to it,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.870
like a terminal connecting--

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.140
BRIAN DORSEY: So that's like the
internet and everything, or--

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.639
LAURENCE MORONEY: That was like
everything hidden behind it.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.002
And I'm sure if you open Visio,
or other drafting tools today,

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.210
there's always an icon for
a big fluffy cloud, right?

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.870
And that was the cloud.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.880
And I can remember,
for me the next step

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880
is, once I've designed
this and I've figured out

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.060
all these feeds and where
I'm getting all this data,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.810
I would bring the Ops people in.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.620
And I remember
specifically, the best Ops

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.910
guy I've ever worked with--
I can't remember his name.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.340
I remember it was
Scott something.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.298
It's not Scott Guthrie.

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:43.130
And I remember it
was Scott something.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.410
And I remember having
this conversation with him

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.090
and presenting the thing to him.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.589
And he looked
through, and I thought

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.400
I'd done a fabulous
job of pitching

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.000
my architecture to him.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.720
And his job would be
then to think about

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.660
how many servers do
we have running this?

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.170
How do we secure that?

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.830
How do we make sure the servers
are patched, managed, powered.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.580
Yadda yadda yadda.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.538
All this kind of stuff.

00:04:01.538 --> 00:04:04.640
And I remember doing this
fabulous presentation

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.300
that I'd prepared for
weeks, and giving it

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.830
to this guy to get him on board.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.740
And he said four words to me.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.650
And these are words that I can
share on video, don't worry.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.660
So what you think
the four words were?

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.663
BRIAN DORSEY: Um, "I love it?"

00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:21.990
No, that's three words.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: His four
words were, "There is no cloud."

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.620
BRIAN DORSEY: Wait.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.010
OK.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.376
This is 10 years ago?

00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:30.834
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, about that.

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:31.410
About that.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.840
BRIAN DORSEY: So where was
he coming from with that?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.650
LAURENCE MORONEY: Where
he was coming from--

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.290
and he was exactly
right-- was because,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.800
if you think about the
complexity of running

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.580
an application like this, OK?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.170
Security.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.105
And the manageability.

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:45.300
Like I say, virus scanning.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.295
Even the number of servers that
you need to run this thing.

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:49.920
We would actually do
a calculation that

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.810
would look at our
traffic and then would

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.018
say this one's going to be
a Java application running

00:04:54.018 --> 00:04:55.440
on a Weblogic app server.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.890
And we'd say, OK, we looked
at our traffic that we'd have.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.690
We'd looked at the
number of users.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.532
We'd figure out how
many-- based on the CPU,

00:05:02.532 --> 00:05:03.990
based on the network
connectivity--

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.170
BRIAN DORSEY: So he's thinking
just straight logistics.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.378
Like how do you get the
hardware you need to do that?

00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:10.270
What networking
infrastructure do need?

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.440
How do the switches work?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.350
Load balancing.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.800
How much storage do we need?

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.120
You can't just handwave
that away and draw--

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.140
LAURENCE MORONEY: Hide
it behind a fluffy cloud.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.014
BRIAN DORSEY: Gotcha.

00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:21.261
Well, how does that change now?

00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:23.260
That's not really what
we think of as Cloud now,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.110
but it kind of is.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: I think
that's the main thing.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.040
And that's the magic,
the perceived magic

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.595
that I as an architect would
do is draw a fluffy cloud

00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:32.970
and hide away all
the complexity.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.910
BRIAN DORSEY: It all just works?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.826
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
and it all just works.

00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:37.120
That is a reality now.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.670
It's no longer a
perceived magic.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.170
Right?

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.000
Because we work with the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.860
And I'm going to go
do my Superman thing,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.210
go-- You know, we work with
the Google Cloud Platform now.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.000
And so the nice
thing about that is

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.902
if we build applications that
run, for example on App Engine.

00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:54.360
And it was funny
that I was talking

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
about Java and Weblogic.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.380
And App Engine supports Java,
which makes me very happy.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.120
And then all of
those complexities

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.970
of scaling up when you
need it, and scaling down

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.989
when you don't need it, and
only paying for what you use.

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:09.530
BRIAN DORSEY: So
now that's all real.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.840
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's all real.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.030
Because in his-- to go
back to my friend who said,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.419
"There is no cloud," he would
look at the amount of traffic

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:16.960
that we need.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.650
We'll calculate the
number of servers

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.130
that we'd need for that.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.724
And then we had an algorithm
based on a bathtub curve type

00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:25.140
thing and-- what
do you call that?

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.950
A binary curve.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.300
And I think we calculated the
average number of servers,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.480
and we multiplied
that by 2 root 2.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.900
And that would give us the 95
percent estimate for traffic.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.080
And so we might need
10 servers for traffic,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.040
but would end up
with 28 servers.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.970
And for the times from
outside of nine to five,

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.290
those 28 servers are still
sitting there and not

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.390
being used.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.860
And average times, we're using
10, and 18 of them were unused.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.290
And for the sake
of peak time, we

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.570
might use 23, 24, 25 of them.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.900
But now with Cloud,
now we can talk

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.360
about that kind of fluffy
thing and all of that magic

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.220
is going on for us.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.160
BRIAN DORSEY: It really exists.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it
really, really exists.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.890
I'd love to have
Scott on a future show

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.610
and ask him, "Is
there a cloud now?"

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.390
BRIAN DORSEY: Let's find him.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.990
OK.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.820
So I had kind of a
related experience.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.890
I spent many years working on
a system for distributing files

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.210
around many locations
so that they were always

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.820
available from
all of these sites

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.380
that the organization worked at.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.517
And we were trying to
create the illusion

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.600
that all of these files
were available everywhere.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.030
And realistically,
you would keep

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.322
a hot set of files,
or recent things,

00:07:38.322 --> 00:07:40.030
or some subset of what
you could actually

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.410
afford to keep
there at some sites.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.090
And maybe other sites
would have everything.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.560
And you have too many
copies of everything,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.090
really because you
don't need them all.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: Asset
management's a difficult

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.430
problem.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.346
BRIAN DORSEY: Exactly.

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:53.760
And you look at things like
Google Cloud Storage, which

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.750
is blob storage
service in the Cloud.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.660
And it essentially is that
entire system that we built,

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.750
just ready to use.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: As a service.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.475
BRIAN DORSEY: As a service.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.860
The entire product doesn't even
need to be built in that way.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.007
So that would save a
huge amount of time.

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:18.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you
could have really focused

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.720
on building out the
user experience.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.350
BRIAN DORSEY: Exactly

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.110
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Instead of the plumbing

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.260
and the infrastructure.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.635
BRIAN DORSEY: And what we
wanted to build on top of that.

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:27.190
Because this was all just
a necessary foundation

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.934
to get to what we
were trying to do.

00:08:29.934 --> 00:08:32.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: There are
only so many hours in the day.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.220
And so if you're spending all
that time and all those cycles

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.289
building that planning,
think about the things

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.330
that you're not building.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:38.890
BRIAN DORSEY: Exactly.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.530
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And particularly

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.809
nowadays, I feel
folks have much more

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.860
of a demand for a rich
user experience than they

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.890
used to have.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.520
The things that were
acceptable 10 years ago

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.500
are completely
unacceptable today,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.650
because now you have
the luxury of being

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.570
able to hide behind
that big fluffy cloud

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.860
with its own storage.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.890
And now you can focus on
building a better user

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.820
experience and such
a thing like that.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.330
BRIAN DORSEY: Totally.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.454
LAURENCE MORONEY: So do
you have a feature of Cloud

00:09:02.454 --> 00:09:03.940
that kind of gets you excited?

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.990
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah!

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.884
There's a bunch of things,
like so many things about Cloud

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.050
that gets me really excited.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.200
I mean, the big picture,
like the whole Cloud

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.720
space is super
exciting right now.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.610
I think we've gotten to the
point where you can create

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.911
a model of the hardware
we used to have

00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:21.910
to run all these things.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.290
So you've got your servers,
and you've got your networks,

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.860
and switches, and
everything that you

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.090
used to have to go to a
data center and do by hand,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.090
there's an API for.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.060
And that is super useful,
incredibly exciting,

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.870
and allows a layer--
a level of automation

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.342
that just wasn't
possible before.

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.550
And there's peaks and slopes.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.300
But I don't think we're
done there, right?

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.240
This is the next
step of figuring out,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.750
OK now that these things
that used to be physical

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.680
are abstract concepts, are
they the right abstractions

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.380
we want for building
software in the future?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.925
And I think we can
do better, right?

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.300
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Oh, absolutely.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.550
BRIAN DORSEY: And so there's
things that are really exciting

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.050
right now.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.550
So App Engine's really
interesting in that space.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.974
I think Docker is
super exciting.

00:10:00.974 --> 00:10:02.640
There's a bunch of
stuff going on there.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.810
So Cloud as a whole,
super exciting.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.910
I think in Compute
Engine terms, we've

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.060
got a load balancer
that's basically

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.080
Google's datacenter-level
load balancing

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.960
available as a feature
for you to use.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.710
We've got Block Storage,
where it's super consistent,

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.790
and that's like its primary
design goal is consistency.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.260
Great for running databases
on, things like that.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.990
But I think if I
wanted to just--

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: Pick one.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:27.970
BRIAN DORSEY: Pick one?

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: Pick one.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.220
BRIAN DORSEY: I'm
actually going to pick--

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: I put
a gopher to your head

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.630
and ask you to pick one.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.140
BRIAN DORSEY: Only one.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.670
OK.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.590
I think I would have to pick
Notifications in Cloud Storage.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.120
Cloud Storage is this
blobstore in the sky.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.590
You can push files to it,
and you can get them back

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.800
from anywhere in the world.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.930
And it has, essentially,
subscription notifications.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.470
You can say, at
this HTTP endpoint,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.790
that's my application.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.290
I want you to send the metadata
for every single change that

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.344
happens to this bucket.

00:10:54.344 --> 00:10:55.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.820
BRIAN DORSEY: So you
can build workflow.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.400
And you can build
deep integration

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.904
between Cloud Storage
and any application,

00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:03.820
whether that's running
on Google Cloud or not.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.080
So going back to
your video scenario.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.460
So if you're
building a video app

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.870
and you've got people all over
the world shooting footage

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.460
for a movie or
something like that,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.890
and then somebody
puts some new footage,

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.310
everybody's going
to be notified.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.160
BRIAN DORSEY: So you can get
notifications to tell people

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.540
about it.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.289
You could kick off a
transcoding process.

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:21.580
You can just deeply integrate
it within your whole app.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:22.340
Cool.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.170
BRIAN DORSEY: Anything
you need to do.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
there's an API for that?

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.960
BRIAN DORSEY: There's
an API for that.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.100
There's an API for everything.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: They used to
say, "There's an app for that."

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.740
Now we say, "There's
an API for that."

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.070
BRIAN DORSEY: There's
an API for that.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.620
So if you had to pick
one, what's your--

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.661
LAURENCE MORONEY: If I
put the gopher to my head?

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:36.170
Oh, there's so many.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.830
I think one, for
me, that actually--

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.706
the very first thing.

00:11:38.706 --> 00:11:40.454
You know what they say
about first love is

00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:41.340
the one you remember.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.280
So the first love for
me with the Google Cloud

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.770
was actually Java.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.500
BRIAN DORSEY: OK

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
I know it's a surprise.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.620
BRIAN DORSEY: Coming from
Python background, I'm like--

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: Over
in Python background.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.933
I've got some great stuff to
say about Python, but maybe

00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:52.990
for a future video.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.440
But I think it's because I
came from a Java background.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.220
And I worked for
Microsoft for many years

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.520
and moved more into
the ASP.NET background.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.680
But really, one of the
things that disappointed me

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.380
about Java years ago
was how hard it was,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.230
and how expensive it was, for
you to put Java stuff publicly.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.920
BRIAN DORSEY: Oh, right.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.280
Like if you had an App
Server, like for a J2EE thing,

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.360
those things cost in the
10s of thousands of dollars.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:16.860
And--

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.175
BRIAN DORSEY: So compared
to your PHP app, or--

00:12:19.175 --> 00:12:20.800
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Python app, you know,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.920
where you can $2 a month, for a
server, and that kind of thing.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.910
And it was like, I'd
really like to be

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.480
able to showcase some Java work.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.292
But I couldn't!

00:12:28.292 --> 00:12:29.610
OK?

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.230
Short of putting an app
server, like a Tomcat,

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.180
or something that, on a
machine under my desk,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.790
and opening port
80 on my router--

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.635
BRIAN DORSEY: So you're
a good Java programmer

00:12:36.635 --> 00:12:38.426
and you've made some
awesome thing in Java,

00:12:38.426 --> 00:12:39.720
and you want to show it off.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.370
What do you do?

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm
applying for a job.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.250
It's a Java job.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.370
And I want to show
some Java stuff.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.300
Can't do it.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.627
But then, what comes
along, but App Engine?

00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:49.210
And I know I'm holding
the gopher now,

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.876
so he'd probably feel
a bit disappointed

00:12:50.876 --> 00:12:53.330
I'm talking about a
different language.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.100
And App Engine.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.480
And now I can use Eclipse.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.720
And I can put a simple
plug-in into Eclipse,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.394
and I can start
writing code in Java.

00:13:00.394 --> 00:13:01.810
And I can deploy
it to App Engine.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.800
And I'm not even
paying a monthly fee.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.132
I'm paying based on usage.

00:13:05.132 --> 00:13:05.840
BRIAN DORSEY: OK.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.830
So this is a case where it
scales down really well,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.920
in addition to scaling up.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.560
And actually, I haven't been
working at Google that long.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.070
And as part of my
interview process,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.030
I've had this algorithm that
I've been working on for years,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.940
where it's like I do predictive
analysis of the stock market.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.320
So take a look at the
history of a stock price,

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.010
and then take a guess from
there what it's going be at.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.740
And I thought, OK, here's
a great example for me to--

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.490
and I had originally
written this in Java.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.260
And I moved it to C Sharp.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.920
And I dusted off my old
Java and put into AppSpot.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.970
AppSpot is where you
host AppEngine apps.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.740
And so for my actual interview,
my first interview here

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.039
at Google, I showed them.

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:44.580
And it was on that particular
day, it was really interesting.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.455
Because it was predicting
that Google would spike,

00:13:46.455 --> 00:13:47.246
and it would go up.

00:13:47.246 --> 00:13:50.057
And I told my interviewers,
because you're talking to me.

00:13:50.057 --> 00:13:51.390
BRIAN DORSEY: How'd it turn out?

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:51.670
Did it--

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.034
LAURENCE MORONEY: They hired me.

00:13:53.034 --> 00:13:54.250
BRIAN DORSEY: OK.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:54.790
Good to go.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.530
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Well, we saw that we

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.550
went over $1,000 soon
afterwards, right?

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.952
So.

00:13:58.952 --> 00:13:59.660
BRIAN DORSEY: OK.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.470
So.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.360
Fantastic.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.310
Thank you very much
for this time together.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
thank you, viewers.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.720
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.511
Thanks for watching
all the way to the end.

00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:10.850
So are you interested in
seeing more stuff like this?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.820
Yes or no.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.530
Like, other topics
you'd like to hear.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.500
Hit up the comments and we'll
be in touch and do more.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.320
Talk to you soon.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank you.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.900
BRIAN DORSEY: Bye.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: All righty.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.010
BRIAN DORSEY: OKey-doke.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: So we're
recording now, right?

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.052
BRIAN DORSEY: We are
absolutely recording now.

00:14:35.052 --> 00:14:36.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:36.925
BRIAN DORSEY:
Out-takes have begun.

00:14:36.925 --> 00:14:38.258
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes they have.

00:14:38.258 --> 00:14:40.356
We haven't even begun
the in-takes yet.

00:14:40.356 --> 00:14:41.730
BRIAN DORSEY:
Respect The gopher.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.127
No--

00:14:42.127 --> 00:14:42.921
LAURENCE MORONEY: We have
to respect the gopher.

00:14:42.921 --> 00:14:43.320
That's true.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.750
BRIAN DORSEY: No
throwing the gopher.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.510
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Maybe we could even

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.600
defer to him for some questions.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.770
BRIAN DORSEY: If I get stuck,
you know who to talk to.
