manual translation or human translation

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389
manual translation or human translation
 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.539
manual translation or human translation
will create an automated translation

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549
will create an automated translation
 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.429
will create an automated translation
using google translate behind the scenes

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439
using google translate behind the scenes
 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.219
using google translate behind the scenes
and then users who are encountering your

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229
and then users who are encountering your
 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.449
and then users who are encountering your
store listing if it's not in their

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459
store listing if it's not in their
 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.460
store listing if it's not in their
native language once you've saved in the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470
native language once you've saved in the
 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.689
native language once you've saved in the
new developer console they'll actually

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699
new developer console they'll actually
 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.699
new developer console they'll actually
see a button allowing them to view an

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709
see a button allowing them to view an
 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.770
see a button allowing them to view an
automated translation so just to be

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780
automated translation so just to be
 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.390
automated translation so just to be
clear you know the automated

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400
clear you know the automated
 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.649
clear you know the automated
translations are generated by google

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659
translations are generated by google
 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.330
translations are generated by google
translate and so they're obviously not

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340
translate and so they're obviously not
 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.680
translate and so they're obviously not
going to be as good as having a native

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690

recently added Ricardo maybe you can say

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:40.720
recently added Ricardo maybe you can say
 

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.589
recently added Ricardo maybe you can say
a bit more about that yeah we use it to

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599
a bit more about that yeah we use it to
 

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.720

example you could see by I don't know
 

00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:40.800
example you could see by I don't know
how the rating is / device and you can

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:40.810
how the rating is / device and you can
 

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.379
how the rating is / device and you can
see maybe that some devices get a user's

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:43.389
see maybe that some devices get a user's
 

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:44.910
see maybe that some devices get a user's
from the given devices give you a lower

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920
from the given devices give you a lower
 

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.249
from the given devices give you a lower
rating than other users and maybe this

00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:47.259
rating than other users and maybe this
 

00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:49.199
rating than other users and maybe this
is indicative that you have not optimize

00:09:49.199 --> 00:09:49.209
is indicative that you have not optimize
 

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:50.790
is indicative that you have not optimize
your application for a given device

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800
your application for a given device
 

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.430
your application for a given device
maybe it uses different screen size and

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440
maybe it uses different screen size and
 

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.689
maybe it uses different screen size and
you have not really optimized for that

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:54.699
you have not really optimized for that
 

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:57.480
you have not really optimized for that
so they divert the user experiences less

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.490
so they divert the user experiences less
 

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.230
so they divert the user experiences less
optimal by language as well maybe you

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240
optimal by language as well maybe you
 

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.329

have now optimize your application for a

00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:03.339

rated poorly and another interesting one
 

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.139
rated poorly and another interesting one
is by application version because you

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:10.149
is by application version because you
 

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.050
is by application version because you
can see by rolling out a new version

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060
can see by rolling out a new version
 

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.120
can see by rolling out a new version
whether you know people like it more or

whether you know people like it more or
 

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.460
whether you know people like it more or
not and maybe your old new version is

the cumulative average rating over time
is provides out to abroad metric because

previous months previous years then you
 

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.699
previous months previous years then you
can switch to the daily average rating

00:10:38.699 --> 00:10:38.709
can switch to the daily average rating
 

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:40.470

would be useful especially for people
 

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.210
would be useful especially for people
who don't have a lot of infrastructure

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:03.220
who don't have a lot of infrastructure
 

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.670
who don't have a lot of infrastructure
and so this would be like something even

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:05.680
and so this would be like something even
 

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.900
and so this would be like something even
simpler than integrating google

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:06.910
simpler than integrating google
 

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.070
simpler than integrating google

like so just my personal take on that

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:16.900
like so just my personal take on that
 

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.290
like so just my personal take on that
like I usually try to avoid adding

trolls very strong reason for doing that
 

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.820
trolls very strong reason for doing that
like if I can have just a simple way to

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:26.830
like if I can have just a simple way to
 

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.130
like if I can have just a simple way to
track where people are finding the app

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:29.140
track where people are finding the app
 

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.170
track where people are finding the app
and installing it that's fine because

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:31.180

connection costs involved for for users
 

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.000
connection costs involved for for users
so if I can avoid that I prefer to not

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.010
so if I can avoid that I prefer to not
 

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.500
so if I can avoid that I prefer to not
add that so okay so

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:45.510
add that so okay so
 

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.200
add that so okay so
it's just a maybe a simple mechanism to

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.210
it's just a maybe a simple mechanism to
 

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.810
it's just a maybe a simple mechanism to
track where the install came from like

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820
track where the install came from like
 

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.350

and if you want to go further and adding

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360
and if you want to go further and adding
 

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.450
and if you want to go further and adding
your own infrastructure for server-side

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460
your own infrastructure for server-side
 

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.550
your own infrastructure for server-side
or even Google Analytics that's that's

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:58.560
or even Google Analytics that's that's
 

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.580
or even Google Analytics that's that's
another step yeah it's good at it for

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:01.590
another step yeah it's good at it for
