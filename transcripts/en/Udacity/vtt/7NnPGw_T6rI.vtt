00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.200
Now let's discuss botnet command and
control.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.540
This is the most important
aspect of botnets.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.100
Recall that the definition of botnet
is that a botnet is a network of

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.630
compromised computers that the botmaster
uses for malicious purposes.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.560
Here, by botmaster,
we mean the attacker behind the botnet.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.830
Because the botmaster needs to
make use of the network of bots,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.800
he needs to communicate with the bots.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.280
In other words, there needs to
be command control, or C&amp;C for

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.890
short, from the botmaster to the bots.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.130
For example the bot should report to
the botmaster its current status and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.260
the bot may be directed by the botmaster
to another site to download

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380
the latest malware version.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.175
And the bot may receive instructions for
spamming, phishing and DDoS, and

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:49.075
so on, from the botmaster.

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:54.150
In short, we can see that without C&amp;C,
a botnet is not a network, but

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.175
just a collection of
isolated infected machines.

00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:01.055
And as a result, the botmaster
cannot utilize the aggregate

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.565
competition of power of
all the bots available.
