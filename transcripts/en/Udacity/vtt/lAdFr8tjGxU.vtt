IBGP is responsible for disseminating routes inside NAS about

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.370
destination IP prefixes that are located outside that AS. The

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.510
iBGP next hop is typically a next hop IP address that is

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.600
reachable via the AS's intradomain routing protocol, or IGP.
