00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.550
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What does organic mean anymore?

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.820
Tales from the front lines of the movement
and just to give you a little bit of background

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.660
on who Bob Scowcroft is is basically he's
an activist.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.390
He first joined the environmental movement
to work on the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.249
Act in the early 1970s and later became a
national organizer on pesticide issues for

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.170
the Friends of the Earth.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.470
As organizer for the FOE, he set up table
at the Natural Food's Agent Orange because

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.149
of the drift of that herbicide on nearby farms.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.309
And basically from there, um, Barney Brickman
and 2 other organizers from the California

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.090
certified organic farmers came and paid him
a visit to his table and introduced Scowcroft

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.489
to the organi, organic farming movement and
since then he became the first professional

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.510
environmentalist to attend and present at
the ecological farming conference.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.460
Then held at a muddy church camp in the Santa
Cruz Mountains.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.000
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Hi everyone, I'm Liv and I'm
a chef.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.110
And I'm just delighted to have my friend Bob
here.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.230
I met him at the EcoFarmConference.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.820
So, 15 years after I interviewed him as a
reporter when I was in Chicago, so thank you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.820
for coming.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.820
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: You're welcome.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.830
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Bob is quite a story teller
and raconteur so I'm, we're just gonna be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.950
pretend it's not summer and it's winter.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.780
We've got our feet pulled up to the fire and
I'm just gonna ask a few questions and I think

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.780
he'll just go.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.579
So, that was a long time ago.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.350
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Yes, that video was shot
it 1989.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.700
He noted that organic was about 1 percent
of the food economy.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:59.799
We are 23 years later and thousands of articles
and reporters and chefs, organic's now 4 percent

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.289
of the economy.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.610
When I joined CCOF I was the first full time
employee and director, there were 178 farmers

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.229
in the program.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.180
When I left there were 780 farmers in the
program.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.740
During the 5 years that I was at CCOF, actually
I'm just gonna step back and say, to give

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.560
you a sense of the history of organic, it
started to be written about in the 20s and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.890
30s, both in Japan and in the UK.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.760
Rodale really brought it to the US in 1947,
first publication of Organic Gardening.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.080
But, Mokichi Okada in Japan and Sir Albert
Howard and Lady Balfour, Lady Balfour is the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.190
key, you know, royalty is what it is; she
was interested about the soils so she started

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.739
a soil association in the 20s over there in
the UK.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.500
So this, to this day we hear that it's a fad.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Well, we're getting on almost 100 years, 80-90
years; I think the fad part a really mute

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.790
point now.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.370
But the first regulation was written in Oregon
in 1974.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.620
The first law, actual law, was in California
in 1978; it was a 2 page law and Ag so disliked

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.299
the word organic that the only way they could
get it passed was to make into the health

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.629
and nutrition program.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:18.980
I'm not sure if you knew that.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.170
And California health and safety code was
where the first organic food act was parked

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.150
and it had no enforcement, it was 2 pages
long but it did define the simplistic no synthetic

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.930
devotion to natural crop rotation; the very
basics of what organic had started out.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.220
So by '89 with Alar, which was, to this day
they call it the Alar scare.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.019
I very strongly point out it was not a scare,
it was carcinogenic and it was taken off the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.930
market 6 months after CBS' 60 Minutes did
the story on it.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.760
But it took Meryl Streep to bring attention
to it.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.079
Environmentalists had been working on it for
a decade but it was Meryl Streep in the, on

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.829
a couple of TV talk shows, the power of talk
shows, that brought it to attention.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:18.080
So, CCOF rewrote the California law for enforcement
and then a year later, thanks to Senator Leahy,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.260
7 people got together and said we've written
the California law, we have friends in Oregon,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.940
we have friends in New England, a couple in
Ohio, let's write a national law.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.740
Little did we know what we were getting into.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.130
But, for the power of individual and the power
of very small group, I think this is a particularly

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.290
critical story to tell.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.910
That to this day, 7 to 10 people dedicated
and with a vision can get together and can

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.390
make global change.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.520
Never forget that.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.620
It's happened here.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.140
It happens in a lot of places.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.500
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: So that was 1 percent of the
market.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.570
We're now at 4 percent?

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.710
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Little over 4, 4.2, 4.3

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.390
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: So I'm gonna ask the question
from the other side.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.390
Why so slow?

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.460
Why so, what's, what have been the impediments?

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:15.360
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Um, uh, absolute to this
day, resistance from the agro industrial food

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.530
system and it's an integrated system, crop
insurance; you can't get organic crop insurance

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.900
to organic research; you can't get that to
scale.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.000
Now there's 4 supermarkets and 3 box stores
that represent something like 70, 7 buyers

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.491
in United States purchase between 70 and 80
percent of all our food.

00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:38.491
7 buyers.

00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:39.940
&gt;&gt;male #1: All food or organic?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.300
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: All food total comes through
7 buyers.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.690
Now, it's like, in California there are 2,200
organic farms, 2 of them, and I said earlier

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.840
in a meeting I'm gonna try not to use brand
names, but 2 of them gross a billion dollars.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.030
And they sell into those 7.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:08.590
So economies of scale, very difficult for
organic to integrate into, um, research, organic

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.500
pest management.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.200
The system of Ag research is really product
based.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.090
Actually, there was a law, this is a kind
of funny, well, depends on your Ag sense of

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.540
humor, Birch Bayh and Bob Dole wrote a law
in the 80s called the" Bayh Dole Act"

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.090
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: It's not, everyone's gonna

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:37.090
have pineapples but the "Bayh Dole Act" reformatted
the entire research system to be product based.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.530
That you could be a company and give money
into an Ag research program and dedicate a

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:50.130
research question you have and you could profit,
i.e. patent, off that product that came out

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.540
with academia.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.040
So, organic is information based.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.150
You can't really patent information.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.990
You can't, it's public domain activity.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:05.020
So, finding out when to release the ladybugs
or when to apply, when to harvest a cover

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.550
crop, which cover crop works with which soil?

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:15.270
That was a historic Ag research program from
our land grant system, from the late 1890s

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.380
to the 1940s, that's what land grants did.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:26.070
And then in, after the agricultural chemicals
became very popular in the '70s, by the '80s

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.420
the system, we wanted to cut funding for Government
waste and to Ag, we were wasting Government

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.710
money to get information.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:39.070
So, instead, we wanted, by this act, to privatize
our Ag research system.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.440
So imagine how you're gonna get an organic
crop rotation system in place.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.990
I'd say that's very expensive, that's been
one of the main challenges is breaking that,

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:56.210
and the other part is also economy of scale,
competitive price organic can be is very expensive

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.620
in many parts of the country, you can't get
it year round in many parts of the country.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.710
So the first person with berries or some of
the other fruits and vegetables sell it for

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.860
a lot of money.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:13.310
That's something called the capitalist system
where they make a very healthy profit.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.560
And, somehow, this is supposed to be, this
is supposed to be a negative to organic.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.320
Well, it's, uh, buyer and seller working it
out.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.500
Now, things have changed a little bit.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.450
After CCOF, 2 farmers and I decided, talk
about tilting against windmills, we decided

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.260
that we were gonna change the grant making
program so we founded the Organic Farming

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:44.710
Research Foundation so that we could make
grants but our grants were based on, uh, agreeing,

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:50.121
upon receipt of money to not patent any information
that it was all, 100 percent, in the public

00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:57.400
domain and that we would fund ideas as well
as actual projects.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:03.060
And OFRF, I retired a year and a half ago,
I was the executive director for 20 years,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:10.500
the average lifespan of a, professional lifespan
of an E.D. is 3 to 5 years.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:18.470
So I was there 20 years and we made over 350
grants and many of those recipients are now

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.840
professors and are now, finally, over 20 universities
have organic research programs.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.460
So, look how long it took us to get there.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.360
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: What was the most difficult
part about getting the federal law written?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:40.950
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Um, well, it's the opposition
of the agricultural industry; some of you

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.750
may have a little bit of awareness that the
Farm Bill is front and center this summer.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.020
It's a really big deal.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:53.310
Well, in 1990 was an earlier Farm Bill, the
House Agriculture Committee refused to hold

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.770
any hearings on organic.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.790
I was actually in a meeting in the mid '80s
in the USDA that a senior agency official

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.680
came in and broke up the meeting 'cause a
communist sympathizer was there; that was

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680
me.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Supporting organic family

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.660
farmers and I had to leave the building.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.640
That's the intensity of the passion at that
period of time.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:22.850
But, 1990, 5 years later, the House Ag Committee
refused to hold hearings so we actually had

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:28.440
one congressman from Oregon, two actually
with Sam Farr, but really, Peter Defazio carried

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:35.250
the bill on the floor of the house, no hearings,
no public testimony, no public comment.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.000
Senator Cranston and Senator Leahy carried
it in the Senate.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.600
One hearing, one time and on the house it
was voted 198 to 189 and we won the amendment

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.260
on the floor of the House.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.761
And we just pushed every grass roots button
we had and the law was 16 pages long and it

00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:57.410
required a National Organic Standards Board
which was the only advisory board that had

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.860
the right to stop a bad action and to recommend
a good action.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.920
There are 29 advisory boards in the USDA,
only one has statutory power and that's the

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.040
National Organic Standards Board.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.090
The administration at the time, and I have
to say including into the Clinton administration,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.520
never empowered the actual drafting of the
regulations.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.990
They were due 18 months after the passage
of the law; we got it 10 years.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.690
It took them 10 years to post the rules and
they were terrible.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.290
They suggested you could use genetic engineering;
you could put sewage sludge on organic farms

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:38.190
as long as –, a number of pasture regulations
were terrible.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.060
They made a mistake, and actually this is
kind of a cool little computer story, it was

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:48.190
the first rule ever published on the internet,
it was the USDA decided, they had this little

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.580
corner thing, organic, no big deal and they
would publish it on the internet and ask for

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:58.580
public testimony, the largest testimony they'd
ever received was animal welfare issues around

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:04.570
production of veal which is a pretty lousy
way to, well we'll leave that for another

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.340
topic, but that had gotten 35,000 letters.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.620
So they published the organic rules thinking
they'd get maybe a couple of thousand, we

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.810
generated 325,000 responses.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.440
Working assets, now called CREDO Phone Company,
the largest single, it donated, it generated

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.660
35,000 comments through their phone subscriber
base, into the rules.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.200
That was such a tsunami, ten times the comments
they'd ever received, that they had to rewrite

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:39.680
the rules and then the press, I think we we're
probably in contact, Liv and I and many others,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:46.190
the press really caught wind of this major
embarrassment and made major organic hay about

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.050
it and they went back and had to rewrite them
again.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:59.290
And, finally, in 2002, 580 pages of every
single thing you can and can't do around organic

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.020
was published and approved with two exceptions.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.480
One was pasture, they didn't quite know how
to figure out what organic pasture and organic

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.490
meat and dairy was and is.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:16.150
They just published the final rule there in
2010, 20 years later, and the other was the

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.000
interface between recombinant DNA, genetically
engineered products and organic.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.400
All they said was you can't use it and we
felt there was a lot of protocol behind pollution

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.930
from that and some other issues.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.610
So, those of you that wanna get into organic,
you gotta start when you're 20 or 30 cause

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:39.330
you're gonna take it from 4 percent to 50
percent you gotta be young, I think, well

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.730
maybe I'll be on a roll for a couple more
years.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.260
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Really?

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.630
Can we reach 50 percent?

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.350
That would be astonishing.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:57.870
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: You know, I think the infrastructure
as immature as it is, has the capacity to

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:05.230
do that understanding that organic transition
requires, one of the key threads is 3 years

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.920
from the last application of a prohibited
material.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.680
So, if something happened and we had to go
organic, I believe essentially the body of

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.960
knowledge is there in almost every crop and
commodity to farm it organically but the land

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960
isn't.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.750
And we don't want sod busted or marginal land
or wets lands taken out and farmed organically.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:32.160
We want the deep soil of the heartland farmed
that way but it's gonna take years, so I have

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:42.910
a fear, it's been my experience that organic
in many cases has grown due to sensational

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:49.730
pesticide stories for the most part, horrific
poisonings, drift, discovery or final proof

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.420
of carcinogenic chemicals and people throw
up their hands, "That's it, I'm gonna buy

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.420
organic.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.420
I don't care."

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:00.660
So if we have some other more food safety,
food issue, stories coming down the pike the

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.960
push for organic with that same peaks and
valleys that we had during Alar where apples

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.690
went for 70 dollars a box that were 6 or 8
dollars a box, the size of that package before.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:20.660
I will say, going a little bit out on a limb
here, my sense is that relative to food issues

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:26.050
and the things that I follow, that some of
the next frightening data that's just starting

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.029
to be peer reviewed, when I say frightening
it's not somebody standing up on a screen

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:35.640
and ruining a dinner party or in a public
speech, I'm talking about peer review science

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:43.560
coming out of Academia, the abuse of antibiotics
and chemicals in our meat production should

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.360
gray the hair on the back of everyone's head.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.460
And the stories are just beginning to come
out.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:59.680
Just recently, uh, and I can provide the link
later on if you wish, urine tract infections,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.810
there's dinner party topic for ya
[Laughter]

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:08.370
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: had been tied to a certain
antibiotic overused in poultry production.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:13.330
They know this, medical schools have now proven
this and, yet, can we get that antibiotic

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.330
out of poultry?

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:20.140
They don't even, they want more research,
let's take, you know, the data's not really

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.140
in yet.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.340
You know science; we need more studies in
the future.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.520
Far as I'm concerned that data's in and what
I've read about some of the chemicals, antibiotics

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:35.460
in hog production, I only eat, I mean, I know
the meat I eat almost personally, not the

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.460
chicken itself
[Laughter]

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.620
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: but the producer that made
it.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:46.140
How do we transition, I guess is the, to get
the 50 percent, you need a government objective,

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:51.800
you need a massive investment in research
and, of course, you need the consumer that's

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.610
gonna be paying those higher prices, in some
cases, some seasons, to support it.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:04.079
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: We're close to 50 percent with
the Google culinary purchasing team with organic

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.079
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Awesome, awesome.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:11.690
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: we're not quite there but,
and our meats and poultry are antibiotic and

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:19.610
steroid free and, but what's the positive
argument about organics?

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:27.050
Yes we want to avoid this and this but in
our culture where we're concerned about nutrition

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:35.360
and optimizing your life and things like that,
is there a benefit to eating organic that

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.590
is, say, something about nutrient density?

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:44.250
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: That's the, uh, that's the
Pandora's Box and I'm happy to open it.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.380
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Go ahead.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.380
[Laughter]

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.870
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: But I'm gonna ask you to
hold it for just about 60 seconds until, I

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.600
came to organic really trying to ban agent
orange and my concerns about pesticides and

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.600
herbicides.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.910
People come to organic for different reasons,
have different paths to, uh, eventually say,

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.350
"You know, I wanna be positive, I wanna be
solutions based."

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:09.370
Organic is a solution that we should all support.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:14.800
Moving the needle, to this day, is still antibiotics
and chemicals and pesticides.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:22.100
The question that arises ever more frequently
that I wanna now address is, is it more nutritious?

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.750
And it's a very difficult question to address.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:34.000
I was very lucky in my run, I got to know,
uh, Mothers and Others for Livable Planet

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.450
which Wendy Gordon and Meryl Streep founded,
got to know them.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.679
At that time, both, for about a year pretty
well and Wendy Gordon decided she wanted to

00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:45.300
say that organic was more nutritious, I said,
"Wait a minute."

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:53.190
So she got a new professor on staff in the
early '90s, a woman named Doctor Marion Nestle.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:58.690
Who is now quite well known in her books and
I would encourage you to log in or get on

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.429
her blog, she's a brilliant writer, and says
that, in a matter that someone like me who's

00:19:03.429 --> 00:19:06.670
not a scientist, can understand.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.830
And also a woman named Joan Gussow.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.050
So we had several years of meetings in New
York whenever I would come through about addressing

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.880
the question of is organic more nutritious?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:25.510
And the variables seem almost insurmountable
upon, to accumulate those in a manner that

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.840
you can say yes or no, and let me just throw
a few out for you to think about.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.160
First of all, America has something called
the standard diet and in a way that's linked

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.290
to how much pesticides you can have as residues
on certain-- []. It used to be based on a

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:47.000
180 pound male which became a real issue when
Doctor Philip Landrigan wrote a book called

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
"Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children"
where he came out of his work saying, "Kids

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.740
ate applesauce, squash, bananas and you're
saying men eat 6 bananas a year.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.860
Children eat the same amount as men every
week.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:08.650
This should be, the standard diet should be
based on pesticides that kids get, they're

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.650
the most vulnerable."

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.540
Then he went on to speculate about, "Well,
what micronutrients are we getting?

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.700
Are they getting enough?

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:20.059
How do we manage that when our kids are newborns
and starting out with just four or five, when

00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:24.610
they move from mother's milk or formula and
start getting foods."

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:29.910
And I don't believe, I've been on some panels
with him in the past and I don't believe he

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:37.560
ever was able to come to an academic understanding
of how you would measure those kinds of nutrients.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.070
So the standard diet is an issue, pesticide
background contamination is an issue, of course

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:48.260
the soil it's grown in is an issue, the way
the seeds have been bred.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:56.290
At lunch we talked just a little bit, our
brilliant academic community has, um, not,

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.250
through classic breeding practices, actually,
very little recombinant DNA, although they've

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:07.240
begun to embrace that as well, have bred our
seeds for our products now for ease of harvest,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.890
uh, mechanical tornado harvesting.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.600
That, the tomato has to be, all of them in
a thousand acres, has to be about the right

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.309
size with thicker skin so the machine can
pick it.

00:21:18.309 --> 00:21:23.950
Actually in the last few days they discovered
that in the process of growing these tomatoes,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:28.549
they also need to look a certain color cause
we tend to buy really orange ones so they

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:33.440
bred in color, and they also need to take
up more water because we all buy everything

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.750
by the pound.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:40.140
So we're actually buying the water that we
subsidize to irrigate it back and, uh, broccoli

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.230
or tomato that's taken up a little bit more
water.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:48.490
Brilliant marketing, academic, Bayh Dole act,
companies want this.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.971
Now you come along and they discovered that
the, uh, in breeding it, literally in the

00:21:52.971 --> 00:21:57.700
last few days the sciences have come out that
they discovered that in this quest for the

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.070
harvested tomato, they had lost the gene for
taste.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.820
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: And that they had just, heck,

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.930
where is it?

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:11.730
And they had just discovered where it was
and now they're gonna breed that gene into

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.590
the tomato for taste as well.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.670
I started yelling at the computer screen when
I read that story.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:21.530
It's like, just go out and get heirloom tomatoes,
brothers and sisters, what are you doing trying

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:27.690
to get another silver bullet to shoot another
gene into an agro industrial system that is

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.100
largely energy based.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.100
We can't ship those tomatoes around the world
that much longer or import them that much

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.120
longer with spikes on energy.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:46.570
So I think it's a bit meandering here but
soil fertility, biological activity in the

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:52.740
soil breaks down the micronutrients slower
that heirloom seeds pick up faster.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.500
Then it has to be harvested for immediate
deliveries cause we all know that starts to

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.410
break down once it's been harvested.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.460
Can organic do that?

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.100
Yes, it's clearly doing it.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.980
There are a number of studies out there doing
that but they're citrus specific or, uh, heirloom

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:14.670
variety tomato specific in New England in
the summer or strawberry specific.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:20.309
Thus, on a podium, I can't yet, in all honesty,
say that organic is more nutritious.

00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:27.880
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: But, as soon as I hear you
say, "They're breeding the plants to do, for

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:39.020
more water uptake," I'm hearing nutrient,
uh, nutrient scarcity, the density is now

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.320
diluted, nutrient dilution.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.920
Is that, that must be true.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.990
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Um, certainly in the soils,
you know, as the soils break down as it's

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:54.520
all about breeding something will take up
N, nitrogen N, faster and more efficiently.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.470
You have a route that's looking for that fertilizer.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:02.799
Sorry to put a personality on it but it's
just not gonna take time to break down the

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:09.330
nodule on a cover crop that's left that little
piece nitrogen node on its root to break down

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.520
over the winter.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.540
It's not gonna look for it.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:17.350
It's gonna go right to where the N is in concentration,
that's the fertilizer we put down a couple

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.350
weeks ago.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:23.160
I brought with me and sent over to you which
you can make available.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:35.800
I did look up, uh, what is it, yeah, here's
the June 29th issue of the journal Science,

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.430
um, talked about finding the gene that makes
tomato taste better.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:46.420
So being published in Science is fantastic,
it's very important point of view but, and

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.590
the fact that these publications are covering
these kind of stories is also very new.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:57.000
Science and Nature is a two premier publications,
they never really covered organic until the,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.321
actually one of the first organic research
stories they ran in Science was in the mid

00:25:02.321 --> 00:25:09.370
90s, actually one of the early OFRF grants
was Doctor John Reganold who compared organic

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:17.870
apples, biodynamic apples and conventional
apples for, uh, price, taste, nutrient density

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.190
and, um, I think shelf life.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:29.320
And he found that 4 out of the 5 cases, organic
exceeded that in an academic protocol and

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.419
biodynamic won the other one.

00:25:31.419 --> 00:25:33.590
And OFRF made those, made those grants.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.930
I'm really proud of that grant.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:41.800
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: You have some other historical,
uh, artifacts you brought.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.040
You wanna tell us about that?

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.060
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Some other goodies.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.470
Sure, Uh,
[Pause]

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:59.320
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: 19, no wait, 2009 the Journal
of HortScience did a story on the sorry state

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.850
of American fruits and veggies.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:07.090
Basically what they found, again, I can give
the link later on, this was a case of such

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:14.320
a quest for color, taste, harvest ability
that conventional produce tested out for,

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.220
I think, 7 to 10 micronutrients, 40 percent
lower than organic.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.650
So it wasn't, depends on which side of the
coin I guess, it wasn't that organic is necessarily

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:30.700
less nutritious, it was that an organic fully
four season biological system was maintaining,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:37.830
the, um, delicate balance of nutrients in
their fruits and vegetables as compared to

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:43.809
conventional which had really largely abandoned,
um, their breeding program for more of the

00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:45.700
commercial marketplace.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.500
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Here's a couple

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.960
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Life magazine?

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.460
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Life, okay, this is kind
of an ageist here

00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:01.331
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: 1970, Life magazine, as far

00:27:01.331 --> 00:27:04.910
as I know this is the first cover story about
organic.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:14.350
Written in 1970, organic comes of age and,
you know, blonde, young actress with her organic.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:19.970
Those, uh, you don't necessarily have to chuckle
out loud but those of you who remember TV

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.960
and ads at the time, I checked out she had
one acting gig.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.990
She was a model on TV for Noxzema shaving
cream where she purred, "Take it off, take

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.990
it all off."

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:37.700
And some guy would shave his, um, and she
made so much money that she bought an organic

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.700
food store
[Laughter]

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.640
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: and left acting to be an
organic activist.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.429
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Uh, and, uh, it goes on to

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:48.410
show that you see Santa Cruz Farm and Garden
and talk about how organic has come of age

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.210
since the '50s.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.410
And I think it's really a phenomenal read.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.971
Since I'm here at Google and I'd, actually
I got the desired response at lunch when I

00:27:56.971 --> 00:28:03.730
showed it around, there's also two ads in
here, one for this breathtaking new technological

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:08.700
development, at 200 dollars per, it's something
called a Polaroid camera.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.090
So, when I've showed it in certain places
people like, "Yeah, organic, that's cool,

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.090
right?

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.140
'70s, but look at that Polaroid camera for
200 dollars.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.600
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: breathlessly the newest deal

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.850
out there.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:26.790
But it's important, again, really for what
they talked about USC and crop rotation and

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:33.910
whole grains and nutrition and what USC, I
said USC, UCSC, produced.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.211
I also wanted to show

00:28:35.211 --> 00:28:37.350
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Well, that's a story.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.980
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: two other things here, maybe
three I'm, I try to bring something to get

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.980
a chuckle.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:48.820
You never know your audience entirely so don't
feel like you have to go overboard on my last

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.820
piece here.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.780
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Or, actually, I'll show the

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.780
book, too.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:29:00.130
In 1979, the last year of the Carter administration,
a couple people said organic's kind of working.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:05.240
And he tasks a group of scientists and farmers
to come together and write a task force report

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.730
on organic and make some recommendations.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:14.059
If this is real, this is growing, what should
we do to expand organic farming?

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:19.320
And they wrote this report, they made 20 some
odd recommendations and it was published,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.880
um, literally the last few weeks of the Carter
administration, an organic program coordinator

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:32.049
was hired to then implement these recommendations
and he was on staff when the Reagan administration

00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:33.250
came in.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:40.150
Whatever your politics are, John Block was
the Secretary of Ag at the time and under

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:45.240
the 'reduce Government and eliminate waste',
he laid off 500 people as one of his first

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.590
day green slip, pink slipped 500 people at
the USDA.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:56.810
Big press, great, immediately reducing, well,
they rehired 498 of them as consultants.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.780
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Cause they needed this staff

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.750
but they kept 2 off permanently.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.731
Now, that was Doctor Youngberg and the poor
woman in the secretary pool who happened to

00:30:05.731 --> 00:30:09.960
be assigned to his desk to help him, she was
laid off as well.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:15.950
But then they went further, they ordered all
the copies destroyed, and the, uh, the plates

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.830
that printed this also be destroyed.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.850
And I happened to be in Garth's office the
day that order came down and he was distraught,

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.320
I mean, this is kind of his life's work.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.990
So, um, seeing myself as a kind of a movie
character and feeling adventurous, uh, I took

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.700
20 of these and wrapped them up in brown paper
thinking that, and smuggled them out of USDA

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.360
passed security.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.150
And I made a much more of a, I mean, really
I just walked out the door with a bag.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.490
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: But it had, I thought I had

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.740
the only copies of this document at that time.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.880
One reporter, this is the power of the press,
James Risser from the Des Moine Register,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:59.049
wrote a story about this and, uh, the uproar
was so strong that, though Garth was never

00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:04.550
allowed back in the USDA, this became the
most requested report in the '80s during the

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.789
Reagan administration.

00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:10.110
Number one, tens and tens of thousands, that's
good news.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.470
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: And how much of this has been
implemented?

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:18.929
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Only 5 of the recommendations
have been fully implemented.

00:31:18.929 --> 00:31:25.290
Now, I have to say, um, Deputy Director of
the USDA is Doctor Kathleen Merrigan, she's

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:31.880
a former OFRF board member, she's number two,
she's created and fully implemented, now,

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.700
all of these recommendations are now in the
implementation track.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.000
She has a fantastic website called 'Know Your
Farmer, Know Your Food'.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.020
I almost thought about dialing that in.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.549
They had an event today at the White House;
she emailed me this morning saying, "If you

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:47.220
want to link into it, it's about women farmers.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:53.250
It's how to find local, how to find how your
USDA dollars, farmer's market, hoop houses.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:59.190
It's a really, really cool program that has
a compass and they just released 2.0 this

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.190
morning.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:07.300
You might think organic is, uh, that the classic
liberal, conservative divide is around organic

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:13.049
and it generally has an image of being a left
or a liberal, uh, phenomenon.

00:32:13.049 --> 00:32:18.340
But you'd probably, or maybe not, maybe I'm
wrong but, um, our general assessment is there

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.540
are more republican organic farmers than there
is democrat, if you will.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:27.790
There's a route in organic of conserve, as
in conservatism that is particularly out in

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:33.060
the heartland that these farmers have taken,
the parents, the grandparents and now the

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.120
children have taken very seriously.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.450
And, uh, one of the more famous or infamous
depending upon your point of view, it was

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:46.500
a gentleman named Paul Weyrich, passed away
a couple years ago, he founded the Free Congress

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:52.150
Foundation, he wrote a news and commentary
called the Conservative Voice, for many years

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.700
he was sort of the conservative voice to what
Norquist is to 'no taxes'.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:02.370
He was, what he said was conservatism when
and he wrote an amazing column on February

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:08.280
2006, the next conservatism and conservation
where he declared the future of conservatism

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:15.039
was organic family farms and protecting our
soil and managing our water and buying locally.

00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:16.700
It's an amazing document.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:24.419
If we wrote it, another bit of propaganda,
but time and time again, I accept all interviews.

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:30.650
I've been interviewed by, uh, Liv, many times
New York Times AP.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:38.330
I've also been on the 700 Club, um, [laughter]
you name it, part of my motto is to complete

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.450
and total transparency.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:43.340
I'll ask, answer any question for anybody
at anytime.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.150
And I love bringing this, uh, bring this out.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:51.010
His last one is, "Think locally, act locally."

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:56.940
This was the Conservative Voice in 2006 and
maybe more than any document we should have

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:03.210
this on all of us whenever debates break out
or the more public presentations.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:11.539
What's to be against about, Paul Weyrich's
vision of a family farm, the Jeffersonian,

00:34:11.539 --> 00:34:17.069
steel of our backbones from buying and keeping
our monies and food and our soil where it

00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:18.069
belongs.

00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:20.059
It's very important.

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:27.509
And then, though I have others here, two others
and then we'll go to Q and A, wanna do that?

00:34:27.509 --> 00:34:28.509
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Sure.

00:34:28.509 --> 00:34:37.279
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: In the theme of taking any
interview at any time, let's see is this dated,

00:34:37.279 --> 00:34:42.639
yeah; in 2003 I got a call from a reporter
from the National Enquirer.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.529
How many people know the National Enquirer?

00:34:45.529 --> 00:34:49.269
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: I see some hands went like

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:50.269
this.

00:34:50.269 --> 00:34:51.379
Nobody looked around so you're okay.

00:34:51.379 --> 00:34:53.539
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: So the National Enquirer

00:34:53.539 --> 00:34:58.609
calls and she says she's a reporter and I'm
sure this is a joke, one of my buddies, I

00:34:58.609 --> 00:35:02.490
mean, this is the kind of, this is what we
do for fun, is pretend, internally.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.539
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: And she was doing a story,

00:35:05.539 --> 00:35:08.520
"Are organic foods worth the cost?"

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.081
And, you know, I just wanted to say is this
Joanne?

00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:15.489
Is this, come on, you know, ha ha.

00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:19.460
I did it once or twice and she got really
irritated and said, "I'm in New York, I'm

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.619
on a deadline, I report for the National Enquirer
and I'm doing this story."

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:24.060
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: "Mister Scowcroft, do you

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.450
wanna talk or not?"

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.710
So I played it straight and she did a long
interview.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:33.549
She called others and low and behold, she
wrote an incredibly straight story.

00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:36.150
All, as any reporter would write.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:40.960
She went out, checked farmer's markets, she
asked about the rule and the 95 percent, the

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:48.390
100 percent, some other questions, not all
of which went in there and they had photos

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:54.499
of a farmer's market and we ended up talking
for about an hour and a half.

00:35:54.499 --> 00:35:59.780
And, you know, I'm not a subscriber and I
didn't quite wanna buy one every week at the

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.410
checkout stand for other reasons.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:07.469
So, um, being, uh, having a sense of humor
I had a contest, internal to the staff and

00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:13.039
others, that we wanted to see who would discover
it first cause we have a lot of eyes and ears

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:15.900
out there and we'd give them some kind of
prize.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:21.420
And it took about 6 weeks before someone outside
of the staff said, "Well, my Grandmother's

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.450
uncle was at the barber shop."

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.289
It was clear they had bought it themselves
[Laughter]

00:36:25.289 --> 00:36:30.289
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: but they had about 5 degrees
of separation to the fact that they had gotten

00:36:30.289 --> 00:36:35.329
the article and read it and low and behold
I was quoted in the National Enquirer.

00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:39.349
This is the range of interest that we have
out, out there and these kinds of stories.

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:45.099
And I thought it was, um, rather phenomenal
that she wanted to do this.

00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:50.130
I should add at the end of the phone call,
we went into pesticides and antibiotics, at

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.079
the end of the phone call, you know, "Thank
you, Mr. Scowcroft" and she said, "By the

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:59.630
way, um, I really hate you" and it just came
from such a, I said, "What, excuse me?

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.630
Did I?"

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.369
She said, "Well, no it's not you, it's that
I had take out and it's been delivered while

00:37:04.369 --> 00:37:07.440
I've been talking to you and now I don't think
I can eat it."

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.801
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: And I thought, "Okay, one

00:37:09.801 --> 00:37:10.859
person at a time."

00:37:10.859 --> 00:37:13.099
You know, one person at a time.

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:20.059
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Um, I'll begin with the first
question, this is, there are people who are

00:37:20.059 --> 00:37:27.859
saying organic is now so mainstream, I mean,
Doctor Oz is talking about eating organic,

00:37:27.859 --> 00:37:31.599
Oprah talks about eating organic.

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:39.210
Walgreens carries it, there are enough disruptive
farmers in California who are saying organics

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:44.900
is so diluted, so it's so mainstream now,
it's not really organic anymore.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.150
Is it, is it?

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.589
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Uh, absolutely.

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:49.059
It's the law of the land.

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:52.150
If it's not organic, it's a felony.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.710
So you have to meet those regulations.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.700
Now, some of those perspectives come from
a quest for purity.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.950
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Yes.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:05.990
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: I should back up a little
bit; organic is still a voluntary term.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:11.469
Nobody's making anyone in this room farm that
way, garden that way, thus, eat that way.

00:38:11.469 --> 00:38:16.160
If you choose to buy an organically labeled
product, you have the force of law behind

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:22.259
you and, actually, in the last few years as
they begun to enforce it, several, actually

00:38:22.259 --> 00:38:27.999
several people have now gone to jail for violations
of multimillion dollar violations of the certificates

00:38:27.999 --> 00:38:29.760
and the rules.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.839
Purity is, uh, why we set up the national
organic standards board.

00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:40.270
This is a board that's set up to assess when
a material can be allowed or not be allowed.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.969
Whether a practice should be approved or not
approved.

00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:49.690
And it's a passionate debate and some of the
materials that have been allowed generate

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.809
intense passion and when the vote comes down
against it, somebody raised their hand and

00:38:53.809 --> 00:38:55.069
said, "Well, that's it.

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:56.280
Industrial farming's taken over.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.460
It's not organic anymore."

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.880
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: I hear that a lot.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.829
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: That's untrue.

00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:08.489
Nevertheless, some of the advances and their
ability to become part of the rule are very

00:39:08.489 --> 00:39:09.799
slow.

00:39:09.799 --> 00:39:18.430
So I, again, as we talked over lunch, uh,
my feeling is that knowing if you have the

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:25.151
time and energy, knowing your farmer, visiting
her farm, his operation, is always, uh, one

00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:27.040
of the best ways to go about it.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.599
Particularly if it's in your neighborhood.

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:35.250
I'm, uh, a flexitarian when it comes to the
long push of organic.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.540
We need all the farmers we can get to farm.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:43.829
We hope to provide the tools to farm organically,
we hope the body of science and knowledge

00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:49.940
and the passion to continue continuous improvement,
to take root.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.249
Some are less patient than others to get there.

00:39:53.249 --> 00:39:58.039
So, but you're right to know that organic
is embedded in the law.

00:39:58.039 --> 00:40:00.759
Transparency is a critical part of that.

00:40:00.759 --> 00:40:04.109
So if you wanna tease that out some more that's
fine.

00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:06.469
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Well, I would but I think there's
some questions.

00:40:06.469 --> 00:40:09.019
Yeah, you wanna stand up?

00:40:09.019 --> 00:40:12.130
Yeah, I think we can hear you in the room.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.130
Go ahead.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.450
&gt;&gt;male #2: You have to repeat the questions.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.559
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: I have to repeat, okay.

00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:19.920
&gt;&gt;female #1: My question is are there countries
that are doing it better than us and what

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.859
lessons we can learn from those countries?

00:40:21.859 --> 00:40:25.690
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Who does organic better than
we do?

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.180
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Um, many.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:35.719
And almost universally because their Governments
have endorsed it, have invested in it and

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:39.009
created action plans to grow it.

00:40:39.009 --> 00:40:43.079
There are a number of European countries that
have goals, some of which have already been

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:47.140
met to have 20 percent of their food economy
be certified organic.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:53.690
Sweden, um, Switzerland, a National University
in Switzerland is an organic university.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:59.999
One of the people in that quick video, Brian,
Doctor Brian Baker, has been hired out of

00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:07.079
a university in New York, he's moved to Geneva
to be the translator of all the European research

00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:12.550
out of the, this is the university project
that translates organic research from around

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.369
the world into English.

00:41:14.369 --> 00:41:16.150
We can't even do that here.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:22.039
And Brian is now doing it out of, uh, F-I-B-L,
which is the acronym worldwide.

00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:25.709
Just, what a concept.

00:41:25.709 --> 00:41:30.619
Where is our academic institutions on almost
a simple information gathering?

00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:35.050
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: You were saying at lunch, what's
the top university in this country for organics?

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:41.280
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Now a number have organic
engagement programs but in my personal opinion,

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.900
and since this is on film I'll be hearing
it from many of them that I didn't name, but

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.390
Washington State University is where it's
at.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.569
WSU is phenomenal.

00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:54.900
They have organic undergraduate programs,
they have organic online programs, they have

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.239
organic masters and PhD programs.

00:41:57.239 --> 00:42:03.829
They just received a 5 million dollar grant
to expand, uh, their organic farm.

00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:10.290
Not only in its own ability to be state of
the art organic research but they have integrated

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:14.869
the organic, they actually call it the smart
farm, cause the architectural school's gotten

00:42:14.869 --> 00:42:16.160
really excited.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.900
The computer, there's an amazing amount of
computer applications, apps, for organic farming

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.049
just being developed.

00:42:24.049 --> 00:42:30.859
Water hydrology, the water use, soil fertility
and the business school, all now are integrated

00:42:30.859 --> 00:42:34.599
into the WSU smart farm program.

00:42:34.599 --> 00:42:41.959
And I found it ironic that UC Davis with a
thousand professors in Ag, I'm sorry, Post-Docs,

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:49.650
assistant professors, Ag professors nearby
that WSU comes to Santa Cruz and San Francisco

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:56.400
to raise money for their organic farm in Washington
when Davis has five or six organic researchers

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.950
out of that thousand.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.140
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Yes?

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:08.310
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hi, um, I find that the terminology
when it comes to animal friendly agriculture

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.640
practices and, you know, and organic animal
products gets a little confusing.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.239
Like, for me, it's really important to have
eggs for like chicken that are able to, like,

00:43:12.239 --> 00:43:16.229
graze a pasture and stuff like that.

00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:34.740
And, you know, now when you go to the farmer's
markets they have farms that advertise sort

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.640
of pastured eggs or whatever.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:43.509
But I'm, I mean, I find that I don't really
know exactly what that means and it's not

00:43:43.509 --> 00:43:50.200
really breaking the rule, right, I mean, so
I guess I'm wondering whether there is any

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:58.690
progress being made about putting some teeth,
some regulatory teeth behind sort of animal

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:02.930
agriculture or terminology and things like
that?

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.460
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Regulations and terminology
around pastured eggs etcetera.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.200
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: You know, the success of
the organic label, it is the only competitive

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.469
conventional egg and it is extremely different,
profoundly different.

00:44:15.469 --> 00:44:19.599
It's now trying to be modeled by many other
ecolabels.

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:25.039
The flip side of that is that many other ecolabels
really don't wanna go through 20 years of

00:44:25.039 --> 00:44:32.079
legislative action, regulatory formatting
or framework, I call it sort of the natural

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:36.680
regulatory spaghetti thrown against the wall.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:45.430
I'm happy, animal free pasture, no drugs,
sometimes sprayed, I mean, it's just everything

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:52.229
is out there and, uh, particularly in animal
welfare issues right now.

00:44:52.229 --> 00:44:57.849
It's really, to the extent possible, getting
a tour, getting to a location, getting to

00:44:57.849 --> 00:45:06.029
a farmer or rancher or talking to them in
the farmer's markets with, uh, again, I don't

00:45:06.029 --> 00:45:11.259
know how close you follow this but, uh, the
Humane Society had a revolutionary breakthrough

00:45:11.259 --> 00:45:16.660
50 years coming, has made an agreement with
the Ag producers association to have these

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:21.259
larger cages, um, we go from a foot to 5 feet.

00:45:21.259 --> 00:45:24.789
They can, chickens can turn around now.

00:45:24.789 --> 00:45:30.589
This is the grand bargain that we've made
and it's not in the Farm Bill.

00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:35.229
The powers that be struck it out and the powers
that be are the pork producers.

00:45:35.229 --> 00:45:42.029
"My God, if they let chickens turn around
then hogs will have to get out of their crates."

00:45:42.029 --> 00:45:51.460
If you really wanna be clinically depressed
on animal production look at a conventional

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.460
hog operation.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.890
&gt;&gt;male #3: Yeah, you know, I actually do that.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:46:00.950
You know, I do, I've been to like 2 particular
farms in this area that I know exactly how

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.509
they treat their chickens and those are the
only farms that I'll buy from.

00:46:04.509 --> 00:46:15.160
But I mean, I think, for, in order for this
sort of to drop, you know, drive sort of greater

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.140
adoption of these animal-friendly practices.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:28.299
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Well, many of the animal
welfare groups are trying but right now the

00:46:28.299 --> 00:46:30.769
heads of Ag committees won't even hold hearings.

00:46:30.769 --> 00:46:40.819
They won't even, I mean, the congressman from
Oklahoma who's an extremely conservative individual

00:46:40.819 --> 00:46:47.519
and remarkably pro agro industrial systems
approach, passed the Farm Bill, can't even

00:46:47.519 --> 00:46:51.599
get Boehner to put it on the floor of the
House.

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:56.029
That's the stranglehold that the industrial
farming system right now has.

00:46:56.029 --> 00:47:01.089
If it goes on before the house then there's,
um, what many people are calling a Monsanto

00:47:01.089 --> 00:47:06.029
amendment which waives all the regulations
around genetic engineering and requires the

00:47:06.029 --> 00:47:12.339
USDA to approve anything within one year of
application without health and safety testing.

00:47:12.339 --> 00:47:21.660
So one amendment got in of 70 or 80, I think,
in the Farm Bill so it's just too, that's

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:27.240
where the consumer power, that's particularly
impressed with an entity like Google and the

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:32.229
operation you have here 'cause you are, in
fact, leveraging forces by orders of magnitude

00:47:32.229 --> 00:47:34.709
as a group more than you would ever guess.

00:47:34.709 --> 00:47:38.849
You have no, I mean, maybe you kind of hear
it or maybe it's kind of sort of the road

00:47:38.849 --> 00:47:39.940
now, the norm.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.140
You have no idea what you're buying power
can do

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.249
[Sneezing in audience ]
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: as far as leveraging change.

00:47:46.249 --> 00:47:49.119
Well, there's questions everywhere.

00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:53.390
&gt;&gt;male #4: Can you talk a little bit more
about the cost dynamic?

00:47:53.390 --> 00:48:04.199
You've mentioned it a few times that there's,
there's a, there's economies of scale yet

00:48:04.199 --> 00:48:05.650
to capture.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.660
What are the specifics there and how do you
balance that against the other comments you've

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.710
made around knowing your farmer and how do
you know your farmers and keep your produce

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.990
local when things start to grow and stuff
like that.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:21.369
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Uh, the complexity of the
marketplace, you can get to a certain scale

00:48:21.369 --> 00:48:28.630
and go to 7 farmer's markets and you and maybe
1 or 2 workers harvest that and bring it direct

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:29.900
to market.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:33.569
You're paying the farmer pretty much the entire
cost for that.

00:48:33.569 --> 00:48:40.579
But that's still some fruits and vegetables,
once you start getting into cold storage,

00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:42.959
there's a little bit more as a middle person
there.

00:48:42.959 --> 00:48:47.299
Once you get into larger trucks or hydro coolers
or ice machines that broccoli has to go on

00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:51.019
ice just about in the field, a little bit
more cost there.

00:48:51.019 --> 00:48:55.190
Now you start to look at the scale as I have
an ice machine maybe I should grow a lot more

00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:00.130
broccoli and hire 5 workers and sell it into
a regional chain.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:04.509
Cost might go down at a certain point but
now you wanna grow something difficult, trial

00:49:04.509 --> 00:49:12.599
and error, you've gotta grow it out several
years to see whether you can grow okra or,

00:49:12.599 --> 00:49:16.710
and we're just talking fruits and vegetables,
um, if you're inter, I'm sorry, just vegetables,

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:22.829
tree fruit, do I wanna put 5 years of apple
varieties when, into my farm when apples might

00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:24.880
go out of vogue and raspberries.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:30.210
Anyone that's been down in the Watsonville,
Salinas area knows that, I mean, even when

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:35.140
I moved there in the '80s, apple trees were
everywhere, there's 1 or 2 apple growers left

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.380
because raspberries, raspberries, raspberries,
raspberries.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:44.039
So now, apple growers, they have harvesters
that come through, they have an intense season,

00:49:44.039 --> 00:49:47.059
they can put it into storage for 3 or 4 months.

00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:52.940
Completely different infrastructure for that
land and they have equipment, cost up front,

00:49:52.940 --> 00:50:00.089
loans, crop insurance, certain size,HACCP,
food safety issues now regulatory over, overlays

00:50:00.089 --> 00:50:03.029
that you have to follow.

00:50:03.029 --> 00:50:08.950
So, scaling up and commodity specific and
your business plan and your marketing initiatives,

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:15.979
all play a role in that dynamic and then when
you get into meat products, for example, there

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:23.569
was a fantastic hog farmer, almost have their
name, just wait, in Watsonville and we all

00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:25.440
went, "Finally, we can eat pulled pork.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.829
We can eat bacon from the farmer's market."

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:32.619
Those of us that eat meat and that farmer
couldn't make it, they ended up losing their

00:50:32.619 --> 00:50:38.440
money for one reason, their only slaughter
facility was down in Los Angeles area and

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:45.269
it was so large that it couldn't even take
their 10 hogs every 2 weeks make, they couldn't

00:50:45.269 --> 00:50:47.900
cleanup, never mind that it was natural or
organic.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:53.200
So, California is in desperate need of what's
called a mobile slaughter unit that can actually

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:59.549
go to the farm and slaughter specific to the
five, you know, name your meat products and

00:50:59.549 --> 00:51:02.209
some of the dairy issues and some of the cheese
making issues.

00:51:02.209 --> 00:51:09.190
So it becomes very complex very quickly relative
to what stream of commerce you wanna go into.

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:14.999
One of the more recent responses to that are
certain aggregators or co-ops where a number

00:51:14.999 --> 00:51:21.400
of veg growers are going together and starting
to aggregate and using one dock and one cooling

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.069
system or a grower that had a cooling system
is beginning to see another stream of income

00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:28.799
cooling other very small grower's product.

00:51:28.799 --> 00:51:33.220
It might be one pallet, it might be 3 pallets,
drive up literally with your pickup truck

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:37.180
with 20 flats of strawberries and they'll
cool it for a couple of days so then you can

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.829
move it out when it's ready.

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:42.449
I don't know if that's helpful but it's just
the complexities

00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:50.269
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah, it just seems like there's
a huge need for, like you said, shared infrastructure

00:51:50.269 --> 00:51:56.099
in the middle tier of the producer and buyer
and then a lot of these organic people have

00:51:56.099 --> 00:52:03.390
it incredibly difficult, like I read the Omnivore's
Dilemma and they talk about how organic first

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:08.109
started it was not just about revolutionizing
how food was produced but also how it was

00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:09.469
distributed and what people ate.

00:52:09.469 --> 00:52:14.180
And it seems like, at least sitting in the
sort of Shangri La of San Francisco, the piece

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:20.180
of that that's still has a lot of development
to do is the distribution piece in the middle

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.990
cause these small farms have such a challenge
getting their food to market.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.729
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: I would actually say it has
been revolutionized even since Michael wrote

00:52:27.729 --> 00:52:32.339
that but it is in certain regional locations.

00:52:32.339 --> 00:52:36.539
There's an amazing co-op up in Eugene in Portland
called Organically Grown.

00:52:36.539 --> 00:52:38.109
It was founded by organic farmers.

00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:40.390
It now represents several hundred organic
farmers.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:46.650
It's an ESOP, they have shares, they have
bonus plans, employee stock, 140 of the 200

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:53.789
employees own this company now and they have
built the entire infrastructure by and for.

00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:59.109
They go to restaurants, wholesalers, they
may serve some of the entities up there, people

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:02.049
at lunch seemed to know.

00:53:02.049 --> 00:53:08.170
But what we're still, this is still really
essentially outside those 7 buyers I brought

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:09.170
up before.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:10.729
The 4 supermarkets and the 3 box stores.

00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:12.109
&gt;&gt;male #4: [inaudible]

00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:18.829
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Well, my feeling is that
to get it to 50 percent, those 7 buyers bring

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:25.249
it to an economic strata that we can't reach,
commodities of which can work in that format

00:53:25.249 --> 00:53:30.450
for a period of time in the future and my
quip to the Nation, the Nation did a story

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:34.999
about it and I got in a little bit of trouble
saying, "Well, the good news is those pesticides

00:53:34.999 --> 00:53:40.269
are not being used on 100 thousand acres,
because of scale it won't go into that, but

00:53:40.269 --> 00:53:44.690
our response was like [indistinct], now we
need to set up a peach tasting stand at the

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:48.869
entrance to those box stores and let them
know what a real peach just harvested tastes

00:53:48.869 --> 00:53:50.009
like.

00:53:50.009 --> 00:53:52.059
Then those people can come to the farmer's
market.

00:53:52.059 --> 00:53:56.529
If you go to some of the intense markets in
Oakland, you'll see the organic tables have

00:53:56.529 --> 00:53:59.020
longer lines than the conventional.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:04.609
As a matter of fact, very important survey
done for years if not decades by the Grower

00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:10.670
magazine, fresh produce the packer, most conventional
publication out there has consistently shown

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:17.490
that the lower the economic strata, the greater
the desire for organic products.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:22.279
Completely countered the image that you see
some of these NGOS that are opposing organic

00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:23.619
want, it's an elite food.

00:54:23.619 --> 00:54:28.960
I mean, we certainly have not done a good
job, I can think of any number of video examples

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:35.049
of the most amazing superstar that only eats
organic that reinforces the elite image but

00:54:35.049 --> 00:54:40.529
the fact of the matter is that when given
the possibility and the opportunity that all

00:54:40.529 --> 00:54:45.069
economic strategists specifically the lower
ones which use organic consistently shown

00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:47.010
in the conventional publication.

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:49.619
&gt;&gt;male #5: [Indistinct]

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:59.959
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: I love that question.

00:54:59.959 --> 00:55:03.730
&gt;&gt;male #5: So I was wondering if you could
talk to the science?

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:04.730
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Sure.

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:05.730
Well, there's a couple of things.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:11.569
First of all, where are, where does it say
the US to feed the world?

00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:20.420
We certainly feed corn and soy beans to feed
stations around the world but, um first, secondly

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:28.569
we already produce something like 1.4, um,
1.4, one and half times more food than the

00:55:28.569 --> 00:55:30.469
earth consumes currently.

00:55:30.469 --> 00:55:38.069
The waste, war and storage and transportation
eliminate a phenomenal amount of that food.

00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:45.729
And, uh, my passion is to declare that we
should be feeding the world information rather

00:55:45.729 --> 00:55:55.910
than somehow assuming that we are industrializing
and exploiting our soil to move, uh, feed

00:55:55.910 --> 00:56:02.900
products in competition to Brazil or Russia
and China to meet operations elsewhere.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:10.950
&gt;&gt;male #5: So from a food system perspective
if you wanted to take an international [indistinct]

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:17.430
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Absolutely, the FAO has published
a number of papers recently showing, that's

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:22.219
an entity of the UN and I can't pull the name
up right now.

00:56:22.219 --> 00:56:23.339
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Food and Agriculture Organization.

00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:29.039
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: And there's a rocket, no
not rocket, well there's one person that's

00:56:29.039 --> 00:56:32.949
particularly been overseeing a lot of these
peer reviewed research reports showing now

00:56:32.949 --> 00:56:39.710
that organic fields are better than conventional
and a number of the African nations that,

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:45.339
particularly women, owned and run, small family
farms are producing a significantly better

00:56:45.339 --> 00:56:53.699
yield and crop rotation systems and local
cover crop, compost, green manure crops and

00:56:53.699 --> 00:56:58.470
that if we are serious about, really serious
about feeding the world we should be cooperatively

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:04.410
developing research stations and information
stations not genetically engineered products

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:07.329
that require fertilizer and chemicals.

00:57:07.329 --> 00:57:12.029
Just exporting the problems that were showing
up, having shown up here.

00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:13.089
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Last question.

00:57:13.089 --> 00:57:14.089
&gt;&gt;male #6: So, one issue you haven't mentioned
at all, I'm curious to hear your thoughts

00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:15.089
on the community garden.

00:57:15.089 --> 00:57:16.089
I have the good fortune of being married to
woman who has a passion for it.

00:57:16.089 --> 00:57:17.999
We have all manner of [indistinct] and peppers
[indistinct] elsewhere.

00:57:17.999 --> 00:57:41.469
Does this have any impact on scale or is just
a hobby for --

00:57:41.469 --> 00:57:49.049
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Can gardening impact, can mini
farming as John Jeavons calls it, impact our

00:57:49.049 --> 00:57:50.049
food supply?

00:57:50.049 --> 00:57:52.349
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: I think it could.

00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:58.961
Some very intriguing initial papers are starting
to come out about community gardens, actual

00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:06.989
just yields and nutrient delivery among some
of these gardens but by far, the more important

00:58:06.989 --> 00:58:12.309
component of gardening is the actual individual
act of growing your own food and understanding

00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:17.719
what it takes and particularly in community
gardens working with others building a community

00:58:17.719 --> 00:58:22.490
around a food and breaking bread and meal
culture.

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:24.230
We don't really have that in the US.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:29.881
If you go to Italy or some of these other,
I came home the other day and there was a

00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:36.619
bag of plums on my front doorstep and nobody
even put a note on it and they were incredible

00:58:36.619 --> 00:58:41.700
and I knew they came from my street or somewhere
and then just yesterday somebody shouted out,

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:45.420
you know, "I got plums up the wazoo and I
just went to every house and dropped them.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.059
I hope they were great!"

00:58:47.059 --> 00:58:48.920
And it was a moving, it was a moment.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:49.920
It was great.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.569
I'm happy to eat these plums in my cereal
every morning.

00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:58.359
I have a very special Bartlett pear tree in
my backyard and I've been doing the same thing,

00:58:58.359 --> 00:59:01.839
dropping them off cause they all have to go
pretty much come off in the next 2 weeks.

00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:08.309
So I think those acts of both just the personal,
it came from my garden, the salad or the fruit

00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:09.309
tree.

00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:12.430
I really want a Meyer lemon tree; I killed
my last lemon plant.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:14.829
I was working too hard.

00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:23.569
I think the garden movement is very important
and the last thing I'd say is the gardeners

00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:28.769
by and large are gonna save us all because
they're growing out heirloom seeds and exchanging

00:59:28.769 --> 00:59:37.890
seeds and saving seeds and trading seeds where
the new organic seed movement and seed alliance

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:41.289
and seed savers are coming from, by and large,
gardeners.

00:59:41.289 --> 00:59:46.589
If it wasn't for the gardeners that have done
this the last 30 years.

00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:51.939
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: It's something to do with,
to take of suburban sprawl is to start growing

00:59:51.939 --> 00:59:52.939
food on it, right?

00:59:52.939 --> 00:59:57.849
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Now, Detroit has a food plan,
it's very contrev, someone wants to industrialize

00:59:57.849 --> 01:00:04.189
that but basically Detroit has an actual plan
and it's beginning to take some of these blocks

01:00:04.189 --> 01:00:09.650
and turn it back to farming and the larger
community agricultural garden stations to

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.989
feed the community around it.

01:00:11.989 --> 01:00:22.009
And that is a mayor initiative supported by
Whole Foods and a number of, you know, philanthropic

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:23.009
entities.

01:00:23.009 --> 01:00:25.939
I should say one more thing, just to close,
can I do that?

01:00:25.939 --> 01:00:27.140
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Sure, yes, please, your book.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.710
Well, the book you're in.

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.750
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Yeah, it's not mine.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:37.390
One of the things that I'm at the very early
stages, and I'm saying this for the record,

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:41.460
I guess people are gonna have to start holding
me to it but I'm gonna write a book, the people's

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:47.119
history of organic . We've got 35 years of
these little, I brought other goodies like

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:51.239
in Russian, in St. Petersburg Russia, a sale
of organic cranberries.

01:00:51.239 --> 01:00:55.619
So if you're really short here in the US you
can go over to St. Petersburg, buy organic

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:57.359
cranberries.

01:00:57.359 --> 01:01:07.269
But, I'm 61, many of us have been working
on this for 30, 40 years, are retiring or

01:01:07.269 --> 01:01:11.579
disengaging entirely, I'm not I'm just doing
things in a different way now.

01:01:11.579 --> 01:01:16.640
But I think capturing our history is really
important so I got an idea years ago, I was

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.890
looking for revolutionary librarians, which
a particular audience though that's was really

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.769
funny, revolutionary librarians.

01:01:23.769 --> 01:01:30.130
But, actually, 2 came up to me afterwards
and said, "We are revolutionary librarians."

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:34.780
And I said, "Well, what I want you to do is
an oral history of the 20 people that started

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:40.049
organic in California" Well, a few have passed
away, others are in their 70s, some of us

01:01:40.049 --> 01:01:41.430
are in a late 50s, 60s.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:43.040
We need to capture this.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:49.569
And low and behold they ended up with 52 oral
histories at UC Santa Cruz's McHenry Library,

01:01:49.569 --> 01:01:56.930
all downloadable mp3's you can listen ad nauseum
for hours at us talking away and then it got,

01:01:56.930 --> 01:02:02.349
within the library system they were so excited
about at UC Press, said let's make a book

01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:03.410
out of it.

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:08.900
And they tasked the librarians to find the
best and put it in order and get about 15,

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:15.559
18 pages of each one in print and this just
came out, it's called "Cultivating a Movement"

01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:19.750
and it's, I found it, I'm learning things
about my friends that I didn't know.

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:25.259
Jim Cochran the great strawberry grower and
UFW supporter started the daycare, as an assistant

01:02:25.259 --> 01:02:28.449
in a daycare program.

01:02:28.449 --> 01:02:36.329
But we should all, in almost every menu, be
capturing our oral history now.

01:02:36.329 --> 01:02:41.309
And so I'm going around the country to other
places and I'm a trustee on a foundation so

01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:44.949
I'm actually, I think, working with other
foundations.

01:02:44.949 --> 01:02:48.630
I think there's some funding now to, cause
this is mostly all local.

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:52.859
What happened in New England, what happened
in Oklahoma, what happened in Wisconsin and

01:02:52.859 --> 01:02:56.099
Washington is, in a way, an indigenous to
the place.

01:02:56.099 --> 01:03:00.819
But, the students job will be to study this
and to find the common themes.

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:07.279
But, "Cultivating a Movement" is a pretty
cool read and you will recognize some of the

01:03:07.279 --> 01:03:10.999
farmers in there if you go take a look on
the web about it.

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:17.779
It can be purchased through UCSC, I didn't
bring it, Irene is really the hero that did

01:03:17.779 --> 01:03:18.779
this book.

01:03:18.779 --> 01:03:21.110
I have a chapter in here, as well.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.670
Amazon, I guess, has it too.

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:25.989
&gt;&gt;Presenter 2: Well, we're gonna look for
your, your memoirs.

01:03:25.989 --> 01:03:31.259
&gt;&gt;Bob Scowcroft: Well, yeah, the people's
history of organic has a couple of PG-13 stories

01:03:31.259 --> 01:03:33.160
about it too.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:40.700
Some great scandals and the gathering of the
tribe of organic activists both young and

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.660
old is at Asilomar Conference Center every
January.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:50.759
It's 32 years running, I've been to all but
3 and they're from 80 years old to 8.

01:03:50.759 --> 01:03:55.400
It's a great conference .And, of course, that's
where we reconnected last January that led

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400
