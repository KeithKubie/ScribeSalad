The Add to Home Screen for
Mobile Safari is a little different, but

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.070
it allows you to do many of the same
things that the web app manifest does.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.870
Instead of putting everything in
the manifest, Safari looks for

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.670
a set of meta tags in the document head.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.360
Let's start with the icons.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.190
The easiest thing to do is
place an apple-touch-icon.png

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.760
document in the folder.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.040
But if you want to specify icons for
different device resolutions,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.495
you'll need to add
a link rel apple touch

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:35.245
icon with a sizes attribute for
each image.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:40.145
To cover all of the current devices,
you'll need six icon sizes.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:46.174
60 pixels, 76 pixels, 120 pixels,

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:51.259
152, 167 and 180 x180.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:55.802
To hide the browser UI components,
add an apple mobileweb

00:00:55.802 --> 00:01:00.066
app capable content equals
yes attribute to the head,

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:04.780
which will start the app
without any browser UI.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.820
If you want to minimize the status bar,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.640
you can add in apple mobile web app
status bar style meta tag to the head.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.909
If you do that,

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.100
remember to add some padding as
the status text is still there.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.773
