Host: Well, thanks everyone and welcome again
to Authors@Google live in the San

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.800
Francisco office. Today, uh, we have Steven
Hall talking about his book,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.120
"Wisdom, from Philosophy to Neuroscience".
Umm, award-winning science writer

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.700
Steven Hall examines ancient concepts of wisdom
through the lens of modern brain

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.990
science and -- and neuroscience. Uh, breaking
wisdom down to what Steven refers

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.539
to as the eight neural pillars, uh, Hall takes
a fresh look at human qualities

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.320
long associated with wisdom including compassion,
emotional regulation, the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.390
ability to discern what's important, uh, and
the skill of coping with

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.880
uncertainty and suggests that modern neuroscience
is providing radical new

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.090
insights about how these timeless virtues
evolved. Uh, based in part on a 2007

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.850
article in the New York Times Magazine, umm,
which I strongly recommend looking

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.079
up and reading, "Wisdom" is also a meditation
on the seeds of wisdom, aspects of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.039
wisdom if our everyday life, and the future
of wisdom in our complex society.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.630
Hall is a professor of journalism at Columbia
and NYU and he actually has an

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.039
article coming out a little later this month
in "National Geographic". So be

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.960
sure to check out, if you'd like to know more,
his web site, Stevenshall.com

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.100
where he has a nice new blog known as "Mind-Wise."
So thanks again. Let's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.360
welcome Steven Hall to Google.
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.509
&gt;&gt; [Pause]
Stephen: Great. Thank you very much for inviting

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.039
me here to talk about this.
Umm, uh, I'm gonna give you a little bit of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.759
background in how I got involved in
this. Umm, "Wisdom" is obviously an immense

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.819
topic, umm, and it's kinda
difficult to talk about because it means so

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.479
many different things to different
people and the definition has changed over

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.170
the course of history and the
definition has been argued about for the last

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.579
2500 years. Umm, and even as I'm
beginning I can imagine several pertinent

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.140
questions running through your minds,
uh, most obvious of which is what exactly

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.579
does he mean by wisdom? And who the
heck is this guy to be telling me about it?

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.969
Those are both good questions and
I'm gonna answer the second one first because

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.810
A it's easier but B it actually
kinda tells you the story of how I got involved

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.150
in this. Umm, I'm not a
philosopher. I hope that's obvious. Lord knows

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.989
I'm not a theologian. I was
the only kid in my high school class who flunked

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.569
the test on the Bible which is
not easy. I'm not a psychologist and I'm certainly,

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.969
uh, not a neuroscientist.
Uh, I'm a science writer and for the last

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.739
25, 30 years I've mostly written about
very basic science. I write a lot about genetics;

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.840
I write a lot about molecular
biology; uh, I write about immunology; I've

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.819
written histories of the creation of
biotechnology, how the -- how the entire industry

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.010
was actually founded a few
miles south of here in South San Francisco

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.640
with Genentech, umm; I've written a
book about cancer immunotherapy. So it's been

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.090
really basic science that always,
you know, intrigued me and then also the history

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.640
and story behind these things.
Uh, so then the question is, so, uh, what

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.420
in the world attracted me to the topic
of wisdom which is very much unlike those

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.840
other topics? Umm, and the answer to
that is it kinda began with a phone call that

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.840
I received in the fall of 2006.
Umm, the call was from, uh, my editor at the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.720
New York Times magazine, a woman by
the name of Vera Titunik who explained at

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.950
the magazine was doing a special issue
on the baby boomer generation getting old

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.500
and would I like to contribute to it.
Umm, I'm not sure exactly what qualified me

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.079
for the call but I suspect part of
it was my inclusion in that generation. Umm,

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.000
but in point of fact I've
actually -- I did my very first cover story

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.999
for the "Times Magazine" in 1981 so
I've had a fairly steady association with

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:09.421
the magazine for nearly 30 years; have
worked in the magazine; have been the science

00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:13.950
editor of the magazine, umm, and
have done a number of stories so I kinda think

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.329
of it as a kind of home that I'm
always delight and had kind of flattered when

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.530
they get in touch and ask me if
I'd be interested in doing something. So I

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.729
said do they have anything in
particular in mind and, uh, she said yes.

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.710
They had heard that there was
research that had been conducted in wisdom

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.700
and would I be interested in writing
about this. Umm, and contrary to the -- what

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.039
you might think because of the
book that's sitting in front of you, my first

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.169
sort of reaction is my heart
completely sank when I heard this 'cause I

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.150
thought, uh, there's no way this --
there's no way there could be any credible

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.169
science that is associated in this
and there's no way research could be, uh,

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.720
could be credible. Umm, I can tell
you this but I didn't tell her that. The whole

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.500
idea of it because it's such a
nebulous idea, how do you define wisdom, how

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.720
could you conduct empirical
research on it was kind of ridiculous. Umm,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.180
and again for the same reasons I
just mentioned I spent my whole career writing

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.550
about hard science and in
addition the critical thinking that produces

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.370
hard science and the notion that
something is nebulous and fuzzy as wisdom

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.610
could lend itself to empirical study
really struck me as preposterous. Fortunately,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.220
I didn't actually tell her that.
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.190
Stephen: Uh, instead, I said, uh, I would
look into it and she said, great.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.550
And she mentioned a couple of psychologists
who had done some of this research,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.940
umm, and when she mentioned it I said that's
interesting and since it was a

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.610
phone call she didn't seem me rolling my eyes
as I said, "That's interesting"

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.080
and then I started gathering the research
and started, umm, just kind of

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.949
involving myself and immersing myself in this
literature. So what was this

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.569
literature? Well, it turns out very interestingly
that in the 1970s and the

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.720
1980s, umm, there was a small group of psychologists
kind of inspired by Eric

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.780
Ericson, who is a name you might recognize
as one of the great 20th century

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.340
American psychologists, umm, who began a kind
of formal study of wisdom and

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.129
Ericson had glancingly mentioned wisdom very
early on in his career, actually at

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:25.060
around 1950, umm, as a kind of culminating
stage of human development toward the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.220
end of life. Part of his definition was it's
reconciliation of two kind of

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.199
opposite things, one of which was what he
called "ego integrity" which is kind

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:39.720
of being settled into one's self at that stage
of life and the disruption of

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.539
contemplating one's mortality. So there are
these two con -- conflicting

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:49.270
impulses going on toward the end of life and
wisdom kind of manifested itself

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.740
and you were able to reconcile these two things
and continue, uh, forward and be

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:59.990
productive. Umm, it also coincided interestingly
with a -- with a tangent from

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.730
gerontology. For a lot of gerontology and
gerontological psychology to that

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.650
point, uh, people mostly studied mental decline
and physical decline. Those

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.560
were the things that were associated with
aging and in the 1970s a group of

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.350
psychologists said there must also be some
positive things about aging. Why

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.640
don't we go out and look for them? Umm, there
was a group at University of

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.540
Southern California led by a pretty prominent
gerontological psychologist named

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.419
James Birren kind of initiated a lot of this
study and it was one of his

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:36.199
graduate students, a woman named Vivian Clayton
who lives in Berkeley, umm, who

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.750
did the first even faintly empirical studied
of wisdom. They were published in

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.770
1975. And as I learned, as I started familiarizing
myself with this early

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.050
history, the researchers who actually started
looking at this were not flakes.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.229
They were very mainstream people in psychology.
One of them, uh, was a guy

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:58.740
named Robert Sternburg, who is a professor
at Yale University for 30 years.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.539
Very, umm, well known for theory of intelligence
and in fact he then went into

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:10.039
wisdom research because he, uh, felt that
the, uh, intelligence as a theory was

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.250
flawed because it didn't take into account
certain aspects of human behavior

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.210
that didn't rise to the level of wisdom. So
he actually used the -- uh,

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.419
intelligence to get to wisdom. Umm, he's a
former President of the American

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:26.810
Psychological Association so he's very mainstream
in that sense. Uh, and then

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.250
there was a group based in Germany at the
Max Plank Institute for Human

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:36.170
Development led by Paul Baltes. They, too,
had been studying aging and had an

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:42.790
aging project in Berlin in the 1980s that
morphed into the Berlin Wisdom Project

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.470
because they became really intrigued by how
elderly people were dealing with

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.380
some of these issues and what constituted
wisdom, how one acquired it and how it

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.750
developed. So these were not fringe figures.
They were actually very

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.290
interesting mainstream psychologists probably
well established enough to take on

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.320
this crazy idea of wisdom because there was
a lot of obvious skepticism much

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:11.650
like I had. Umm, many of these people came
from a field known as, uh, lifespan

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:17.130
developmental psychology which is a branch
of psychology which studies changes

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.010
in human development, thought, emotion over
the course of the lifetime with the

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:26.190
understanding that the times you live in,
the, uh, events that happened, the

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.150
technologies that are available, everything
that occurs during your lifetime has

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.380
an impact on how you think and how you feel
and how those qualities evolve and

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.900
change over the course of a lifetime. I mean,
it sounds very obvious to us now

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:42.190
but in fact so much psychology was based on
specific time periods and sort of

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:48.090
the present tense so it it can a much broader
view of it. So anyway, this small

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:54.240
group of researchers started to design studies
and they began publishing studies

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.730
about wisdom beginning again around 1975 and
enough had been, uh, published that

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:06.510
in 1990 there was actually an academic anthology
edited by Sternberg entitled

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:12.720
"Wisdom". So I got my hands on this book and
I started reading these, uh, uh,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.620
articles, umm, and it really kind of explains
how I got into this. A funny

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:23.510
thing happened. Umm, I really found myself
fascinated by this very fuzzy topic.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:28.320
Again, most of the research I read and write
about is -- involves transcription

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.070
factors in genetics and the nuts and bolts
of antigen and antibody technology,

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:38.560
very, very detailed mechanistic explanations
of how things work at a reductive

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.880
level. Umm, suddenly I was reading about life
choices, moral decisions and

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:50.210
moral judgment, emotional resilience and resolving
problems that often resolved

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:56.220
these kind of timeless conflicts between the
immediate impulse to satisfy one's

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.230
urges and delaying those gratifications to
get a larger goal on the one hand or

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.110
try to mediate the self-interest versus what
would be of interest to a larger

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.080
group of people whether it's a family, congregation,
work group, whatever --

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.260
whatever it is. Umm, I found the reading incredibly
stimulating in part because

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.140
it did what all us writers want our work to
do which is it got me to stop and to

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.740
think and the stopping part of it was as important
as the thinking part of it.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.700
&gt;&gt; [Pause]
Stephen: As I continued to read and do things

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.380
I noticed that there were kind of
changes in my own pattern of behavior and

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.160
thought that were really kind of
interesting. Umm, whenever I read about wisdom

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.380
and it definition I found myself
sort of arguing with the definition, troubleshooting

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.860
the def -- definition,
disputing the definition but at the same time

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.050
being illuminated by that kind of,
uh, disagreement and just thinking about,

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:58.190
uh, not only wisdom but then how it
kind of resonated with the decisions that

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.560
I had made in my own life, the kind of
choices I'd made, that sort of thing. In a

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.750
funny sense, the definition of
wisdom began not even to matter too much.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:14.020
It's important, obviously
scientifically, but, umm, Sternberg made the

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.340
point that to understand wisdom
fully and correctly probably requires more

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.550
wisdom than any of us have. So
there's an understanding that -- that whatever

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.680
we're talking about is difficult
to get our arms around but I don't think that

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.490
means that it's not worth thinking
about or not even worth trying to define but

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:37.610
we -- we -- we gravitate towards
certain, umm, qualities. Now, granted that

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:43.050
wisdom is almost, uh, impossible to
define and that book I mention that came out

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:48.830
in 1990 by the psychologist, umm,
had 13 chapters written by 13 different groups

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:53.040
of psychologists and every
chapter had a different definition of -- of

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.150
wisdom. And it just sort of
indicates the kind of -- there's no definitional

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:03.750
consensus in many ways about
what actually it is. Umm, but and this is

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.580
what -- another sort of part of this
process -- I began to pay more attention to

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.250
the convergences and the congruences
of the definition than I did about the differences

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.010
and there were things that
were congruent across different definitions.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.070
Umm, there were certain cognitive
qualities and emotional traits that kept cropping

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.980
up again and again in these
discussions primarily in the psychological

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.910
literature but also in the
philosophical literature. Things like being

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:34.100
even-keeled emotionally and how
that sort of prepared you for decision making;

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.310
an ability to frame problems in a
way that allows you to see alternative solutions;

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.590
an ability to understand the
viewpoint of others, uh, an ability to weigh

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:49.410
future rewards against, uh,
immediate -- the allure of immediate gratifications,

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:55.220
a sense of moral and social
justice; an ability to deal with limitation,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.740
uncertainty, and change. These
qualities ran through a lot of discussions

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.820
of wisdom whether it was in
psychology and if you go back and look in

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.450
the early history of philosophy as
well. And this kinda led to the second sort

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.500
of major insight. Umm, I knew that
no one in neuroscience was seriously doing

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:20.050
research in wisdom but I realized
that a lot of cutting edge neuroscientific

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.560
research was being done on precisely
these cognitive and emotional qualities that

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.800
I had kind of identified, umm, and
in fact psychologists, thee low gins, philosophers

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:37.060
long before me had identified
as being, umm, really important if not central

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.870
to wisdom. If I bring anything
special to this whole enterprise, uh, I kind

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.130
of have always had the dumb luck of
being familiar with a lot of different fields

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:52.050
that don't typically talk to each
other. So I was able to see conversations

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.180
that were in different fields that
maybe they were not aware of. Uh, clearly

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.080
the neuroscience community was not
aware of this wisdom literature, uh, the wisdom

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.700
community -- the wisdom
psychologists were actually not that aware

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.860
of the neuroscience. Umm,
neuroscience, interestingly, was becoming

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:15.750
very conscious of some of the very old
arguments philosophically so they were beginning

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.500
to pay attention and one of the
most interesting phenomena I've observed in

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.130
the last five years in the
scientific literature: Very hard core articles

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:29.680
in nature and science about
brain, uh, neuroscience is that the list of

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.570
citations at the end of the article
include people like Aristotle, uh, John Stuart

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:40.160
Mills, John Rawls, umm, David
Hume. In other words, these ancient conflicts

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.070
that have been identified and
bandied about for centuries if not millennia

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.910
are being re-examined, readdressed,
and different experimental protocols are being

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:55.600
designed to kind of test them in
the sort of atmosphere of brain science now

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.730
which is, in and of itself, really
interesting. So that got me to ask these questions.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.240
So can the workings of the
brain help us understand what it means to

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.490
be wise and perhaps even suggest ways
we can become wiser? Uh, is there any place

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.741
for wisdom in our modern world?
And of course before answering those questions

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:17.720
I had to come the at least a
tentative answer to one other question which

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:24.570
is again, what exactly is wisdom?
Umm, I'm not gonna answer that too specifically

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.030
but I'm gonna give you an
example of how one comes kind of sideways

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:32.200
into some of these issues. Umm, uh,
it's a question that has so many dimensions

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.360
as I mentioned before but also
because the book actually runs through a number

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.540
of working definitions and, umm,
you know, argues with them, uh, announces

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.620
them and it's -- I think part of the
processing of wisdom is processing one's definition

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.130
of it in thinking how it
applies to you and that's part of the process

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:57.420
of this entire book. However,
umm, I really like the succinctness of a contemporary

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.160
author, Robert Nozic, who
said, wisdom is an understanding of what is

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.039
important. And there's a lot of
stuff that follows behind that very simple

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:10.959
statement, how we determine
valuation, how we value what's important,

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:15.949
what's the -- the ambit or environment
of importance? How do we gather knowledge

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:20.850
that reinforces what's important, so
on and so forth? But that specific standard

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.880
I think is really important and
that leads me to an episode in my own life

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.090
with which I begin the book because
it occurred to me much after the fact that

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.150
it was an exercise in deciding what
was important even though at the time I was

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.210
actually not aware of it. So I'd
just like to read the kind of beginning of

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:46.990
the book as an example of how our
brain works at least. Umm, okay. On a beaut

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:52.149
 -- On a beautiful fall morning
nearly a decade ago, like hundreds of mornings

00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:57.389
before and since, I dropped off
one of my children at school. Micaela, then

00:17:57.389 --> 00:18:01.799
five years old, had just started
first grade, and the playground chatter among

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:06.759
both the children and their
parents reflected that mix of nervous unfamiliarity

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:10.190
and comforting reconnection
that marks the beginning of the school year.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.980
I lingered in the schoolyard until
Micaela lined up with her teacher and classmates.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.230
She wore a pretty purple
dress that my mother had just sent her, white

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.980
socks, and
pink-and-white-checkered sneakers. A hair

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:28.750
band exposed her hopeful, eager,
beautiful face. I sneaked in a last hug, as

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:33.470
impulsive dads are wont to do,
before she disappeared into the building.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:39.139
The time was about 8:40 a.m. As I
left the schoolyard and began to head toward

00:18:39.139 --> 00:18:45.610
the subway and home to Brooklyn, I
heard a thunderous, unfamiliar roar overhead.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:50.399
As the noise grew louder and
closer, I froze in an instinctive crouch,

00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:55.610
much like the rats we always read
about in scientific experiments on fear, wondering

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.450
where the sound was coming
from, knowing only that it was ominously out

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.870
of the ordinary. Moments later, a
huge shadow with metal wings passed directly

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.570
over my head, like some prehistoric
bird of prey.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.929
&gt;&gt; [coughing]
Stephen: Excuse me. I instantly recognized

00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:16.360
it as a large twin-engine
commercial airliner, but nothing in my experience

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.850
prepared me for what happened
next. I watched for the endless one … two

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:27.110
 … three … four seconds it took for
this shiny man-made bird -- excuse me -- to

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:32.230
fly directly into the tall building
that I faced several blocks away. In real

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:39.200
time, I watched a 395,000-pound
airplane simply disappear. Almost immediately

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.780
black smoke began to curl out of
the cruel, grinning incision its wings had

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:49.120
sliced in the façade of the
skyscraper. In moments when life’s regular

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.080
playbook flies out the window, when
the ground shifts beneath our feet in a literal

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.750
or figurative earthquake, we
feel a surge of adrenalized fear at the shock

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.679
of the unexpected. But right
behind that feeling comes the struggle to

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:07.720
make sense of the seemingly senseless,
to try to understand what has just happened

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.509
and what it means so that we will
know how to think about a future that suddenly

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:16.570
seems uncertain and
unpredictable. In truth, the future is always

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:21.990
unpredictable, which is why these
moments of shock remind us, with unusual urgency,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:27.629
that we have a constant (if
often unconscious) need for wisdom, too. Although

00:20:27.629 --> 00:20:32.370
we now know -- we now all
know exactly what happened that terrible morning,

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.690
the ground truth in lower
Manhattan on September 11, 2001, was much

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:42.360
fuzzier at 8:45 a.m. One of the
hallmarks of wisdom, what distinguishes it

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:47.029
so sharply from “mere” intelligence,
is the ability to exercise good judgment in

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:53.440
the face of imperfect knowledge. In
short, do the right thing -- ethically, socially,

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.320
familiarly, personally.
Sometimes, as on this day, we have to deliberate

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.350
these decisions in the midst of
an absolutely roaring neural stew of conscious

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:07.550
and unconscious urgings. In one
sense, I knew exactly what had happened long

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:12.129
before the first news bulletin hit
the airwaves. In a larger sense, someone watching

00:21:12.129 --> 00:21:16.120
television in Timbuktu soon
knew vastly more about the big picture than

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.630
I did. This may be an exaggerated
example, but it is in precisely the murk of

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:27.129
this kind of confusion that we often
have to make decisions. So what did I do?

00:21:27.129 --> 00:21:32.299
I went to a nearby shop and bought a
cup of coffee. It didn’t occur to me until

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:36.620
much later that this was a decision
of sorts -- perhaps a foolish one, and certainly

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.779
not an obvious one. But to the
extent that I mustered even --

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:45.241
&gt;&gt; [coughing]
Stephen: Excuse me -- a dram of wisdom that

00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:50.440
day, it was in how I viewed the
situation and what I thought was most important.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.679
Oddly, I felt little or no
physical threat, despite such close proximity

00:21:54.679 --> 00:22:00.200
to the unfolding disaster; in some
respects, the event played much scarier on

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.870
TV than in person. My person -- My
immediate focus, even then, was on the long-term

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:10.440
psychological impact that such
a calamity might have on a young child, and

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.759
what (if anything) a parent might do
to minimize it. I hadn’t quite understood

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:18.409
yet that that would be my mission for
the day, but by standing in the street and

00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:23.009
sipping a cup of coffee, in that
mysterious shorthand of human choice, I had

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:28.610
chosen to stay close to my daughter,
to stay calm, and, failing that, to fake parental

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.169
calm realistically enough to
convince her that this was a situation we

00:22:32.169 --> 00:22:37.499
could deal with. But she didn’t need
to see the whole movie. I did not think it

00:22:37.499 --> 00:22:42.200
was a good idea for a young child to
witness, as I did, human bodies falling like

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.809
paperweight angels from the upper
floors of the nearby tower. Even more, I did

00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:51.200
not think it was a good idea for a
young child to absorb, even for a moment,

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.510
the panic and despair written on the
faces of all the adults who were beginning

00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:00.490
to comprehend that the world as they
had known it, even a few minutes earlier,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.269
had suddenly changed, slipping
irrevocably out of their (however illusionary)

00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:10.490
controlling grasp. If you’re
thinking that I’m offering a smug little

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:15.279
narrative about wise parenting, not to
worry. Wisdom doesn’t come easily to us

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:18.610
mortals, and I’ve been reminded many
times since that it probably didn’t come

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.659
to me that day, either. Many of the
choices I made that morning were second-guessed

00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:29.820
by my wife, by my friends, and
even by my daughter. More to the point, my

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.460
small-minded plan to buffer
Micaela’s emotional experience was rudely

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:39.730
interrupted by the collapse of 500,000
tons of metal, concrete, and glass. Just as

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.730
teachers began to evacuate children
from the school, the second tower came down,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.220
unleashing the kind of apocalyptic
roar no child should ever have to hear, and

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.950
a huge pyroclastic cloud of debris
came boiling up Greenwich Street toward us.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.080
You couldn’t tell if the cloud was
going to reach us or not, but it wasn’t

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.769
a moment for contemplation. I picked up
Micaela and we joined a horde of people running

00:24:02.769 --> 00:24:07.360
up the street. As I carried her
in my arms, swimming upriver in a school of

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.460
panicked fish, she was forced to
look backward, downtown, right into the onrushing

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.929
menace of our suddenly dark
times. Even to this day, however, the thing

00:24:16.929 --> 00:24:21.720
Micaela remembers most about the
evacuation is the moment her classmate Liam

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.360
accidentally walked into a street
sign when he wasn’t looking. It will be

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:32.130
a long time, if ever, before I know if
I acted wisely on 9/11. Indeed, it didn’t

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:36.529
even occur to me until I was writing
this passage that the most important decision

00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:40.940
I made that day did not even rise
to the level of conscious choice. I “decided,”

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.580
without any conspicuous
deliberation, that I had to be a parent first,

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.659
not a journalist, on that
particular morning. At one level, it was an

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:53.760
obvious choice; at another, it went
against self-interest, career, my professional

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.299
identity, taking advantage of
being an eyewitness to the biggest story of

00:24:57.299 --> 00:25:02.759
my lifetime. What was I thinking?
That, in a sense, is what I want this book

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:08.320
to be about: How do we make complex,
complicated decisions and life choices, and

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.870
what makes some of these choices so
clearly wise that we all intuitively recognize

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:18.179
them as a moment, however brief,
of human wisdom? What goes on in our heads

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:21.950
when we’re struggling to be patient
and prudent, and are there ways to enhance

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.400
those qualities? When we’re being
foolish, on the other hand, do our brains

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.700
make us do it? And how does the
passage of time, and our approaching mortality,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:36.259
change our thought processes and
perhaps make us more amenable to wisdom? In

00:25:36.259 --> 00:25:39.850
moments of exceptional challenge
and uncertainty, we tend to ask, How did this

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:44.490
happen? What could we have done
to prevent this dire turn of events? This

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.730
is another way of saying, I realize
now, that we are always searching for wisdom,

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:53.539
but all too often we are looking
for it in the rearview mirror, sifting the

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:59.529
past for clues to how we might have
thought about the future in a different way.

00:25:59.529 --> 00:26:03.440
We crave wisdom -- worship it in
others, wish it upon our children, and seek

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.590
it ourselves -- precisely because it
will help us lead a meaningful life as we

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:12.549
count our days, because we hope it
will guide our actions as we step cautiously

00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:17.779
into that always uncertain future.
At times of challenge and uncertainty, nothing

00:26:17.779 --> 00:26:22.600
seems more important than
wisdom -- economic wisdom, moral wisdom, political

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.980
wisdom, even that private,
behind-closed-doors wisdom that allows us

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.450
to convey the gravity of changed
circumstances to our children without making

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:36.539
them afraid of change itself.
Nothing seems more important, yet nothing

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:41.980
seems more beyond our grasp, until we
begin to think about wisdom before we think

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:48.539
we need it. So I wanted to read
this as an example of -- of the kind of decision

00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:52.900
making we sometimes make
without being aware of it. Umm, we're not

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.940
 -- uh we're unconscious of the
process, uh, and there's been a lot of neuroscience

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.100
in the last ten or 15 years
that's made clear that the emotional part

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.649
of our brain is kind of telling us
sometimes things to do and counseling our

00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:09.380
actions at a level that we're not even
conscious of until later. Umm, I would say

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:14.080
that that counsil is not always wise
which is what makes it kind of tricky and

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.240
interesting but none the less it's an
input to behavior and thought that I think

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:25.779
is much more appreciated now than it
used to be. Umm, and it's also kind of a reminder

00:27:25.779 --> 00:27:30.230
that we're always struggling
to be wise and to do the right thing. But

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.820
what's exactly going on inside our
brains when we're doing there and is there

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.440
any reason to think we might possibly
become wiser if we understand the neural underpinnings

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.480
of wisdom? So I set out
to see if I could attach any serious science,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.880
uh, to if not wisdom itself to
these qualities or traits that seemed important

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:57.299
to the idea of wisdom as I was
conducting this research. And the -- my approach

00:27:57.299 --> 00:28:01.279
was the following. Umm, as
many of you probably know, the great power

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:06.749
of modern science is something called
"reductionism." You basically take a big biological

00:28:06.749 --> 00:28:10.259
idea, for example, like
heredity, and then you break it down into

00:28:10.259 --> 00:28:15.539
some component part which is then you
can approach experiment tally and design experiments

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:21.269
about and hopefully get
some answers to. Umm, in a more metaphoric

00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:26.509
sense, uh, I took the same
reductionist approach to wisdom. The idea

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:32.080
itself is huge again and it doesn't
lend itself to easy description but I asked

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.670
myself, are there some common
elements in the definitions of wisdom that

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:42.269
might be reducible and is there any
real science to these elements? I should say

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:46.159
that when I started out doing this
I was hard pressed to find a single scientist

00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:50.539
who would say she or he was
working on the neuroscience of wisdom and

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:54.340
for very good reason. Umm, people
wouldn't think you were a very good scientist

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.029
if you attempted to measure a
process that you could not even define. So

00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:05.909
it was not an active interest of any
neuroscientist I talked to at the time. However,

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:09.701
when you break wisdom down
into some of its component parts, when you

00:29:09.701 --> 00:29:14.850
reduce it, which I did by kinda
following the lead of the psychologists, I

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.489
realized that there was a lot of
interesting research and I kind of organized

00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:22.730
it for the purposes of the book and
somewhat arbitrarily into what I call the

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.989
"eight pillars of wisdom", kind of
building off the classic seven pillars of

00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:33.529
wisdom from the Bible. What exactly
are these? I'll run through them briefly and

00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:38.730
talk about them a little bit more
in more detail. Uh, emotion relation by which

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:44.929
is meant, umm, an ability to
respond to adversity, to negative events,

00:29:44.929 --> 00:29:49.740
negative emotion and kinda reset your
emotional thermostat that you don't get sort

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.440
of bogged down in the negativity.
It's a way to respond -- it's basically a

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.830
coping mechanician in terms of your
emotional life and how you respond to things.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:01.179
Decision making and all of the
things that go into decision making including

00:30:01.179 --> 00:30:04.950
gathering knowledge, knowing what
knowledge to include in your decision, what

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:11.340
to -- not to include, how you gather
it, where you go to get it, where it accumulates

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:16.919
through the lifetime
experiences that we all have. Compassion,

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:22.750
by which is meant not simply feeling
for another person but taken almost to the

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.320
level of kind of mind reading where
you actually inhabit and understand another

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.830
person's point of view in order to
both understand what they're feeling, where

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:35.489
they're coming from, and how that
can inform a decision. Moral judgment and

00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:40.059
reasoning, working through problems
that all of us encounter in a number of different

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:44.000
settings where we have to make
choices that are difficult precisely there

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.539
are good reasons to do either one.
Umm, patience by which is meant, uh, how do

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:54.369
we overcome the sort of impulse of
impatience when it doesn't serve us well?

00:30:54.369 --> 00:30:59.259
How do we forestall immediate
gratification in order to achieve a larger,

00:30:59.259 --> 00:31:07.641
if more distant, goal in time in
humility by which is not -- which is meant

00:31:07.641 --> 00:31:14.960
not simply being humble but accepting
limitation as part of one's, uh, apparatus

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.700
that you don't -- will not have the
answers to everything, you will not be able

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.549
to find the answers to everything,
that sometimes you have to make decisions

00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:26.230
without adequate information and also
I think there's a -- there's a component of

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.730
humility in making one's self
available to new sources or forms of information

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.519
that maybe did not conform to
what you expected or hoped so that it's an

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:40.509
openness to alternative forms of
knowledge that might be helpful ultimately.

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:45.850
Umm, altruism, a really important
component of what's now considered social

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:52.740
neural science. Actually, this idea
of sacrificing personal, uh, interest in the

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:58.100
greater interest and goals of an
group. Uh, sacrificing what you would want

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.529
in order to promote the goals of
this larger group whether it's a family, or

00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:06.649
again, a company, whatever the group
happens to be. In this really important ability

00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:10.429
to cope with uncertainty in
change, how do we -- you know, the world is

00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:15.110
not static. The environment is not
static. It changes all the time. How do we

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:20.210
get upset by change or how do we
adapt to it? I hope you can se that each one

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.659
of these traits is not an island
virtue onto itself but rather that they feed

00:32:25.659 --> 00:32:30.429
into and resonate with each other
so that being emotionally even-keeled effects

00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:34.370
the kinds of decisions that you
make and compassion is not really feeling

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:38.429
for someone else, as I said, but
somehow inhabiting and understanding the point

00:32:38.429 --> 00:32:42.679
of view of another person which,
again, in turn -- informs your decisions and

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:46.779
the decisions you take. So I set
out to see if I could find my interesting

00:32:46.779 --> 00:32:50.950
brain science attached to these
components of wisdom and to see if the researchers

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.070
were willing to talk about
wisdom which, in some cases, surprisingly

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:59.340
they were. But I'll give you of many
examples of these neural pillars of wisdom

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.779
if you'll indulge another passage,
uh, from the -- from the book. In part I heard

00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:07.780
from someone in -- at Google was
encouraging compassion meditation so it was

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:15.720
one of the reasons I wanted to, uh,
to read this. Umm, uh, let me -- I -- give

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.909
you a little brief introduction to
this passage. So one of the fundamental corner

00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:26.059
stones of wisdom has always been
compassion and it's -- it's a central concept

00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:32.409
that runs through Confusionism,
Buddhism, Judaic Christian tradition, umm,

00:33:32.409 --> 00:33:38.090
the particle physicist Victor
Weisskopf famously once said, "Knowledge without

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:42.710
compassion is inhuman.
Compassion without knowledge is ineffective."

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.779
That's kind of an epigrammatic
intersection of compassion and science but

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:52.200
also a real intersection of
compassion and science. Umm, for more than

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.970
a decade, Richard Davidson, who's a
neuroscientists at the University of Wisconsin

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.640
has been flying in Buddhist monks
to Madison to do brain experiments. He measures

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.369
electrical activity in the
brain while they meditate or lie in an MRI

00:34:04.369 --> 00:34:08.899
machine. Matthieu Ricard is a
French-born Buddhist monk who has participated

00:34:08.899 --> 00:34:12.100
in a half dozen of these
experiments, uh, on compassion over the last

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.890
decade and I'd like to describe
just a bit of his visit, uh, on within of

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:24.360
these occasions. So at exactly 8:48
on an unseasonably brisk, overcast June morning

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.570
in Madison and with the hint of
rain in the air, Matthiue Ricard climbed out

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:33.800
of a Subaru Outback station wagon
driven by his friend Richard J Davidson license

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:39.050
plate "emote" adjusted his
saffron and purple robes over bare arms and

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.650
then sauntered into the Waisman
Center of Neuroscience for an arduous day

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:49.180
of meditation. Over the previous few
days, Ricard, a French-born Buddhist monk

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:53.910
who lives in a monastery in Katmandu,
had flown from New Delhi to Newark, led a

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:58.540
meditation workshop for financiers
from a Manhattan stock brokerage firm at the

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.950
Harvard Club, discussed a new book
project, and then traveled to Wisconsin, where

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:07.290
he has participated in
experiments since the year 2000. As he walked

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:11.370
down a long corridor, he paused
to hug old friends (he has come to Madison

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:15.770
half a dozen times for these
experiments) and greet people he'd never met

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:20.940
before, including a bemused
maintenance worker holding a paintbrush. Within

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.900
a few minutes he had slipped
out of his Top-Siders and settled his 62-year-old

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:30.000
frame onto a green pillow on
the floor of a small, dark, nominally soundproofed

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.600
booth. Then scientists
attached a hair net of a hundred and twenty-eight

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:40.790
electroencephalograph (EEG)
electrodes to his shaven skull. Each electrode

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:46.140
would measure electrical
activity in this Buddhist's brain as it meditated,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.650
capturing any changes in
milliseconds while nearby computer monitors

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:55.010
would provide a running display of
the readings. (Neuroscientists prefer EEG

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:58.860
to MRI in certain situations or
certain situations -- or certain experiments

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.890
because the technique captures
instantaneous changes better than MRI.) C'est

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:08.470
bien, Matthieu? asked Antoine
Lutz, the French-born scientist leading the

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:13.910
experiment. Okay, Ricard replied.
With that, heavy door was closed, and the

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:19.490
experiment began. We have found a
correlation between a deep state of meditation

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:24.620
and change in the EEG activity of
the brain, explained Lutz, who published his

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.840
first monk data in a 2004 article
in the "Proceedings of the National Academy

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.680
Sciences", a leading international
journal. That study reported that expert meditators

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.170
who generated a state of
quote, unconditional loving-kindness and compassion,

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:42.560
end quote, (uh, which I
like to point out is a phrase that you do

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.140
not normally encounter in the
scientific literature. Uh, you now see it

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.670
in places like science and nature --
umm, uh, expert meditators who generated a

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:56.510
state of quote unconditional loving
kindness and compassion produced accompanying

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:02.420
changes in the brain, especially
something called gamma-band oscillations -- gamma-band

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:07.140
oscillations, about which
more in a moment. Now they are gathering more

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.610
data and asking expert meditators
like Ricard to estimate the intensity of their

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:19.930
mental states on a scale of one
to nine as their brain waves are being recorded.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:24.060
Nearly an hour into the
experiment after segments devoted to the "focused

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:29.051
attention" and "open presence"
meditation, the voice of researcher Andy Francis

00:37:29.051 --> 00:37:33.740
was piped into the little room.
"The next one will be compassion," he said.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.260
According to the experimental plan,
Ricard would spend the next minute in "neutral"

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.280
not meditating at all to provide
a baseline brain activity. After a pause of

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.510
exactly 60 seconds, Francis leaned
toward his microphone and said in a flat,

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:54.020
neutral voice, "Compassion.
Compassion." At a scientific seminar in New

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.610
York several months earlier, Richie
Davidson had made the point that expert meditators

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:03.290
could turn it on like that
(which he indicated by snapping his fingers)

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:07.250
and although Ricard's compassion
meditation was not as instantaneous as snapped

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:12.330
fingers, it would probably strike
most people as impressively quick. After 15

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:16.690
seconds, he rated his meditative
state at two. By thirty seconds, he was up

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:21.660
to three. By 39 seconds he was up
to four. He reached five at the one-minute

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.500
mark and achieved a lofty seven at
two minutes. These are self-reported ratings,

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.640
of course, and deserving every
bit of skepticism that self-reports inevitably

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:37.560
invite. But since dedicating his
life to the practice of Buddhism in 1972 (literally

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:42.070
the day after he received a
Ph.D. in molecular biology in the Paris laboratory

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:46.640
of Nobel Laureate François
Jacob, Ricard has logged well over 10,000

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.820
hours of meditation and I couldn't
avoid the sense that I was watching a powerful

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:56.080
neural engine power up, roar, and
accelerate, like a race car, cognitively going

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:01.790
from zero to 60 in the figurative
snap of a finger. As Ricard's meditative state

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:06.710
deepened, the EEG readings
scrawling across Andy Francis' computer screen

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.580
visibly changed. At the
beginning, they had been a series of thin,

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:15.910
disorganized lines, the
electrophysiological equivalent of lank, unkempt

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.430
hair. By the time Ricard
reached a self-assessed eight, about seven

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:24.980
minutes into his compassion
meditation, the EEG readings had an intensity

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:30.330
of amplitude looking like bushy
eyebrows and an overall coherence and synchronicity

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:35.180
that were apparent, even to
my novice eye. "With a few practitioners,"

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:39.650
Francis explained, "you can see
change in the raw data in real time as they

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:44.520
meditate but that's very rare." At
the risk of sounding credulous (if not downright

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.910
corny), the electrical activity
measured by dozens of electrodes plastered

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:54.360
all over Ricard's noggin seemed in
remarkable harmony. Then the muffled sound

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.890
of a toilet flushing in a nearby
bathroom could be heard, and whether this

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:04.400
perturbed Ricard's meditative state or
not, his subjective ratings began to drop.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.630
Later on in his office, Davidson
agreed that the coherence and synchrony of

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:13.720
these brain waves was so striking
that it is obvious even to nonexperts. "It

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.950
doesn't require any fancy computer
interpretation," he said. "I can actually

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:22.090
see it with the naked eye, so it's
pronounced." His current thinking (pure conjecture

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.880
at this point he conceded)
is that pattern of the brain activity observed

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.710
during meditation, known as
"gamma oscillation," might be a way for monks

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:35.510
to coordinate activity in
multiple parts of the brain while experiencing

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.090
intense compassion. "What is
striking about the gamma," Davidson said,

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:44.810
"is the synchrony across brain regions
that we see." From their own descriptions,

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:50.960
it's kind of a panoramic awareness
that's fused with compassion. But the elements

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.970
of the panoramic awareness
suggest that there are many different systems

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.690
in the brain that become
functionally integrated, which may be a neural

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.830
correlate of this experience of a
panoramic or vast awareness. A study by the

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.550
Wisconsin group, published in 2008
in the journal "Public Library of Science

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:12.890
One," reported that fMRI studies of
monks, and also novices, who followed a two-week

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:17.880
program of compassion
meditation written by Ricard -- showed increased

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:22.160
activity during compassion
meditation in several distinct parts of the

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:27.440
brain. Ricard emerged from the
chamber in Madison looking fresh and energetic

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.630
after the morning's experiments.
"You have to come to a lab to do meditation

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:38.430
these days," he said with a chuckle,
wiping his face with a towel. Umm, to kind

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:43.740
of wrap up and cut to the chase.
Umm, each of the middle chapters of the book

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.720
talks about one or another of these
neural properties associated with wisdom,

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.130
umm, and just to summarize very
quickly, there is a neuroscience of moral

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:57.840
judgment, there is a neural science of
emotion regulation, there is a neuroscience

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.490
of altruism now, there is a
neuroscience of decision making including

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:07.230
decisions in the face of uncertainty
and there is a neural science of delayed gratification.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.280
And to cut even further
to the chase, when I started out pursuing

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:16.120
this hypothesis and began this become
back in 2007 there was no neuroscience of

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.760
wisdom. A month after I turned in a
draft of the book, uh, a review article appeared

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.640
in the journal "Archives of
General Psychology" which is a peer-review

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:29.190
journal, uh, and the title of that
article was "A Neural Biology of Wisdom."

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:34.030
Umm, it's not mainstream science at
this point but it's part of a conversation

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:39.830
that it was not part of, uh, even,
uh, two years ago. Umm, so at this point I'd

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.080
like to take any questions you
might have and, uh --

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:50.370
Host: Yeah. We'll take questions into the
microphone but first let's give

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.440
Steven a round of applause.
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.440
Stephen: Thank you very much.
Host: And, uh, if we do run out of time I'm

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.390
sure he'll be hanging out a little
afterwards to talk more or sign books if necessary.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:00.060
So, again, use the mic if
you have a question. I'll start it out. Umm,

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:05.310
you know, wisdom, much like
consciousness in the mind for, you know, millennia

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.300
has been considered kind of
separate from the biological processes and

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.280
I know neural sciences, neural
biology really want to stitch those two strongly

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:19.150
together and remove any kind of
intangible higher mind. Did you -- were any

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.690
of those, uh, preconceived notions
you might have had broken or re-enforced or

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:25.480
just changed as you started to study
this? Did you actually believe in a distinct

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.630
mind before or do you more or less
now?

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.020
Stephen: I'm, uh, it's a synergistic question.
I guess I have two answers. As

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:36.410
the humanist my answer is, I think wisdom
is too big to, uh -- you know, for

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:39.580
science to entirely wrap its arms around.
As someone who's written about

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:45.420
science for 30 years, I've constantly been
surprised at how a reductive and

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:50.670
molecular nuts and bolt -- nuts and bolts
approach to issues has really changed

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:56.830
our thinking about how things work and how
even the mind functions. So, umm,

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:01.110
uh, I guess ill have an agnostic response
in the sense that a part of me thinks

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:06.000
this could be impossible ultimately to explain
everything about wisdom. I've

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.600
been constantly surprised by the ability of
science to explain things and I

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.680
think, uh, neuroscience, again, is a field
of the beginning of the story, not at

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.450
the end. Umm.
&gt;&gt; [Pause]

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:26.640
&gt;&gt; Umm, thanks very much for the talk. By
one of the things I thought of right

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.280
away was that, umm, the eight pillars seemed
to talk mostly about the abilities

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.380
to process information and things like that.
What about just the amount of

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.200
information? So kind of the size of the data
base for someone who is wise;

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.100
right?
Stephen: Uh-huh. Uh, I think one way you can

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.210
think about that is that as long
as your memory is functioning well, you're

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:50.300
building up a data base of lifetime
experience which is telling you, for example,

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:55.150
things about human nature as well
as a sort of, uh, factual knowledge base,

00:44:55.150 --> 00:45:01.850
uh, and as long as you have the
ability to re-call that degree of information

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.480
in situation -- it's very
situational. One of the things about wisdom

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.550
that's interesting is that, uh,
what's a wise decision in one situation or

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:12.710
context will be foolish in another
because it needs -- it's very con textural,

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:17.660
umm, which is why it doesn't -- I
don't think it kind of fits any kind of algorithmic,

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:22.410
uh, notion of arriving at a
right decision. It really depends, uh, on

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.880
the context and the environment. And
when you think about this from a biological

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:31.750
point of view, umm, our environment
is never static and so, umm, it's a good idea

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:36.880
to design a brain that was very
flexible and adaptive to change because that's

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.160
the environment that we all live
in and that in fact all biological creatures

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:45.470
live in, uh, and this is such a
powerful instrument. I -- I think wisdom is

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:52.100
kind of, in part, being adaptive
and discerning enough to see when a situation

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.540
is changing or about to change and
then being adaptive to what that change means

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:02.400
and how you respond to it. So our
brains are -- are not built, umm, necessarily

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.150
for habit. Umm, there's been some
interesting experiments. You know, habit,

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.450
obviously is when you have the right
solution to the same problem that always comes

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.950
up. You do it quicker and more
efficiently but when the situation changes,

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:18.270
habit is engrained to the point
where people -- animals at least in experiments

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:23.860
that have a habitual response to
something have a harder time finding a different

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:28.050
solution. So you get ingrained
by habit and that actually impedes your ability

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:31.890
to find alternative solutions.
Neurologically, in animals, with a certain

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:38.359
set of experiments.
&gt;&gt; [Pause]

00:46:38.359 --> 00:46:41.440
&gt;&gt; You -- you actually pretty early on in
the book up couple wisdom from

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.320
intelligence which I think that question was
kind of hinting at. How many backs

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.970
and how many things do you know is very different
from wisdom and -- and you

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:54.540
place wisdom within fairly easy reach of,
umm, of the color person. I mean,

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.820
[inaudible] you were talking about just give
us time most of us will be wiser

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:04.130
even if we're not wise when we're old, umm,
and some people, you know, are wise

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:08.370
beyond their years what have you but it didn't
 -- it certainly didn't take away

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:12.240
any sort of elitist connotations when you
think about somebody who's very

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.100
intelligent and you kind of put wisdom kind
of at the back and it was almost

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.140
describing sort of a folksy sort of wisdom
which I don't necessarily agree with

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:23.700
the things that neuroscientists or that you
had laid out as, like, sure, those

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.040
are necessary but not sufficient.
Stephen: Mm hmm.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.220
&gt;&gt; Umm, but, you know, could you talk about
what influenced that approach and

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:33.720
if there was kind of a sort of a populous
feel about it intentionally or if you

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.910
just really wanted to throw it out there?
Stephen: I wouldn't call it populous but I

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:43.040
would say -- I would frame it this
way. Umm, so much of intelligence is related

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.490
to cog -- it has traditionally
been related to cognition, obviously, so sort

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:52.430
of the cognitive part of
neuroscience has been focused on intelligence.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:56.870
The whole, umm, aspect of
emotional intelligence has really been something

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.700
I'd say within the last 20
years or so, umm, this idea that there's other

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:05.250
inputs, other forms of knowledge
and so forth. Umm, I think a lot of that has

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:10.930
to do with negotiating the sort of
everyday dilemmas that people encounter and

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.680
I think when people think about
wisdom or even Solomonic wisdom, the classic

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:20.860
 -- the local story of Solomon, it's
resolving this very immediate dilemma in a

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:26.650
very particular situation, how do you
do it? Umm, and so I think this emotional

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:30.860
intelligence, this idea of emotional
intelligence, uh, this attentiveness to what

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.280
emotion is doing in terms of
decision making and gathering information

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.960
and so on is part of, uh, I think what
your you're talking about is something that

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:44.470
everybody -- it doesn't require book
learning. It's more a -- a -- a learning kind

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:48.231
of -- again, the control of this
emotional thermostat in a way which I think

00:48:48.231 --> 00:48:52.970
can be controlled with -- with, uh,
with use. I mean, the -- the -- the -- the

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:58.020
big, umm, take home message from
neuroscience in the last ten or 15 years is

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.630
this notion of plasticity, that
things change, umm, the brain changes on the

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:07.710
basis of experience or what you do,
uh, and even how you exert yourself and these,

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.340
uh, meditation experiments are
important because it shows that the brain

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:15.390
is changing when you're doing this
repetitive mental exercise or making this

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:20.740
mental exertion. Umm, I think what
that suggests is that even at the level of

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:26.570
this emotional content that this can
be, umm, uh, at least modulated. I think we

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:31.140
can learn to, you know, deal with
it at a certain level, modulate it, reduce

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:36.970
the -- the impact of negative, uh,
events or adversity through this kind of concentrated

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:41.030
practice and I really
think of it as, you know, if the 20 century

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:45.980
 -- 20th century was a lot about
physical exertion and maintaining muscle tone

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.531
in terms of deeming ourselves fit,
I think the 21st century is going to be about

00:49:49.531 --> 00:49:54.200
maintaining our mental tone by
mental exertion and really training our brains

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.170
in terms of dealing with some of
these things. We're not there yet, I would

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.211
hasten to add, clearly, but I think
it's really important.

00:50:01.211 --> 00:50:04.270
Host: Well, since we are just about out of
time, I will finish with one last

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:09.460
question unless someone else has one they
wanna toss out there. Umm, so it's

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.610
kind of a cap -- again, you can always catch
Steven after the talk. So to cap

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:16.980
it all off, it actually makes -- you make
it sound as if, umm, you know, again,

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:21.640
wisdom -- the traits of wisdom could at least
if not be learned you can frame

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.420
them in your mind in such a way so it'd kind
of work faster towards that un

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.820
attainable goal of absolute wisdom --
Stephen: Mm hmm.

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:31.150
Host: -- and put yourself a little farther
down the road, little earlier on in

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:33.980
your life. Uh, is that a correct interpretation
that you actually could learn

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.110
certain aspects of wisdom or train your body
to -- to be ready for it in and if

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:41.260
so, any quick tips before you go?
Stephen: [Laughing]

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:46.090
Stephen: I'm always forced into say I don't
write self-help books. So I'm very

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:49.770
wary of making prescriptions. Uh, I think
one of the things you're eluding to

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:54.830
there's a discussion with this whole issue
of emotional, um, regulation, where

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:58.970
does that come from, where does it originate
and I talk about some

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:04.180
experimentation in the book that suggests
that maybe an early moderate exposure

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:10.620
to adversity or stress acts as a form of -- of
vaccination or inoculation where

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:14.940
it seems to enable, at least in animal experiments,
it seems to enable these

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:20.940
animals to deal -- deal with frustration and
difficult circumstances later on

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:26.970
indeed and enhance their problem solving abilities
in these very specific tasks

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:31.470
that they use in these experiments. Umm, I'm
certainly not suggesting that

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:36.540
children should be deliberately placed in
adverse circumstances as a way of

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:40.440
tuning this tissue but I think it's something
to be mindful of. There's a --

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.060
there's a history, umm, in terms of the major
figures of both philosophy and

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:52.990
religion, uh, of, umm, early life adversity
and people like Aristotle had a

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:57.880
speech impediment, was orphaned; Mosas had
a speech impediments; umm, the

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.260
Buddha, at least to some accounts, lost his
mother when he was seven days old;

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:08.150
umm, and through a number of other, uh, schools
of philosophy, Confucius lost

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:12.840
his mother -- or father when he was three;
Abraham Lincoln lost his mother when

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:17.230
he was nine. In other words, these are -- and
a number of founders of

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:21.000
philosophy were raised in what we would call
single-parent homes now. So

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.910
there's this kind of thread of an early life
adversity that may, uh, contribute

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:31.780
to this. I don't think we know enough to really
arrive at any kind of

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:37.140
prescription for it. Having said that, the
 -- the most interesting exercise

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:41.360
that I got out of this whole thing was the
more I thought about and wrote about

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.010
wisdom, the more I just started asking myself,
what would be the wise thing to

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:49.430
do here when any kinda problem came up. And
as a kind of, you know, it's really

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:55.070
kind of an armchair mantra or amateur mantra
but by asking myself that question,

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.660
by stopping myself long enough to -- to ask
the question and begin to think of

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:03.610
what the possible answers might be I found
that I really useful exercise that I

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:06.680
think everyone could benefit from.
&gt;&gt; [Pause]

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.490
Stephen: And you don't need a prescription.
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:12.610
Host: Well, once again, thanks Steven so much
for stopping by the San Francisco

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:14.530
office. One more round of applause for Steven
hall.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:15.589
Stephen: Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
