00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.810
- Hey, everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.610
It's Mark Wiens, I'm
in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.480
Today, I'm with the Best
of Sri Lanka Food Tour

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.330
with David, The Hungry
Tourist, and it's gonna be kind

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.690
of a mixed day.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.690
We are starting off for lunch,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.210
an authentic Sri Lankan lunch,
then we're gonna have tea,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.020
and then tonight for
dinner, we are gonna go

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.170
to one of the most iconic
crab restaurants in Colombo,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.052
in Sri Lanka to eat Sri Lankan crabs.

00:00:23.052 --> 00:00:25.060
But we just arrived for lunch.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.893
Let's go eat.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:28.359
(lively music)

00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:34.331
- This place is amazing.

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:38.630
There's like 50 or 60 different curries,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.770
and all on banana leaf.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.310
You eat with your hands.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.460
It's just super amazing.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.293
You have a grill.

00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:46.880
You have, like, cold stuff, hot stuff.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.740
- Hi, Mark!
- Hello!

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.573
- Hello, hello!

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.370
We got into the restaurant.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.870
They even have a grill going in here.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.110
You can smell the smokiness.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.730
They have, like, kind
of a palm branch roof.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.540
All buffet style, except, I
mean, it's not all-you-can-eat,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.910
but you get a plate, you
choose which dishes you want.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.450
Maybe, there's like 50 dishes.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.800
You can just see the clay
pots going down the table.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.130
So, there's quite a long line,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.210
so we're just waiting in line.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.060
We're gonna get rice,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.640
we're gonna choose our
different dishes, and eat.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.720
This is where it gets really tough

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.180
because you actually have
to make some decisions,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.440
or can we get a little bit of everything.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.958
I don't even think that's
possible to fit on a plate.

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.541
(lively music)

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.426
This one.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:35.797
(indistinct chattering)

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:36.630
Yeah, this one.

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:40.170
I think that's good.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.550
Yes, thank you.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.440
Okay, so I go this side?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.350
Oh, the fried section.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.290
My plate is almost full

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.140
but then you move over to this section.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.493
I think this is the fried.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.150
Oh, this is the fried section, right?

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.332
- Deviled sausage, deviled
pork, deviled fish,

00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:57.440
cuttlefish, prawns, and
fried also, snake fish.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.553
- [Mark] Let's have this one please.

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:03.199
- Your barbecue.

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:04.850
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.683
That's huge.

00:02:05.683 --> 00:02:07.510
Yeah, this food really adds up.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.940
This like basket is...

00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:13.190
Oh, that entire basket
is just filled with food.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.460
They put a lotus leaf plate down

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.540
before they put all your food down.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.992
There's rice on the bottom,
looks and smells incredible.

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:21.740
Just going to go in for
whatever's right on the top here,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.973
some of this green vegetable
and some of the rice.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.113
- [Mark] It's like an herb
salad with coconut in it.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.300
Okay, okay, I think this
one is some of the brinjal,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.460
which is eggplant.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.010
Again I'm going to mix that in.

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:45.600
The brinjal, the eggplant is amazing.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.090
It's sweet and sour and
like caramelized tasting.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.390
But and again it sort of
like melts in your mouth

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.223
at the same time.

00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:53.200
Chicken curry, I believe.

00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:57.850
Mm, a little bit of a sour oniony taste.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.533
I'm going to chase that with a chili.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.790
Oh, nice.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.010
You can eat the entire stem and all

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.310
because they're deep fried chilies.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.143
This one is the shrimp curry.

00:03:07.143 --> 00:03:08.330
And typically when they
make the shrimp curry,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.700
you can actually almost eat the shell

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.550
because it's been stewed for so long.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.860
I really like mixing the
rice with that herb salad.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.693
Into this bite.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.126
(upbeat lively music)

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:29.271
Oh wow, nice little light lunch there.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.950
I feel like there's like
two kilos of Sri Lankan food

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.380
in my stomach right now
which is probably true.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.860
It's fun to choose, it's fun to eat.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.860
It's just a great like relaxed
place to try Sri Lankan food.

00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:46.445
Oh, and nothing better to
drink after a meal like that,

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:48.483
than a Sri Lankan king coconut.

00:03:50.282 --> 00:03:51.710
Mm, mm, mm.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.550
After a meal like that,
with the amount of sweat

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.090
that you've exerted, and the
energy you put out to eat,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.990
you need to replace your electrolytes.

00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:02.223
Yeah, that tastes really good.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.990
It is a lot harder to
walk out of the restaurant

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.890
than it was to walk in the restaurant.

00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:12.030
(upbeat music)

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.080
- [Mark] Micah, jump.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.240
Gonna be honest with you, I'm
not totally sure where we are

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.910
but I think we're here to drink some tea

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.263
and maybe buy some tea.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.293
Everybody stepped in here.

00:04:25.697 --> 00:04:26.530
- Good afternoon.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.750
- [Mark] Hello, good
afternoon, good afternoon,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.970
nice to meet you, thank you, thank you.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.790
This is actually a Dilmah tea shop,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.871
and Dilmah is one of the
big brands of ceylon tea.

00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:36.870
They have the shop here
where you can order tea,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.170
but then I think you can also buy the tea

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.572
on the other side possibly.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:42.380
Thank you very much.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.334
- Rose with french vanilla,
it's a flavored black tea

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:45.187
with pineapple.

00:04:45.187 --> 00:04:46.104
- Ah, cool.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:51.028
Whoa, that is like a pineapple shake.

00:04:56.464 --> 00:04:59.700
So we gotta wait for the
yellow sand to filter down,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.600
and then the tea will
be finished steeping.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.550
- I'm going to need a magnifying glass.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.327
- I'm flipping mine, I think it's good.

00:05:08.327 --> 00:05:09.560
- [Mark] I'm gonna wait another 30.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.205
- Yeah, you wait another 30.

00:05:11.205 --> 00:05:14.433
And now I guess I crack
this? Is that right?

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.253
- You gotta flip the tea over,

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.863
take off the lid or the little top.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.140
And I love these cups,
the double walled glass.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.720
It is a white tea, it smells very fruity,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.803
almost like peachy.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.890
And it is very light.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.969
Very light, very like a chill chilled tea.

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.636
(glasses clink)

00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:47.100
A really relaxing tea indeed.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.790
And I'm enjoying this, we're
all enjoying this lounge.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.673
This tea lounge.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.700
Okay, next drink, I got a matcha.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.330
Oh, and it's a cold one.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.163
I thought it was going to be hot.

00:05:57.163 --> 00:05:59.300
- [Man] It looks like
a shot of wheatgrass.

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:03.290
Oh wow, that's not just matcha.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.490
That's like lime too,
oh wow, that's awesome.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.580
Tastes like a straight
lime juice matcha infusion.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.211
Ying, that's awesome.

00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:16.080
It's not matcha like you think.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.713
It's like lime juice.

00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:20.546
(everyone laughs)

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:26.469
(upbeat music)

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.300
For dinner tonight we are going to,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.780
it's one of the most iconic
crab restaurants in Colombo.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.225
Ministry of crab.

00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:44.808
(upbeat music)

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.300
You may have half kilo, small,
medium, large, XL, kilo crab,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.017
jumbo colossal, the OMG and the crabzilla.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.813
Thank you.

00:06:59.813 --> 00:07:01.930
Gonna put on the head nets, hair nets

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.483
to go inside the kitchen and
see some of the crabs cooking.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.630
Nice one.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.423
- Yeah, oh yeah.

00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:12.430
- Oh Sinan really needs one.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.555
- Oh.

00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:16.852
(Mark laughs)

00:07:16.852 --> 00:07:19.558
- I really need one, so much hair.

00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:20.470
(everyone laughs)

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.900
- Not only do they have crab here

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.850
but massive river prawns as well.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.730
- One more.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.339
- [Mark] That thing is massive.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.710
(wok sizzling)

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.411
Which dish are you making now?

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:33.490
- The garlic crab.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.240
(flames roaring)

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.870
- Then he's just like
carefully controlling the heat,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.460
so that it bubbles, so that it steams,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.380
so that it cooks evenly and
perfectly throughout the crab.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.070
They have an unique style
of plating the crab,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.610
with the shell on the bottom,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.240
and the two claws in the front.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.210
And then the legs and the other like limbs

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.520
like sprouting out of the main shell.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.560
And then pour on that
juice, with the garlic

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.100
and the sauce all over it
and that smells incredible.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.150
And it goes straight to
your table piping hot,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.113
boiling, still boiling away on your plate.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.360
Okay, a couple of things.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.530
Number one is that the Ministry
of crab, the restaurant,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.850
it's within the old Dutch hospital.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.090
So it has a colonial feel to it.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.570
The walls of the building
are really thick,

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.090
and then you have the
windows, you have the breeze,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.430
the air coming through.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.270
And Ministry of crab is a restaurant

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.330
on Asia's 50 best restaurants list.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.506
So it's one of the top
restaurants in Asia,

00:08:56.506 --> 00:08:59.940
known for their crab but
they also have river prawns.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.720
Unfortunately it's not
season for the crabzilla,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.250
massive crabs.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.870
But we got the next step, next step below,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.000
the OMG crabs.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.792
We got 15 of them.

00:09:09.792 --> 00:09:12.459
(woks sizzling)

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.000
Before we start on the crabs,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.310
we are going to have the
clams and the river prawns

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.429
and it's amazing to see all
of the woks going at once,

00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:27.590
frying on the woks, the steam rising.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.910
The aromatherapy is just insane.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.850
The garlic, the amount of
garlic, the amount of butter.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.500
The fumes, the steam.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.973
- I love clams.

00:09:40.027 --> 00:09:41.490
- [Waiter] There's two more oyster shots.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.610
- We're starting off with oyster shots.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.280
Okay, I actually totally
forgot I had the hair net on.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.373
Okay, oyster shots.

00:09:49.738 --> 00:09:52.203
Whoa, that just slid out of the toothpick.

00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:55.149
Mm.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.003
Dripping the juices.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.331
Oh yeah, that's just like a
butter, butter creamy sensation.

00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:07.383
That does taste good, really good.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.010
- Thank you, thank you very much.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.120
What is your name?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.080
- Osana.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.913
- Osana, okay.

00:10:14.913 --> 00:10:16.870
He's offering to put my bib on.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.523
It's an offer I can't resist.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.253
Keep calm and crab on.

00:10:23.114 --> 00:10:25.070
Thank you very much, thank you very much.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.850
Okay cool, so the next course has arrived.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.750
These are the river
shrimp, which they fried

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.320
in like an immense amount
of butter and garlic.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.173
The key to eating river shrimp
is to lift up the helmet.

00:10:36.393 --> 00:10:37.380
Oh, it's so hot.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.343
Yeah, whoa.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.220
Oh, look at that, oh, look
at that tomalley in there.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.690
It's like a little puddle.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.780
It's like a melted puddle of butter.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.140
You gotta look into the
interiors of that head.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.660
It's like sloshing around,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.040
it's like sloshing around in there.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.810
I'm going to start with the
body, looks it's just dripping

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.770
with oily juices, in fact I'm
going to redip it actually.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.730
Redip in the butter juices.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.563
Okay.

00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:08.260
Mm, oh wow, yeah, that is stunning.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.573
Garlicky, buttery.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.270
How was that, Dudi?

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.040
- Crazy, you gotta give it to this place.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.973
We had some amazing crabs this week.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.260
But they have their act together.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.997
- It's like a, it's such
a well functioning system.

00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:26.830
- Yeah.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.663
- The way they have it down.

00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:29.113
- And the product is amazing.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.150
- What is your name?

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.983
- I'm Brava.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.250
- [Mark] Thank you for holding the light.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.250
- Yeah.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.210
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.360
I'm going to rehydrate.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.593
Oh, yes.

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:47.957
It's so fat, it's so meaty, it's so plump.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.523
- All right, freedom of speech.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.810
Freedom.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.760
Oo, oo.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.927
(upbeat lively music)

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.982
(wok sizzling)

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:26.983
- Round of applause.

00:12:26.983 --> 00:12:27.816
Give them a round of applause.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.606
Amazing chefs.

00:12:30.606 --> 00:12:33.708
And just all of them working together.

00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:36.300
All of the woks are going at full blast.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.760
- Teamwork. Teamwork.
- Beautiful.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.613
- This is how you win the superbowl guys.

00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.132
- It's a beautiful thing,
it is a beautiful thing.

00:12:43.132 --> 00:12:45.882
(plates clatter)

00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:02.847
- [David] Oh, get the juice.

00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:04.023
Get the juice.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.530
- And it is impressive to
see them as they plate that,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.860
they actually put down
a little scoop of rice.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.480
That's only to hold the
crab shell in place,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.100
so they can create the formation.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.721
But it's impressive,
it's almost like a sport.

00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:19.640
The way they compete.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.570
As soon as that crab
comes off of the fire,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.723
it comes onto the counter top, literally,

00:13:24.723 --> 00:13:27.898
within milliseconds, they
jump into that pan of crab.

00:13:27.898 --> 00:13:30.870
They start formulating, they
put the shell down first,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.970
the head top shell.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.330
Finally, they dump on the sauce,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.230
the remaining juices at
the bottom of the wok.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.390
But that initial pounce,
that initial reaction,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.910
the reflexes are incredible

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.560
as soon as it comes off the fire.

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:47.389
(upbeat lively music)

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.732
Oh, I think I'm done with the hair net.

00:13:56.732 --> 00:13:58.290
- Rocking the baby.
- Rocking the baby.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.670
There's like five different
versions of crab you can get,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.970
I went with the black pepper.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.973
And again this formation,
the claws in the front.

00:14:05.935 --> 00:14:06.768
What shall we begin with?

00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:08.570
I think I'll start with the claws,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.810
because there's two of them.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.350
Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get some

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.440
of that pepper sauce all over the shell.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.460
Let it seep into the shell.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.450
Slide this out.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.530
Oh yes, it comes out.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.770
Sure, thank you very much.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.320
Okay, and I think actually
the thing to do is rebuild.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.193
Rebuild the claw.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.940
Rebuild the claw with pepper sauce.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.843
Oh yeah, okay.

00:14:42.294 --> 00:14:44.920
Oh wow, oh the crab meat.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.330
It's like ridiculously sweet.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.210
It's so stringy, and then
it's wrapped up in that sauce.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.140
The sauce is garlicky,
a little bit peppery.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.050
And you taste like the, just
the sweetness of that crab.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.530
The sweetness of that crab is insane.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.370
Okay then, and just go
in for an entire spoon

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.833
of shredded crab in pepper sauce.

00:15:11.402 --> 00:15:13.950
Okay, a little piece of shell.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.613
Wow, that is awesome.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.600
It's amazing, an amazing
product, an amazing crab.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.560
That sauce.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.440
And actually the black pepper isn't like,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.780
at first it seems kind of mild

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.613
but then it does start

00:15:24.613 --> 00:15:26.180
to like almost tingle
your lips a little bit.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.382
How's the crab guys?

00:15:27.382 --> 00:15:28.215
- I have something for you.

00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:29.700
Share it with my friends.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.601
- Oh wow, oh yeah.
- Chili garlic.

00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:35.074
- Dudi got the, is it the chili garlic?

00:15:35.074 --> 00:15:35.907
- Chili garlic yeah.

00:15:35.907 --> 00:15:37.550
- It's a totally different
flavor, thank you.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.100
You gotta grab one of mine too.

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:45.640
Mm, oh yeah, the chili
garlic is nice as well.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.750
It has a kind of like Asian Chinese kind

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.870
of like wok fried taste to it, yep.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.680
The kind of sweetness, a little bit chili.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.770
It's good, you really taste
the smokiness of the wok

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.603
in that.

00:15:57.603 --> 00:15:58.436
- Oh yeah baby.

00:15:58.436 --> 00:15:59.269
- Having fun.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.331
- Messy, dirty, loving life baby.

00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:04.650
(Mark laughs)

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.600
- It's really good.

00:16:06.513 --> 00:16:09.203
- [David] But you can take
the bread, like a sponge.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.013
- [Mark] Sponge it.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.016
- [David] And sponge it.

00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:16.420
Get all the goodies from inside.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.810
- [Mark] Sponge juice it.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.643
- Yeah.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.013
- Yep, we were just talking
how pure this crab tastes.

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:31.330
It really is pure,

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.480
you really taste the
quality of their crab.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.130
The sweetness is undeniable.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.163
And you're gonna wanna lick
every last crevice on this crab.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.023
And bite out every single piece of meat.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.490
Look at that one biter.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.840
I think I'm going to add
some more sauce to it.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.150
What I like about the sauce
is that it's not overpowering,

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.857
you still really taste the
natural taste of the crab.

00:16:56.857 --> 00:16:58.930
Yet you do taste the sauce like

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.930
with your first bite, but then
the crab just shines through.

00:17:06.972 --> 00:17:09.472
Oh wow, that crab is stunning.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.103
- [David] Boom.

00:17:15.987 --> 00:17:17.263
- Wow, wow, wow.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.250
- [Mark] Look at those fingers.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.297
- Yeah baby.

00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:23.033
I mean I could just go like this.

00:17:26.507 --> 00:17:27.512
- Cheers.

00:17:27.512 --> 00:17:28.381
- Cheers guys.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.253
- Yes.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.123
- Oh yeah, oh, that's stunning.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.770
There's so much flavor in that bite.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.380
Down to my final piece,
the final drumstick,

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.253
the final claw.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.173
The joint there.

00:17:44.176 --> 00:17:48.140
Oh oh oh, that just slides off.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.973
Oh, that is beautiful,

00:17:48.973 --> 00:17:50.340
there's only one thing
that can make it better.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.689
It's called the rejuice.

00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:55.856
(upbeat lively music)

00:18:11.902 --> 00:18:12.819
Oh wow, oh.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.440
That crab was incredible,
the actual product,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.314
the crab itself, it was
so meaty, it was so sweet.

00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:29.980
The pepper sauce was incredible.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.530
It's a finer dining setting
and the crab is not cheap.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.280
But it really is the quality,
really does stand out.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.780
It's been an amazing time

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.190
to hang out with just amazing
people who love to eat

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.688
and who are passionate about
food, passionate about people.

00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:51.060
I love connecting and
enjoying meals with people.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.120
And that's really what food is about,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.590
what meals are about.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.620
And the hands that prepare them.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.061
And by far the most crabs

00:18:58.061 --> 00:19:01.220
in a single week that I have
eaten in my entire life.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.160
I'll have all the links in
the description box below,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.180
so check them out down here.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.620
Again, I just wanna say a huge thank you

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.142
to David the hungry tourist for
putting everything together.

00:19:09.142 --> 00:19:13.540
