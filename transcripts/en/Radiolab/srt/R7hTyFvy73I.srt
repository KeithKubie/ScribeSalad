6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,300
It's good to hear this. I'm like,
I'm Jad Roberts, Radiolab and this

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,663
[inaudible].

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,970
Oh, I can die. A happy man. So
that was perfect. So here we go.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,950
This is radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad
and I'm Robert Krulwich and this

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,630
sound of 700 people who have come to
bear witness to the recording of our show

11
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:48,480
today. We are in the Fitzgerald
Theater at Saint Paul,

12
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,050
Minnesota talking about these strange
phenomenon that is the war of the worlds.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,220
Know I, it's very great that
everybody's here, of course. But this,

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,950
there is one guy I really
wish had been here. Who?

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,370
That the Ecuadorian Guy Leonardo.
Well, let's just, yeah, yeah,

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,970
because he's the guy I want to
ask. Like, what were you thinking?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,890
That's what I want. Well, he's
dead. He's dead. Yeah. Well,

18
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:12,830
but how Orson Welles, I would say to
him, what, what were you thinking?

19
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:16,280
I would say dead. Yeah. Yeah. How
about the guy in Buffalo Buffalo?

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,700
A missing retired? I don't know.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,010
That's ask somebody. So I found a
guy who I think is definitely alive.

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,290
I am Daniel Myrick, Cole writer,

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Co Director of the Blair witch project
before making the Blair witch project and

24
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,940
my Rick heard a recording
of the war of the worlds,

25
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:37,310
which he was pretty young at
the time. He was a teenager.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,440
I just thought it was brilliant.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,530
I absolutely the coolest thing
and more than anything else,

28
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,810
he was impressed by the
technique of the thing.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,410
There's a couple of moments in particular
where they cut to the kind of onsite

30
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:51,380
reporter return you to call
fill ups that drover's. Yeah,

31
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,860
it's almost like cut in a second or two
early and you hear the reporters saying,

32
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:58,190
so are we on my arm? Are we, are
we going to ladies and gentlemen?

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,110
And then he goes into his into character.

34
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,660
Here I am back with stone wall
and it's those little beats,

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,610
those little moments that
really make it convincing.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,950
I get this kind of guilty excitement when
I, when I know how it affected people.

37
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,880
Myrick never forgot that sense
of guilty, uh, excitement.

38
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:18,770
He was fascinated by the idea that scary
stories get even scarier if you think

39
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,920
they're true. So years later,
fresh out of film school,

40
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,660
he and his friend Eduardo Sanchez
decided to develop their own, uh,

41
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,320
wells like product. It's your basic scary,

42
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,320
which story three a kids go into
the woods. Okay, okay, okay,

43
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,030
we're leaving right now. They get lost.

44
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,630
They bump into the witch and then they
die. Or they think they die. You'll just,

45
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,483
you never see them again.

46
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,060
But when you entered the theater
to see the Blair witch project,

47
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,150
the first thing that you'd see on
the screen are these two sentences.

48
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,350
It would read in October of 1994,

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,430
three student filmmakers disappeared
in the woods near Burkittsville,

50
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:55,820
Maryland while shooting a
documentary. A year later,

51
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,980
their footage was found.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,040
So the suggestion here is that what we
see is not a movie within our mind that

53
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,500
you are in a movie theater, right?

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,370
And you're paid $10 and have some
popcorn. Yeah. Yeah. But when you went,

55
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:12,280
when you went sat down,

56
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:16,540
what you saw was something called the
found footage shot by three kids who have

57
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,690
gone missing. And so these
kids, you're not sure,

58
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,470
but they might be real. Well,

59
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:28,471
we picked a subject matter
that was difficult to disprove
to the Casual Observer

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,590
Martians invading from outer space is
you turn the channel to the next network

61
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,220
and if no one's reporting about
it, it's pretty well assured.

62
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,090
It's probably fiction, but three
missing students in the woods, you know,

63
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,750
that's something that is a little harder
to disprove without a fair amount of

64
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,150
scrutiny. And it worked.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,410
We were getting calls from
police wondering where these
three kids were and how

66
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,080
come they never heard of this
case? You're kidding. Oh yeah.

67
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,600
I mean it was constant. Oh people,

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,340
we saw the whole thing and thought
they saw something real. Still do.

69
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:00,830
I still getting emails occasionally on
what part of the story is real, you know,

70
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,370
is there still any phenomena out
in Burkittsville and [inaudible]?

71
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,460
It's all fiction and is all made up.

72
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:11,020
And I think it reinforces what I think
Ed and I suspected that so much of us

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,310
wants to believe.

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,790
Some people told Dan Myrick that after
watching the sweet campers go in the

75
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,000
woods, they themselves would
never go camping again.

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,410
And he thought that was fabulous. He
loved [inaudible], blah, blah, blah, blah,

77
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:27,220
blah, blah, blah. Well, why would
you not want people to go camping?

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,680
I mean, we know honestly, why would you
do that to people? I asked him. Well,

79
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,350
I think that's the goal of any
filmmaker. When you make a movie,

80
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,010
whether you want people to
laugh or cry or be scared,

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,870
you're trying to affect
people so viscerally and so
emotionally that it has a

82
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,680
resonating effect on them long after
they've seen your movie. And I mean,

83
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,100
that's why you're doing it. You know,

84
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,760
we're not making this movie
to kind of scare people.

85
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,160
We were making the film
to really scare people.

86
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,903
Okay.

87
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,720
No regrets on people not wanting
to go camping afterwards.

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,470
So the question is, is that what
Orson Welles was up to back in 1938?

89
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:13,100
Was he just trying to give people a
good old fashion show business scare,

90
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:16,460
make them scream away, up in the
balcony? Because remember at the time,

91
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:20,390
that is what he claimed, that
this was simply an entertainment.

92
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,420
This is awesome. Well,

93
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,270
ladies and gentleman out of character
to assure you that the war of the worlds

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,790
has no further significance,
but as the holiday offering,

95
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,720
it was intended to be the mercury theater,

96
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:36,150
his own radio version of dressing up in
a sheet and jumping out of a Bush and

97
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:36,990
saying boom.

98
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,100
16 years later, Orson
wells changed the story.

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,140
Here he is on the BBC.
The year is 1955 in fact,

100
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:51,940
we weren't as innocent as we meant to
be. When we did the motion broadcast,

101
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:52,900
we were fed up

102
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,250
with a way in which everything
that came over, new magic

103
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,850
box, the radio was being
swallowed. So in a way,

104
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,980
our broadcast was an assault on the, uh,

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,400
credibility of that machine.

106
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:12,401
We wanted people to understand that they
shouldn't swallow everything that came

107
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,790
through the tap.

108
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,700
So here are two ways to think
about the war of the worlds. One,

109
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,570
it was a smashing entertainment using
every trick they could think of including

110
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,850
inventing some new ones to scare you.

111
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,300
Silly master storytelling or or,

112
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:30,930
and it was, we're trying
to send you a warning.

113
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,910
Don't trust everything
you hear on the radio.

114
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:36,810
It's not always true to
which one was it. You think,

115
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,610
well, I asked the professor Jason
Lavilla [inaudible] me. Yeah, you,

116
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,810
Jason m, he's a radio historian
at the University of Maryland.

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,930
He says that what Welles understood was
that a newscast is often two things at

118
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:56,610
once in a newscast. You hear something
scary or disturbing sometimes,

119
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,120
but it's going to be told to
you in a way that's sues you,

120
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,520
meaning the authority of
the voice, the newscasters,

121
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,200
steady voice coming through the radio.

122
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,430
It will calm you like President
Roosevelt's famous fireside chat.

123
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,743
Hi Friend.

124
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,440
I want to prop for a few minutes with
the people of the United States about

125
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:18,490
banking. He's so calm, so in
charge. He says, Professor Olivia,

126
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,630
when you study the rhetoric
that Roosevelt used,

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,460
he really did convey two messages.
One we're in terrible danger.

128
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,120
And two, I've got it covered.
And that is the sort of the,

129
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,470
the authoritative voice coming out of
the darkness. This sort of invisible,

130
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:38,160
disembodied voice of the powerful man. Um,

131
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,410
the news anchor timber 22nd,

132
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,920
1940 and we'll see this
with Moreau on the rooftops.

133
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,270
Britain standing on a roof top during
the plane looking out over London,

134
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,420
straight in front of the, now it
was your two sounds and Justin Mama

135
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,963
are they on?

136
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,140
He's giving us a story of
an unfolding emergency,

137
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,080
I should think in a few minutes. There
may be a bit of shrapnel around here,

138
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,430
but his mastery of the information,
his mastery of his own voice,

139
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,560
his bravery on the scene,

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,790
you may be able to hear the sound of guns
off in the distance. Very thankfully.

141
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,260
Like someone kicking a tub.

142
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,420
This was the beginning of
the formatting of fear,

143
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,370
the formatting of crisis.

144
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,930
It's sort of a ritual where we're sort
of evoking a terrible danger and then

145
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:29,640
somehow assuaging those fears
through the performance of the news.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,870
And so people go to the
news not to be afraid,

147
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:36,630
but to be afraid. And
then to be reassured.

148
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,500
Robert [inaudible], you file things
for the news. Yeah. Do you buy this?

149
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,120
That a news reporter does these two
things simultaneously scares and then

150
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:49,930
reassures and then scale. You never go,
you know, go cover the governor and say,

151
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,510
first I'm going to scare them, but
then I'm going to assuage them. You.

152
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,590
No one would do that. Why else would
you talk that way? I mean, not you. Oh,

153
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,180
but I mean

154
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,070
the, the, the, the anchors.
Well, sometimes you actually,

155
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,750
th th the form in of the news is a,

156
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,810
because the guy is always
there because he's an anchor.

157
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,130
That's what the word means.

158
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,360
It is a reassuring thing to see them
night after night to telling and telling.

159
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,710
But Loving Leo says that the real genius
of the war of the worlds was that wells

160
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:20,240
put you into a newscast where you
expect anchors to anchor and you expect

161
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:24,740
reporters to report. And then he
kills the reporter and the anchor,

162
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,260
and suddenly you're left all by yourself
in your own living room all alone.

163
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,790
Okay.

164
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,960
That is exactly right. The moment
of the war of the worlds broadcast,

165
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:39,070
which still frankly terrifies me.
It's this moment, right? Yeah.

166
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,820
It's like some head on the
tell you to play by the woods

167
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,290
running every way coming this
way down by 20 yards by, right.

168
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,100
It's like that silence is
terrifying. No anchor, no reporter,

169
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,850
no one to reassure you. Okay,

170
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,650
but forgetting that for a moment.

171
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,990
What about his second lesson that he
had to teach us the thing about don't

172
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:07,510
believe the radio. What
about that? Did it work?

173
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,680
Well, professor at Leo says, if that
is really what wells was trying to do,

174
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,810
if you believe that, well
then he failed. Actually,

175
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:18,280
he worse than failed the war of
the worlds. Not once, not twice.

176
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:20,140
We've shown you three broadcast tonight.

177
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,400
It was so good at grabbing an audience
and sucking them in that the wills

178
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:25,540
formula, you might call it,

179
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,620
the newscast that scares you enough to
keep you listening has been adopted by of

180
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:31,420
all folks. News

181
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,270
right now at 11 at night of shopping
during the to a night of fear,

182
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,890
swarming over boardrooms, flooding,
cities and towns, Muslim immigrants,

183
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,600
teens, texting and driving.

184
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,630
It's a deadly mint terror in the
toilet and sink holes and landslides,

185
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,310
python in the clot,

186
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,920
a rabid baby go terrorists
working at one of our airports.

187
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,320
So many newscasts tease you with
things that aren't quite true.

188
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,310
Terror in the toilet. Pythons
in the potty mean it may be,

189
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:03,840
there will be true snake somewhere near
a toilet tree facility of some kind.

190
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,040
But it probably wasn't the python
and it probably wasn't your toilet,

191
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,480
but you don't know that.

192
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,650
You want to hear that it belongs to Mrs.
James C McGillicuddy of 2114 beauday

193
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,800
boulevard and not you. So you,

194
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,790
you want to be reassured and so
you listen and so you fall in.

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,070
And if Orson Welles retelling a Martian
invasion story by hg wells at most

196
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,650
people already knew if he could grab us

197
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,510
and then if they could do it again in
Ecuador and then if they can do it again

198
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:39,560
in Buffalo, what does that tell you? It
tells you that we can't help ourselves,

199
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,930
even if the headline is slightly
preposterous, even if it's slightly scary,

200
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,690
even if it's slightly false,

201
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,660
we will listen.

202
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,220
The fear that these broadcasts generate
now suck us in and you'd think that 70

203
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,180
years later we'd be more
sophisticated and critical.

204
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,780
When the local newscaster tells us that
there's something we're feeding our

205
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:05,900
children that could kill them in,

206
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:09,610
they'll tell us after the
news the way I still listen.

207
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,570
I'm a media critic and I still wait
through the commercials to see what is it

208
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:16,210
that I'm doing to kill my child.
Even if it's really implausible,

209
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,820
your shoelaces will kill
you after this beat method.

210
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,100
I somehow it gets me every time.

211
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,540
Yeah, and wells knew.
