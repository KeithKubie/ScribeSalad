00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.940
My name is Ho, Chien-Kuan, and I am a new
fellow of the Harvard Berkman Klein Center.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.460
I have been a prosecutor for about two or
three years in Taiwan.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.080
This year my research will primarily focus
on how to more effectively investigate cyber

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.200
crime.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.730
With the development of technology, many criminals
may use new cyber tools to commit a crime,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.990
such as mobile malware, and ATM fraud, et
cetera.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.880
The growth of cybercrime remains a great threat
to security in our world.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.399
Therefore, law enforcement authorities have
to improve their capability to investigate

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.300
cybercrime more effectively.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.940
With the massive use of the technology of
the Internet, everyone could be a potential

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.050
victim of this technology.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.190
In our world, the reality is that everyone
who is connected to the Internet is vulnerable

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.230
to cyber attack.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.539
It's not only big companies that are under
threat.

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:14.200
Individuals who don't think they have much
to offer the hackers can be also targeted.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.409
So even if you don't think you are a big target,
you should still care for this risk.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.689
Modern technology is certainly fascinating.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.700
Social networks have allowed us to share almost
anything, anytime, anywhere.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.030
Smartphones and the Internet have dramatically
changed the way we communicate.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.270
But criminals may also use these technologies
to commit crimes.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.360
What scares me the most about technology is
the increasing misuse of anonymity and encryption

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.579
services on the Internet has become a critical
impediment of the investigation and the prosecution

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.919
of criminals.

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:07.829
If law enforcement cannot keep up with the
progress of technology, our world may become

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.420
a paradise for criminals.
