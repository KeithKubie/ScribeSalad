Prepare for a film so terrifying it will convince
an entire generation of kids not to be astronauts.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.960
GRAVITY.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.620
You’ve seen it in pulse pounding IMAX 3-D.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.539
Now, experience the massive letdown when you
watch it on your crappy home television.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.170
Or iPad.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.550
Or phone.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.850
Oh, man, that's depressing.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.210
Please don't watch this movie on your phone.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.310

"Beautiful, don't you think?"

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.410
But the dialogue, not so much...

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.140
“Tell me about the hairy guy, tell me what
happened.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.969

in space.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.640
"What do I do?!

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.729
What do I do?!"

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.380
“Eenie meenie... ok, that doesn't sound
good."

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020
Matt “George Clooney” Kowalski.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.450
A George Clooney-ish pilot with the charm
of George Clooney...

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.880
"I know you never realized how devastatingly
good looking I am"

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.590
“You’re attracted to me, right?”

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.590
And Shariff.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.639
Who’s only there for 5 minutes before his
face gets hole punched.

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:30.770
Ew.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.369
When their simple reapir mission literally
spirals out of control, you’ll be on the

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.509
edge of your seat, trying to hold in your
barf.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.229
"Kowalski, I have a visual."

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.159
Ugh, I gotta close my eyes.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:02.569
Get ready for 90 minutes of bumping into stuff

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.889

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.670

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.550

"No no no no!"

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.760
and gasping for air.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.350
"I can't breathe!

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.940

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.540

“Half of North America just lost their Facebook”

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.040
And made so much debris we won’t be able
to leave the Earth for 100’s of years.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.370
