00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.710
In the last video, we set
up this definite integral

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.290
to evaluate the volume of
the solid of revolution

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.350
that we set up using
the shell method.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.770
So now, let's just
evaluate this thing.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.760
So the main thing is just
simplifying this expression.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.150
I'll start off by trying to
simplify this part of it.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.980
So that's going to be y plus 1.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.604
I just ate an apple,
so something weird just

00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:23.520
happened in my throat.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.960
But anyway, that's done with.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.930
y plus 1 minus y
squared minus 2y plus 1.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.250
I just expanded
out this binomial.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.470
And then that would simplify
to-- another apple in my throat

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.880
moment-- so that's going to
be y plus 1 minus y squared

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.245
plus 2y minus 1.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.877
So this 1 and this
negative 1 cancel out.

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:49.460
And let's see.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.850
You get negative
y squared plus 3y.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.342
And then we're going to
multiply that times y plus 2.

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:03.050
So when you multiply
y plus 2 times this,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.120
so you have y times
negative y squared,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.580
it gets us negative
y to the third power.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.560
y times 3y is going
to be plus 3y squared.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.880
2 times negative y squared
is negative 2y squared.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.790
And then 2 times 3y is plus 6y.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.440
So then you go all
the way down here.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.800
This thing can simplify,
too, because you have 3y

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.070
squared minus 2y squared.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.130
So this going to be
negative y to the third

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.310
plus-- this part right
over here simplifies

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.160
to just y squared--
y squared plus 6y.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.090
So that's this entire part
simplified to this down here.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.420
We can take the 2 pi out
of the integral sign.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.000
So let's do that.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.715
We're integrating
from y is equal to 0

00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:56.240
to y is equal to 3 dy.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.790
And I took the 2 pi
out here, and that

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.129
is equal to our volume.

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:01.920
And so now, we're
essentially ready to take

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.880
the antiderivative.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.940
This is going to be equal to
2 pi times the antiderivative

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.090
of this business evaluated
at 3 minus evaluated at 0.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.620
And I'll color code it.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.140
I found this useful.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.640
The antiderivative
of y to the third

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.135
is y to the fourth
over 4, so this

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:24.040
is negative y to
the fourth over 4.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.780
Antiderivative of y squared is
y to the third over 2-- or y

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.240
to the third over
3, I should say.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.070
And then finally,
I'll do it in yellow.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.340
Antiderivative of 6y is 3y
squared, so plus 3y squared.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.260
And we are going to evaluate
all of this business at 0 and 3.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.240
So this simplifies.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.380
This going to be equal to 2
pi times-- well, let's see.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.110
Let me do it in the same colors.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.150
3 to the fourth power is 81.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.835
So it's negative
81 over 4, plus-- 3

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:08.330
to the third is 27
divided by 3 is 9, plus 9.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.874
And then 3 squared is 9
times 3 is 27, plus 27.

00:03:17.874 --> 00:03:20.040
And then when you evaluate
all of these things at 0,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.810
you just get 0.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.185
So you're just
subtracting out 0,

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:25.560
so we really don't have to
do anything else with the 0.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.465
And now we are
ready to simplify.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.170
Let me see.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.050
Actually, let's just
add them all up.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.060
So this is going to
be 9 plus 27 is 36.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.960
So that is 36.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.160
And if we want to add it
to negative 81 over 4,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.150
we just have to find
a common denominator.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.900
So all of this business is going
to be equal to 2 pi times--

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.130
and so our common denominator
can be 4, times something

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.610
over 4.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.590
We have negative 81 over 4,
and then 36 times 4 is 144.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.420
Is that right?

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.640
Yeah, that's 144.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.780
So 36 times 4, so it's plus 144.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.740
30 times 4 is 120 plus
another 24 is 144.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.780
So you have 144,
essentially, minus 81.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.871
So this is going to be
equal to 2 pi times--

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:28.370
and actually, I can
even simplify it

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.990
little bit more, because we
have a 2 here and a 4 there.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.210
So divide the numerator
and denominator by 2

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.670
so you get it over 2.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.120
So you're going to have pi
times-- this is going to be 44.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.620
Let's see.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.456
If this was an 80,
this would be 64.

00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:47.593
So it's going to be 63.

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:50.700
Let me write it this way.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.460
It's going to be 63 pi over 2.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.630
Did I do that right?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.780
60 plus 81 is 141.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.610
Add another 3, you get a 144.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.110
Yep.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.735
And we're done.

00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:07.740
We figured out the
volume of our front

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.060
of jet engine-looking shape.
