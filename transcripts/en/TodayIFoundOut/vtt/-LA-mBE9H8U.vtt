00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.820
In the early 1960s, high school athlete Dick
Fosbury probably never imagined that he would

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.200
set the Olympic high jump record in 1968.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.700
The then teenager at Medford High School in
Oregon participated in the high jump portion

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.340
of track and field, but as a sophomore, he
failed to clear the 1.5 meter height required

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.720
to qualify for a number of high school track
meets.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.020
The standard high jump techniques of the day
included such techniques as the straddle and

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.460
the upright scissors method.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.140
In the former, the jumper takes off from the
inner foot to pass over the bar with their

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.390
face down and legs straddling it.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.460
While American high jumpers at the Olympics
used the technique to earn themselves silver

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.660
and gold medals, Fosbury could not coordinate
his limbs and body just right to make it over

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.660
the jump at any great height.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.660
Straddle Method
Straddle Method

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.860
Thus, he began experimenting with another
high jump method- the upright scissors technique.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.200
Jumpers using this method approach the bar
at a thirty to fifty degree angle before taking

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.610
off with the outside leg.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.040
The leg nearest the jump remains straight
and swings over the bar, and the takeoff leg

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.949
is swung up over the bar once the jumper crosses
it.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.600
Jumpers often bend forward at the waist once
their takeoff leg clears the ground to lower

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
their center of gravity.

Scissor Method

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.279
With neither of these methods working terribly
well for him, Fosbury began experimenting

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:17.130
with different jumping techniques, achieving
greater heights than he could with the standard

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.539
methods of the day.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.829
One such method became the Fosbury Flop.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.159
When Fosbury developed this innovative backwards,
headfirst leap, it was quite by accident.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.549
He later stated,

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.179
It was just simply intuition.

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.000
It was not based on science or analysis or
thought or design.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.290
It was all by instinct.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.090
It happened one day at a competition [in May
of 1963 at the Rotary Invitation at Grants

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.149
Pass, Oregon].

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.149
My mind was driving my body to work out the
best way to get over the bar….

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.460
I can remember the coaches looking through
the rule book that day to see if what I was

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069
doing was legal, which it was.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.630
I ran into that over the next couple of years
in high-school competition: the opposing coaches

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.630
checking the rules.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.099
If you’re wondering why this method had
not been long since discovered by other jumpers,

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.899
going over the bar headfirst and backwards
meant that Fosbury would be landing on his

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.929
back, something that would not have been possible
before his junior year.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.140
You see, high jumpers prior to the early 1960s
landed on surfaces made up of sand, sawdust,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.420
or woodchips, meaning you at least needed
to partially land on your feet or risk injury.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.280
To get around the injury problem, colleges
in the United States began bundling up soft

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.550
foam rubber inside mesh nets in the late 1950s.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.930
These bundles not only provided a softer landing
zone, but they stood about three feet tall,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.409
making it so jumpers did not need to fall
as far on the way down.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.900
Just prior to Fosbury’s junior year, his
school replaced its old wood chip filled landing

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.930
area with such soft padding, making his otherwise
back breaking flop viable.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.230
Despite his success with the method, Fosbury’s
high school coach initially insisted he keep

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.450
practicing the straddle technique, but stopped
pestering him when he used the flop to break

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.019
his high school’s high jump record, clearing
six feet, three inches (1.91 meters) and then

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.680
shortly thereafter clearing six feet, five
and a half inches (1.969 meters) at a state

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680
competition.

western-roll
Western Roll

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.609
Fosbury’s subsequent college track and field
coach at Oregon State University in Corvallis,

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.469
Berny Wagner, also tried to get him to abandon
his flop, for the entirety of his freshman

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.370
year having him practice the western roll
technique (where the jumper lifts themselves

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.290
into a horizontal position over the bar).

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.079
However, Fosbury was allowed to continue using
his own technique at competitions.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.780
Things change when, during his sophomore year
in the very first meet of the season, Fosbury

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.090
flopped his way to a new school record of
6 ft. 10 inches (2.08 meters).

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.189
After that, Fosbury stated, “Berny came
up to me and said, ‘That’s enough.’

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.430
That was the end of Plan A, on to Plan B.
He would study what I was doing, film it,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.909
and even start to try to experiment and teach
it to the younger jumpers.”

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.959
It was while he was in college that Fosbury’s
jumping technique became known as the Fosbury

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:46.959
Flop.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.190
Fosbury later explained how his method got
its name:

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.620
To tell the truth, the first time that I was
interviewed and asked ‘what do you call

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.620
this?’

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.200
I used my engineering analytical side (Fosbury
was a civil engineering major) and I referred

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.999
to it as a ‘back lay-out’.

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.079
It was not interesting, and the journalist
didn’t even write it down.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.129
I noted this.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.239
The next time that I was interviewed, that’s
when I said, ‘Well, at home in my town in

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.930
Medford, Oregon, they call it the Fosbury
Flop’ – and everyone wrote it down.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.190
I was the first person to call it that, but
it came from a caption on a photo that said

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.610
‘Fosbury flops over bar’.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.920
Before this, one newspaper noted in a caption
showing one of Fosbury’s leaps, “World’s

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.110
Laziest High Jumper.”

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.889
Yet another described his jump noting that
it looked like “a fish flopping in a boat.”

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.020
Nevertheless, five years after first flopping
his way over a high jump bar, this former

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.360
teenager who for a time couldn’t even qualify
in certain high school meets, used his innovative

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.370
method to get himself on the United States
Olympic Team for the Mexico City Olympics

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.370
in 1968.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.300
At that Olympics, he was one of only three
jumpers to clear seven feet, two and a half

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.230
inches (2.20 meters).

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.440
With only three competitors left, he then
managed to clear seven feet, three and a quarter

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.270
inches (2.22 meters), along with his teammate,
Ed Carruthers, while their Soviet Union competitor,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.380
Valentin Gavrilov, did not and ended up with
a bronze medal.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.870
fosbury-olympicsThe bar was then set to 2.24
meters, a height Fosbury cleared, setting

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.240
a new Olympic record.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.680
Carruthers failed in all three tries, winning
Fosbury the gold.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.080
Not satisfied, Fosbury then asked that they
put the bar up to 2.29 meters (7 ft. 6.12

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.120
in.), just over the world record of 2.28 meters
held by Valeriy Brumel.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.270
(Brumel had his career cut short in 1965 after
a motorcycle accident resulted in serious

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.270
injuries to his right foot.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.270
Even after a whopping 29 surgeries on it,
his foot never recovered enough to allow him

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.270
to jump competitively again, though he did
attempt a brief comeback in 1970.)

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.770
For Fosbury, beating Brumel’s mark was a
leap too far and he failed on all three attempts

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.810
to clear the bar.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.069
Nevertheless, with Olympic gold in hand, the
track and field world took notice of the Fosbury

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.069
Flop.

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.050
By the 1972 Olympics in Germany, twenty-eight
of the forty high jumpers were using this

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.050
method.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.810
The 1980 Olympics saw thirteen of its sixteen
high jump finalists use it, and today, while

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.360
other techniques can still be seen used by
those warming up, when it comes to actual

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.020
competition, some slight variation of the
Fosbury Flop is the gold standard, and not

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.659
a single person who’s used a different technique
in the high jump has held the world record

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.330
since 1980.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.970
So why is the Fosbury Flop so much more effective
than previous high jump techniques?

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.740
Jumpers who use such techniques as the straddle
method need their entire body to be above

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.090
the bar when they reach the peak of the jump,
meaning their center of gravity is also far

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.270
above the bar.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.259
While there are many different subtle variations
on the flop, in general, at the apex of a

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.840
jump, when their center of gravity is at its
highest point, the jumper’s legs are still

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.630
below the bar on one side while their head
and torso are below on the other.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.389
If done optimally, and with sufficient flexibility,
this means at no point does the jumper’s

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.210
center of gravity need to go above the bar;
in fact, at times it can be several inches

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.470
below at its peak point, requiring significantly
less leaping power to produce the same result

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:58.340
as techniques that require the jumper’s
center of gravity to go higher to clear

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:05.440
the bar.
