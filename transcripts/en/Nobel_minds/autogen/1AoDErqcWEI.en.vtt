00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 align:start position:0%
frictions show up because workers are
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
frictions show up because workers are

them and this is a process that takes
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
them and this is a process that takes
