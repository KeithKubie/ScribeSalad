00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.688
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.800
- OK.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:13.150
So our last panel is here
to talk about marine life.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.440
I don't know if
anybody ever thought

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.640
that the supply of
marine life in the ocean

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.310
was inexhaustible or not
subject to the stresses

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.570
that humans can put on it.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.030
But if not, by now we probably
are keenly aware of this issue.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.140
And it only gets more keen.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.060
So this panel will
talk about that.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.780
And here to moderate
is John Mandelman,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.570
who is the vice president of the
Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.232
Life and the chief scientist
at the New England Aquarium.

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:48.377
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.950
- Thank you very much, John, as
well as to the other symposium

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.310
organizers who've done a
tremendous job putting this

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.920
together, as well as to
Linda Cabot at Anderson

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.860
for the support
for this symposium.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.599
For me personally, it's been
an absolutely amazing day.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.130
I've learned a
tremendous amount,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.380
and I feel honored and
privileged to be a part of it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.920
and to have heard so many of
these distinguished speakers

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.407
that we've had here today.

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:14.990
I'd like to just take a second
before I introduce our speakers

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.930
for this panel to reflect a
little bit on the sessions

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.010
that we've already had,
to tie it in full circle

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.040
to where we're about to go now.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.600
And I think back to the
origin of life panel

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.370
that started the day.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.490
And then we ended up working
into the physical interaction

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.517
between the oceans
and our climate.

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:34.350
Now we're going to kind
of come full circle.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.930
We're going to look back
at that life in the ocean,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.846
and we're going to take
a little bit of a look

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.064
at how these pressures
and impacts, disturbances,

00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:42.980
acute and chronic--
although I think our panel

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.350
is primarily interested
in chronic stress,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.360
or maybe some acute
disturbances that come along

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.560
with it-- on how that impacts
the oceans, how that impacts

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.030
the ecosystems and the species
that inhabit our oceans.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.190
So one note that I
found really interesting

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.570
in thinking about the oceans
and reflecting earlier

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.600
was Dr. Girguis's talk.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.330
He talked about the incredible
diversity in form and function

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.080
in our oceans.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.000
There is, in every
nook and cranny,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.550
every possible organism
you can imagine, just

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.730
in terms of size,
shape, mechanics,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.732
physiology, the
ability to withstand

00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:20.940
some of the pressures of
living in the ocean already.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.981
Even without human impact,
it's not an easy place

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.230
to live in and evolve.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.610
So the ability of to
respirate, salt-- osmoregulate,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.000
locomotory skills,
all these things.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.280
There's just an amazing
diversity in the ocean.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.050
So now you throw in human
anthropogenic disturbances

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.650
into the mix, and it's
really quite incredible

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.070
how much damage that can cause
over a very short time span.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.060
And as you'll see
momentarily, there

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.530
are case studies from
right here in our backyard.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.710
I think it was
Lynne Talley's talk

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.940
where she mentioned how
climate change is really--

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.880
or, I should say, global
warming is really ocean warming

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.369
as so much of the warming
is reflected in our oceans.

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.160
And we've no better a
case study than right

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.620
here in the Gulf of Maine.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.980
And that's a good way to
lead into our first speaker

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.230
for this panel.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.780
Dr. Andy Pershing is the
chief scientific officer

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.940
up at the Gulf of Maine Research
Institute, also known as GMRI.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.620
He also runs the ecosystem
modeling laboratory there.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.950
And his expertise is looking
at the causes and consequences

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.969
of climate trends
and climate change

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.760
here in the Gulf of
Maine and the Northwest

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.180
Atlantic in general and has
done a lot of amazing work

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.763
in that realm, which
he'll talk to you

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:34.910
a little bit about today.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.020
Moving on to our second speaker,
Dr. Anne Cohen from the Woods

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.840
Hole Oceanographic Institution.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.900
Anne is an internationally
renowned scientist

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.940
who does work looking at the
effects of ocean acidification

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.230
and warming, as well,
on ocean inhabitants,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.330
predominantly coral reefs and
then, as you'll learn today,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.990
some of the animals here
in our own backyard.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.000
And then finally, we're going
to get to hear Dr. Chris Clark.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.730
I'm sorry, Chris.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.650
I'm going to have to read this.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.066
Your title's a
little complicated.

00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:07.470
Just Chris.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.350
All right.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.890
Chris.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.940
So Dr. Clark is the IP
Johnson Founding Director

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.390
at the Cornell Laboratory of
Ornithology's Bioacoustics

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.454
Research Program and
a senior scientist

00:04:19.454 --> 00:04:21.370
in the Department of
Neurobiology and Behavior

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.210
at Cornell.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.730
Dr. Clark, I know of
his work because he's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.885
worked very closely with my
close colleague Dr. Scott Kraus

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:31.510
at the New England Aquarium for
years looking at the endangered

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.960
North Atlantic right whale.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.760
And while I think Chris's
basic expertise is looking

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.830
at acoustic signaling
or communication

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.460
between organisms,
he's applied a lot

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.410
of novel and very sophisticated
acoustic technologies

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.460
to addressing some of the big
conservation issues facing

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.600
our oceans, especially on
endangered species, including

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.770
whales and birds.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.520
So it's a real nice, diverse
mix of speakers today,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.860
I think, touching on
some different topics.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.522
And I really hope you enjoy it.

00:05:00.522 --> 00:05:02.480
With no further ado, I'll
welcome Dr. Pershing.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.749
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.810
- All right.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.870
Thank you for coming, and
thanks for inviting me.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.486
And it's great that everybody
stuck around after coffee.

00:05:15.486 --> 00:05:16.610
So my name's Andy Pershing.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.818
I'm the chief scientist at
the Gulf of Maine Research

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.360
Institute, which is just up
the road in Portland, Maine.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.920
So I'm going to give just
an overview of a few things.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.080
I'm going to talk with a couple
of basics of climate change

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.050
and really try to
pick up some threads

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.270
that some of the earlier
speakers presented.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.069
I'm going to then turn
to our local waters

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.610
and think about the
impact that we've

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.930
seen of global warming
and the warming trends

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.160
that we have observed
here in the Gulf of Maine.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.820
And then I'll talk about the
impact of those temperature

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.430
changes on cod.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.647
Lobsters had to be cut.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.230
I'll talk a little
bit about lobsters,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.610
but I'm not going to give
the full lobster story today.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.340
And then I'll talk
about how we're

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.480
thinking about adaptation
in terms of fisheries

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.500
and natural resources.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.019
And hopefully, it'll
be a nice complement

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:01.810
to the great talk we
heard about adaptation

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.240
on the human
infrastructure side.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.310
So this is the
famous Keeling Curve.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.130
Everybody's seen this unless
you were a caveman who was just

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.040
recently dethawed,
in which case,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.850
this is why you were
recently dethawed.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.740
But the previous speakers
did a great job, I think,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.950
talking about the consequences
that rising levels of carbon

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.120
dioxide are having on our
planet in terms of warming

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.410
temperatures, impact
in vulnerable places

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.540
like the Arctic, CO2
dissolving into the ocean,

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.680
and things like that.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.340
It's really easy,
though, to think

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.080
that these are surprises,
that somehow we're

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.010
just discovering this.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.509
And, of course,
there are surprises,

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.380
and it's really
important that we

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.115
need to document what's
going on out there.

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:47.990
But one of the reasons
that we're doing this,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.823
that we're trying to
document all this work,

00:06:49.823 --> 00:06:52.070
is that it allows
us to actually test

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.680
models and predictions
that were put together

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.921
20 or 30 years ago.

00:06:55.921 --> 00:06:57.420
And so what I want
to do is actually

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.270
walk you through a very
quick test of a climate model

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.362
because I think it's
really informative to think

00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:05.320
a little bit that the
science of climate change

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.720
is not a new science.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.320
In many ways, we're
following threads

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.790
that were laid down over 100
years ago, as far as the role

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.350
that carbon dioxide plays in
making this planet habitable.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.900
So we're going to
start by trying to test

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.750
a prediction by James Hansen.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.350
So in 1981, Hansen wrote
a really influential paper

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.660
in Science magazine,
where he was working

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.810
with an early climate model.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.550
And he made a prediction, based
on the trends in carbon dioxide

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.130
that he was seeing at
the time and predictions

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.790
on how people would use carbon
over the next 30 or 40 years,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.040
that "anthropogenic carbon
dioxide warming should emerge

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.040
from the noise level
of climate variability

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.414
by the end of the century."

00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:50.830
So really what
he's saying is that

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.180
by the end of the
20th century, that we

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.050
should be able to look at
the record of temperature

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.460
on the planet, and we should
be able to clearly see

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.850
that there's a warming signal.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.100
And we should see that
signal standing out

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.264
even among the
variability that we have.

00:08:06.264 --> 00:08:07.930
Then he also made
predictions, and these

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.860
should sound familiar--
the "creation

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.140
of drought-prone regions in
North America and Central

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.639
Asia."

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.940
So think about the talk that
talked about the amplification

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.330
of the hydrologic cycle.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.990
And the "opening of the
fabled Northwest Passage."

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.620
Think of the previous talk
with the very depressing shot

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.870
of the cruise ship in
the Northwest Passage.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.250
So in 1981, this is
the temperature record

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.123
that Jim Hansen would
have had available.

00:08:32.123 --> 00:08:33.539
And, in fact, his
group was really

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.669
instrumental in putting together
many of these global datasets,

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.659
including this one.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.570
And so you can see in 1981 that
the temperature in that year

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.030
was only slightly higher
than the temperature that

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.084
was measured in about 1942.

00:08:48.084 --> 00:08:50.000
And so yes, you could
say, well, maybe there's

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.842
a hint of a trend.

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:52.675
But there's also quite
a bit of variability.

00:08:52.675 --> 00:08:54.980
And it would be very
hard to say that there

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.980
is a conclusive
trend in that data.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.114
10 years later, some
continued warming.

00:09:00.114 --> 00:09:01.780
But I don't know,
maybe it's going down.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.738
Things are cooling off.

00:09:02.738 --> 00:09:04.350
It won't be too bad, right?

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.590
OK, well, of course
it's worse than that.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.240
By the year 2000, we're now
able to see a very clear trend

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.700
in this data set.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.320
So in many ways,
Hansen was starting

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.170
to make predictions using some
of the early climate models.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.220
And we can now test
those predictions.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.260
And Hansen was right.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.550
And, of course, it continues.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.900
And we're now faced
with the warmest

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:31.190
year ever that humans, at least,
have measured on the planet.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.630
And we're thinking
about the consequences

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.760
of persistent drought
in the southwest.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.140
We heard a great talk
about the consequences

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.150
of loss of sea ice in the
Arctic and cruise ships going

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.670
through the Northwest Passage.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.310
But one of the reasons why I
include this story in my talks

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.080
is because I'm going to take
some of the temperature records

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.510
from climate projections and
start to think about the impact

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.720
that the predicted temperatures
are going to have on species

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.770
that we care about.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.567
And so that Hansen
story is meant

00:10:05.567 --> 00:10:07.150
to give you a little
bit of confidence

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.060
that global climate
models actually

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.990
can say something meaningful,
that we're not just making them

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.050
up, it's not a Chinese
hoax, that there's

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.170
real science behind this and
that we know what we're doing.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.010
So of course, there, I'm
showing two different scenarios.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.430
The red one is the high CO2,
business as usual emissions

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.730
pathway that we're on.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.940
The blue one is a very
optimistic scenario where

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.430
CO2 emissions are cut way back.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.420
And they have very
different pictures

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.910
of what the future temperature
of the planet will look like.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.840
But one of the things
I want to highlight

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.080
is that over that
first 30-year period,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.260
those two lines are
almost exactly the same.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.360
It is very hard to
distinguish them.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.100
So we really are dividing the
world into these two periods,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.420
into this initial period of
the next 20 or 30 years, where

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.230
we really have to adapt to
the changes that are already

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.504
baked into the system.

00:10:56.504 --> 00:10:57.920
One of the things
I like to say is

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.790
that the temperature that we
have on the planet this year

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.620
is actually a consequence
of carbon dioxide

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.130
that was emitted when Nirvana
was on tour in the early 1990s.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.210
But then we start to
think about choices

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.960
that we can make that
will play out, then,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.902
towards the end of this century.

00:11:14.902 --> 00:11:16.860
So I'm going to talk
about a temperature story,

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.290
and Anne's going
to pick things up

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.780
with a story about
ocean acidification.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.450
And we just heard a great
talk on sea level rise.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.840
So this is the Gulf of Maine.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.610
It does bear the
name Maine, but I

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.026
think it's really important
to remember that it's not just

00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:33.890
Maine, that it's Massachusetts,
it's Nova Scotia, it's New

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.990
Brunswick, and, yes, even
New Hampshire gets a piece.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.490
So it's a really
important body of water,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.470
and it's been a very important
and influential body of water

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.310
in the settlement
of New England.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.180
So this is the
temperature record

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.740
from the satellite
data going back

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.690
to 1982 of sea
surface temperature

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.720
in the Gulf of Maine.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.950
So I'm showing it on
almost a weekly scale,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.180
so a lot of variability.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.570
That's that blue line
in the background.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.510
If you begin to take
annual averages,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.010
you get the gray dots.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.380
And you can see there's
some pattern, right?

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.830
There's kind of maybe
a five-year cycle or so

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.510
that's going on in the 1980s,
a bit of a jump around 2000,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.285
and then things have warmed
up over the last few years.

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:17.910
And we can start to
do some statistics.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.560
So if we fit a line,
that black line--

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.590
that black line has
us warming at a rate

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.880
over this 34-year period of
0.04 degrees Celsius per year.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.350
That's hard to fathom
what that means.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.360
That's four times the
global average rate.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.600
The global average
ocean warming rate

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.954
is 0.01 degree Celsius per
year over this same period.

00:12:37.954 --> 00:12:39.870
So we've been warming
over this period at four

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.130
times the global average rate.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.910
But it gets better.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.110
So from 2004 through 2013, I
highlighted this 10 year period

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.900
because it was a feature
that really stuck out once we

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.820
started looking at this data.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.390
And over that period, we
warmed at almost a quarter

00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.240
of a degree Celsius per year
over that 10-year period.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.630
If you map the
trends over that 2004

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.150
through 2013 period-- so red
in that figure at the top

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.780
is an area that has a
steep warming trend.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.420
Blue would be an area
that has a cooling

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.380
trend over that 10-year period.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.990
You can see that
there's roughly--

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.990
there's a little bit more
red, but it's probably

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.790
hard to see, than blue.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.690
But the Gulf of
Maine in our region

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.930
really stands out
in terms of being

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.660
bright, bright red,
along with places

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:31.150
like the-- I guess I have a
pointer-- the Barents Sea off

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.710
of Norway, region of Australia.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.740
So these all areas
that had similar trends

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.090
over the last 10 years.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.700
But the Gulf of Maine
still stands out.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.440
So if you view this
as a histogram,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.680
we are way out here
on the right-hand side

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.460
of that distribution, which
leads to the statistic

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.420
that over that 10-year
period, we warmed faster

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.370
than 99% of the global ocean.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.030
It was a 10-year warming
trend, a 10-year increase

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.494
in temperature that very
few large marine ecosystems

00:13:58.494 --> 00:13:59.410
have ever experienced.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.100
So what has been
driving that trend?

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.540
Well, in the Gulf
of Maine, we're

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.744
just this really interesting
place on the planet.

00:14:08.744 --> 00:14:10.660
We're right at the
boundary between cold water

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.360
and warm water and between cold
air masses and warm air masses.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.070
And the shifts in those warm
air masses or water masses

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.950
has a big impact on the
temperature that we have.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.000
So in particular, we
have a cold current

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.640
that comes in from Nova Scotia.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.390
We have warm water
that can come in

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.160
from off the continental shelf.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.000
And then we have
the Gulf Stream,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.600
which is riding out here off
of the continental shelf.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.052
We have seen over the
last few years an increase

00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:39.510
in the latitude of
the Gulf Stream.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.140
It's been pushing further north.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.070
And when that happens, we
get a characteristic series

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.810
of changes in the circulation.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.180
We get a decrease in
that cold current,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.880
and we get an increase in
the supply of warm water.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.380
So it's a lot like
a bathtub, where

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.864
you adjust the temperature
by turning the warm up

00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.280
if you want it to
be warm, and you

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.530
can turn the cold down if you
want it to be really warm.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.180
And so that's what's been
going on in the Gulf of Maine.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.300
But why has the Gulf
Stream been changing?

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.530
Why have these
currents been changing?

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.820
Well, here's the map that
I previously showed you

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.160
that showed the warming
trends over the last 10 years.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.100
Here's a map that Vince Saba, a
colleague from the Geophysical

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.769
Fluid Dynamics Lab,
had in his paper.

00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:24.060
And he allowed me to modify it.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.350
And what I did was I took the
warming trends from his paper,

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.790
where he was running a very
high-resolution climate

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.260
model, the only
one that actually

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.620
can resolve the continental
shelf in our area

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.869
and really get that
shelf circulation that's

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:37.660
so important to
maintaining the temperature

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.534
in the Gulf of Maine.

00:15:38.534 --> 00:15:40.610
And it's the only model
that can get that right.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.220
And so what I did was I took
the warming trends out of his

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.190
that he was projecting, and I
just divided by the mean trend.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.810
So the gray area up
here off of Greenland

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.730
is an area-- it's not
that it's cooling,

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.160
it's just not warming as
quickly as the global average.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.940
Whereas the Gulf of
Maine is warming faster

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.450
than that global average.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.350
And so notice the correspondence
between the two images.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:09.220
Both of them have this warm,
cool, warm-- warm, cool, warm--

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.550
pattern.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.770
So we are seeing very similar
dynamics playing out right now

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.220
to what the climate models
suggest we should see over

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.790
the next century.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.240
And the mechanism behind
that that's in the models

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.450
and, we think,
also in the data is

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.970
related to large-scale
changes in the North Atlantic

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.400
circulation, ultimately tied to
increases in fresh water supply

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.450
and melting in
Greenland changing

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.340
this meridional overturning
circulation and causing,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.240
instead of the ocean going
up and down, where you're

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.820
sinking at the poles and
then rising elsewhere,

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.410
we're putting more energy
into going around and around,

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.030
which tends to kick that
warmer water into our region

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.691
and reduce the
supply of cold water.

00:16:49.691 --> 00:16:50.190
OK.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.470
So now for the biology, since
this is a biology panel.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.210
So I'm going to talk
in depth about cod

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.420
because it's arguably the most
important fishery in the United

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.610
States.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.980
It was the first export
from New England.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.970
I heard somebody say
that the English made

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.730
more money off of cod
exported from New England

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.339
than the Spanish
did off of the gold

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.088
that they were getting
from their colonies

00:17:10.088 --> 00:17:11.660
in South America.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.579
In the late 1800s,
after the Civil War,

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.270
the US had a bounty on cod.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.490
We were catching over
70,000 tons of cod

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.310
from this Gulf of Maine
stock in a single year.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.940
So remember that number.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.560
In 2014, catch limits were
reduced to about 350 tons

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.780
for the Gulf of Maine stock.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.560
So a very, very steep
decline in this population.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.870
And here's what that
steep declines looks like.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.280
So we had more fish
in the early 1980s.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.170
We had less fish in the 1990s.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.240
And then we have
this big decline

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.570
that started in the late 2000s.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.690
Well, what was
driving that decline?

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.340
Well, one of the
things that we look

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.250
for when you're trying to
diagnose what's going on

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.750
with a fish population is you
look at the number of new fish

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.320
that are coming
into the population.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.900
We call this recruitment.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.070
So this is an estimate
of the number of new fish

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.090
that are being recruited
into the population.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.530
And you can see it
has a lot of parallels

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.610
with the decline in biomass.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.396
But that's kind
of what we expect.

00:18:12.396 --> 00:18:13.770
If you have fewer
females, you're

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.420
going to get fewer babies.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.200
And so in part, some of
that is going on in here.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.930
So what we did was we took
the data up through 2004,

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.510
before the onset of
this rapid warming.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.120
And we fit two
statistical models

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.040
that were trying to predict
the number of new fish entering

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.530
the population based on
the number of females

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.290
in the population.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.410
And then we fit
another model that

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.000
included a temperature effect.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.730
So we have two different models.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.210
Both of them do almost equally
well during this period.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.360
But they perform
very differently

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.750
when we confront them with
the new data after 2004.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.940
If we don't include
that temperature effect,

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.140
we greatly overestimate the
recruitment in the population.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.390
As a consequence, we
greatly overestimate

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.380
the potential productivity
of that stock.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.780
And if we include a
temperature effect,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.280
we actually explain
the decline of cod.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.620
So temperature was
a major contributor

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.020
to the decline in recruitment
and to the decline

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.940
in this population.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.620
But it wasn't just
temperature alone.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.730
It was really the interaction
between temperature and people.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.700
So fisheries management is
meant to be a negative feedback

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.980
loop, meaning that if there's
a change in the population--

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.920
let's say there are fewer fish--
we pick them up in our sensors

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.350
and in our process called
the stock assessment.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.640
And we say, oh,
there are fewer fish.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.770
We then pass that through
the management machinery.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:41.960
And at the end, we come up
with quotas or regulations

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.530
that reduce the fishing
pressure on that stock

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.240
and should allow that
stock to increase.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.090
Well, over the last
few years, we've

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.191
been in this cycle where every
time we look at the stock,

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.190
there are fewer fish than
we thought there were.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.110
And not only that, there were
fewer fish the previous year

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.657
than we thought there were
when we looked at them then.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:00.615
Very, very challenging.

00:20:00.615 --> 00:20:04.710
And what our study shows is
that the ocean was really

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.930
changing the dynamics faster
than this human system

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:08.990
could keep up.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.440
And so we were issuing
quotas, and fishermen

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.060
were staying within
those quotas,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.670
yet overfishing
was still occurring

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.020
because the science
wasn't able to keep up

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.110
with the changes in the ocean.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.235
But I don't think
it's all terrible.

00:20:22.235 --> 00:20:23.610
So I'm going to
talk a little bit

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.776
about the future of the cod.

00:20:24.776 --> 00:20:27.510
And this is where those climate
models are going to come in.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.150
So this is where we are.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.240
The black line is
our current level

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.200
of spawning stock biomass.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.564
The dashed line is where
management thinks we should be.

00:20:35.564 --> 00:20:37.980
This is the goal that the New
England Fisheries Management

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.340
Council has for the stock.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.140
OK.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.210
So keep in mind, that's
about 55,000 tons of fish,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.150
where in the late 1800s, we were
catching 70,000 tons of fish.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.520
So there's been a very
big change in scale

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.670
in our expectations
for this stock.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.520
But this doesn't include
the impact of temperature.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.240
So if we add a
temperature effect,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.960
we bring down our expectation
for the stock because they're

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.070
going to be less productive.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.260
So now we're going to
project things forward.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.110
So if we allow a little
bit of fishing and project

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.330
under our mean warming
from the climate model

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.410
projections over this
period, we actually

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.710
can get an increase
in the population.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.750
But we never rebuild to
what is our current target.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.140
But if we apply the same
temperature to our reference

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.030
points, to our
management targets,

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.650
we would actually say
that we could rebuild

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.300
this stock by about 2028.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.030
So not too bad.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.790
Not too far outside
of the 10-year horizon

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.230
that's the goal in
management right now.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.840
But that's only one temperature.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.030
And we know that there's
a range of temperatures

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.850
that we could experience.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.870
We could have cooler
temperatures--

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.760
not the temperatures
get cool, but we

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.260
warm at a more gradual rate.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.970
Or we could stay on this
rapid-- on our 30-year warming

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.252
trend, which I'm calling
the warm case down here.

00:22:03.252 --> 00:22:04.960
And you might look at
this graph and say,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.200
wow, we should really
be hoping for warm water

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.850
because with warm water, we
could say that we could rebuild

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.290
a few years earlier, that
we could declare victory

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.560
and go home.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.566
Of course, it doesn't
work that way.

00:22:16.566 --> 00:22:18.440
You have to take into
account the temperature

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.910
on the productivity
of the stock, as well.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.560
And so in the warming
case, we wouldn't actually

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.460
rebuild until about 2034.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.780
So there's this interaction
between management

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.690
and an interaction
between the ocean.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.350
If there were no
fishing, we obviously

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.310
would increase the
population faster,

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.590
but at very large
socioeconomic costs, as well.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.127
So just a few lessons that
I'd like to highlight.

00:22:46.127 --> 00:22:48.710
One of the things that I think
we can say in the Gulf of Maine

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.140
is that global warming is real
and that it impacts things

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.220
that we care about.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.312
It isn't just some
abstract concept

00:22:55.312 --> 00:22:56.770
that's out there
for people to talk

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.190
about at wonderful
universities like this.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.680
It's real, and it's
impacting people's lives.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.730
And we've seen that especially
with the cod fishery, where

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.410
communities in
Gloucester are really

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.420
grappling with a huge amount
of socioeconomic stress

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.790
due to the decline
of that fishery.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.630
Lobster is sort of a
different story, where

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.300
we've seen, basically,
the collapse

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.520
of the fishery in Rhode Island
and in southern New England.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.724
But in Maine,
lobster is booming.

00:23:21.724 --> 00:23:23.140
The lobster fishery
in Maine alone

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.970
was worth over half a
billion dollars last year,

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.400
a huge increase in the
population, a huge increase

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.840
in the value of that stock.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.880
And there's a temperature story
that's embedded in lobster.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.550
We've seen northern
shrimp-- very similar

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.090
global distribution to cod.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.880
And not surprisingly, we've
had a collapse in that fishery,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.329
as well, that's very
much due to temperature.

00:23:47.329 --> 00:23:49.120
On the other hand,
we're seeing an increase

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.660
in species like black
sea bass, especially here

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.620
in Massachusetts.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.590
We're seeing longfin squid
moving into the Gulf of Maine.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.900
And these are potential
commercial species

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.590
that may make up for
some of the loss of some

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.146
of these other things.

00:24:02.146 --> 00:24:06.130
So the previous talk, I
think, did a great job

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.760
of sort of laying out that
kind of the adaptation

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.680
challenges that a city
is having to deal with.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.490
We're trying to understand what
are the adaptation challenges

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.132
that fishing communities and
that fisheries management

00:24:18.132 --> 00:24:18.840
has to deal with.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.070
And a lot of it has to do with
thinking about decisions that

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.850
get made by different actors
at different space and time

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.720
scales.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.336
So a fisherman has to
decide whether they're

00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:30.960
going to stay in the fishery or
whether they're going to leave.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.810
The fishing community
has to make decisions

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.314
about their infrastructure.

00:24:34.314 --> 00:24:35.980
They have to think
about sea level rise,

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.220
but they also have
to think about

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.594
are they going to continue to
support commercial fishing,

00:24:39.594 --> 00:24:44.170
or are they going to put in
a marina and support yachts.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.460
For fisheries
management, how can we

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.270
account for trends similar to
what we've done and with cod?

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.856
Is there a way to
develop forecasts

00:24:51.856 --> 00:24:53.230
that might be able
to give advice

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.820
on the medium-term about
how to manage fisheries?

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.600
And what are the
strategies that we can

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.550
take to manage for resilience?

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.940
So just some quick
summary points.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.980
The Gulf of Maine
is warming rapidly.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.540
The warming has already impacted
human and natural communities.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.760
The adaptation
requires, first of all,

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.690
acknowledging that climate
change is having an impact.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.800
But good management
can build resilience.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.820
So there is an
opportunity to make sure

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.410
that the fisheries that we have
can be sustainable in a warmer

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.660
climate, as long as we
knowledge that the climate is

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.830
going to be warmer.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.130
So thank you.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.098
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.390
- Hi, everyone.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.570
It's great to be here today.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.990
So I want to thank the
organizers for inviting me.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.210
And I also want to
thank you for being here

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.230
to share with us some
of the work that we're

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.870
doing to understand the
impacts of ocean acidification

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.328
on marine life.

00:25:53.584 --> 00:25:54.500
My name is Anne Cohen.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.370
I'm from Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.110
As we are pumping huge
amounts of carbon dioxide

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:06.150
into the atmosphere
through human activities,

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:11.050
we're not only warming the
atmosphere and the oceans,

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.110
but we're also
changing the chemistry

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:19.130
of the ocean in significant
and measurable ways.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.510
And specifically what I
want to focus on today

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.130
is the decline in
ocean pH that's

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.840
occurring as the ocean is
taking up excess carbon dioxide.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.240
And this is a process,
an ongoing process,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.840
that is referred to as
ocean acidification.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.230
But I want to
start my talk today

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.960
by introducing you
or reintroducing you

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.260
to two organisms that
you know very well,

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.767
but you might not recognize them
because they were just born.

00:26:48.767 --> 00:26:49.850
They were just fertilized.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:55.940
So on the right here is
the larva of a shellfish.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.304
And on the left is a
planula larva of a coral.

00:27:00.304 --> 00:27:01.720
That's what baby
corals look like.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.350
They're just a blob
of fat, not much else.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:12.660
And these babies are about
24 hours post fertilization.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.530
And over the next
24 hours, they're

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.627
going to do something
absolutely remarkable.

00:27:17.627 --> 00:27:19.210
They're going to
completely transform.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.220
The baby coral is going
to transform into what

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.920
we call a primary polyp.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.450
It looks not much different
from a sea anemone.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.730
It has tentacles that
have stinging cells that

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.840
can capture prey.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.440
It has a central mouth.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.760
And underneath that polyp, a
skeleton, a beautiful skeleton,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.670
is beginning to form.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:47.050
And this is within 24
hours of that larval stage.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:50.330
And that baby
shellfish that you saw

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:56.520
earlier is busy enveloping
itself in a shell of calcium

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.230
carbonate.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:03.350
And by becoming calcifiers
within the first 48

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:07.170
hours of being fertilized,
what these organisms are doing

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:14.510
are joining a myriad and diverse
array of marine organisms,

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:20.090
plants and animals, that
build calcium carbonate shells

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.670
and skeletons.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:28.990
And they are ranging from
microscopic plankton that

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.700
are photosynthesizing and
providing a lot of the oxygen

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.760
that we breathe
to corals that are

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.700
building geological-scale
structures that we

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.500
know as coral reefs.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.400
And what all of these
organisms have in common

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:53.390
is that day in and day out, 24
hours a day, seven days a week,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.480
365 days of the year, they
are pulling calcium ions

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.120
and carbonate ions
from the seawater,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.380
and they join them together
to make calcium carbonate

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.690
molecules.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.530
And from these
molecules, they're

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.650
building calcium
carbonate crystals.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.380
And as you can see,
the calcifying plant--

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.260
this is Halimeda-- kind
of throws its crystals

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.940
together all haphazardly
to build its skeleton.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.510
When you look at the corals
in the scanning electron

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.900
microscope, they're a
little more organized.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.180
They're building radiating
arrays of crystals

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.380
that are eventually going
to build the coal reef.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:39.700
But nothing quite compares
to the amazing organization

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.980
of the mollusk nacreous
layer, the layer

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.750
that we know-- that
iridescent layer in the inside

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.240
of the mussel shell.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.920
We can't build anything
like this in the laboratory.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.360
This is a carefully
organized process

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.850
of calcium carbonate building.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.910
Now, from a calcifier's
perspective, what you really

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:09.320
care about in that ocean is the
carbonate ion concentration.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.770
Because as you can see
from this schematic

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.460
that I've put
together, there's a ton

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.980
of calcium ions in seawater.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.670
They're not going anywhere.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:25.410
But for every 25 calcium ions,
there's only one carbonate ion.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:29.250
And it's actually really easy
to change the carbonite ion

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.620
concentration of seawater.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.418
All you have to do
is change the pH.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:42.780
So here's a schematic of
a pH scale-- more basic

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.140
on the top toward more
acidic on the bottom.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.520
Seawater before the
Industrial Revolution--

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.730
this is prior to
about 1850, when

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.845
we started to pump a lot
of CO2 in the atmosphere--

00:30:53.845 --> 00:30:59.490
the seawater pH was around 8.2
Carbonate ion concentration,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.240
very abundant in seawater.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.040
You can see that you just need
to change the pH by about 0.3

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:13.157
units-- not a big
change-- to more than half

00:31:13.157 --> 00:31:14.490
the carbonate ion concentration.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.760
How do you change the pH?

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.050
A lot of you, if you have a
SodaStream in your kitchen,

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:27.070
which I do, are changing the
pH of your water every day

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:32.160
by injecting a few squirts of
CO2 from the SodaStream bottle.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.620
But that's a bottle, a
very small amount of water,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.160
relatively.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:42.200
How do you change the pH of
the global ocean, quintillion

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.050
gallons of water in there?

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:48.440
Well, we're doing a
pretty good job of it.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.634
This is a data set published
by the Global Carbon Project.

00:31:52.634 --> 00:31:54.300
They're keeping track
of how much carbon

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.530
dioxide we're emitting into
the atmosphere every year.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.560
On the x-axis are CO2 emissions.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.350
Now, this is gigatons
of carbon per year.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.180
A gigaton is a billion
tons of carbon.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:12.330
And this is just the data since
1990, so the past 25, 26 years.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.890
And there's two things that
I want you to notice here.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:18.450
One is the sheer
amount of CO2 that's

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:23.160
going in from human
activities-- 10 billion tons

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.850
a year at this point.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.580
And the other thing to
notice is that the pace

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.890
or the rate of these emissions
is actually accelerating.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.390
We're not slowing down.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.510
So that at this point, 2013,
when these data were published,

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:45.770
was the highest number
of the past 25 years.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.520
Just to put that
in perspective, you

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.080
may have seen this
plot earlier today.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:56.320
This is the 400,000-year-long
record of CO2 concentrations

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.300
in the atmosphere.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.340
And prior to very recently,
most of that information

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.170
comes from measuring
CO2 trapped in bubbles

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.410
that are trapped in ice cores.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.190
And what you see
from this plot is

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.610
that, yes, carbon
dioxide concentrations

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.970
in the atmosphere have
changed quite dramatically

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.070
over the past 400
years as the earth

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.400
cycles between glacial
and interglacial periods.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.190
But here we are today.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.150
We are at the
highest concentration

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.940
that the earth has seen in the
past, at least, 400,000 years.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.450
And more recent data suggests
at least 800,000 years.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:45.530
So the ecosystems, the marine
ecosystems that we know today

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.105
are adapted to these levels,
not these levels and rising.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.950
Where does all
this excess CO2 go?

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.470
Well, the trees are
taking up about 27%

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.610
of those 10 billion tons a year.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.980
47% is hanging out
in the atmosphere.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.830
And that's what's causing
the atmosphere to warm.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.510
And the ocean is taking
up quite a bit-- hundreds

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.610
of billions of tons since
the start of the Industrial

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.889
Revolution, around 26%.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.770
Now, when the ocean
takes up carbon dioxide,

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.540
the CO2 doesn't just sit there.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:35.290
It actually reacts with
water, with the seawater,

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:39.870
to form carbonic acid.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.050
But the carbonic
acid is not stable,

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.480
and it dissociates
pretty quickly

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.690
into free protons-- these
H-pluses-- and bicarbonate.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.710
And the increase in
these free protons

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.645
is what is causing
the pH to decline.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.150
But as far as calcifying
organisms in the ocean

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:09.500
is concerned, it is not so
much this decrease in pH

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.990
that's a problem.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:15.000
It's the fact that those
free protons, a lot of them,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.640
go around like little Pac-Men
looking for carbonate ions

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.230
to bond with.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.220
So those few
carbonate ions-- 10%

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.980
of the total carbon
in the ocean exists

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:32.770
as carbonate ions-- are
falling victim to bonding

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:37.020
by these voracious protons.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.130
So what ocean
acidification is is

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:44.180
the decline in pH
and, at the same time,

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.790
the decrease in the
carbonate ion concentration.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.550
The ions of all those
calcifying organisms,

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.110
from the coccolithophores
to the lobsters

00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:00.250
to crabs to shellfish to
corals to coral reefs,

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:04.170
all need to build
their skeletons

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.420
and skeletal structures.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.932
Now, the chemistry of
ocean acidification

00:36:12.932 --> 00:36:14.390
is actually pretty
straightforward.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:15.740
You put CO2 into the water.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.530
It disassociates.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:20.440
It forms carbonic acid,
dissociates, pH goes down,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.420
carbon ion
concentrations go down.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:28.330
We actually have, this for
about the past 30 years,

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:33.490
moorings out in various stations
around the world's oceans

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.920
that are actually making these
measurements in [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:43.710
And those data are coming
back from various parts

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.490
of the oceans.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:50.630
And what we see everywhere is
exactly what we would expect.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.800
The carbonate ion
concentration of the oceans

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.110
everywhere has been
declining for as long

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.501
as we've been measuring it.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.750
What we do in my lab--
and I don't do this alone.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:12.200
I have colleagues that I work
with, both at NOAA, at WHOI,

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.730
and at other universities.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:18.740
What we do is try to understand
not only the local processes

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.970
that are exacerbating or
modulating ocean acidification,

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:30.530
but also how these changes are
impacting the organisms that we

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.400
care about, even those
that we don't care about.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.770
Well, I think we care
about all of them.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.040
I want to focus today on
one of these organisms.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:47.090
This is the sea scallop,
Pacopectin magellanicus.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.500
You might know it from
the grocery store.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.050
It's delicious, especially
wrapped in bacon.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.250
I shouldn't say that.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:54.750
I'm a Cohen.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:07.970
But the sea scallop is one of
the most valuable fisheries

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:09.287
in the US.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.870
In fact, I think it
is, at this point,

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.640
the most valuable fishery
on the US east coast.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.770
It's about a $500 million
fishery, employing thousands

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:24.050
of people from the fisherman all
the way to the restaurateurs.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:28.480
So the scallop itself
is enormously valuable.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.900
But it also is one
of the major prey

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.670
items of other
valuable fisheries,

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:40.850
such as squid, lobster,
and the animal that Andrew

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.790
was talking about, the cod.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.430
And Andrew, I don't think
you took into account

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:46.860
the impacts of
ocean acidification

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.000
on the cod's diet.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.980
But impacts of ocean change on
the sea scallop, for example,

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.810
would have major ramifications
not only directly to humans

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.150
but also indirectly through
its effects on other organisms.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.520
The sea scallops is abundant
along the North Atlantic Bay

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.880
and also in the Gulf of Maine,
specifically on Georges Bank.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.190
We actually have
data now coming in,

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.490
largely through NOAA's
efforts, on what

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.610
the pH conditions
in the Gulf of Maine

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:28.040
are during sea
scallop spawning time.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.090
So these are the actual
data that are coming in.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:34.590
This is October, November,
December, on average, pH.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:40.090
And as you can see, in
some period of sea scallop

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.130
spawning time, we're already
at pH's that are quite low--

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:44.500
so 7.85.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.860
You remember my
earlier slide showing

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.370
that you don't need to
change the pH that much

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.560
to change the carbonate ion
concentration quite a bit.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.900
And by the time we get
into this pink zone

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.140
here, that is where the
carbonate ion concentration is

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.340
so low that we would
expect the shelves to stop

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.200
dissolving at this point.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.490
So from these data,
NOAA's actually

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.655
starting to make projections
under various emissions

00:40:13.655 --> 00:40:18.850
scenarios, what would the
future pH in sea scallop habitat

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.410
is going to look like?

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.640
And this is one example.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:29.180
So, for example, if we continue
on the current emissions track,

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:34.800
by 2060, the pH in
sea scallop habitat

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.490
will look like this, below 7.85
for most of the spawning time.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.840
And then by the
end of the century,

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:50.680
we're basically in a zone where
for most of that spawning time,

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.600
the pH is so low that the
shells will start to dissolve.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.740
Why are we so interested
in the spawning time?

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:04.630
Well, it turns out that the
adult shellfish and the baby

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.030
shellfish make their shells out
of different forms of calcium

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.420
carbonate.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.890
The adult makes its
shell out of calcite,

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.300
and the baby makes its
shell out of aragonite.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.620
And it does that
because aragonite

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.910
is much easier to make.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:27.979
If I was going to make
a shell in seawater,

00:41:27.979 --> 00:41:29.020
I would choose aragonite.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.780
Much easier.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:35.360
I could just lay back there
and just build my shell.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.050
No energy required.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:42.330
The problem is that
it's easy to make,

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.910
but it's also easy to take away.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:48.550
So aragonite is a
much more soluble form

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:51.380
of calcium carbonate
than calcite.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.790
And that means that
the baby shells

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.229
are much more vulnerable
to ocean acidification

00:41:57.229 --> 00:41:58.020
than their parents.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:05.590
Now, we recognized
this fairly early on,

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:08.020
that this is
potentially an issue.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.220
But we needed to
understand better in order

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.710
to inform policymakers,
to inform our colleagues

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:19.000
at NOAA what the sensitivity,
potential sensitivity,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.470
of these larval shellfish
are to ocean acidification

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.554
because we have no idea.

00:42:24.554 --> 00:42:27.095
We know that if you decrease
the carbonate ion concentration,

00:42:27.095 --> 00:42:30.010
they're going to have a harder
time building their shells.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.760
We need numbers.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.890
So what we started to do
was work with our colleagues

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:37.560
at the Marine
Biological Laboratory,

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.480
bring in adult sea scallops
from Cape Cod Bay-- males

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:50.230
and females-- and entice
them, very gently, with music

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:54.220
and warm up the water a little
bit, create some ambiance,

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.530
entice them to spawn.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.320
And we had a few failures,
more than I care to mention.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.780
But eventually,
we got this right,

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.690
and we had fantastic
success with spawning.

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:09.440
We collected the fertilized
eggs in a bucket.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.800
And then at this stage,
at the trocosphere stage,

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.280
we introduced our
larvae into conditions

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.820
in the lab that
mimic the pH in 1960,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.500
the pH today, the pH
in 2060, and the pH

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:33.210
by the end of the century to
see how they'd deal with it.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:37.580
What's absolutely
remarkable is that some

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.700
of those babies, even though
they're growing in conditions

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.760
where the shells really
shouldn't grow-- and if they do

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.380
grow, then they
should just dissolve--

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.990
there are some, a few
percent in each batch,

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:56.150
that manage to come out perfect.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:58.387
They just know how
to deal with it.

00:43:58.387 --> 00:44:00.220
And this is something
we need to figure out.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.540
How do they do it?

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:06.265
But this is an absolutely
perfect nine-day-old D-shell.

00:44:06.265 --> 00:44:09.082
It's it's about 50
microns in diameter.

00:44:09.082 --> 00:44:10.800
We can't see it
with the naked eye.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.860
We have to put it under the
scanning electron microscope.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.320
Absolutely perfect.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.250
Grew in a pH where the
shell just shouldn't grow.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.480
But the problem is that the
majority of those babies

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.570
either don't form
shell or they form

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:33.570
knot shells that can't close, so
they can't protect the animal.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.650
Or they're so
deformed that there's

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:41.040
no way that they're ever
going to live to adulthood.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.810
So we can quantify
those deformities.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.800
And what we see is that as
we lower the carbonate ion

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:55.960
concentration and the pH of our
experimental water, the numbers

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.460
of babies with
deformities so severe

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.865
that they're not going to--
let only reach adulthood,

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.490
they're not going
metamorphose, they're

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:07.680
not going to settle--
increases dramatically.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.480
So by the time we get to
conditions in the Gulf of Maine

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:18.900
that are projected to occur
by 2060, more than 80%

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.710
of our larvae have
deformities that

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.360
are incompatible with life.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.948
This is a massive,
massive impact.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:38.110
Now, some of my colleagues at
WHOI and at Ocean Conservancy

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.940
have been working with NOAA on
integrated impact assessments.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.480
And what they do is they build a
model including various factors

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.115
like how the pH is
going to change,

00:45:49.115 --> 00:45:57.460
how fishing is regulated to try
to project the impact of ocean

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:03.460
acidification and warming
on biomass, on landings,

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.940
on the economy that
surrounds this fishery.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.000
So this is one
plot that actually

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.690
appeared in a recent paper
led by Sarah Cooley in 2015.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.830
And this is the
projection-- biomass

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:27.020
on the y-axis over
time, up to 2050.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:31.970
If emissions stay or
CO2 concentrations

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:36.940
stay at present level versus
a business-as-usual CO2

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.220
emissions-- so we keep pumping
as much CO2 in the atmosphere

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:46.950
as we are now-- this is the
projected decline in biomass

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.760
in sea scallop habitat,
with implications

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.605
for impacts on landings.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:59.930
But these data,
these projections

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:04.290
were made not with
data from sea scallops

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.970
because we didn't have
them at that point.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.340
They were made with data from
oysters or estuarine organisms

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.890
that are seeing naturally
large fluctuations

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:15.980
in the pH in their environment.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.280
If we put our data in
there, the implications

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.920
are much more stark.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.580
We're seeing a 50%,
25% to 50% decline

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.520
in the biomass in sea
scallop habitat just

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.865
over the next few decades,
just as a consequence of ocean

00:47:32.865 --> 00:47:33.448
acidification.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.080
And that's one organism
that we've studied.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.080
There are myriad
organisms out there,

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.530
a lot of them upon
which we depend

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.680
not only for the oxygen that
we breathe but for the food

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.535
that we eat.

00:47:54.535 --> 00:47:59.760
And we're just starting
to understand and study

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.267
the consequences or potential
consequences of the ocean

00:48:02.267 --> 00:48:02.850
acidification.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:11.380
I want to end on a-- although
I don't feel particularly

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:18.390
optimistic today, I do want
to end on an optimistic note

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:22.240
by reminding you that we do see
some babies in our experiments

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:29.770
that for some reason can
deal with these conditions.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:35.670
So it's probable that there
are populations out there

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:41.470
that for some reason are adapted
to dealing with much lower pH

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.980
conditions.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.360
The target now is to go
out and find them, and then

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:53.950
protect them to make sure that
we have these organisms around

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.717
for our children and
our grandchildren.

00:48:56.717 --> 00:48:57.550
Thank you very much.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:58.304
Wrapped in bacon.

00:48:58.304 --> 00:49:01.466
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:16.340
- This is a very meaningful
moment for me in many ways.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.520
I was born on Cape
Cod and raised

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.970
in a town called Wellfleet on
an island called Bound Brook

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:29.090
Island, where I ran free as
a young boy over the hills,

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:34.640
then barren of trees, learned
how to find water in sand.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.210
And I grew up in an environment
where we were surrounded

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:40.450
by animals and wildlife.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:45.120
There was an old ship captain's
parrot up in the grape

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:53.220
arbor above the porch,
goats, sheep, et cetera.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.320
So for me to be here today
and to listen to people

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.860
talking about the
ocean is a real treat.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:06.570
And so before I really get
into the presentation formally,

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:10.640
I'm going to read you
something from Aldo Leopold.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.170
And I hope to also
give you a sense of who

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:17.280
I am as a person because I
think the connections we all

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.290
have in this room are,
in many ways, driven

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:27.490
by our connections, the affect,
and the emotional connections

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:30.980
we share and our passion.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.280
This is from A Sand
County Almanac.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.720
Some of you may
have read this book.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.950
"There are some who can live
without wild things and some

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.730
who cannot.

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:49.140
These essays are the delights
and dilemmas of one who cannot.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.740
Like winds and
sunsets, wild things

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.560
were taken for
granted until progress

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.830
began to do away with them.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:00.630
Now, we face the question
whether a still higher standard

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:06.640
of living is worth its cost in
things natural, wild, and free.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.570
For those of us in the minority,
the opportunity to see geese

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.180
is more important
than television,

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.680
and the chance to
find a pasqueflower

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.170
is a right as inalienable
as free speech.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:26.300
These wild things, I
admit, had little value

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.655
until mechanization assured
us of a good breakfast

00:51:30.655 --> 00:51:35.230
and until science disclosed the
drama of where they come from

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.970
and how they live.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:41.970
The whole conflict thus boils
down to a question of degree.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:46.190
We of the minority see a
law of diminishing returns

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.210
in progress.

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:51.630
Our opponents do not."

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:58.000
That was written in 1949,
the year I was born.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.550
You may have seen
some connections

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:02.902
to the situation today.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:12.890
Each day, our sun gives rise
to a resounding chorus of life

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:20.020
that continues around the globe
24 hours a day, 365 days a year

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.160
for millennia.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.130
These sounds are not
some random collections.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:30.300
These sounds are the
living reflections

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.540
of evolution's economy,
the costs and benefits

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:40.250
imposed by living in a
biological and physical

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.410
environment.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.720
I'm a bioacoustics engineer.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:51.180
It's a multisyllabic summation
of who I am, I guess.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:55.840
I listen and study the sounds
and songs of life in the air,

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.050
on land, and in the ocean.

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.640
My work has taken me from
the Arctic to Argentina

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.210
to the Central African
Republic to some of the most

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:09.080
remote places on this planet.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:15.230
In 1972, when I was asked by
two of the world's leading whale

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.780
scientists, Roger and Katy
Payne, just not too far west of

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.070
here in a town
called Lincoln-- I

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:26.760
was asked to join them on a
National Geographic expedition

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.770
where they were about
to start studying

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.790
the endangered
southern right whale.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:35.130
This was in
Patagonia, Argentina.

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:37.500
There's a beautiful
picture of two right whales

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.130
in shallow water.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:42.940
We lived in tents
along this beach.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.950
We ate out under the
Southern Cross every night

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:47.890
around a campfire.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:50.750
And we awakened in the morning
to the sounds of whales,

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:55.320
sea elephants, and penguins.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.500
It was in this magical place
that Roger explained to me

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.300
his hypothesis that he
had just published--

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.370
this was in 1971
he published it--

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.010
that prior to the advent
of modern shipping

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.540
and all the noise
that ships make,

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.760
the songs of blue whales and
fin whales-- these are two

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.190
of the largest
animals ever to live

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:22.410
on this planet-- those songs
could be heard across an ocean.

00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:26.790
Now, I was a little skeptical
that the songs of whales

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.510
could travel thousands
of miles across an ocean

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.960
or that the noise from
ships could actually

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.100
drown out those voices.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:40.980
But I was sufficiently
intrigued that it

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:44.280
changed the course of my life.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:49.870
So in 1992, I was
given the opportunity--

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:53.490
I was selected by the US
Navy as their marine mammal

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:58.050
scientist, who would be
given access to the US Navy's

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.160
sound surveillance system.

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.130
That was a classified
term called SOSUS.

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:05.380
But this was in a rather
enlightened period

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:09.220
in the recent political
history of our country

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.540
when Senator Gore, Senator
Kennedy, Senator Stevens,

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:18.780
Senator Nunn helped form
a program that we refer

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.820
to as Swords to Plowshares.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:24.980
And the US Navy offered
its SOSUS system

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.430
as a way of studying
marine life.

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.350
So the first time I got
into the SOSUS system

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:40.610
to listen to blue whales,
all I heard was a giant hum.

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:43.090
So I thought my
equipment was broken.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.740
I went around and tried to fix
everything and make sure it

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:46.830
was all plugged in right.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.034
And I knew it was working.

00:55:51.034 --> 00:55:52.450
I knew there were
whales out there

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:57.750
singing because I could see
their voiceprints on the Navy

00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.800
displays.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.020
And then it hit me.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:08.440
Of course I couldn't hear a blue
whale singing because my mind

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.227
and my ears were completely out
of tune and out of touch with

00:56:11.227 --> 00:56:11.852
a blue whale's.

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.100
But I knew how to fix it.

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.160
I had to speed up the song.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.060
And when I sped up
the song, voila,

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.050
I heard the whale singing.

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.760
So this is a voiceprint
of a blue whale

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.010
singing in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:33.370
And a voiceprint is very
much like a musical score.

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:36.360
Time runs along the
bottom, from left to right.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.750
And pitch is low at the
bottom and high at the top.

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:42.820
Now, in this case, pitch
of 10 hertz and 20 hertz,

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.235
it's below your
hearing threshold.

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.860
So that's why I
couldn't hear anything.

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.960
I just heard stuff.

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.820
So I'm going to play this
back to you at 30 times faster

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:54.440
than I originally recorded it.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.290
[WHALES SINGING]

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:13.680
When I first heard
this song, the hair

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.160
went up on the back of my neck.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:19.720
And I still get chills
remembering that moment

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:23.150
because that was
the moment, in 1992,

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:29.140
that I knew Roger's hypothesis,
as crazy as it was, was true.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.320
So consider this-- a
blue whale singing off

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:36.527
the Grand Banks of Canada
can be heard all the way

00:57:36.527 --> 00:57:37.610
across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.580
It was in these
early days in SOSUS

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.070
that I met a young lieutenant
named Chuck Gagnon.

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:49.270
Chuck was a wizard at
tracking submarines

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:53.640
and at how sound
travels in the ocean.

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.020
So I asked him,
Chuck, what would you

00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:01.490
do if you had a voice as loud
and as low as a blue whale?

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.810
He didn't hesitate to answer.

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:07.195
He said, I could
illuminate the ocean.

00:58:07.195 --> 00:58:08.820
Now, you see what he did?

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.950
He took the acoustic radiance
from the voice of the whale

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:17.180
and translated it into an
image of how that image would

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:21.710
allow him to see the ocean.

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:25.920
So I said, Lieutenant Gagnon,
could you show me an image?

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.340
Could you show me what
this would look like?

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.790
He said, sure.

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:32.670
This is what he showed me.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:33.170
OK?

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.610
The tail at the
bottom of the screen

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:41.080
is where the blue
whale is singing off

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.680
of the Virgin Islands.

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.950
The dark radial bands
radiating out from the whale

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:50.850
represent how loud
the voice of the whale

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:55.960
is throughout the Western
North Atlantic Ocean.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:00.620
Notice how those lines
outline the continental shelf

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.000
along the United States,
from Florida all the way up

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.850
to the Grand Banks of Canada.

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:08.800
The blue dot in the middle
is the island of Bermuda.

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.560
And notice how the island
casts a white acoustic shadow

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.510
to the north in which
no song appears.

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.540
Notice to the right
the jagged edges

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:24.560
of the song outlining something
an underwater mountain range

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.510
known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:33.860
I was pretty amazed,
but I figured

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:35.260
I might as well push my luck.

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.960
So I said, OK.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.530
So, Chuck, can you actually
follow one of these whales

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:44.670
and track it
throughout the ocean?

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:49.290
He looked at me, and
he said, piece of cake.

00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.330
This is an animal
putting out 185 decibels.

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:55.790
This is six orders of magnitude
greater than a submarine.

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:57.600
So a few months
later, Chuck showed me

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.790
this track of a blue whale.

00:59:58.790 --> 00:59:59.862
He called it Ol Blue.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:08.950
Ol Blue is a male singing
across an ocean to find a mate.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:12.020
Chuck tracked Ol
Blue for 43 days

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.642
as it sang and swam
1,700 nautical miles.

01:00:15.642 --> 01:00:17.350
That's pretty much
the distance from here

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:23.050
to California,
throughout the ocean.

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:29.560
So this changed my
perspective and started

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.030
to change my perspective
on space and time.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.860
I couldn't hear the
whale, so it wasn't there.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.150
I couldn't see the whale,
so it didn't exist.

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:45.200
But we had this system
in which it was exposed.

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:52.050
This is a one-year voiceprint
from the Pacific Ocean,

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:55.590
halfway between San
Francisco and Honolulu.

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:59.340
20, at the bottom-- 20
Hertz-- is the lowest pitch

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.660
that humans can hear.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:04.150
And 440 is orchestral A,
for those of you-- I presume

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:05.400
there are some musicians here?

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.760
I hope?

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.400
That's orchestral A.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.710
The yellow striations
dripping from the top

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:15.530
represent the energy
from ocean storms.

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:18.890
And that glow you see
in the lower right

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:23.710
represents the collective
voices of singing blue whales

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.860
and singing fin whales.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.950
That chorus lasts for
about three or four months,

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:33.970
from September into mid-January.

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:36.380
So again, what
I'm hoping to show

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:40.190
you is scales, ocean scales.

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.040
Biggest animal on
earth, big scales.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.790
Low voice, very, very loud.

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:49.746
These are the kinds of insights
you can get into the scales.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.890
Chuck and I have been
working together now

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:56.170
for about 26 years.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.100
We're still doing this.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:02.280
And it was Chuck who taught me
to think of the SOSUS system

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.936
as an acoustic telescope.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.840
He discovers interesting
objects in the telescope's

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:15.090
visual displays, and I drill
down into those voiceprints

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:19.410
to listen and discover
what they are.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:25.750
These discoveries span enormous
periods of time and space.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:29.110
So I can actually track
whales throughout an ocean

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:32.940
basin for months at a time.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.054
And this is a really
important point

01:02:36.054 --> 01:02:37.220
I want to get across to you.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:41.880
This fulcrum of
awareness took me

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.780
from knowing
something-- and Anne,

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.809
this is something we were
talking about earlier.

01:02:46.809 --> 01:02:48.850
You know something because
you read it in a book.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:50.160
I took classes.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.569
I was a postdoc.

01:02:51.569 --> 01:02:52.610
I was a graduate student.

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:55.150
I had all the epaullettes
and the things

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:59.310
that you wear to show
how cool you are.

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.850
But until I actually
experienced this,

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.800
I had no idea, really,
no understanding

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.070
of the scales of space
and time and frequency

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:13.590
which were operating in the
ocean-- not in Cape Cod Bay.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:14.860
I love Cape Cod Bay.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.210
I love Gulf of Maine.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:17.830
I love Western North Atlantic.

01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:18.860
But it's the ocean.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.920
Oh, and I have to
tell you, I basically

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.900
grew up running
around on Cape Cod,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.580
and I'm in love with
the living world.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.470
I have a love affair
with the living world.

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:30.678
I'm very passionate about it.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.500
So what I'd like-- I played
you the song of the blue whale.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.070
Now I'm going to play you
some other songs of whales

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:43.080
in the ocean or sounds
of whales in the ocean

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.630
because I want you to be aware
of this sort of quick holiday

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.880
tour of the voices
of the animals.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.124
The blue whale is infrasonic.

01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:54.540
I'm going to take you all the
way up to the beaked whales,

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.540
which are working at very
high ultrasonic ranges.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:02.640
This is a voiceprint
of a bowhead whale.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.730
A bowhead whale-- this
is an Arctic species.

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:07.330
It's the right whale that went
north and never came back,

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:10.070
and it lost all of its
mascara and make-up.

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:11.705
There are no
markings on the head.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.180
This animal sings
with two voices.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.730
And this is what you
hear if you take a paddle

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.300
and you put it against the ice.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.300
[WHALE SONGS]

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.300
This is one animal.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.616
[WHALE SONGS]

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.690
We still don't know how
they make these sounds.

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:37.190
[WHALE SONGS]

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.490
OK.

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:50.210
Now I'm going to play you
sounds from a collection

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:52.650
of melon-headed
whales bouncing over

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:59.001
the highlands of the [INAUDIBLE]
down in the Caribbean.

01:04:59.001 --> 01:05:02.480
[WHALE SONGS]

01:05:04.793 --> 01:05:05.959
These are mostly ultrasonic.

01:05:05.959 --> 01:05:10.929
But a lot of the voice
is in the audible range.

01:05:10.929 --> 01:05:13.911
And what these animals do,
these are highly fission-fusion

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:15.402
societies.

01:05:15.402 --> 01:05:18.170
They are constantly
inventing new sounds.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:21.820
So an individual in a group
bouncing over the highlands-- I

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.090
think of Monty Python.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:25.660
Click, click, click, click.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.926
And they're inventing
sounds all the time.

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:31.300
It reminds me of someone
outside of Grand Central Station

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.675
blowing up balloons and twisting
them into little animals

01:05:33.675 --> 01:05:36.160
and handing them off,
just making things.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.600
And I will make something.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.639
And then John, you
would imitate it.

01:05:40.639 --> 01:05:41.930
And then Andy would imitate it.

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:43.500
And this is our social currency.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.350
This is how we maintain
our social group.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:50.660
Because remember, the blue
whale is 90 feet long.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.250
It can barely see
its tail, but it

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:55.270
can communicate with another
whale 3,000 miles away.

01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:57.070
A herd of melon-heads,
which might

01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:00.707
be bouncing over the highlands
of Cambridge, Massachusetts,

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.290
the way they
communicate, the way they

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:06.272
maintain their social
structure is through sound.

01:06:06.272 --> 01:06:07.980
So they're constantly
playing with sound.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.924
They're highly social animals.

01:06:10.924 --> 01:06:15.190
Now I'm going to play you the
sounds from an echolocating,

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.530
foraging beaked whale.

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:21.340
This is an animal that dives
one mile down into the ocean,

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.900
hunts in complete darkness
trying to find bags of water

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.250
called squid.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.920
And that's how it
makes its living.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.370
So it's sending out slow
pulses, just like a bat.

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:34.120
[CLICKING]

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.770
And then [SQUEAL].

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:37.962
That's what the squid
hears just before the--

01:06:37.962 --> 01:06:40.794
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:43.105 --> 01:06:44.015
[CLICKING]

01:06:44.015 --> 01:06:45.840
[SQUEAL]

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.205
OK, that's it.

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:50.460
That's pretty much
what these guys do.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.660
But this click that I'm
playing to you at fast-- this

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.210
comes from a device
that was attached

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:58.010
on the back of the
animal-- it's ultrasonic.

01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:02.602
It's living in a space of
sound that you and I can't hear

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:03.810
and we can barely appreciate.

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:10.090
Space-- I'm going to now show
you an animation of fin whales,

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.760
singing fin whales, males.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.660
You see where we are.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.770
There's Nova Scotia.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.590
OK, there we are.

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:18.090
Right here.

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:19.610
We're sitting right there.

01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:20.110
OK.

01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.237
So I'm tracking
singing fin whales.

01:07:24.237 --> 01:07:25.070
I'm not seeing them.

01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:26.070
I'm tracking them.

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:27.770
And I'm animating it.

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:31.677
So I'm showing over time,
and your eye will see tracks.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:43.390
This is their space.

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:47.220
100,000 square miles,
200,000 square miles.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.320
They don't live in
these little places

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.584
such as we observe them in.

01:07:50.584 --> 01:07:52.250
If you go out on a
whale-watching cruise

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.070
and you see some whales, you
think, oh, there they are.

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:55.950
Nuh-uh.

01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:57.370
It's much bigger.

01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:58.540
So this is their space.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.700
Cape Cod Bay is where we work.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.450
So we put in an array of
underwater microphones.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:12.280
This is my poor man's US
Navy array in Cape Cod Bay.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.890
And here's what happens
when we track right whales.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.797
This is happening
at night, mostly.

01:08:23.797 --> 01:08:25.380
And what you're going
to see is you're

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.010
going to see some little
worms moving around.

01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:28.843
That's these animals
calling back and forth.

01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:30.200
They call antiphonally.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.519
They maintain their social
cohesion with sound.

01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:41.620
There is that little insight
into their three days

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.670
in the life of right whales.

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:45.620
We may have only had
20 whales in the bay,

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.350
but they're acoustically
extremely active.

01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:51.729
So the point is,
acoustics is their world.

01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:58.800
OK, this is how
we-- as a scientist,

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.729
I try and represent what I
hope you experienced in terms

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:05.290
of listening to it
in that spatial scale

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:10.060
into a three-dimensional space,
which is defined by frequency,

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:13.279
the pitch of the sounds; the
range over which these animals

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.930
are using those
sounds for maintaining

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:18.290
communities,
communicating, navigating,

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:23.470
finding food, defense; and the
time over which they use these.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:30.069
So notice that here's the blue
whale, this little juju bee

01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:31.130
up here.

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.670
And here's the beaked
whale, restricted down here

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.419
in this
space-time-frequency domain.

01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:46.779
All marine animals
studied to date-- whales,

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:52.510
seals fish, shrimp--
all produce and use

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:56.870
sounds for all the basic
activities of life--

01:09:56.870 --> 01:10:02.020
communication, navigation,
defense, finding food,

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.490
maintaining social networks.

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:07.880
Acoustics is the
modality of choice.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.890
It's very efficient.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:13.900
Light does not transmit very
far at all in the water.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.520
You can't use these
big acoustic telescopes

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.520
without being brutally
aware that all

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.130
of our activities in the ocean,
human activities in the ocean,

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:25.872
are creating a din,
a lot of noise.

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:33.090
We use sound in the
ocean-- humans use

01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:36.300
sound in the ocean-- for
all of our basic activities

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:36.860
in the ocean.

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.340
We use sound for communication.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.700
We use sound for navigation.

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:40.960
We use sound for defense.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.460
We use sound for finding food.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:49.290
Another way we use
sound is we use

01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:52.020
sound to find oil
and gas hydrocarbon

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.950
deposits beneath the sea floor.

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:57.860
So I'm going to play you
the sounds of an air gun

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:00.520
array in which we
set off explosions

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.240
every nine to 10 seconds for
many weeks and many months

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.190
at a time.

01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:06.080
These are very, very loud.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.220
They're so loud that they
basically boil water.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.680
They create a partial pressure.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.075
[EXPLODING SOUNDS]

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.276
You also hear the sonar from
the ship's navigation system.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:32.600
So off of Boston, we've
had an LNG terminal built.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.010
And one of the questions
was, in all this noise

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:38.630
that we're generating by our
shipping and our LNG terminals,

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:41.500
could that be affecting
the acoustic ecology

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.990
of our endangered right whales?

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:47.910
So I'm going to change
my pitch a little bit,

01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:49.470
and I'm going to
appeal to people

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:53.970
who are creative artists,
who are videographers, who

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:57.160
translate science
into visualizations

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.410
that people can
understand because one

01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:02.560
of the most difficult
concepts that I've had

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.150
is the acoustic
footprint of a ship

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:10.110
or the acoustic footprint
of a seismic survey vessel.

01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:14.630
So this is a visualization
where the little-- this is

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.220
sort of Starry Night, van Gogh.

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.910
These dots represent
the acoustic space

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:22.570
of an individual right
whale that's communicating

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:25.230
with other right whales.

01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:28.490
These larger meteorite
things, these

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:31.210
are the footprints
of commercial ships.

01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:33.020
This is where the
LNG terminal was.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.760
So right now,
there's an LNG ship

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.780
on this date and time that's
offloading LNG into Boston.

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.210
This is a relatively small
boat coming out of Boston.

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:43.540
There's some off of Gloucester.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.110
That's a commercial ship.

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.370
So I'm going to animate this.

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:48.400
This is real data.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.760
We had 19 recorders in
the area for five years.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.780
We know the ship speed.

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.724
We know all the
information about the ship.

01:12:56.724 --> 01:12:57.890
We know the noise footprint.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:59.750
We know the whales.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.194
So I'm just animating this.

01:13:02.194 --> 01:13:04.110
And what you're going
to see is the footprints

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:06.440
of the ship traffic.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.920
This is just commercial shipping
coming in and out of Boston.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.490
And when the light of
the whale disappears

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:16.580
under the footprint of
the ship, that whale

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.610
loses all possibility
of communicating

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:20.510
with another whale.

01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:22.830
And what this has
led us to model

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:27.560
is that these animals are losing
over 65% of their opportunities

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.160
to maintain
communication system.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.100
That is, we are constantly
tearing and ripping apart

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.750
their social mechanisms for
maintaining communication

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:37.250
space.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.080
Seismic exploration--
this is a big issue

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.110
because there's
been a strong effort

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:47.990
to open up the east coast
all the way down to Florida

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.290
to seismic exploration.

01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:54.360
Here's a visualization of a
seismic exploration activity's

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:59.310
impact on 100,000 square
miles in the ocean.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:02.370
These red dots that
you'll see the flashes

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:05.960
represent singing whales.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.520
Here is-- when I now
put seismic surveys

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.650
and ship noise into
that map, notice

01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:16.480
the scale, the space that
is occupied by the shipping

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.090
noise and the seismic surveys.

01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:20.430
It's enormous.

01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:23.190
So this is an
attempt to quantify,

01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:26.810
create a model by which we can
assess how noise in the ocean

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:30.070
is actually impacting the
ecological systems of life

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:32.590
in the ocean.

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:34.522
So why should we care?

01:14:34.522 --> 01:14:36.730
This is similar to other
questions we've heard today.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.980
Why should we care if all the
noise we're making in the ocean

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.210
is impacting ocean life?

01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.580
I have a hypothesis.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.600
It'll take me two minutes.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.280
As Chuck was using the
acoustic telescopes

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.430
to look into the ocean
for interesting objects,

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:56.660
he discovered a phenomenon.

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.870
It was an acoustic
glow of energy

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:00.790
that showed up in
the voiceprints.

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:06.720
This glow showed up after
sunset and lasted for many hours

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.360
before going away.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.775
When I listened to it,
there was nothing there.

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:14.650
But we knew it was there
because we could see

01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:16.680
the glow in the voiceprints.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.660
It turns out we were listening
to sea anemones, thousands

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.350
and thousands of sea
anemones scraping algae

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:26.840
off rocks along a
coast of a coral reef

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.600
where we were pointing
the telescope.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.630
This made us very interested.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.770
And so Chuck continued
to look for other glows

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:40.160
of acoustic energy that
we could not explain.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.950
And he found one.

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.710
And it wasn't sea urchins
because this time,

01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:47.910
he was pointing the
telescope into the deep ocean

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.290
where there were no islands.

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.160
There were no coral reefs.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.850
There were no sea anemones.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:56.750
I think I know what it is.

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:59.550
I think we're observing
a phenomenon that

01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:03.350
happens every day when
billions and billions

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:07.150
of tiny organisms-- some of them
surrounding you on the walls

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:09.420
or in this room, and
you've heard about today--

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.970
move up toward the surface
of the ocean at night

01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:17.280
and then descend and disappear
into the depths of the ocean

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.320
during the day, every
day, 365 days a year,

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.410
but for millions and
millions of years.

01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:28.360
This phenomenon was first
detected by the US Navy

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.800
during the Second World War
using antisubmarine sonar.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.110
It's called the deep
scattering layer.

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:41.380
We are detecting the
deep scattering layer

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:46.360
in the voiceprints when
the ocean is quiet.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:54.110
These organisms depend on
tiny, microscopic exotic forms

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:58.570
of life, such as you see here
on the walls that convert

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:02.940
carbon dioxide into oxygen.

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.394
You've heard about this.

01:17:04.394 --> 01:17:05.810
And I think everybody
in this room

01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:10.760
now knows that every
other breath you take

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.580
comes from this phenomenon, the
respiration of these organisms.

01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:23.020
So we are literally witnessing
the voice of the living ocean

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:24.970
breathing.

01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:27.340
This is more than amazing.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.833
This is literally
our breath of life.

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:38.650
We are wise to pay attention
to the light we can't see,

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:45.460
to the sounds we can't hear,
and to the life we know is there

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.680
and on which all
our lives depend.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.646
Thanks very much.

01:17:50.646 --> 01:17:54.027
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:03.610
- Thank you very much, Dr.
Clark, and to our whole panel

01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:05.090
for these excellent
presentations.

01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:07.990
So now we have time,
before our final session,

01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:10.740
for two questions
from the audience.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.325
Adam Sacks again, since
nobody else is here.

01:18:13.325 --> 01:18:17.500
I want to ask Dr. Clark
about your findings

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:28.430
among the animals whose shells
are just being defective.

01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:31.520
Aren't we seeing natural
selection right in front

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.930
of our very eyes there?

01:18:33.930 --> 01:18:39.270
And over generations, have
you done a longitudinal kind

01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:42.230
of study over generations
of those creatures-- I don't

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:46.890
know if it's possible--
and see if you

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:50.320
develop a population that's
resistant to acidification?

01:18:54.662 --> 01:18:56.420
- I think the
question is for me?

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:56.920
- Yes.

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:57.576
- Is this on?

01:18:57.576 --> 01:18:58.430
- Yes

01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:00.750
- Yes.

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:04.230
- That's a really good question.

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:05.390
I think we are.

01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:09.710
Humans are definitely performing
a natural selection experiment.

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:11.970
The question is, is
it going to work?

01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:15.520
I mean, the level of
uncertainty there, I think,

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.860
is one of the scary
parts of this.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:20.570
Natural selection
also usually happens

01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:23.950
over very long time periods.

01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:28.720
And what we're doing is
really escalating the rate

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.750
at which things are happening.

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:33.030
As far-- your
question with respect

01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:38.050
to have we grown these organisms
out through several generations

01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:40.550
to see if natural
selection can occur,

01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:41.800
not with the sea scallops.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:47.370
And in fact, ours was the first
successful ocean acidification

01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:48.810
experiment with
sea scallops just

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:51.380
because they're so
difficult to rear

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.300
under experimental conditions.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:57.210
And so we actually
invested several years

01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:00.520
into figuring out how
to actually grow them

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.250
in the laboratory so that we
did have a successful grow out

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:06.640
under ambient conditions,
and then started

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.770
to introduce them to
treatments after that.

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:12.490
So in fact, even though
I'm sort of showing the end

01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:15.410
results of these
experiments, it takes

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:20.470
a long time, a lot of
effort, quite a bit of money

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:23.260
to come up with
really robust results

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:28.855
that we feel confident that we
can put into these projection

01:20:28.855 --> 01:20:30.210
models.

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:34.330
So we're kind of at
the cusp of this.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.616
There also isn't an
endless amount of money.

01:20:36.616 --> 01:20:38.490
This is another thing
you have to understand.

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:41.620
I mean, NOAA, who is running
the ocean acidification

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:45.870
program, who actually funds
our sea scallop experiments,

01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:47.400
they're cut.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.250
And funds are thin,
spread thin on the ground.

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:57.340
So we've submitted a
proposal to an open call

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.620
to do exactly that, to test out
different populations of sea

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.970
scallops to see whether we
can see natural variability

01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.440
and sensitivity across
different populations.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.440
I'm going to have to
submit that proposal again.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.160
- Right.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:17.080
But they're not going to wait
to evolve for you to get funded.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:17.580
- I know.

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.080
Damn.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.460
- I absolutely
support the study.

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.800
But if the acidification
is increasing,

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.800
then you're going to
get that selection.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.620
It's going to be
gradually increasing along

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.050
with the increasing
ocean acidification.

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:36.150
And evolution with
fast-growing animals-- I mean,

01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:38.760
we see these things with
industrial moths in England

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.570
and that sort of thing.

01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:42.680
They change pretty quick.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.200
And I don't know--

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.050
- Well, we have examples from
history, from geologic time

01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:51.560
periods, of mass extinctions of
calcifiers under elevated CO2

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:52.090
conditions.

01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:54.256
We know that these things
have occurred at least six

01:21:54.256 --> 01:21:55.531
times in the past.

01:21:55.531 --> 01:21:59.150
But the time scale for
those organisms to come back

01:21:59.150 --> 01:22:00.780
is a hell of a lot
longer than you're

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.010
going to wait around for the
sea scallop in the restaurant--

01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:07.270
tens of thousands of years.

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:10.130
So we're talking about a
brink of a mass extinction.

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:11.930
Organisms, yes, they're
going to come back.

01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:14.100
Some organisms are
going to adapt.

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.000
But the time frame
that we're looking at

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.550
is not the time frame
that we're operating on.

01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:21.490
- But what's their
reproductive cycle?

01:22:21.490 --> 01:22:24.541
I mean, you have 10% of
them who are surviving.

01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:26.540
And they're the ones who
are going to reproduce.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.123
- [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:29.494 --> 01:22:31.410
- We're going to move
on to our last question.

01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:32.200
Thank you.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.130
- We can continue
the conversation.

01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:37.555
- I just wanted
to ask Dr. Clark--

01:22:37.555 --> 01:22:40.027
I see Cornell on your resume.

01:22:40.027 --> 01:22:41.610
And I was wondering,
could you tell us

01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:43.790
one anecdote about
the most amazing thing

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:44.930
you heard from birds?

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.587
- Dinosaur call.

01:22:50.587 --> 01:22:51.420
- Yeah, that's good.

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.525
Dinosaur calls.

01:22:53.525 --> 01:22:54.130
- All right.

01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:55.505
Thank you again
to our speakers--

01:22:55.505 --> 01:22:56.650
- [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:59.631
- --and to all of you for the
wonderful session and symposium

01:22:59.631 --> 01:23:00.130
so far.

01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:00.630
Thank you.

01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:02.830
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:06.780
