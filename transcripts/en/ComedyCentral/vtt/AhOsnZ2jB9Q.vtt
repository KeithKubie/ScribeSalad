00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:02.779
- He's punchin' him right
in the fuckin' Queens,

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:03.969
just punchin' him in the face.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.011
It's New York in the 70s,
nobody's sayin' dick.

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:09.844
(soft rock music)

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:27.073
- Welcome to This Is Not
Happening presents fisticuffs.

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:28.355
If you've never been to this show before,

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.446
this is a bunch of comics
telling fun stories

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:32.621
about real shit that happened.

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:34.513
All right, this is Joey Diaz.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:36.930
(applauding)

00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:45.724
- All right!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.951
This whole thing started when I got hit

00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.701
in the head with a lunchbox
when I was like five.

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:53.210
(audience laughs)

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.865
I played hooky in kindergarten, right?

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:55.698
I didn't play hooky.

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:58.105
I didn't wanna eat a fuckin' lunch school,

00:00:58.105 --> 00:00:59.547
and they made you bring a lunch.

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:01.803
But on the corner was that hot dog dude

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:03.576
that had the fuckin' orange drinks

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:05.965
with the aluminum foil on top.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.488
For a dollar, you got like a hot dog

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:08.543
and one of those fuckin' drinks,

00:01:08.543 --> 00:01:10.543
you lost your mind.

00:01:10.543 --> 00:01:12.294
My option was after like three days

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:13.611
of bringin' my mother's lunch, I said,

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:15.416
"Fuck it, I'm gonna take the lunchbox,

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:17.954
"I'm gonna get a hot dog,
and take the lunchbox

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.207
"and dump it in the Central Park

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:21.804
"in that little lake with
the pigeons and shit.

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:23.836
"And I'll tell her I lost
it, and fuck, that's it,

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:26.728
"I'll just go on a hot dog diet
till I fuckin' die, right?"

00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:28.099
(audience laughs)

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.748
So, third day comes, I
snap, I say, "Fuck it."

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:33.683
I go up to the corner, I get a hot dog.

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:35.198
I walk to Central Park.

00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:37.913
I'm just about to dump this
fuckin' Beatle lunchbox,

00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:39.796
whatever the fuck it was in the thing,

00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:41.381
and these few little Irish Puerto Ricans

00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:42.847
dirty fucks come up to me, right?

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:43.822
(audience laughs)

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:45.681
And they're like, "What's in
the lunchbox, cocksucker?"

00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:46.826
And I'm like.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.747
So, I could have gave them the lunchbox,

00:01:48.747 --> 00:01:49.756
but my mother was goin' like,

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:51.405
"Don't let nobody fuck
with your lunchbox."

00:01:51.405 --> 00:01:52.590
(audience laughs)

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.737
So, somethin' in me, I'm like,

00:01:53.737 --> 00:01:55.368
"I'm not giving you
this fuckin' lunchbox."

00:01:55.368 --> 00:01:57.011
Just like that, I had like a sandwich

00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:59.734
in there, and chips and shit.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.330
I should correct myself,
they didn't hit me

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.243
with the lunchbox, they hit me

00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:04.237
with the fuckin' thermos in the head,

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:06.663
and you hear the glass and shit, right?

00:02:06.663 --> 00:02:08.485
So, at the time, I was like a little,

00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:09.462
that's was my first battle.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.617
See, you guys, you're young,

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:13.109
you don't remember Bruce Lee.

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.398
Before Bruce Lee, Chinese
people were very timid.

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:19.868
They walked around like
all fucked up and shit.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:21.743
Once Bruce Lee came, he changed everything

00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:23.581
for a lot of fuckin' people.

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.421
And I was one of 'em.

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.135
I was an immigrant, you
know what I'm saying?

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:28.204
I came from Cuba, I
didn't speak the language,

00:02:28.204 --> 00:02:31.204
but once Bruce Lee started
bitch slappin' motherfuckers,

00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:32.953
you had a spokesman if
you were an immigrant,

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:34.177
you know what I'm sayin'.

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:36.218
Even if you weren't
Chinese, it didn't matter,

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:38.036
you had a fuckin' spokesman now.

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:39.102
So, I was fired up.

00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:41.584
So, I lived on Bruce Lee,
kung fu, and those shit

00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:43.193
after I got hit in the head

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:44.875
with the fuckin' lunchbox, right?

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:47.021
And my mom was a single mom at the time,

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.767
so she made me stick
up for myself and shit.

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:51.926
But that wasn't nothin',
that was just a prequel

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:53.857
to what I was gonna go in to.

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:56.361
My mother, after a couple
of years of being single,

00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:58.255
she got scared because I
was always around women.

00:02:58.255 --> 00:02:59.096
My mom was hot and she had

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:01.581
hot little fuckin' dirty women around me,

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:02.414
(audience laughs)

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:03.877
so she was always worried about me

00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:05.891
that this kid's gonna be soft and shit.

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.631
So, she hooked up with this
fuckin' guy, Juan Tuero.

00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:10.941
And Juan Tuero was a
no-nonsense type of guy.

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:13.551
He moved in, and at night,
for some reason he'd stay

00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:15.804
in every night and make
me banana milkshakes,

00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:17.156
and he taught me how to be a man.

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.454
He'd teach me how to fold my clothes,

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:20.193
how to make my bed, how to wash myself

00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:22.995
and put underwear on,
how to put VO5 in my hair

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:24.751
and grease it back and shit.

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:26.801
Oh, this motherfucker was smooth.

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:28.409
And then at night, he'd
play the guitar for me

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.563
and sing Spanish songs, it was okay.

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:33.051
So, about three months into
it, I'm off for the summer.

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.907
he used to be a bookmaker in the Bronx,

00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:36.242
they had a dry cleaning operation

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:38.022
in the Bronx on Tremont Avenue.

00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:39.372
So, my mom woke up one day and she goes,

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:41.599
"You got an option, you
can go to Tremont with him,

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.939
"or you come to the Met game with me."

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.722
Now, my mom was a big
motherfuckin' Met fan.

00:03:45.722 --> 00:03:47.989
We wouldn't even take a
car, she was a Met fan.

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:48.822
She didn't wanna fuck around,

00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.261
she wanted to make the national anthem

00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.109
and batting practice, so she'd take a cab.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.450
So, my mom was a serious
fuckin' crazy bitch.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.244
When she got in a cab, it would be 1970,

00:03:58.244 --> 00:03:59.841
she'd throw a ten-spot on ya just

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:01.863
so there'd be no misunderstandings.

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.334
Like, this is the direction
we're fuckin' takin', okay?

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:06.270
This is the route, don't fuck around,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.440
I gave you a ten, put the clock on,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.053
and I'm gonna tip you over there.

00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:11.704
Don't worry, I'm gonna scratch my pussy

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:15.074
and smoke pot back here,
and drink and mix cocktails,

00:04:15.074 --> 00:04:17.304
but don't worry about
me, it's me and my son.

00:04:17.304 --> 00:04:18.910
And my mom was fuckin' wackadoo.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.884
So, she gives the guy a fuckin' ten,

00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:22.599
we're on the way, and the guy decides

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.656
to take a better route.

00:04:23.656 --> 00:04:25.522
What a fuckin' mistake.

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:26.773
What a fuckin' mistake.

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:27.909
He hits traffic.

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.092
So, now him and her are arguin',

00:04:29.092 --> 00:04:31.006
and this is when, and
no offense to nobody,

00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:32.374
but this was before
fuckin' immigrants came,

00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:34.713
like this was when there
was white cab drivers.

00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:37.009
This guy was like fuckin' "Taxi Driver".

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.356
He was a white dude,
with like fuckin' glasses

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:41.474
and a beard, he was a burly guy.

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:43.780
So, they get into an argument on this BQE

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.379
or whatever the fuck they're goin'.

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.015
And my mother makes him pull off.

00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:48.756
So, she goes, "I want my $20 back."

00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:50.209
They started arguin' about the $20,

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:51.972
the $10, whatever the fuck it was.

00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:54.026
And the guy's like, "I'm not
gonna give you the money back."

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:55.545
So, my mom goes, "Fuck it, all right."

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.889
So, she gets me out of the cab,

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.941
and the guy opens his door,
what a fuckin' mistake.

00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.368
And my mom pushes him, and
takes the ignition keys out.

00:05:04.368 --> 00:05:06.297
And in doin' so, she cuts her hand,

00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:09.102
big fuckin' mistake for
this cab driver, right?

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:11.583
So, my mom knew how to work
the fuckin' blood angle.

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:12.917
So, I'm like, "Ma, you're bleeding."

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:13.750
She's like, "Don't worry about it.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.638
"I'm gonna call the fuckin' police."

00:05:14.638 --> 00:05:15.779
I knew deep down in my heart,

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.967
my mom wasn't callin'
no fuckin' cops, right?

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:19.216
So, she goes to the pay phone,

00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:20.827
she's wipin' the blood on her face.

00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:21.660
(audience laughs)

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.714
She's a badass bitch,
that's a Cuban Jewish woman.

00:05:24.714 --> 00:05:27.415
She knows there's a payday comin', right?

00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:29.613
She's wiping that fuckin'
blood on her face.

00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:31.658
She looks like fuckin' Carrie, right,

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:34.319
when she got hit with a bucket, right?

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.056
I can't believe they remade "Carrie".

00:05:36.056 --> 00:05:37.795
Is nothing fucking sacred?

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:39.843
Is nothing fucking sacred?

00:05:39.843 --> 00:05:41.790
Julianne Moore, you cocksucker.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.207
(applauding)

00:05:46.154 --> 00:05:48.134
My mother's on the phone, right?

00:05:48.134 --> 00:05:49.444
But I hear her talkin' in Spanish.

00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:51.331
The police department, they
don't talk fuckin' Spanish.

00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:53.034
It's 1970, right?

00:05:53.034 --> 00:05:53.867
They don't talk Spanish.

00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:54.700
So, she hangs up the phone,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.557
and she's tellin' the motherfucker,

00:05:55.557 --> 00:05:57.499
"The cops are comin', bitch, sit tight."

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.480
And this schmuck is
actually believing my mom.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.240
He's sittin' there waitin'
for the cops with no ignition.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.362
So, my mom had this dry cleaner
slash bookmakin' operation

00:06:07.362 --> 00:06:10.281
on top of the dry cleaner,
and her partner was Nelson,

00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.550
and then my dad worked
for my mom in that office.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.756
So, about 10 minutes in,
I see the Mustang pull up,

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:18.110
and it's Nelson drivin', the Puerto Rican,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.727
and my step-dad's in the passenger seat.

00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:21.412
And they get out of the fuckin' car,

00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:23.916
and I run over like a
little fuckin' half a fag,

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.701
I run over and grab my dad.

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:26.692
I'm like, "You're not gonna believe it,

00:06:26.692 --> 00:06:29.430
"he hit Mommy, oh my
God," and all this shit.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.842
And Juan walks over to my mom,

00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:32.284
and he sees the fuckin' blood.

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:34.474
And I had known him at this
point, maybe six months.

00:06:34.474 --> 00:06:36.488
His demeanor just changed.

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:38.877
Like he just got fuckin'
pale when he saw the blood.

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:40.546
Like he couldn't fuckin' believe it.

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:42.384
And he just looked at the cab driver,

00:06:42.384 --> 00:06:43.647
and he grabbed me by the hand.

00:06:43.647 --> 00:06:45.806
So, I walked up to the
cab driver with him.

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.966
And he didn't speak no English, right?

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:49.439
He spoke like broken English, like,

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.485
"Hey, what happen here?"

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:51.627
Whatever the fuck, right?

00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:53.611
(audience laughs)

00:06:53.611 --> 00:06:54.884
What happen here?

00:06:54.884 --> 00:06:56.930
(speaks in foreign language)

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.139
What happen here?

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.565
What happen, I wanna know what happen?

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:01.399
(speaks in foreign language)

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.232
How you say, what happen?

00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:03.419
What happen here?

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.450
(audience laughs)

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.867
What happen here?

00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:10.516
So, the cab driver's, "That fuckin' bitch,

00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:12.218
"she fuckin' took the keys."

00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:13.051
And one thing leads to another.

00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:15.323
Now, the guy had glasses, all right?

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:18.122
Now, one thing for sure, I
was in the PAL on the corner,

00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:19.275
the Police Athletic League,

00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:20.863
and that's the first thing they teach ya.

00:07:20.863 --> 00:07:22.552
Don't hit nobody with glasses.

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:25.320
And I was like sendin' it to
him telepathically like Carrie.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.161
I was sayin', "Don't hit a
motherfucker with glasses."

00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:29.181
So, he was holdin' my hand,

00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:30.804
all of a sudden finally,
he let go of my hand,

00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:33.271
and he pushed me like an inch,

00:07:33.271 --> 00:07:34.894
like just a fuckin' inch,

00:07:34.894 --> 00:07:36.205
and he just went at this guy.

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:37.693
Guys, it was beautiful.

00:07:37.693 --> 00:07:40.356
He just started fuckin'
punchin' this motherfucker,

00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:42.070
pulled him down, he's punchin' him right

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.580
in the fuckin' Queens, just
punchin' him in the face.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.519
It's New York in the 70s,
nobody's sayin' dick.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:49.006
People just walkin' by.

00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:51.221
He's just punchin' this motherfucker.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.369
He's got him the fuck down,

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:55.459
and he's just hittin'
him, you motherfucker.

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:56.873
And the guys head is bangin',

00:07:56.873 --> 00:07:59.422
and I'm like droolin',
I'm fuckin' lovin' this.

00:07:59.422 --> 00:08:01.310
Bruce Lee can suck my dick.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.801
(audience laughs)

00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:05.811
My step-father's the king
of New York, motherfucker.

00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:06.964
Fuck Bruce Lee.

00:08:06.964 --> 00:08:09.917
That's the movies, this is the bad Bronx.

00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:13.043
And he's fuckin' this
motherfucker up, right?

00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:15.369
And Nelson's standin' there,
my mom's standin' there

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.622
like nothin', and I'm like, "Ha ha ha ha."

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.497
And we're all fuckin' standin' there.

00:08:19.497 --> 00:08:21.017
(audience laughs)

00:08:21.017 --> 00:08:22.463
And the next thing you know,

00:08:22.463 --> 00:08:24.932
the cops really come, right?

00:08:24.932 --> 00:08:26.527
But the car was double parked,

00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:28.038
the cab was double parked,

00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:30.079
and they couldn't see
the guy gettin' beat up.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.981
So, they got out like 20 feet away.

00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:34.524
And they got out like to see
what the disturbance was.

00:08:34.524 --> 00:08:37.540
But Nelson and my
step-dad were too badass.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.957
They got up and I saw Juan do like a dip.

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:43.859
And I go, "This motherfucker's got a gun,

00:08:43.859 --> 00:08:45.728
"and they're gonna shoot the cops, right?"

00:08:45.728 --> 00:08:49.076
No, he was goin' in his pocket,

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:51.647
and he did somethin'
and he cupped his hand,

00:08:51.647 --> 00:08:53.983
and he greeted the cops.

00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:55.092
And when they both went up to him,

00:08:55.092 --> 00:08:56.211
he just shook the cop's hand,

00:08:56.211 --> 00:08:58.211
but he blocked the guy on the floor.

00:08:58.211 --> 00:09:00.050
It was fuckin' beautiful.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.900
The guy's on the floor
squirmin' for his life.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.900
(moans)

00:09:05.747 --> 00:09:06.798
And Juan and Nelson are like,

00:09:06.798 --> 00:09:08.174
"Fuckin' beautiful day today, huh?"

00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:10.397
And all of a sudden his
English was perfect.

00:09:10.397 --> 00:09:12.427
(audience laughs)

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:15.234
What a beautiful fuckin' day today, huh?

00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:16.416
And they're goin' back and forth,

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:18.155
talking about the Mets and the Yankees,

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:19.882
and finally after eight
minutes, the cops goes,

00:09:19.882 --> 00:09:21.887
"What's wrong with that guy?"

00:09:21.887 --> 00:09:23.858
He got in an argument with my wife.

00:09:23.858 --> 00:09:26.939
He came out and he fell or some shit.

00:09:26.939 --> 00:09:28.085
And that was the end of that, they go,

00:09:28.085 --> 00:09:29.615
"Fuck him," and they got in their cop car.

00:09:29.615 --> 00:09:31.503
(applauding)

00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:33.396
And here's the beauty of it.

00:09:33.396 --> 00:09:36.139
We never talked about it.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:38.235
Half of you motherfuckers got
to have like a family meeting,

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:40.258
what you saw today will
never happen again.

00:09:40.258 --> 00:09:41.813
(audience laughs)

00:09:41.813 --> 00:09:44.277
We never fuckin' talked about it again.

00:09:44.277 --> 00:09:45.809
Then I seen him throw a beatin' on a guy

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:48.607
like a year later for hittin' a dog.

00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:51.161
Right, I saw him fuckin'
destroy a guy for hittin' a dog.

00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:52.943
Then about a year later,
I saw him shoot a guy

00:09:52.943 --> 00:09:55.978
on 148th Street at a
Santeria Party, dig this one.

00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:58.478
(audience laughs)

00:09:58.478 --> 00:10:00.148
He shot him in the
fuckin' leg, I loved it.

00:10:00.148 --> 00:10:01.559
We even went to Riverside Drive

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.082
and threw the gun in the Hudson.

00:10:03.082 --> 00:10:04.788
We never talked about
that for years either.

00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:06.165
(audience laughs)

00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:08.691
In 2006, I was eatin' with
my step-father and I'm like,

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.478
"Hey, remember that time you
shot Nikko on 148th Street?"

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:13.601
He's like, "I have no fuckin' idea

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:14.434
(audience laughs)

00:10:14.434 --> 00:10:16.059
"what you're talkin' about."

00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:17.355
(applauding)

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:18.813
But it's weird because
it's funny and stuff,

00:10:18.813 --> 00:10:20.572
and you think about, you know,

00:10:20.572 --> 00:10:22.452
whenever like somethin'
happens at a school now,

00:10:22.452 --> 00:10:23.674
where there's like a prom with a kid,

00:10:23.674 --> 00:10:25.480
I always think about fuck,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.463
I grew up in a house with artillery,

00:10:27.463 --> 00:10:29.731
like this motherfucker had silences,

00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:31.643
he had fuckin' guns, he had knives,

00:10:31.643 --> 00:10:34.056
he was tremendous with a straight razor.

00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:36.324
Tremendous with a straight razor.

00:10:36.324 --> 00:10:37.777
Fuckin' amazing.

00:10:37.777 --> 00:10:40.311
I seen him shoot a guy one
time with the pepper spray.

00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:42.366
He was tremendous with pepper spray.

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:44.582
He was just a man of a thousand weapons.

00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:45.625
(audience laughs)

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:46.960
And I don't fuckin' shoot nobody.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.985
I don't carry weapons so
it didn't affect that way,

00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:51.323
But for years I thought,
"Was it gonna affect me?"

00:10:51.323 --> 00:10:52.749
And I got into fights and I got beat up.

00:10:52.749 --> 00:10:53.724
I'm no tough guy or nothin'.

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:54.792
But then somethin' weird happened.

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:58.985
I got married in 90, 'cause
I got this girl pregnant.

00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:01.151
(audience laughs)

00:11:01.151 --> 00:11:02.370
And it didn't work out, right?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.638
I went to prison, got out, knocked her up.

00:11:04.638 --> 00:11:06.769
And it didn't work, and
then we had a kid together.

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:08.952
So, I tried to be a father, you know.

00:11:08.952 --> 00:11:11.928
The divorce didn't work, it
was basically around this kid.

00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:13.011
She was four.

00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:16.756
And this is what I found
out about Juan afterward,

00:11:16.756 --> 00:11:17.738
like as I got older.

00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:19.904
That the reason why he babysat me at night

00:11:19.904 --> 00:11:22.637
was because he was on
parole for bookmakin'.

00:11:22.637 --> 00:11:24.717
Listen to how bad this motherfucker was.

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:27.438
He wasn't allowed in New Jersey.

00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:31.218
Lawrence Taylor is allowed in New Jersey.

00:11:31.218 --> 00:11:33.784
Tony Soprano is allowed in New Jersey.

00:11:33.784 --> 00:11:35.922
My step-father was not
allowed in fuckin' Jersey.

00:11:35.922 --> 00:11:37.683
Here's where it gets better.

00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:39.693
It's funny because 20 years later,

00:11:39.693 --> 00:11:41.803
I'm married, I'm going
through hell with this chick.

00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:42.761
And she's got a boyfriend who thought

00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:44.608
he was a fuckin' tough guy in Boulder.

00:11:44.608 --> 00:11:46.488
And he'd always say little things to me.

00:11:46.488 --> 00:11:48.309
And I knew I was gonna fuck the guy up,

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:49.266
it was just in time.

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:51.378
The problem was I had two felonies.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:52.443
I had two fuckin' felonies,

00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:53.734
so if you bitch slap somebody,

00:11:53.734 --> 00:11:55.114
you make it a good one.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:56.506
You gotta stab 'em and shit.

00:11:56.506 --> 00:11:57.868
(audience laughs)

00:11:57.868 --> 00:11:58.897
Because if you're walking on ice,

00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:00.560
you might as well dance, right?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.259
(audience laughs)

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:03.517
(applauding)

00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:04.618
And in the back of my mind,

00:12:04.618 --> 00:12:07.193
I was just startin' to do comedy,

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.669
and I had this new direction in my life.

00:12:08.669 --> 00:12:10.240
But I knew these motherfuckers
were gettin' away

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.760
with murder, and I knew I had

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.258
to do somethin' to this fuckin' guy.

00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:15.086
And I knew the day was gettin' close.

00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:16.336
So, one day, I pick up my child,

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:18.859
she four, at a daycare,
and we're drivin' home.

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:19.928
And I'm talkin' to her and she goes,

00:12:19.928 --> 00:12:21.572
"Daddy, what does spic mean?"

00:12:21.572 --> 00:12:23.642
And I go, "Fuckin' spic
is a derogatory word

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:24.565
"for Spanish people."

00:12:24.565 --> 00:12:26.576
It doesn't bother me
because I grew up in Jersey,

00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:28.350
I hear it all the fuckin' time.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.777
No biggie to me, but she
was in Boulder, Colorado.

00:12:30.777 --> 00:12:32.514
Why should she hear this word?

00:12:32.514 --> 00:12:33.378
And I go, "Where'd you hear it?"

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.504
And she goes, "Every
time you call the house,

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:35.988
"John calls you that."

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:38.503
That was her step-father's name.

00:12:38.503 --> 00:12:39.816
And I knew right then in the car

00:12:39.816 --> 00:12:41.506
I was gonna stab this
motherfucker that day.

00:12:41.506 --> 00:12:44.713
(audience laughs)

00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:47.033
So, I pulled over, I had to meet them.

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:47.959
I would pick up the kid at three

00:12:47.959 --> 00:12:49.939
and have her till seven on Wednesdays,

00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:50.927
then all day Sunday.

00:12:50.927 --> 00:12:52.780
Then this one Wednesday, I picked her up

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.336
and I had to drop her back off at seven,

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:55.665
and that was the day that the kid told me

00:12:55.665 --> 00:12:57.447
there was a spic thing, right?

00:12:57.447 --> 00:12:59.419
And I go, "Fuck it, this is
the day this guy's goin' down."

00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:02.050
So, I had to meet him at a Safeway.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.667
I pulled up to the
Safeway, and there he was

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:05.025
with his little fuckin' slippers on,

00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:06.872
his little fuckin' shirt on and shit.

00:13:06.872 --> 00:13:07.705
(audience laughs)

00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:09.250
And I got out and I left
the baby in the car.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.004
And I felt really bad,
I had the two felonies,

00:13:11.004 --> 00:13:12.029
and I go, "This is it."

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:12.862
I already had a plan.

00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:14.192
I was gonna bitch slap him,

00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:15.635
then I was gonna call my friends in Jersey

00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:17.587
to send me money for a fax machine,

00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:21.039
so I could fax Jay Leno jokes from prison.

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:23.189
I swear to God, I was
gonna do like three years,

00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:24.807
I was just gonna fax Jay Leno jokes.

00:13:24.807 --> 00:13:26.664
This was the fuckin' plan I had.

00:13:26.664 --> 00:13:27.532
I already had a plan.

00:13:27.532 --> 00:13:29.331
Some people go to prison
without a plan, okay?

00:13:29.331 --> 00:13:32.854
I was goin' to prison with a fuckin' plan.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:36.416
You laugh all you want,
motherfuckers, big difference.

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:38.520
So, I pull up to the Safeway and I look

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.025
at this motherfucker,
and I get out and I go,

00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:41.917
"John, I know we've had problems before,

00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:43.828
"but I gotta ask you a question.

00:13:43.828 --> 00:13:45.510
"Did you spic when I called the house?"

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.403
And he goes, "No, I didn't."

00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:48.973
I go, "Fuckin' John, she's four years old,

00:13:48.973 --> 00:13:50.596
"she's got blond fuckin'
hair and blue eyes,

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.658
"she couldn't hear that
at a fuckin' daycare,

00:13:52.658 --> 00:13:54.137
"'cause they call Mexicans beaners,

00:13:54.137 --> 00:13:56.200
"spic is never fuckin' used.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.417
"So, say it, and I'll let you

00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.631
"off the fuckin' hook real fuckin' easy."

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:01.920
And he looks at me and I can
tell he's gettin' nervous.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.184
And all of a sudden, he's
like, "I'm callin' the police."

00:14:03.184 --> 00:14:04.386
And I go, "Before you call the police,

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:05.855
"I'm gonna give you somethin' to go."

00:14:05.855 --> 00:14:07.704
And I stare him down
and I fuckin' punch him

00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:10.089
with everything I had, and
I felt really bad about it.

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:11.254
I hit him with everything I had.

00:14:11.254 --> 00:14:13.191
Everything bad that every
happened to me in my life,

00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:15.953
I took it out on this
cocksucker at that minute.

00:14:15.953 --> 00:14:17.769
And I punched him and he
looked at me all weird.

00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:19.263
And he goes, "I'm callin' the police."

00:14:19.263 --> 00:14:22.029
And I go, bam, one more fuckin' time.

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:23.800
And then some lady's like,
"I'm callin' the police."

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.974
Some fuckin' Republican, nosy bitch

00:14:25.974 --> 00:14:27.059
(audience laughs)

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:30.174
that should be minding
her fuckin' business.

00:14:30.174 --> 00:14:31.007
"I'm callin' the police."

00:14:31.007 --> 00:14:33.546
So, they all fuckin' call
the police on me and shit,

00:14:33.546 --> 00:14:36.061
like a bunch of fuckin' whatever.

00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:37.188
(audience laughs)

00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:38.979
So, I'm there with the
baby tryin' to play like,

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:41.617
you know, the good dad and
shit, even though I fucked up.

00:14:41.617 --> 00:14:42.913
And two cops pull up.

00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:44.971
But I knew the two cops,
'cause I worked on a car wash

00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:46.543
and they used to always come in.

00:14:46.543 --> 00:14:47.752
And we'd talk about the Broncos,

00:14:47.752 --> 00:14:49.970
whatever all the mind
fuck I had on my mind.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.248
And they come in, and
I'm like, "What's up?"

00:14:51.248 --> 00:14:52.538
And he's like 30 feet behind me,

00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:54.635
so I got to the cop first.

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:56.707
I'm tellin' 'em my story,
he called me a spic,

00:14:56.707 --> 00:14:59.148
you can't disrespect me,
you know, blah blah blah.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:00.302
And the cop's like, "No, no, no, Joey,

00:15:00.302 --> 00:15:02.894
"I got your back on this,
forget it, you're done."

00:15:02.894 --> 00:15:04.782
So he writes me a fuckin' ticket.

00:15:04.782 --> 00:15:06.403
Here I got these two felonies,

00:15:06.403 --> 00:15:08.224
I got like three joints in the car,

00:15:08.224 --> 00:15:09.372
my little daughter's in the car.

00:15:09.372 --> 00:15:11.542
This guy writes me a
ticket and lets me go.

00:15:11.542 --> 00:15:13.827
John's got an ice pack on his fuckin' eye.

00:15:13.827 --> 00:15:15.422
And when I look back, I fucked up,

00:15:15.422 --> 00:15:16.599
'cause my little girl was crying,

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:18.143
and that's where it gets ugly.

00:15:18.143 --> 00:15:19.645
I didn't fuckin' cry when I seen my dad

00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:21.748
beat up the fuckin' guy,
but times are changed.

00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:22.581
(audience laughs)

00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:24.396
Time are fuckin' changed.

00:15:24.396 --> 00:15:25.742
Thank you guys very much, goodnight.

00:15:25.742 --> 00:15:27.277
(applauding)

00:15:27.277 --> 00:15:30.110
(soft rock music)

00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:33.014
- Joey Diaz, everybody.

00:15:33.014 --> 00:15:34.030
That's the episode.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.225
Thank you, fuck yeah, Joey.

00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:36.058
Thanks for doin' that.

00:15:36.058 --> 00:15:37.635
He's the greatest storyteller
in the world, you guys.

00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:38.468
He's awesome.

00:15:38.468 --> 00:15:40.807
