00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
James was healthy professional, a father of
two. He had lots of friends, loved telling

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.180
jokes, and played softball on Sundays.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.430
Then one day, at the age of 45, he suffered
a stroke. He bounced back fairly quickly,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.860
with one major exception: He was no longer
able to speak. The stroke damaged a specific

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.270
area in the left hemisphere of his brain called
Broca’s area, and left him with what’s

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.140
known as Broca’s aphasia.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.819
Broca’s area is partly responsible for the
ability to produce and process language, and

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.319
Broca’s aphasia often leaves its sufferers
with some ability to understand speech, but

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.700
an inability to produce intelligible words.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.860
James could understand his wife when she asked
if he wanted cereal for breakfast, but he

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.110
could only respond by repeating the word “too”
-- although he could still intonate as though

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.790
he were speaking a whole sentence.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.190
Then, after some time and therapy, something
rather unexpected happened -- James regained

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.000
some ability to communicate through singing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.740
Broca’s aphasia can sometimes be treated
by teaching patients to sing, because singing

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.150
uses a different region of the brain -- one
that’s on the right side and that’s analogous

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.690
to Broca’s area on the left.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.920
So after some practice, James could sing words,
and he eventually relearned how to talk by

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.299
teaching the right side of his brain to speak
rather than sing.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.909
Whether it’s a stroke affecting your speech,
a tumor destroying your memory, a concussion

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.479
affecting your aggression, or that fateful iron
rod that shot straight through Phineas Gage’s

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.039
skull -- a lot of what we know about how the brain
works has come through studying injuries to it.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.100
And what we’ve learned so far is that, even
though it looks like a 1.4-kilogram lump of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.300
gray, congealed oatmeal, the brain is made up of
super-specific areas that have super-specific functions.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.160
You might actually say the same thing about
your brain that’s sometimes said about politics:

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.740
Everything is local.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.020
You’ll remember that our nervous system
is divided into two main networks that work

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.009
in harmony -- the central nervous system,
consisting of your amazing brain and spinal

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.000
cord, and the peripheral nervous system, made up of
the nerves coming out of that central nervous system.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.859
The central nervous system’s main game is
integrating the sensory information that the

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.240
peripheral system collects from all over the
body, and responding to it by coordinating

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.520
both conscious and unconscious activity.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.780
The sun is bright, so I’ll shade my eyes;
I’m hungry, so I’m calling the pizza man;

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.710
the phone is ringing, maybe I’ll answer it.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.300
All these sensations, thoughts, and directions
process through this two-part system.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.800
It’s the brain, of course, that sorts out
all that sensory information and gives orders.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.180
It also carries out your most complex functions,
like thinking, and feeling, and remembering.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.750
Meanwhile, your spinal cord conducts two-way
signals between your brain and the rest of

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.420
your body, while also governing basic muscle
reflexes and patterns that don’t need your

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.040
brain’s blessing to work -- this is how
a chicken can still run around even if the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.560
poor thing has been decapitated.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.100
Both your spinal cord and brain are made of
fragile, jelly-like nervous tissue that is

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.150
extremely susceptible to injury.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.580
So all that goo is well-protected by the bones
of your vertebrae and cranium, as well as

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.680
membrane layers, or meninges, before being bathed
in a cushy waterbed of clear cerebrospinal fluid.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.460
This fluid actually allows your brain to float
somewhat in your skull, reducing its weight

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.350
and letting it slosh around while you and
your head are free to move.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.300
But even with all that extra protection, your
brain is still vulnerable. And one thing James’s

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.670
story taught us is that its vulnerabilities
can be incredibly specific, because your brain

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.890
is divided into specialized regions that may, or may not,
interact with each other to produce a given action.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.910
We can better understand this division of
labor by looking at how the brain first develops

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.690
into its main component parts.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.740
Inside a developing embryo, the central nervous
system starts off as a humble little neural tube.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.200
Soon the caudal, or lower, end of the tube
stretches out, forming the spinal cord, while

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.470
the cranial end begins to expand, divide,
and enlarge into three primary brain vesicles,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.840
or interconnected chambers.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.400
This is kind of your proto-brain.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.430
We call these chambers the prosencephalon,
the mesencephalon, and the rhombencephalon

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.500
-- or forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.560
By an embryo’s fifth week of development,
these main three chambers start morphing into

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.229
five secondary vesicles that essentially form the roots
of what will become your grown-up brain structures.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.680
The prosencephalon divides into two sections
-- the telencephalon and the diencephalon.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.860
The rhombencephalon forms into another pair,
called the metencephalon and the myelencephalon.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.900
And in between, the mesencephalon, thanks
to evolution, remains undivided.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.280
The real action starts as these five secondary
vesicles start developing into the major adult

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.820
brain regions that you might be more familiar
with -- the brainstem, the cerebellum, the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.180
diencephalon, also known as the interbrain,
and finally the cerebral hemispheres.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.840
But, in order to go from a simple tube into
that classic, wrinkly icon we think of as

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.260
the “brain,” each of these five vesicles
grows in different ways. Basically, some develop

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.290
a lot more than others.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.760
The least dramatic changes occur in the three
most caudal or lower sections: the mesencephalon,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.340
the metencephalon, and the myelencephalon.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.560
They go on to form the cerebellum, which mostly helps
coordinate muscular activity, and the brainstem,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.980
which plays a vital role in relaying information
between the body and the higher regions of the brain.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.200
The brainstem actually has three main components
-- and I know this is getting to be a lot

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.889
of vocabulary here -- you have the midbrain,
the pons, and the medulla oblongata. Together

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.409
they regulate many of the most basic, vital involuntary
functions, like keeping your heart on pace, keeping

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.560
your lungs working, and controlling things like sleep,
and appetite, and pain sensitivity, and awareness.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.120
But of the three brainstem parts, it’s your midbrain
that carries out the higher-level functions.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.090
Like, when your eyes track a fast moving object,
or when you look behind you after hearing

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.260
some sudden loud sound, it’s the midbrain
that receives and processes that sensory information

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.730
and sends out the reflexive motor signals,
so you react without thinking.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.330
The midbrain also passes that data to regions
like the cerebral cortex, which do the actual

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.389
conscious thinking about the stimuli, like
“What is that thing whizzing across the sky?”

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.400
or “WHAT JUST EXPLODED BEHIND ME?!”

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.360
So with the brainstem and cerebellum covering
your basic life and motor functions, you start

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.980
to see somewhat more complex tasks being carried
out in the next major brain structure, the diencephalon.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.640
This is where you find the thalamus, hypothalamus,
epithalamus, and the mammillary bodies, which

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.500
regulate things like homeostasis, alertness,
and reproductive activity. Here we also find

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.320
part of the limbic system, which is a center
for strong emotions, like fear.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.880
This area is sometimes called the “reptilian
brain” because we share it with some of

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.980
our less philosophical animal brethren like
lizards and fish.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.790
I’m not putting these guys down, but by
our standards, they don’t think so much

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.930
as focus on the more instinctual pursuits
that are ruled by the caudal regions of the

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.340
brain -- eat, drink, sleep, mate, stay safe.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.340
All those things are awesome. But it wasn’t
until the appearance of birds and mammals

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.400
that some animals’ brains came to be dominated
by the last of the five vesicles, the telencephalon.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.090
During your brain’s growth, the telencephalon
undergoes the biggest changes of all, as it

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.180
develops into the most brainy part of your
brain -- the two classic, walnut-looking hemispheres

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.440
we collectively call the cerebrum, that cover the
rest of your brain like a mushroom cap on its stalk.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.660
That’s the cerebrum -- not to be confused with
Cerebro, which is Professor X’s telepathy-enhancing

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.979
device -- and it is the largest region of the
brain and performs the highest functions.

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:04.610
It’s made up of the wrinkled, outer layer
of “gray matter” called the cerebral cortex,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.330
and the inner squishy layer of “white matter”
beneath it.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.980
And it’s the cerebrum that rules our voluntary
movements and our most advanced tricks, like thinking,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.419
and learning, and regulating and recognizing emotions,
and experiencing consciousness in general.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.459
You’ll remember that higher processing requires lots
of synapses, which require lots of nervous tissue. 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.940
So as the cerebrum grew through evolutionary time,
it got more massive but our skull didn’t exactly keep up.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.919
So in order to squeeze all that material into
your skull, the brain forms little creases,

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.859
called gyri, and larger grooves, or sulci, giving
it more folds than than an origami pineapple.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.020
And although a big fissure separates the left
and right hemispheres, the two halves communicate,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.169
through a series of myelinated axon fibers
called the corpus callosum.

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:49.610
And each hemisphere has other, smaller fissures
that divide it into lobes -- each with a different

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.889
set of major functions.

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.150
The frontal lobe, for example, governs muscle
control and cognitive functions like planning

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.870
for the future, concentration, and preventing
socially unacceptable behaviors.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.919
In most people, this area doesn’t finish
developing until after the teenage years,

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:07.430
which tells you a lot about the teenage years.
Since Broca’s area lives in this lobe in

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.460
the left hemisphere, it also is important
in language comprehension and speech.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.800
If you’re enjoying a beautiful sunset, you
can thank your occipital lobe at the back

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.540
of your head for processing those bright visual
cues.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.169
And the next time you step on a lego, you
can curse your parietal lobe, which processes

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:25.090
the sensations of touch, pain, and pressure.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.729
Meanwhile the temporal lobe helps sort out
auditory information, including language.

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:34.520
It contains Wernicke’s area -- another important
region of the brain associated with the production

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.520
of written and spoken language.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.610
This part of the limbic system includes your
short-term memory keeper, the hippocampus,

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.899
and the emotional amygdala, which controls
sexual and social behavior. So, if you damage

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:48.060
the wrong part of your temporal lobe, you
may never again be able to remember what you

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.660
ate for lunch… or you might suddenly become
a total jerk who kicks kittens and cuts in line.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.990
We could do a whole course on the finer-grained
functions and consequences of malfunction

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.600
in every bit of brain in your gourd,
but, well, we can’t do that today.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.690
And you got to remember that, when it comes
to your body, no organ or system is an island.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.240
Your brain would be pretty useless if it weren’t
hooked up to the outside world. That’s where

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.910
the peripheral nervous system comes in, which
we’ll be spending the next few lessons exploring.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.800
Meanwhile, you learned today about the central
nervous system and how important location

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.750
is to brain function. We looked at how the
brain develops from an unassuming neural tube

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:25.680
into three primary vesicles, and then five
secondary vesicles, and finally into our complex

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.300
set of four adult structures and their basic
functions.
