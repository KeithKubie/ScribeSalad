where you live it's a nightmare
there's no doubt we could do a lot to

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:18.519
there's no doubt we could do a lot to
 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.909
there's no doubt we could do a lot to
simplify our tax system but we could

simplify our tax system but we could
 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.439
simplify our tax system but we could
also do a lot of other things to change

also do a lot of other things to change
 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.599
also do a lot of other things to change
it too and the fact is we haven't really

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609
it too and the fact is we haven't really
 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.579
it too and the fact is we haven't really
made a major change in our tax system

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589
made a major change in our tax system
 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.499

for about a hundred years it's been a
 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.669
for about a hundred years it's been a
hundred years since we got a

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679
hundred years since we got a
 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.469
hundred years since we got a
constitutional amendment just so we

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:31.479
constitutional amendment just so we
 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.480
constitutional amendment just so we
could have an income tax now maybe it's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490
could have an income tax now maybe it's
 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.340
could have an income tax now maybe it's
time to consider how we would refit our

time to consider how we would refit our
 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.950

tax system for the 21st century one
 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.870
tax system for the 21st century one
thing we could do is get rid of the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880
thing we could do is get rid of the
 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.790
thing we could do is get rid of the
corporate income tax that's right the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800
corporate income tax that's right the
 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.860
corporate income tax that's right the
tax on corporate profits why

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870
tax on corporate profits why
 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.350
tax on corporate profits why

companies we don't know it could be a

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410
companies we don't know it could be a
 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.740
companies we don't know it could be a
mix of all of them and that means that

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750
mix of all of them and that means that
 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.090
mix of all of them and that means that
we really don't know who's bearing

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100
we really don't know who's bearing
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.040
we really don't know who's bearing
burden another problem with the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050
burden another problem with the
 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.390
burden another problem with the
corporate income tax is it's extremely

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400
corporate income tax is it's extremely
 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.090
corporate income tax is it's extremely
volatile unlike your household where you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100
volatile unlike your household where you
 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.919
volatile unlike your household where you
pay taxes no matter what whether or not

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929
pay taxes no matter what whether or not
 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.899
pay taxes no matter what whether or not
you spent all your income or not when a

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
you spent all your income or not when a
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.149
you spent all your income or not when a
company spends all its income it has no

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159
company spends all its income it has no
 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.980
company spends all its income it has no
profits and it doesn't pay any corporate

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990
profits and it doesn't pay any corporate
 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.139
profits and it doesn't pay any corporate
income tax so that means the corporate

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149
income tax so that means the corporate
 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.569
income tax so that means the corporate
income tax revenue is really volatile in

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579
income tax revenue is really volatile in
 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.819
income tax revenue is really volatile in
years when the economy is doing great we

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829
years when the economy is doing great we
 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.349
years when the economy is doing great we
collect a lot of corporate income tax

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359
collect a lot of corporate income tax
 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.450
collect a lot of corporate income tax
revenue when it's doing badly we collect

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460
revenue when it's doing badly we collect
 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.099
revenue when it's doing badly we collect
much less and that means it's much

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109
much less and that means it's much
 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.870
much less and that means it's much
harder for the government to plan it's

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880
harder for the government to plan it's
 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.609
harder for the government to plan it's
much harder for us to make sure that we

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619
much harder for us to make sure that we
 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.679
much harder for us to make sure that we
get a steady stream of revenue from year

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689
get a steady stream of revenue from year
 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.629
get a steady stream of revenue from year
to year and we don't have to cut back on

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:33.639
to year and we don't have to cut back on
 

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:36.690
to year and we don't have to cut back on
spending during a downturn so what could

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700
spending during a downturn so what could
 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.739
spending during a downturn so what could
we do to replace it

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749
we do to replace it
 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.649
we do to replace it
well one idea would be to change our

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659
well one idea would be to change our
 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.260
well one idea would be to change our
income tax into a sort of hybrid income

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270
income tax into a sort of hybrid income
 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.449
income tax into a sort of hybrid income
and wealth tax so we would still be

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459
and wealth tax so we would still be
 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.849
and wealth tax so we would still be
taxing some of the owners of capital in

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859
taxing some of the owners of capital in
 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.379
taxing some of the owners of capital in
this country and not just people who

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389
this country and not just people who
 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.239
this country and not just people who
owned labor and supply that into the

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249
owned labor and supply that into the
 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.639
owned labor and supply that into the
workforce how would it work well we

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649
workforce how would it work well we
 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.319
workforce how would it work well we
would have a sliding scale where

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329
would have a sliding scale where
 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.269
would have a sliding scale where
depending on your wealth you would pay

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:57.279
depending on your wealth you would pay
 

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.370
depending on your wealth you would pay
different rates of income tax if you

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380
different rates of income tax if you
 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.289
different rates of income tax if you
didn't have any income coming off your

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299
didn't have any income coming off your
 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.359
didn't have any income coming off your
wealth then you wouldn't pay any tax but

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369
wealth then you wouldn't pay any tax but
 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.249
wealth then you wouldn't pay any tax but
the more wealth you had the higher tax

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259
the more wealth you had the higher tax
 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.440
the more wealth you had the higher tax
rate you'd be liable to pay the great

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450
rate you'd be liable to pay the great
 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.540
rate you'd be liable to pay the great
thing about this is if you hold income

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550
thing about this is if you hold income
 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.520
thing about this is if you hold income
constant then you're always facing the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530
constant then you're always facing the
 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.500
constant then you're always facing the
same marginal tax rate that's intact

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
same marginal tax rate that's intact
 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.630
same marginal tax rate that's intact
Reitan the next dollar of your wealth if

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
Reitan the next dollar of your wealth if
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.580
Reitan the next dollar of your wealth if
you hold wealth constant it's always the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
you hold wealth constant it's always the
 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.619
you hold wealth constant it's always the
same marginal tax rate on your income so

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629
same marginal tax rate on your income so
 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.630
same marginal tax rate on your income so
that distortions on the behavior that we

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
that distortions on the behavior that we
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.190
that distortions on the behavior that we
might have and where we invest in how we

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
might have and where we invest in how we
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.490
might have and where we invest in how we
work are minimized now is this too crazy

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
work are minimized now is this too crazy
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.190
work are minimized now is this too crazy
on the idea to be implemented in the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
on the idea to be implemented in the
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.319
on the idea to be implemented in the
21st century some people might even say

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329
21st century some people might even say
 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.270
21st century some people might even say
it's unconstitutional but it's at least

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
it's unconstitutional but it's at least
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.860
it's unconstitutional but it's at least
worth thinking about it because we've

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870
worth thinking about it because we've
 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.410
worth thinking about it because we've
done so little to change the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
done so little to change the
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.670
done so little to change the
fundamentals of our tax system for a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
fundamentals of our tax system for a
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.130
fundamentals of our tax system for a
century all we've been doing is messing

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140
century all we've been doing is messing
 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.690
century all we've been doing is messing
with these little details that just add

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
with these little details that just add
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.729
with these little details that just add
more lines to the tax form let's do

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739
more lines to the tax form let's do
 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.470
more lines to the tax form let's do
something major and clean it up for the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480
something major and clean it up for the
 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.870
something major and clean it up for the
next century
