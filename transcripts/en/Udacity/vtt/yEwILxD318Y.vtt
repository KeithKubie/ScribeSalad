00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.170
In this class we discuss different ways
of showing information to the user.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.689
But you might be confused as to
which is the most appropriate for

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:07.620
different situations.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.290
See here's a quick run down of when
to use each one of the following.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.360
Notifications, regular activity,
always-on activity or watch face.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.260
Let's discuss why you'd
use one over the other.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.580
Notifications are best when you need
to get the user's attention right now.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.200
You have a picnic coming
up in ten minutes so

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.410
you need to do something
about this straight away.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.300
The information will probably
be out of date after an hour.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.080
Notifications will cause
the wearable to vibrate ensuring

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.520
the user then glances at the device
to see what they need to know.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.080
Regular activities are great when
you need to take care of some

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.270
action right now.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.430
Such as sending a text
message to a friend.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.330
You want the activity to take over the
whole display, show what you just spoke,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.380
send the message, and then disappear.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.280
You might also want to get more detail
about the weather for the week.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.980
You can scroll through a list to see
what the temperatures are for each day.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.120
But this is not something you want to
always be visible when the user is busy

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.340
doing other things.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.550
These regular activities will disappear
when the watch goes into ambient mode

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.435
and the default watch
face will then be shown.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:08.260
Always-on activities are special
because when the watch goes into

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.810
ambient mode after a timeout,
the app continues to run but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.340
the display goes into a low power mode.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.030
The app draws itself
with much lower detail so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.240
it looks good with a reduced
number of pixels illuminated.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.170
This would be great for
a navigation app.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.580
When the user is not looking at
the display, the user saves power, but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.450
the interface is ready to
be resumed to this one here

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.060
whenever the user wakes it up.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.700
The user can dismiss the always-on
app when they have finished the task

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.750
they're performing.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.810
But then they can control how
long this task happens for.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.460
And finally, there are watch faces.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.220
These are selected by the user
as the default watch face, and

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.170
the wearable shows this whenever
there is nothing else to show.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.470
The user is going to be glancing at this
all day to find out what time it is, and

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.910
what important things there are that
are going on in their lives.
