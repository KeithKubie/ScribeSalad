00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.469
I'm not feeling so good. *cough* *cough* I
guess I should go to work!

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.039
sickos
Flu season is serious, and it's different

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.359
every year, which is why we keep needing flu
shots. But flu shots don't stop every infection

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.810
every time, which is why WHEN YOU'RE SICK
STAY HOME. Trust me, no one is so important

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.469
at their job that they can get everyone sick.
"Oh, Trace, I'll just go sit at my desk, no

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:33.469
one will get sick!

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:34.469
I just won't touch them!"

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.469
WRONG.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.879
A study by the American Society for Microbiology
found within 2 to 4 hours of putting a little

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.520
contaminant on a doorknob, coffee pot handle,
or tabletop, 40 to 60 percent of workers were

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.760
infected. BOOM. One. Doorknob. They used a
virus called MS-2 which doesn't infect humans,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.120
but can spread in the same way as any human
pathogen; and the researchers said, quote,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.039
"It spread like crazy." The researchers tested
up to 100 fomites -- places where infections

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.049
can live, like "light switches, bed rails,
table tops, countertops, push buttons, coffee

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.619
pots handles, sink tap handles, door knobs,
phones and computer equipment" -- and found

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.830
them everywhere, and it only took hours to
get from a tabletop onto people's skin!

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.840
Virus contamination moves quickly and gets
on everything. This might come as a shock

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.729
to some of you, but the word "viral" comes
from how quickly viruses can spread… just

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.240
like an Ellen tweet from the Oscars. Hands
are everywhere, keyboards, desks and things

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.470
all over your school or office. Plus, you
touch your face an average of every three

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.470
minutes.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.500
In a natural environment -- not when an experimenter
puts it there -- viruses can survive on surfaces

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.210
for hours, or simply travel through the air.
When a sick coworker coughs or sneezes they're

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.100
throwing about 1.5 liters of air out of their
lungs and between 3,000 and 40,000 droplets

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.460
of saliva tainted with pathogens. If those
droplets are small enough, less than four

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.860
microns, they can live in the air, waiting
to be inhaled by passersby, even hours later.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.940
The larger droplets fall onto surfaces, where
they are picked up and moved around by human

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.940
activity…

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.590
When people touch a surface we pick up between
30 and 50 percent of the organisms on that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.739
surface. You're welcome for the nightmares.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.060
Remember, viruses and bacteria live in the
world all the time, we're constantly coming

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.459
in contact with them, not just around sick
people. The thing is, most are fought off

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.269
by the immune system every day, constantly;
this is actually a good thing, because it

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.800
keeps our defenses strong!

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.629
But once a sick person enters our midst those
sneeze and surface droplets aren't just testing

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.629
our defenses…

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.290
That person is carrying a pathogen that has
somehow circumvented their immune responses,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.160
so it can probably do the same to us!

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.709
Researchers at Cornell found people who come
to work sick account for 60 percent of health

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.430
costs for businesses. But why do people come
to work?

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.690
Because people can tell when you're absent.
Absenteeism is a serious issue for employee

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.890
productivity and thus is often studied, but
now science is catching on to presenteeism,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.340
or the act of working while sick. New studies
in this area have found, you're not helping,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.340
you're hurting!

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.370
One study in Population Health Management
found 1600 dollars are lost per employee annually

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.060
for presenteeism, and the Journal of Occupational
and Environmental Medicine found a 2.3 to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.190
1 ratio of productivity to medical costs…
it's actually cheaper for you to stay home

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.690
than to come to work!

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.480
PLUS you're not infecting other employees
(which drives costs up further). SO STAY HOME.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.269
STOP COMING TO THE OFFICE. We work in a digital-friendly
age, and at digital-friendly offices people

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.090
can often work from home, keeping their sickness
to themselves!

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.459
Which is important.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.700
In studies of people with chronic illnesses,
researchers find it's better to take a sick

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.220
day and be refreshed than work debilitated
without a break. Presenteeism is new, as is

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.700
the idea that we can work from home, so researchers
are struggling to find hard and fast costs

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.230
to support business policies; the Harvard
Business Review said "Without a standard tool

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.189
for measurement, 'there is a lot of confusion
about what we’re even measuring.'"

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.410
More research is needed, but in the meantime,
if you're sick, and you insist on being at

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.710
work, keep in mind, you're spreading your
sickness around; avoid physical contact others

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.669
and wash your hands often. If you're at work
with sick people and you're NOT sick. Make

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.949
sure you wash your hands often too, and be
aware of common fomites: the biggest being

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:32.949
handles (doors, but also the handles of microwaves,
coffee pots, fridges and sinks); also buttons

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:33.949
on water fountains, vending machines, and
keyboards. It's important to clean your surfaces

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:34.949
too!

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:35.949
I mean, by the numbers, keyboards are dirtier
than toilets!

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.270
But to be honest, the FEAR of these illnesses
spreads faster even than the disease. So don't

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.590
go bubble-boy on us; just be aware, wash your
hands, and you'll be fine.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.840
Plus, you're made of viruses, so you shouldn't
be THAT afraid of them. What, you… didn't

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840
know that??

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.330
Julia explains how you are completely filled
with viruses here

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:06.210
Do you go to work sick?!

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.210
WHY?!

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.210
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.820
Really, tell us your motivation, let's break
down some stereotypes. For example, contractors

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:21.690
don't get sick days; that's messed up!
