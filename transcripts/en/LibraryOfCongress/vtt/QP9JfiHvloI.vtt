00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.720
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.570
Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.380
My name is Betsy Peterson
and I'm the Director

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.270
of the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.860
And, on behalf of all the
staff and the library,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.380
I want to welcome you.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.110
We're very excited
about today's event

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.030
and very excited to
have you with us.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.670
And, before we move
along, I just wanted

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.350
to tell you a little bit about
the American Folklife Center

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.680
for those of you who don't know
that much about what we do.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.380
We are a center here
in the library,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.590
in fact in this very building.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.220
We were founded in 1976 by
Congress with the mandate

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.440
to preserve and present the rich
diversity of American Folklife

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.080
and we have strived hard for the
last 41 years to do just that.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.220
Now, Congress selected the
library itself as the site

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.730
for the center in part because
the library already had a pretty

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.150
significant archive of
traditional music and culture,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.970
which had in fact been
established in 1928.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.450
So, it was already pretty darn
big by the time we started

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.870
and it has only grown in
magnitude in the last 40 years.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.990
We now have over six
million items of recordings

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.870
of traditional culture,
traditional music,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.130
stories from over a hundred 140
countries throughout the world

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.540
and I certainly I want
to invite you to come

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.840
and listen to some of it.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.400
But, the other reason that I
think they selected the Library

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.710
of Congress is because it
is, it's America's library

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.000
and it has a strong commitment
to preserving the rich diversity

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.610
of voices in the United States
and indeed throughout the world.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.690
And, I think this even today is
very much about that commitment.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.900
So, one of the ways in which we
continue to grow our archives

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.500
in - in the last few decades is
certainly through partnerships

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.970
and partnerships with other
organizations, other individuals

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.720
and I think today's event is
very much about that as well.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.410
And, I do want to thank our
partners for this event today.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.340
The Muslim American
Leadership Alliance.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.080
Thank you very much.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.530
And, thank you very
much to Zainab Khan.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.180
I don't know where Zainab
- ah, you're right there.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.480
Right in front of me.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.090
And, Naeem Uddin
[assumed spelling].

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.270
I do - I don't know
if Naeem is here.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.910
Oh, welcome.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.710
I - I gather you came all
the way from New Orleans, so.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.380
Welcome. And, I also would

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.670
like to acknowledge Mohammed
Aziz [assumed spelling],

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.140
who I hope is here.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.470
I believe he is one
of the board members.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.310
Ah, okay. Welcome and thank you.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.780
I also want to acknowledge
StoryCorps [assumed spelling]

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.400
who is one of the other
very critical partners in -

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.800
in this event today and in this
project that Zainab is going

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.670
to tell us a little
bit more about.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.890
So, once again thank you to
our staff, thank you Zainab,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.170
thank you MALA, and
thank you StoryCorps

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.510
and welcome once again.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:54.870
[ Applause ]

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.880
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody
and thank you so much

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.520
for taking the time out and
joining us this afternoon

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.950
for what I hope is a very, very
compelling program that each

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.960
of you can understand
how much heart and soul

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.720
and effort was put into it.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.530
For the past two and
a half years, MALA,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.340
Muslim American Leadership
Alliance, has really,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.950
really worked hard to collect
archive and preserve the stories

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.860
of diverse Muslim Americans.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.440
And, what I really noticed was

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.970
that as a Muslim
American myself,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.610
I felt that my voice
didn't belong.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.590
I didn't know where
my story would belong

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.990
and where my voice
would be accepted.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.720
And, hence, a group of us had
started the Muslim American

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.910
Leadership Alliance
and we're very proud

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.480
to showcase the narratives
on the collection

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.230
of stories that we have today.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.860
MALA is a 501C3 Civic and
Community Organization

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.050
and we're committed to promote
individual freedom diversity

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.620
and to celebrate heritage.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.320
Our core storytelling program is

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.350
to amplify voices
of Muslim Americans.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.650
Really when you think about it,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.430
Muslim Americans are the most
broadest and diverse group

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.040
in America, holding the
broadest range of diversity

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.040
across ethnicities,
nationalities,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.820
various demographics
in this country.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.780
These stories are a prime
example of liberating new voices

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.270
from behind a cloud of
stereotypes, the stereotypes

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.520
that have come from
within the community,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.390
stereotypes that have
come from the media

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.190
and actually providing
people a platform

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.770
to share their personal
individual experiences.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.500
To date, MALA has collected,
archived and preserved

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.070
over 350 stories of
Muslim Americans and many

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.940
of these stories were also
archived into the Library

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.430
of Congress and really through
our community partnership

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.160
with StoryCorps, several were
even aired on NPR programs.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.410
And, as you listen
to these stories,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.860
you'll hear just a small
sample of what we've been able

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.420
to produce that presents just
the vast diverse experiences

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.610
that really make us human.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.900
These are stories of people that
hail from Kazakhstan, Albania,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:37.380
Algeria, Siberia even, India,
Iraq, Iran, Israel, Somalia,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.540
Mauritania, Mali,
Nigeria, Morocco, France -

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.440
pretty much every country
- Palestine, Yemen,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.630
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.080
All of these people
hailed from these countries

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.340
yet have shared their
story as Muslim Americans.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.010
And, I really hope that
these stories will continue

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.810
to have an incredible
potential to harness engagement

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.070
and build bridges all while
stressing the importance

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.470
of inclusion and individuality.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.350
I want to thank the
American Folklife Center

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.730
for providing us the
opportunity to hold

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.130
such a significant event.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.310
I want to thank StoryCorps
for over two and a half years

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.360
of partnership as
we continue to grow

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.730
and record stories all
throughout America.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.460
And, I want to thank the
Library of Congress also

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.030
for providing us this incredible
opportunity for generations

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.070
to come to come back and listen
to these stories and have pride

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.270
in the personal experiences,
whether they are triumphs,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.240
adversities, struggles,
they are human journeys

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.010
and they ought to be recognized.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.600
We will now play a
sample compilation of some

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.650
of the stories that have
been produced and even aired

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.940
in partnership with
StoryCorps and NPR.

[ Music ]

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.690
&gt;&gt; I was born in Algeria.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.850
My parents were elementary
school teachers from Syria

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.850
who during the post-independence
period

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.480
in Algeria taught
Arabic and Algeria.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.220
So, I was born there and
then we went back to Syria

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.960
and I was raised in
Syria, went to school there

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.680
and to medical school
in Damascus University,

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.640
graduated from Damascus
University Medical School

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.300
in 1988 and came right
after that to Chicago.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.700
I was first in class in
medical school and I remember

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.050
that I gave the graduation
speech

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.080
on behalf of the big class.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.570
We had about 550
people who graduated.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.660
And, among the graduates at that
time was someone whose name was

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.390
Bashar al-Assad, who was the
son of the President of Syria

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.290
at that time, Hafez al-Assad.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:12.350
Hafez al-Assad ruled Syria
for 30 years and at that time,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.610
Bashar was not being groomed
to be the next president.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.170

that they will go back and try

to rebuild what has
been destroyed.

Every Syrian American dreams of
the time that they can go back

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.050
and walk peacefully in the
streets that they got to know

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.740
and eat in the restaurants
that provide Syrian cuisine

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.760
and listen to the
music of Syria.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.510

be a long way from - from now.

as a 4-year-old child

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.190
who came from Pakistan.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.820
My father wanted a
better life for us.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.010
He wanted us to go to
school and I came to America

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.040
and I remember being
called Hindu

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.300
and being called all these names

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.260
because kids just didn't
understand my culture

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.740
and I would be like
embarrassed if my mother

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.110
who wore the head scarf
would take me to school.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.260
As a child, you don't
know, because all you want

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.020
to do is fit in and I
remember I was in fourth grade

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.100
and I had a crush
on this Greek boy.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.930
His name was Leo something.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.150
It's a long last name.

myself why even look at him,

when you know you're going

Imagine what that's like for
someone in the fourth grade.

So, in October of 2004,
I went to Pakistan.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.870
They said oh it's
your cousin's wedding.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.350
You know that was the trick to
get me there, that we were going

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.820
for my cousin's wedding and
the next thing you know,

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.740
January 5th came along

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.010

whole life changed.

[ Music ]

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:07.380
&gt;&gt; I think as a Muslim
American, as an Arab American

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.830
who has grown up in the
United States his whole life,

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.980
I was born and raised
here from parents

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.730
who immigrated from Syria.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.930
Now, I think one of the main
reasons why I wanted to come

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:24.320
down here and speak about
my story is because I am one

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.660
of the very few Arabs or
Muslim Americans who decided

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.230
to branch off from being a
doctor or engineer or lawyer

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.700
and do something
completely out of the norm.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.020
And so, right now I
am a videographer.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.410
I've been doing video,
telling stories

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.890
for about nine to ten years now.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.200
I'm not in it for the money
and I'm not in it for the fame.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.500
I'm in it for the next
generation that is to come.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.090
The next generation out
there who are like my brother

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.740
or my sister or even my kids,
I want them to grow up knowing

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.580
that they can be
something that they want,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.880
that they can put their mind to.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.660
You can be a firefighter.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.740
You can be a - someone that
wants to be on the news,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.840
someone that wants to do
something in PR, communications.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.510
Anything that you can put your
mind to, you should go for it.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.160
[ Music ]

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.660
&gt;&gt; My dad is [inaudible]

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:22.360
and my mom is half
Russian and half Iranian.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.320
It's interesting because my
grandmother is actually Jewish

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.430
and my grandfather is Muslim
and he's actually Shia Muslim.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.880
And so, then my dad and his
parents are Sunni Muslim.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.290
So, in addition to the different
cultural like practices,

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.290
there's also differences
in like religious sect.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:50.180
What I've realized is I've grown
up as that kind of one culture

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.230
and just religious sect kind

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.100
of like was more
prominent in my life.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.570
So, definitely the
Palestinian culture

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:04.060
and practices I've learned way
more about than Iranian culture

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.360
or even Russian culture.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.660
That's probably what
I've learned the least

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.960
about is Russian Culture.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.890
And, then I am [inaudible]
Muslim too.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.540
So, yeah, I've just
realized that.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.170
I didn't really have the
opportunity to learn as much

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.640
as I would have liked to
about Iranian culture,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.560
Russian cultures, as
well as like Judaism

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.360
and [inaudible] Islam too.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:37.320
[ Music ]

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.460
&gt;&gt; I hope you enjoyed that
little montage of a snippet

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.280
of just a compilation
of the rich stories

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.840
that we've been able to
collect and preserve.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.670
Now, I am very excited
to announce three

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.630
of our panelists today who
have also shared their story

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.970
with MALA.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.720
And, I want to thank
them because they came

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.330
from three different states.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.380
So, from New York,
we have Zabi Rahat.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.510
So, please come on up.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.160
[ Applause ]

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.510
We also have Supna Zaidi
from Washington, DC.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.580
[ Applause ]

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.510
And, finally, we have Ahmed
Salim from Chicago, Illinois.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:28.740
[ Applause ]

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.040
So, three different stories,
three different journeys.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.040
Zabi starting from
you, you know,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.160
could you share a little bit
about just your journey here

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.990
and also what compelled you
to share your story with MALA.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.290
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.060
Thanks for coming.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.950
Before I start, I did
my story with MALA

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.040
and I was very thrilled with
what MALA is doing and all

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.430
of these stories and diversity
of American - Muslims in America

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.480
and - and also the
communities they live in.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.930
I came to U.S. - I was born in
Kabul - in Kabul, Afghanistan.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.290
I spent my early
teen years in Kabul.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.160
I was living there during
the entire Taliban period

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
and then I moved to U.S.
when I was in eleventh grade

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.840
through a State Department
funded exchange student program.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.900
And, the way the exchange
student program worked was

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.790
that the students would
be placed randomly

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.390
across the U.S. anywhere.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.240
And, I was placed
in Berne, Indiana

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.380
and I don't think you can
even find Berne on a map.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.730
I came from Kabul.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.270
Kabul has a five
million population.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.150
Berne had five thousand
- the entire town.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.770
My high school in Kabul
had ten thousand students.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.070
Berne had five hundred.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.850
I don't think they had
ever seen a brown person,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.990
let alone a person
from Afghanistan.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.660
So, it was an unbelievably
amazing experience living

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:02.220
with this family that took me
in and became my legal guardians

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.650
after that exchange
student year ended.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.630
And, Berne, Indiana is not like
Washington, DC or New York City.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.290
It is a very conservative,
majority white,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.410
I would say Republican town.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.340
So, combine all those, you
already have certain perception

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.470
of what that community
would look like.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:29.040
But, to me it was my family
there and the were [inaudible]

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.820
and the way I became such
a really important part

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.870
of that community really changed
my perception of what America -

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.330
what small town America
is all about.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.550
So, one of the reasons I wanted
to share my story was because of

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.410
that family and friends I
found in - in a part of America

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.590
where you always hear about
racism, you always hear

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:54.750
about bigotry, but to me,
I made friends with one

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.370
of my friend's grandpar
- grandad who I went

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.470
to their house and
played cornhole with.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.050
I don't know if you
know what cornhole is -

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.870
if you're from midwest
- Mideast U.S.,

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.510
you will know what cornhole is.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.550
And, I drank moonshine
with them.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.850
[Laughter].

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.980
And, I wasn't - I was under
age, so just forget about that.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.720
But, he was a Vietnam veteran.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.560
So, when I told him I was
from Afghanistan and he was

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.000
like so welcoming and - and
then we sat, we - we, you know,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.900
we had - they had
a whole barbeque,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.870
but that's what made me want
to share my story is that a kid

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.870
like 16, 15, when
I was in undergrad,

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.890
then I spent time in Ohio.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.930
Very young kid from Afghanistan
in the middle of nowhere

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.500
in America making friends
with the most unlikely people.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.800
And, they welcomed me.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.100
All of them.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.280
I mean, of course, there's
certain racism that you feel,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.560
but for the most part, it was
an amazing experience and one

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.580
of the reasons I wanted
to, you know, share.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.580
&gt;&gt; I think that's an incredible
story, Zabi, and, you know,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.260
I think what you - what you
also mentioned is very important

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.920
because dispelling stereotypes,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.540
I think your story
in itself does that.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.730
It goes against the grievance
narrative and it actually shows

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.120
that you were welcomed, you were
able to create a new identity

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.870
and an American identity and you
were welcomed and you obviously

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.800
as a human you experienced
things,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.880
but it's - it's a success.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.930
And, it - I think maybe
a little different

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.220
because I was a student.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.430
So, I was in university,
living on campus in a dorm room

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.800
and all freshman kids, this
was a new experience for them.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.850
So, everybody coming to
live in a campus dorm room,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.150
they're all away from home.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.480
I was away from home, so all of
those kids were away from home.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.960
And, we all had that one shared
experience of being students

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.370
in a small, you know, campus.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.680
That's - I would say that was
an opportunity and an advantage

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.970
for me to be able to make all
these friends and, you know,

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.650
with different communities.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.950
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.520
Yeah. Supna, you had also shared
a very compelling story with -

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.210
with MALA as a, you know, Muslim
American with your heritage

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.670
and your, you know, very unique
story of where you come from

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.970
and your parent's story.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.290
So, if you could share that
with us that would be wonderful.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.100
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.490
Thanks for coming today.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.580
So, the profile I wrote focused

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.190
on I guess two stages
of my life.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.260
Me through my parents and their
experiences having left Pakistan

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:30.370
in 1981 and the context in which
they left and then me growing

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.350
up through the 80s and 90s
and getting married about,

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.970
you know, four years ago.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.790
And, for me - I'll get
into the details of those,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.130
but the one common thread
that I realized in writing

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:46.740
that which was most compelling,
especially in the context of,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.730
you know, for millennials,
especially growing up post 911

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.600
and being any minority,
not even just Muslim,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.190
is that there's always
adversity,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.840
there's always experiences
that we go

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.020
through regardless whether
there's economic adversity

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.050
or something having to do with
the disability or any kind

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.120
of disadvantage that we
experience that makes us

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.510
in the moment feel like we're
going through something worse

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.380
than others, but in
hindsight when you look back,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.930
it's a learning experience.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.310
You grow from it.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.290
You're a better person
through it.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.330
And, the politics of today
make things feel more sensitive

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:27.670
and worse or makes us feel
that we're in a situation

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.820
that can't be overcome, but
when you look at the experiences

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.240
of everyone around you
that, you know, precede more

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.650
than one generation, like
my parents coming to America

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.360
or anyone in this audience
whether it was their

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.650
grandparents or great,
great grandparents that came

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.810
to the U.S. from somewhere else.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.790
We've all been through -

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.470
we as in our family histories
have been through periods

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.700
where we had to figure out who
we were, what our identity means

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.550
to us and how we
can integrate it

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.290
to all being American
at the same time.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.900
And, I think that's something
that for me means everything now

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.060
in our political environment
when I look at my nephews

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.240
and nieces who aren't even 10
yet of what I'm going to share

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.100
with them about what it means to
grow up American and be Muslim

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.170
or Pakistani or anything
other hyphen that you want to,

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.440
you know, put in
there for yourself.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.320
And, with my parents,
they left Pakistan in 1981

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.250
as the country was being
[inaudible] during the cold war

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.980
under the dictatorship of
Prime Minister [inaudible].

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:35.060
My dad was a liberal who was
part of Pakistan Television.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.030
His dream was just to be like
a filmmaker, write soap operas,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.840
[inaudible], dramas
and just, you know,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.770
his friends were
writers and musicians

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.200
and he was a very jovial person.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.150
And, with increasing religious
[inaudible] that was coming

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.450
into the public's fear

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.670
of Pakistani society
[inaudible] became a factor

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.010
of your employment.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:58.870
And, because my dad didn't fit
into the expectations of the -

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.870
the government and a certain
increasingly orthodox society

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.560
was expecting of him, he
basically got demoted.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.460
I was born in a city called
Karachi, which was - is -

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.430
continues to be pretty
cosmopolitan like New York City.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.370
My dad was general manager
of Pakistan Television.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.230
He got demoted [inaudible],
no offense,

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.140
but [inaudible] was not
exactly where he wanted to end

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.030
up if you were in the
television industry.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.560
And, because my family didn't
come from a wealthy background,

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.610
we were lucky enough
to be able to immigrate

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.440
to the United States where
my father had a sister

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.740
who had already settled here.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.520
My parents started over.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.130
My mother was a painter and with
my father's background in film,

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.880
there was really no
translatable, successful career

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.430
to start over again
in the United States.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.750
They had a little apartment

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.970
and my parents first
jobs were fast food.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.220
And, especially I think for
a person like my father,

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.940
that has to hurt personally in
terms of who you think you are,

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.240
what you've achieved in life

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.670
and where you're
starting over at 40.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.970
I'm 40 now myself.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.270
My father has passed away.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.170
It's been ten years and I
can look back at my childhood

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.610
and look at all kinds of
different experiences we had

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:18.130
that were difficult, but I think
I always just attributed it

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.310
to being an immigrant.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.680
That first generation,
understanding

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.480
that people aren't going

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.440
to get certain things
and yeah it sucks.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.400
You know, sometimes you
don't have enough money

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.610
to do the things your
girl friends are doing

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.910
in sixth grade.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.210
You're not going to get
to go to the slumber party

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.600
because your parents don't
understand the culture

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.960
and they're afraid of all kinds
of bad things happening to you

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.600
because they have a lot of
time to make up a lot of stuff

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.910
and watch the 4:00 news and
they think that's all American

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.210
society is.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.810
But, you know, we fight, we push
for boundaries, we - we learn

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.580
and ask for more
responsibilities to figure

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.090
out our own space and we
figure out what all the labels

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.250
that are being put on
us actually mean to us.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.900
For myself, my family
is [inaudible],

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.070
which is a minority
- religious minority

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.710
in Pakistan - Muslim
minority even.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.470
So, growing up in
Southern California,

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.140
I couldn't even just say I was
Muslim, because among Muslims,

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.950
I was a different thing.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.510
So, I never really
fit in anywhere

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.950
and it took me a long
time to be okay with that.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.210
And - and, all the friends
I made by the time I was

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.340
in college happened
to be - to be blunt,

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.440
middle class white
girls who grew

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.270
up in conservative
families like me.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.770
What we had in common were
the simple joys of life.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.590
We were going to the
movies at 10:00 at night

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.180
and our parents weren't
there to get mad at us.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.180
It really had nothing to do
with a specific religion.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.220
And, our values were the same.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.980
We were studying, we were
trying to go to law school

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.280
or med school or whatever and
our friendships were based

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.480
on our trusts that we had
in each - in each other,

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.300
the respect we had for each
other and just being girls.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.100
But, the exposure we also had

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.830
to each other's families
allows us to learn.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:06.480
My best friends were Catholic
or Jewish or Hindu or Vietnamese

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.520
and Buddhist and
they came to my house

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.720
and it was a Muslim household
and they were exposed

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.410
to Pakistani food, south Asian
clothing, Bollywood music

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.260
on the radio if my
dad was playing it

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.140
and it was [inaudible]
of experiences.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.050
It wasn't just being Muslin,
because Muslin doesn't -

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.800
it has no one singular
definition.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.040
And, if you fast forward
today when I look at my nephew

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.620
and niece who are 9 and 7,
they're growing up in Indiana.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.400
They're, I think, the
only Pakistani kids

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.070
in their neighborhood.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.480
My husband's Catholic
from Richmond

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.170
and their favorite visit to
Virginia is for Christmas.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.750
And, I love the fact
that they have exposure

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.780
to different faiths and
not different cultures,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.370
because they're 100%
even more American

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.990
than me, they were born here.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.600
And, for them, they
don't flinch.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.020
They easily move fluidly from
wearing Pakistani clothes

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.960
on Saturday because they're
going to some baby's baptism,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.220
which we call [inaudible],
or then, you know,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.750
going to a Christmas
party the following week

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:17.470
because it's December 20
something and it's the season.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:23.370
And, to me it's that fluidity
that makes America great.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.870
It's that respect and
balance that the public

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.870
and the community irrespective
of politics and irrespective

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.750
of whatever particular
moment we're in.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.420
That as sense is being American
is not going to go away in mind

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:42.450
and it lets me be Pakistani,
American and any other thing

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.550
that I listed in my profile

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:49.150
and that why I couldn't
ever live anywhere else.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Supna.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.750
That was very, very well said.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.370
Thank you.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:27:00.090
Ahmed, you have also had
a very compelling journey

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.810
in achieving the American
dream and I'd love for you

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:07.150
to share a little bit about
your own personal experience,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.230
what you shared with MALA.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.490
&gt;&gt; I'm terrible with
technology and it continues.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.010
First of all, thank you.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.050
So, like everyone else,
I am an immigrant.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.350
I from Pakistan.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.090
Actually, immigrated here when
I was 2 and my parents came,

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.720
you know, same message,
American dream.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.620
And, you know, I thought
it was important to talk

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.010
about the American dream.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.100
I don't think people really -
they don't really give gratitude

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.840
to the idea of the
American dream.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.950
You know, I'm now 33 and, you
know, my entire life I grew

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.610
up saying, you know, I immigrate

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.420
and not really understanding
what my parents gave up and,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.740
you know, what they had to
go through and what we went

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.800
through really to assimilate.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.820
So, I came here at
2 and my parents,

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.120
you know, changed careers.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.710
My dad was in the
Army back in Pakistan.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.280
My mom was a housewife.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.670
My dad opened up shop.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.010
He was hit hard with
the recession

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.550
like a lot of other people.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.320
He lost his house or our
house, he lost his business.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.240
I actually got into law school
at the same time that happened.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.540
Not once did they flinch.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.180
Not once did they complain
about being in this country.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.940
They figured a way
to get me my loans.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.030
They figured a way to make sure
I was able to attend law school.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.680
I worked. My - I liked to
- I like to brag, you know.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.660
You always hear parents say I
had to walk 20 miles in snow to,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.960
you know, get to school.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.060
My third year of law school, I
went to school out in Michigan.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.740
I - I lived in Chicago.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.650
I scheduled all my classes for
Thursday afternoon and Friday,

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.910
so I used to drive
up Thursday morning,

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.980
sleep on my friend's
couch Thursday night

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.040
and drive back Friday
night to avoid paying rent

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.920
and I would just buy him dinner
and I worked a sunglasses kiosk

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.890
on the weekends and
during the week.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.650
So, about 40 hours a week.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.580
So, I can't wait to
tell my kids that story,

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.880
because I legitimately
am going to hold

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.180
that over them [laughter].

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.480
But, that's the idea, right?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.780
That's the American dream.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.650
My parents, you know, I saw
that work ethic growing up

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.760
and I was able to replicate it.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.060
You know, and that
actually lead me

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.060
to my basically currently
professional life.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.730
I, you know, I do compliance
law for a health system

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.500
in Chicago and, you know, it
lead me to my current decision,

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.100
which, you know, I won't
go into detail here,

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.760
but I decided to run for office.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.230
And, you know, running
for office right now is -

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.800
is basically like the pinnacle
of an immigrant's dream,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.580
like seeing your child being
able to run for office.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.780
And, you know, truth be
told, after I decided to run

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.370
for office, my dad, 67, was
let go from his job because he,

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.190
you know, wasn't technical
savvy enough to keep

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.390
up with the computer
systems at work.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.050
He didn't complain.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.350
What did he do?

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.080
He literally the next day
signed up to be a Lyft driver

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.750
and drives Lyft as a
67-year-old [laugher].

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.040
And, that's what I mean when you
talk about the American dream

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.570
and really making sure that, you
know, we appreciate it and it -

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.350
it - it - we take it for granite
for the idea that we hear it

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.210
so often but, you know,
there are people who believe

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.480
in the American dream so much
that stuff like that happens

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.780
and they just keep
rolling with it.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.790
And, you know, they see their
kids and I'll see my kids based

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.670
on the fruits of my parent's
labors and, you know,

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.730
it's something I really
think is important to share.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you Ahmed.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.760
That's - that's a very - that's
a - that's actually something

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.850
that I think resonates
quite frankly with a lot

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.900
of us sitting in this room.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.740
Especially coming as
a, you know, from a -

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.400
a child as an immigrant, the
sacrifices that people have made

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.070
to make sure that your
life here is what it is.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.270
You know, I know myself, my
own father escaped oppression

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.420
and subjugation in its
worst form from Afghanistan

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.980
and came here and
rebuilt his entire life

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.230
and his identity here and
I know what he sacrificed

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.460
and what he had gone
through to ensure that myself

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.290
and my sisters have the
life that we have now.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.470
I'm going to open the floor
to the audience for Q&amp;A.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.080
you know, please take
advantage of the panelist

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.920
that we have here and also any
questions that you may have

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.280
in regards to the
storytelling process.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.100
You're more than welcomed
to go on our website,

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.650
which is www.malanational.org.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.120
You can share your story.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.510
You can read the stories.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.620
You can listen to the stories.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.080
And, you know, the
floor is open.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:04.030
And, Thea [assumed spelling] is
walking around with a microphone

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.970
in case anybody has a question.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:16.910
None? Somebody has
to have one question.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.840
&gt;&gt; Hello. I am also from
Pakistan, so I can pretty relate

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.710
with the two persons
here, Supna and Ahmed.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.370
And, as my projecting, I
believe from results based

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:32.050
on assimilation of Pakistani
community in the United States.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.690
And, I have one question
from Supna.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:41.170
As you just mentioned that you
married to a Catholic and how -

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:46.550
how the Pakistani community and
the families perceive such kind

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.110
of marriages in which, you
know, there is a huge difference

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:55.210
of religion and the
nationality and ethnicity

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.020
and there is a difference.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.820
So, do you think
that all families

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.080
across the board accepts
that and if they don't,

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.430
which communities do
not accept it as such?

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.960
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your question.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.260
Well, interfaith marriages
are a new experience

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.470
for first generation immigrants.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.070
I mean, every Pakistani
family isn't first generation,

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.610
but predominantly they are.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:24.550
And, I think the insularity
that maybe is where you're going

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.380
like with your question is
sometimes coming from a place

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.100
from parents where they
have fears of the unknown

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.980
and being immigrants that
have migrated from one place

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.620
to another, it's not

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.180
that they're anti whatever
the other is, but it's more

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.480
of fear of preserving.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.800
Whether it's language
or culture.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.280
I remember when I was young
my father would say oh

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.420
if you marry out, you know,
how will I talk to him.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.800
I'm like, you speak
English perfectly fine.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:56.620
But, his point was his command
of, you know, his argument,

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.670
his - his emotion, his heart.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.510
That would be in [inaudible].

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.130
That wouldn't be in English.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.540
And, so I - he - he's coming
from an emotional place

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.240
when he said that, you know,
and I can understand that

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.050
and I think that's probably
why it took me a long time

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.610
to get married, because I
spent a lot of years trying

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.190
to meet somebody that
- and this is the thing

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.490
about identity right.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.310
Someone can fit on
paper on the outside,

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.300
but that doesn't mean they
fit you on the inside.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.290
Because I - I like everyone else
here, our experiences are unique

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.320
to us and they're
like in our heads.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.860
They're not external.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.270
And, you know the funniest
thing I can you tell you

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.640
about my husband is
that on the outside,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.020
we couldn't be more different.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.580
Voted opposite at the
election, different religions,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:45.060
all kinds of different stuff
but, you know, no one reminds me

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.520
of my family more than
him, like his habits.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.750
Like the way he says and
does little things reminds me

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.590
of my dad sometimes.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.360
His love of family.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.290
When he - one of the most
enduring things he ever did

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.810
for me was when we were dating,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.470
because my mother had
already been widowed,

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.770
he didn't even tell me.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.440
He sent her a Valentine.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.250
My brothers are not going
to do anything like that

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.530
for anybody ever, you know,
and my husband does that.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:14.470
So, personal relationships
should be respected as such

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:17.640
and I think interfaith
marriages are happening more

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.050
and more slowly as - as
families become more integrated

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.960
in the United States.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.370
I think my age group had
the hardest, but when I look

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.800
at people in their 20s,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.930
I'm amazed they're
dating in college.

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:31.630
We were not allowed
to date in college.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.170
I mean, you wouldn't do that.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.310
People are meeting their
spouses on their own.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.650
Arranged marriages are
more becoming from my ex -

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.990
from what I've seen more in
name rather than practice.

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:46.140
You know, I call it
the mommy network.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.130
You know, parents are
introducing their kids,

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.830
but it's not like,
you know, here's Bob,

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.130
you're marrying him on Friday.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.430
That's a real arranged marriage.

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:53.730
That's not happening.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.420
And, then, you know, in that
same vain, people are looking

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.230
for people who they
get along with

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:01.500
and that is increasingly
crossing labels,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.060
whether it's religion
or nationality

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.840
and I think that's just again
part of the immigrant experience

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.910
and not necessarily
unique to Muslims.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:10.980
&gt;&gt; That was a great
question and answer.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.320
We have another one.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.270
&gt;&gt; So, actually wanted to
join this conversation.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.130
My father is from Multan.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:23.650
He grew up in Delhi, which tells
all the Pakistanis in the room

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.840
that my family isn't Muslim.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.260
He was born in 1940 and he
came to the United States

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.910
in the early 70s where he met

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.340
and married my white
unitarian mother.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.810
They got married
in 1973, I think,

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.490
and I think that you're
really right when you say

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:45.780
that it's different
generationally, right.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.260
So, I'm about your age

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.030
and I think it's probably very
different for people dating now,

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.570
but for my parents, even then
there were certainly people

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.780
who made my mother welcome
immediately in the community

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.140
and people in my
mother's community

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.850
who made my father welcome.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.780
I think the issue a
lot of it had to do

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.510
with what were expectations
for children.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:11.660
And so, the - I think now
people who are raising kids,

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.790
there's much more acceptance
on the part of the parents

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:17.720
and the goal is that fluidity,
whereas I think that growing

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.350
up the child in one of those -

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.680
those blended marriages
in the 1980s.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.440
My sister and I and our
inability to speak Punjabi

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.530
for instance was
scary to parents

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.810
who were immigrant
parents in a way

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.130
that I suspect it's
maybe sad sometimes --

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:38.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Losing identity.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.650
&gt;&gt; -- for parents now, but it's
not terrifying in the same way.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.970
And so, I do think it's the sort
of forward moving progression,

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.260
maybe towards something good,
maybe just different, right.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.850
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.430
&gt;&gt; But, yeah very much
what you're saying

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.120
and I think I see something very
different for friends of mine

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.840
who marry across than
I saw for my parents,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.190
even though I would
say they found a lot

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.260
of acceptance 50 years ago.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.240
&gt;&gt; And, I think it'll
be very empowering

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.890
for Muslim communities,
you know, speaking broadly

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.580
because when you
look at Americans

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.570
of Muslim backgrounds
growing up here -

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.870
or even traditional
backgrounds -

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.170
I should probably
take a step back.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.470
It's not just Muslims.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.320
A lot of issues that come up in
the Muslim context actually have

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.790
to do with traditional
[inaudible] cultures,

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.190
Middle Eastern cultures, not,
you know, strictly Muslim,

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.170
or Indian cultures,
South Asian culture.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.470
There's a lot of stuff
especially having to do

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.020
with women's rights issues.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.350
Anyway. With that, the
point what I was trying -

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:35.920
my point is more that like
when people like my age group

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.770
or younger grow up in western
cultures like American culture

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.920
and we integrate our
heritage with being American,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.550
which also includes
American values

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.550
and American sensibilities,
what I'm seeing when you look

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.410
across the media is you also -
you see more liberal interp -

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:55.540
understandings of what it
means to be a woman or Muslim

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.250
or Pakistani and I think that
goes back into the community.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:02.990
So, you know, a little girl
being raised going to Mosques,

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.870
excuse me, today
is probably going

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.940
to hear a lot more enlightened
interpretation of what it means

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.050
to be Muslin or Pakistani
or whatever other, you know,

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.380
national background she might be

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.190
of than maybe what my
mother was exposed to

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.610
or even what I was
exposed to coming

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.660
to America, you know, 1981.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.400
&gt;&gt; I think for anybody
in this room also

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.530
that has a very compelling
story I do encourage you to go

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.890
on the site and definitely
share your story,

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.260
because it is an open platform.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.850
You can submit your story, your
headshot and it would be amazing

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:38.640
to feature you, especially
your unique narrative as well.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:44.100
Are there any other questions
from anyplace that I overlooked?

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.110
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.410
There you go.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.620
&gt;&gt; Hi. I had a question
for the last speaker.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:56.370
So, I'm kind of wondering what
you - what exactly do you mean

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.590
by the American dream?

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.480
Because like - I don't
know, like it seems

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:06.110
like the way you're describing
it is kind of like in terms

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.020
of like material successes.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.280
How do you think that
that kind of intersects

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.960
with the way Muslims in this
country have been criminalized

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.410
and marginalized consistently
and perhaps especially

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.410
under this administration?

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.550
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll - I'll -
I'll start with that.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:29.980
I think the most important thing
is that, you know, a) it's the -

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.960
the stories themselves are
not just about material gain,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.070
but it's about the sacrifices
and the opportunities

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:40.370
that America has had
provided for people that come

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.010
from all walks of life, you
know, not just Pakistan, but,

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.790
you know, all different
countries

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:48.760
and not just economic
growth, but actual freedom

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.220
and opportunities and democracy.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.190
And, you know, there's a lot of
Muslims that come from countries

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.730
where there was a lot of
injustices that also existed

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.500
where democracy doesn't exist.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.260
I think that's kind of where
Ahmed was touching on that.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.650
Now, in regards to
anything about politics

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.950
or the current administration,

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:10.390
that's not something
that we comment on.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:14.230
Quite frankly, our organization
and our whole project is

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.880
to exemplify what Muslim
American experiences are

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.720
and how Muslims have contributed

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.440
to this American
fabric of society.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.880
So, going back into that
Ahmed, you can answer

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.180
that question as well.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.340
&gt;&gt; Well, it restricts just
a bit, so we can always talk

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.720
after in case you need to.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.780
But, yeah, it's beyond material
benefit and gain in a spec -

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.870
in a respect of the
American dream.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.700
I think when I'm referring
to the American dream

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.820
in my parent's eyes, it's really
just making sure that, you know,

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.430
they're children had the
opportunity specifically

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:50.930
with education and I think every
single person on this panel

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.810
and stories we've heard or
stories I've seen on MALA seems

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.110
to be the general
message, right.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.830
The American dream is making
sure your kids have a better

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.710
life, meaning education,
democracy, freedom,

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:03.810
the ability to basically
practice and do what you want.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.840
And, that's what my parents
gave me and that's what I mean

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.910
when I speak about the American
dream in respects to my parents.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.910

don't even know

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.630
if they understand what
American dreams are,

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.530
what the American dream is
supposed to be because they're

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.340
in Afghanistan still and they
live there and they work there.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.960
And, my American parents now
they never once mentioned

to me American dream, but
they raised - they have -

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.110
I have four other older siblings
and they raised all of them

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.500
to be the, you know, the
values they instilled in them

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:38.190

education, get a job, you know,

try to make a difference.

And, but, you know,
being here and learning

to and realistically when I was

in Afghanistan, American dream
was living in New York City.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:43.860
&gt;&gt; I was born in Venezuela
and my parents are Lebanese.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.860
They immigrated to Venezuela
when they were very young.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.550
And, so I have that
mix of cultures

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.370
and to me it was
natural to be able

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.670
to understand the
different cultures.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:00.530
The American culture,
the Lebanese culture,

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.610
the other Arabic cultures
that we have in Venezuela

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.700
and then moving to
the United States,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.080
I feel that I gained an - an
additional culture as well.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.720
So, I - I identify with people.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.030
That's how I think it's
made it easier for me.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.730
So, I don't identify
necessarily just

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.140
with the culture as a whole.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.570
I see it as bits, pieces,
elements, you know,

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:24.510
within a culture and there
are things that I like,

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.250
things that I don't like, you
know, I adopted as my own.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.670
My identity is solely
encompassing.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.340
I always reject it, identifying
with just one culture.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.470
I find Venezuela is
where my heart is.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.320

is, that's what I know.

the United States in Michigan

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.520
for 20 - almost 21 years, so
I've been here for so long

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.050
and I - I do feel
American as well

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:53.190
and Michigan is my home as well.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.660

me again to go back

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.140
to Venezuela, go
back to Lebanon.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.790
It's still my home as well.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.130
So, I just would
like a time I guess

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:06.740
in which I'm not challenged to
identify or show solidarity,

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.340

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.150

as Lebanese or I don't want

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.740
to be identified as only Muslim.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.630
I don't want to be identified
only as a Latin-American.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:23.950
I want to be identified as a mix
of all of this because I feel

that I understand all of
them, then why I'm going

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:30.970
to be cornered into just
one so people accept me.

well about nine or
ten hours outside

of Mumbai called Bilongo

that place when he was
16 and my mother grew

up in Heatherbod [assumed

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:16.000
in Heatherbod, but grew up
in Bombay, very much comes

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.700
from Heatherbodi [assumed

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.870
of what's, you know,
interesting about, you know,

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:24.670
people think Indians and
Pakistanis were, you know,

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:28.120
kind of one big thing, but
really it was a subcontinent,

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.330
so every state, every culture
has its own flavor and I grew

I started out in
college studying opera

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.030
because it became very
apparent later on in high school

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:53.410
that I had a voice that
was well suited for opera.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:58.410
So, I rigorously studied the
art of singing and the art of,

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.840
I mean, classical music forms
whether that be the rudiments

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:07.250

just the grounding that -

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:11.800
that is good to have if one is
to pursue a career in music.

appreciation for black culture

hide where I'm from, like,

everyone's kind of
laughing at me

Abu Dhabi was a desert,

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:05.870
or what was happening,
but that, you know,

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.210
there was something
definitely off

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.310
or something definitely wrong
because I saw, you know,

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.830
how upset my parents were
and I vaguely remember being

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:16.550
at a bus stop with them
and my grandparents

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:19.290
and we were supposed to be
just taking a, you know,

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.190
doing air quotes, like
a vacation, you know,

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:23.490
because we weren't
supposed to be leaving Iraq.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.050
And, even with just
having immigrant parents

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.560
like the stories that they share
I think really paint a picture

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.600
of, you know, just how
difficult they had it over there

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.900
and how hard they worked.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.050
I mean, my parents are
probably conservative.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.230
They controlled a lot
of things that I did

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.940
and with our cultural
background, you know, it's,

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.400
I mean, it's already hard
enough for parents to hear that,

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.520
you know, their son is
gay let alone, you know,

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.600
they come from being Iraqi
and their son is gay,

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.060
which culturally
that's like, you know,

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.040
you get stoned for that.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.600
I've been asked by
people usually

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.810
like how's it being an Iraqi
in the military, you know,

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:04.190
aren't you like fighting
your people?

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.490
Isn't that weird?

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:09.390
And, honestly, I don't think
I've ever let that question

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.550
like really simmer with me,

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.690
because I don't know
what I would have done,

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.760
you know what I mean, if I
really sat there and entertained

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.650
that question, because
on one hand, yes,

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.100
I am Iraqi culturally.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.650
You know, I come from Iraq and
they're, you know, my people,

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:26.920
but I'm American as well, so.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.310
It's a super strange and weird
gray area, because it's like,

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.610
but this is my country too.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.400
I've been here since
I was 5 and, you know,

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.370
I value my freedom and
I will fight for it

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:40.010
and I enjoy my freedom.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.310
[ Music ]

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:47.970
&gt;&gt; My name is Kardijetu
Dumbia [assumed spelling].

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:51.010
I go by the name Kadi
[assumed spelling].

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:54.090
I am from Mali.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:57.030
I was born and raised
over there,

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.990
all the way to the age of 18.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:04.170
I left my country when I was 18
years old, traveled to Europe

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.140
and fast forward, came

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:11.080
to the United States
about 24 years ago.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.890
I live in Chicago right now.

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:21.650
I grew up in a very big
family, in a polygamist family.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:25.610
I had four moms - four
moms in the family.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:30.410
My father had four
wives and that's

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:36.010
where I was raised
[inaudible] for me

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:42.970
and from what I understand
like in my country, FGM,

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:49.140
which is female genital
mutilation, is not illegal

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.050
in my country [inaudible].

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:58.780
My hope is that of course
we have to have education

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:04.070
around this subject and we have
to have an open conversation

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:08.710
about this subject, because
nobody talks about FGM.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:10.010
Nobody does.

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:14.430
If we can find a way
to educate the people

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:20.910
about not only the physical pain
- not only the physical pain,

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.500
because I don't remember
my physical pain.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.430
The psychological
pain that stays

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:30.510
with you forever,
ever until you die.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:42.450
[ Music ]

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:47.310
&gt;&gt; I'm going to reintroduce
the panelists back up.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:52.510
We do have about ten minutes
for more of an interactive Q&amp;A

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:55.940
in regards to the story
montage that we just listened to

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.690
and any other things
that, you know,

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:00.750
we may have overlooked
throughout the first segment.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:03.050
So, yes?

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:11.100
&gt;&gt; I've - there's a focus here
on the immigrant community

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:15.100
and as an immigrant myself, I
don't want to diminish that,

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.710
but nonetheless, more than
a quarter of the Muslims

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.660
in America are the
children of converts,

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.800
overwhelmingly
African-Americans.

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.840
Have you included them in the
storytelling and if - if -

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.590
if so, would you and if not, why
didn't you have a representative

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:32.890
of that somewhere in the
montages or on the panel?

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:37.310
&gt;&gt; We have - you just
can't see somebody's image

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:39.400
when they're explaining
their story.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.880
We have collected
and archived stories

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.880
from the black Muslim community,

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.370
from the African Muslim
community, various [inaudible],

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:51.500
as well first generation
to fourth generation.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.680
It's very difficult in such a
short amount of time and also

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.320
with just audio to actually
show you the vast majority

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:02.280
of the collection and the
rich compilation of stories

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.580
that we have collected.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:06.690
So, I do urge everybody
to go on the website.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:10.130
It's malanational.org and
look through the stories

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:12.900
and hopefully you can also
see the diverse voices

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.310
that we have showcased
through the stories

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:20.470
that are spread throughout the
room with people's photographs

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:21.770
and just an excerpt
of their narrative.

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:24.970
So, I hope that answers
your question.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:36.190
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, thank you
for your presentation.

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.980
This is - this is very
good and as a child

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:44.450
of enjoying StoryCorps
and the American Folklife,

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.200
this is - this is timely.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.080
So, I was just curious
are - in your work,

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:54.510
are you capturing the diverse
ideological perspectives

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:56.250
within the Islamic
tradition as well?

00:54:56.250 --> 00:55:01.300
I certainly appreciate your - my
colleague over there's comments.

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.160
I'm a fourth generation
African-American Muslim.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.570
My grandparents - my great
grandparents converted

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:11.100
to Islam back in the 30s
through jazz musicians

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.320
and largely through [inaudible].

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.160
So - so, I appreciate that -
that comment as well, but -

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.970
but largely, I was just curious
in terms of just diversity

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:23.160
of perspectives,
liberal, secular,

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.460
chia [assumed spelling], --

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.760
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.060
&gt;&gt; -- [inaudible], etc.

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.690
&gt;&gt; Liberal, secular, chia, suni
[assumed spelling], orthodox,

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:31.250
atheist, Muslims even.

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:34.440
We have spotlighted
stories from people

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.830
of all different backgrounds.

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.610
Our platform is open and that's
why we encourage you to go

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:41.200
on the site and I
wish there was a way

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.780
where we actually could
showcase all 350 plus stories.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.910
In addition to not just
ideological or theological

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:52.800
or whatever it may
be that, you know,

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.610
there's so many different
divides

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:57.550
within the Muslim community
itself that our hope was

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:00.090
through storytelling
we're able to bring

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.630
and connect people
together from such a broad

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.460
and diverse community

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.550
that represents what
a Muslim American is.

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:09.990
And, I think just even
listening to these stories

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.640
and having these panelists
up here and listening

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.250
to just different
perspectives shows you

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:18.210
that we have actually
encompassed one

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:20.890
of the broadest range
collections of narratives

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:24.590
and stories and experiences and
we hope to continue to do more.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.560
You know, our goal is to
have thousands of stories.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.000
People from first generation
to fourth generation.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.190
And, we've done recordings
with StoryCorps in partnership

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.080
with the Arab American
National Museum.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.130
We've done it with the
Minneapolis community.

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:40.430
We do it in Chicago.

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.730
We do it in New York.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:43.810
We've done it with the
university studies,

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:45.790
exchange students
from the MENA region.

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.920
So, like I said, it's - it's
- it's a very broad range

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.230
of just people's
individual experiences.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.660
And, we never tell anybody
what to write or what to submit

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:55.960
or what to talk about.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.450
They're free to do that.

00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:59.130
It's your story.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:01.970
You have autonomy over it and
you can share what you want.

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.280
&gt;&gt; I feel a bit odd since it's
kind of been raised twice now,

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.550
but I also had this reflection
that he raised that, you know,

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.750
others considerable,
you know, geographic

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:18.540
and ethnic diversities that's
really beautiful in chimes

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.840
through these stories.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.400
It does seem like there's a
consistent story of immigration

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.450
or - or having parents in
the context of immigration.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:27.750
And, so I was wondering

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:31.200
if you were doing any
outreach specifically

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.070
to communities that,
you know, whose -

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:37.630
whose story of immigration
forced or otherwise is

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.420
from several generations ago?

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.380
&gt;&gt; Those are - those
are amazing stories.

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.410
We've done - we've
had a few that are

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:46.690
like fourth generation
stories and even stories

00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:47.990
that are not about immigration.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:50.570
It's just about their
own personal experience.

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:54.370
Again, we would love to
reach out to a broader range

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:57.270
of people to, you know,
and different communities

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.650
within the Muslim American
communities to, you know,

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:02.400
come out and reach out to
us and share your story.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.720
We're really, really, really
trying to keep pushing the power

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.670
of narratives, especially
diverse ones from people

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:10.970
of all different backgrounds.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.570
So, we're very open to it.

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:15.400
Again, you know, reach out
to us through the website.

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.310
We're very active on social
media as well on Facebook,

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:21.400
Twitter, Instagram, and there's
several ways you can submit your

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.500
story or even sign up to
be recording your story

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.590
with StoryCorps in which
StoryCorps will actually talk

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:29.890
about that a little bit in -

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:31.600
in a little bit more
depth coming up.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.610
So, there are very,
very different ways

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.660
where you can still get involved
and share your narrative

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.830
with MALA or your -
your story in general.

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:44.890
I hope that answered
the question.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:53.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, again, I have a
question from Ahmed and Supna

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:58.900
in regard of particularly

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.890
when the hate crime again
was [inaudible] increased

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:06.350
because of - because
of involvement

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:12.320
of some distant individuals
into the terrorist attacks.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:17.080
Where you feel that the Muslim
community placed themselves

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.360
and that is one question.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:24.290
And, the second question is,
do you think that the Muslims

00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:28.240
from Middle East and
Muslims from South Asia,

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.460
they're [inaudible] of
association with America

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:37.540
and with the American
dream has been different?

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:41.710
&gt;&gt; We have about a couple
of minutes to answer this

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:46.030
and there's a couple
more questions, so.

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:50.080
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I understood
the question exactly,

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:54.910
but with regard to hate
crimes and their affect

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:57.910
on the Muslim American
community, I definitely feel

00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:01.820
that there's a greater sense of
trepidation among communities

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.740
about what's going on and what
the appropriate response should

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.650
be, especially considering we're
three examples of individuals

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:14.400
and families that have tried to
I think in our own ways just to,

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.160
you know, work and
mind our own business

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.460
like everybody else
does, you know,

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.040
in their respective
communities across the nation.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.300
I think it's - with respect

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:27.780
to the individuals perpetrating
the crime, I think that's

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.080
where your question was going.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.740
I think that's where
communication is needed

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.210
and there is related
more to ignorance

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.640
than necessarily racism even
need to be responded to.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.050
I - I think that, this is my
personal opinion, no MALA's,

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:45.190
but a hyper-partisan political
environment doesn't help.

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.320
We need to talk to
each other more.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.240
We need to have projects

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:55.970
like MALA's narrative project be
expanded into more communities.

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.890
And, you know, for the questions
regarding to demographics

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:00.990
that haven't been
included yet, that -

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.420
that's a factor of funding.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.400
[Inaudible] organization
which, you know,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.810
I don't fund myself
or get a salary from.

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:10.420
They work really hard to try
to raise the money they can

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:16.180
to get people taped and it's
not [inaudible] aren't easy.

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.410
They're not making
anybody money.

01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:20.500
So, nonprofits like [inaudible]

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:26.110
or any other community oriented
project needs public support.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:28.790
And, it'll reach the
demographics you're seeing -

01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:31.340
where you're seeing the gaps
if that support happens.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:35.510
And, the second part of
your question was about --

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:39.330
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:40.630
&gt;&gt; -- salvation.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.540
They do - they affiliate
themselves differently

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.270
from the American dream or
they have the same take --

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.570
&gt;&gt; I - I think it varies.

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:49.870
I think it varies.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.760
I mean, I think when an audience
member, you know, raised concern

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.480
with that feeling of, you
know, victimization, I -

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.970
I think it's how the
issues are spoken about.

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:03.480
I personally feel more strongly
that every immigrant community

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.330
that has come into the
United States regardless

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:09.970
of era has faced its unique
challenges and Muslims are going

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:14.060
to face their challenges given
the political backdrop we find

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.360
ourselves in.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.670
A hundred years from now,

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.230
I don't know what other
communities are going

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:21.460
to face integration issues,
but it's a part of growing.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:24.630
Like, to me, what America
is, what America means,

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.420
that identity, it's life
and organic and it changes

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.190
and its influx and it's what you
contribute, what you take back

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:35.360
and it goes back to
communication and respect.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.500
Even especially where
you see the differences.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.140
That's where the communication
needs to happen ten times more.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.580
And, we can't look at
each other caricatures,

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.860
which I think is the
issue on all sides

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.290
and that's my politics
and not Zainab's.

01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:51.000
&gt;&gt; I - I mean I think
overall, yeah.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.230
Some of these questions
are great because it goes

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:54.870
into a much larger
picture and there's

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:58.190
so many overlapping issues,
obviously, social issues

01:02:58.190 --> 01:03:01.360
that kind of go into
this, but again our -

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.250
our goal is to scale our
project and showcase narratives,

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.760
showcase the diverse
individual experiences

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.660
and no two people's experiences
are ever going to be the same.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.930
We did have a question here.

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.980
&gt;&gt; This is a much
narrower question.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:22.920
A number of years ago I read
that the Mosque that has been

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.630
in continuous existence

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:30.770
in the United States the
longest is located in Iowa.

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:35.260
Do you know if that's true or do
you not know whether it's true

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.760
or not or do you know
definitely that it isn't true,

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.230
that there's some other Mosque
[laughter] which is the long -

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:44.430
has the longest exis -
continuous existence?

01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:45.730
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.030
Does anybody else
have an answer?

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.330
Okay.

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.630
&gt;&gt; Anybody got Google?

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.930
&gt;&gt; No.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.230
&gt;&gt; I do know that when
we were in Dearborn,

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.530
Michigan recording stories

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.400
with the Arab American
National Museum and StoryCorps,

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.700
that's actually one

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:01.590
of the oldest populations
of Muslim Americans.

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:05.050
Arab Americans - Arab Americans
also constu - like, they consist

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:10.460
of Christian Americans as well,
but that's actually one of the,

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.550
you know, primary
immigrant groups

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.580
that really was the
building block

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.660
of like a great American city.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.320
Now, in regards to the
Mosque and the development

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.600
and the communities, I'm
sure it comes with time

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.420
as communities settle in.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.040
So, I'm not sure
about the Iowa one,

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.340
but thank you for verifying.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.280
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.580
Sure.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.650
&gt;&gt; It's not just the Mosque -

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:35.400
it's not just the
Mosque in Iowa.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.480
Muslims are part of
American folk culture,

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.240
though people don't
recognize it.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.190
There's a play called
Oklahoma in which one

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:45.070
of the character is a peddler
named Ali Hakim and he's there

01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:47.860
because there was so many
immigrant Muslim peddlers

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:52.840
in the midwest and he's, you
know, reflective of that.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.430
Benjamin Franklin when he did
his census of Philadelphia,

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:57.300
he was - because
he was concerned

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.240
that he felt Pennsylvania
was being taken

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.000
over by Germans found
a Muslim community,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.140
significant Muslim
population in Philadelphia.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.830
That was in 1742, so.

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.130
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:12.340
&gt;&gt; I have a question for you.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.550
Have you considered, I guess,

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:17.100
obviously it would be
a much larger project,

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.210
but hearing the voices

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:23.630
and hearing the stories
definitely brings it to life,

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:27.080
but hearing the panelists
and seeing them

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.530
and telling their stories
really puts it all together.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:36.930
Would you I guess look at
making like a video form

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:41.150
of these stories with the
individuals narrating their

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:47.060
story as more like a documentary
or some larger format?

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.030
&gt;&gt; We have actually
discussed that quite a bit.

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:51.940
Again, a lot of it is,
you know, limited time,

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.750
limited budget, limit manpower.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:58.550
MALA is all run by
volunteers and board members.

01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:02.750
We're lucky to have, you
know, a good solid base

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.680
of like grassroots donors.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.520
One of the things
that we did look

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.330
into is our StoryCorps segments
are so beautifully edited

01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:13.710
and they're just so compelling
and it would be amazing

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.300
to have them animated even.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.440
That was something that
we also had discussed.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.400
So, there are quite a lot
of things in the pipeline

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.700
that we would like to do.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.140
I think panels like this
really bring forth the voices.

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:30.980
So, MALA does do very
interactive events in Chicago

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:35.230
and in New York, obviously where
we have our largest network

01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:38.250
of volunteers and, you know,
people who are really committed

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:39.550
to making the event happen.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:43.030
And, we would love to continue
doing a lot more nationwide

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:44.380
programs and events.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.480
The moral to this, we are
having something similar to this

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.520
in Chicago with the Chicago
Cultural Alliance in October.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.510
And, you know, hopefully we can
continue scaling this project.

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:59.110
So, that's why we're very
grateful for everybody

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:02.460
that is here and for StoryCorps
for giving us the opportunity

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.700
to bring these stories
more mainstream,

Center for making, you know,

event on the map in regards

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:15.590
to the significance of such
stories and also The Library

are actually archived and housed

for generations to come.

your question.

Now, before we get
started with that,

01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:53.710
I'd like to talk a little bit
about StoryCorps for those

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.580
of you who are unfamiliar
with us.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.960
So, StoryCorps is
an independent,

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.010
nonprofit organization
that was founded in 2003

01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:05.050
by radio documentarian
Dave Isay.

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:07.910
Now, our mission is
relatively simple.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:12.140
It is to record, preserve
and share humanity stories

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:17.820
and in pursuit of this mission,
we hope to really build a sense

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:24.140
of compassion and empathy
throughout humanity as well.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.760
So, this is how it works.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.430
We have recording locations

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:30.230
in San Francisco,
Atlanta, and Chicago.

01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:32.070
We also have a mobile
booth that travels

01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:35.820
around different cities each
month recording stories.

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:38.430
And, we have what's called
a national team in New York

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:41.260
which is based out of New
York, but they travel all

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.870
over the country
recording stories as well.

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.550
And so, you might come into one
of our booths with a friend,

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:51.360
a family member, someone
you know or someone you'd

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.970
like to get to know
a little bit more

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:56.610
and you have a 40-minute
conversation with that person.

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.310
It would be recorded by one
of our trained facilitators

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:03.500
who would be taking notes during
the process and afterwords,

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.050
of course, you would receive
a copy of the interview.

01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:09.810
And, with the participants
permission, we would also add

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.370
that interview to the
StoryCorps archive.

01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:14.260
Now, every interview
that is part

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.640
of the StoryCorps archive is
actually housed right here

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.830
at The Library of Congress, at
the American Folklife Center.

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:24.230
So, those of you who are
interested in hearing some

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:27.420
of these stories from the MALA
collection and other collections

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.110
that we have in the
StoryCorps archive.

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:31.400
You can make a reservation at
the American Folklife Center

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.510
and go and listen to
some of the stories.

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:39.420
We are hoping to put a large
portion of the archive online

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.730
in the next year or so.

01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:44.340
So, stay tuned for
more details on that.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.760
So, at this point,
we've collected

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.040
over 70 thousand interviews.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.040
Now, you cannot collect 70
thousand interviews in a silo.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.590
We rely on partnerships like
MALA to reach participants,

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:02.670
to create the archive
that we have today.

01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:05.340
And, we would be unable
to pursue our mission

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.490
without the partners that
we work with like MALA.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:11.310
There would be very little
recording, preserving or sharing

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:13.110
if we didn't have
any interviews.

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:17.520
So, we see the stories in
our archive as contributions

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.270
from participants and
organizations as well.

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.570
So, I do want to make sure

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:26.130
that everyone knows how
grateful StoryCorps is

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:28.290
to be working with MALA.

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:31.030
And, very, very grateful to be -

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:33.480
to have been connected
with - with MALA.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.520
This happened back in 2014.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.950
So, in 2014, our
Chicago story booth lead

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:45.250
by Shirley Alfaro was very
interested in making sure

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:47.150
that we reached out
to Muslim communities.

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:52.420
And, so they were attempting to
find partnerships with these -

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.730
within these communities

01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:56.460
and they were having
some difficulty.

01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:57.760
So, they mentioned this

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.890
to another partner
organization of ours.

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:03.290
We have a partnership
with the radio -

01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:07.420
we have a radio station
partnership with WBEZ.

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:10.370
And, a person from
WBEZ connected Shirley

01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:12.610
and her Chicago team
to Zainab and MALA.

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:16.030
And, thus the partnership
was forged.

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:20.050
In 2015, actually December
- December the 6th 20 -

01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:24.920
2015 was the very first
interview recorded

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.150
in partnership between
StoryCorps and MALA.

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:31.080
And, sense then, there have
been 88 interviews recorded

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:36.450
with over 90 participants
and more to be recorded.

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:40.380
And, so this has been one of
the most successful partnerships

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.740
to come out of the
Chicago booth.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.330
And, it's been a
really incredible ride.

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:49.090
And, so I - I again, thank the
Chicago booth and the folks

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:52.210
at MALA for starting
this partnership.

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:56.780
Now, for those of you who've not
really perused the collection,

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:59.730
if you haven't had an
opportunity to do so,

01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:03.290
I'd like to give a brief
snapshot of the types of stories

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:05.910
that are there and the
individuals who are part

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:09.810
of this archive, part of
this journey's collection.

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.400
Now, some of the themes that
you'll hear are about home,

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:19.520
acceptance, identity, culture,
music, art, resilience.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.060
Some of these are
traumatic stories.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:25.320
Some of these stories are about
painful events, but they're also

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.270
about love and laughter
and hope.

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:33.370
The people who are presenting
their stories are artists,

01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:38.450
visionaries, thinkers, writers,
creators, content producers,

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:42.210
educators, activists,
friends and family members,

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.030
colleagues, mentors and mentees.

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.010
There are so many
different types of stories

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:50.150
that are being told and so
many types of participants

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:54.920
who are part of this project.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.990
In addition, there are dozens
of countries represented.

01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:04.360
Zainab read a few early on and
so I'll just list a couple.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.980
But, there's Tunisia, Libya,
Saudi Arabia, India, London,

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.250
Nigeria, Egypt, Lebanon,
and the list goes on.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.480
It's a really fantastic project

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.560
that we are very
grateful to be a part of.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.290
And, again, emphasizing how
important partnerships are

01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:27.130
in order to get the word
out about StoryCorps,

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.380
to have people understand that
their stories are important

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.220
and whether you record
your story with StoryCorps

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:36.260
or another organization or
on your own, it's important

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.300
to capture these stories.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.610
It's important to make sure your
voice is heard and the stories

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.890
of your community, whatever
type of community that may be,

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:48.460
are archived and
saved in perpetuity.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.480
So, with that I would just
like to again encourage you all

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.540
to find out more
information about StoryCorps

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.150
and our many partnerships
by visiting our website.

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:02.140
If you're interested in starting
a partnership with StoryCorps,

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.770
there is information
available on our website.

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:07.320
If you're interested in
hearing more about MALA,

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.790
they have a fantastic website.

01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:11.670
So, you should definitely
check that out.

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:14.530
Again, you can also make a
reservation here at The Library

01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:17.410
of Congress, at the American
Folklife Center and listen

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:20.290
to interviews here in The
Library of Congress, the beauty

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:23.140
and splendor of The
Library of Congress.

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.700
And, again, remember
to share your stories,

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.320
record your stories.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.530
And, coming up next, we're going
to have Julia Kim who is one

01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.000
of the individuals responsible

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.630
for processing the
StoryCorps archive

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:39.020
and ingesting the materials
that we send to her.

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.410
So, she's got some
very interesting things

01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:41.710
to talk about.

01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:44.030
One of which is another way
that you can record your stories

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.980
by using the StoryCorps app.

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:48.510
So, thank you very
much and take care.

01:15:48.510 --> 01:16:01.780
[ Applause ]

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.600
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Julia Kim.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.510
I have the privilege of actually
working with these interviews

01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:10.390
and stories when they
come here to the library.

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:13.230
I'm just going to
spend ten minutes sort

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:15.050
of getting more granular
and talking

01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:18.980
about the app that's available
on smartphones to use.

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:23.870
So, if you are interested in
contributing to the - StoryCorps

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:27.120
and to the archive, you can go
home and do that right away.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.500
But, I'm going to spend most

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.440
of my time specifically
talking about keywords.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.450
And, I think this actually loops
back to a lot of the themes

01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:38.140
that we've been actually
talking about earlier today.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.780
Securers have a very
maybe obvious function,

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.380
in that they make it
easier for us to get a sense

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:48.410
in what are these discrete
files that have sort of -

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:50.560
they can gibberish names.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.970
So, you can see at the top
there's a lot of keywords,

01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:59.100
maybe not all of you can see
those, but, you know, 100 years,

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.210
Clayton, family,
Libbey High School.

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:06.640
So, there are dates, locations,
there are even like full names.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.650
And, then on the bottom
and this just happened

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:09.950
to be on the screen.

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.700
It's a great convo.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.190
Great convo might be
an app descriptor,

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.300
but it doesn't help us a lot
of the times down the line.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.790
When we're trying to understand
what is the value of this story?

01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:21.090
What is going on here?

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:24.650
What are the themes that
we're talking about?

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:29.470
So, on a very practical level
as - as we've been talking

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:30.940
about today, you
can come on over

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.050
and take a look at
these stories.

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:36.560
And, this collection is
obviously extremely pop -

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:42.540
popular for patrons, students,
researchers who are interested

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.350
in this huge [inaudible] of
interviews that, you know,

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:49.480
obviously go across a broad
section of not just America,

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.780
but all around the world.

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:54.700
So, we often get questions like
I want to listen to interviews

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.880
about disabilities or I'm
interested in native in -

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.630
indigenous oral histories.

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:01.440
So, this loops back to keywords.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.730
Great convo isn't going to help,
but if you have disabilities,

01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:09.760
for example, in the first one as
a key word, we can pull that up

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.160
for you for your family members,

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.740
for whoever is interested
really.

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:19.610
And, really the more
keywords you have the more

01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:20.910
that we can search.

01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:27.150
So, if someone comes in and
asks for a topic, for example,

01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:30.670
indigenous in that last one,
we might - we might pull

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:32.450
up everything related to
indigenous, but we'd have

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:35.340
to think what are other
labels and words around that.

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:39.550
So, native, first
nation, native American.

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:43.450
So, this gets back to
categories and labels.

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:46.910
This is just the way that we
have to work in terms of trying

01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:48.980
to figure out what are
these stories about?

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.790
Who are the people talking?

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:53.070
And, what is the value?

01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:56.410
So, people obviously
categorize things differently,

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:58.390
so this is where you
and your role as sort

01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:01.640
of like the first archivist
doing the interviews comment

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:07.100
in terms of interpreting
what - what your role is -

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.820
or what your identity is maybe
or what are the themes here.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.120
What is the value here?

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.510
Right. Ultimately,
what is the value

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:15.580
in this story and interview?

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.880
And, that's really the
main point of this talk.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.510
It's that you can go
home and you can decide.

01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.720
Is it appropriate
to do first nation

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.310
or is it appropriate
to do indigenous?

01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:27.220
Is it appropriate to do Muslim?

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.190
Is it appropriate to
do Muslim American?

01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:33.210
But, what I'm talking about
very broadly is then trying

01:19:33.210 --> 01:19:35.540
to address all these
questions, like who, what,

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:36.950
where and then in
these keywords.

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:38.810
So, if you actually
look in the app,

01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:41.880
it'll give you some examples
of how to answer these things.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.640
So, they can be - we would
like ideally for them

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.980
to be both very broad.

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.970
For example, family, mother,
sister in terms of relationships

01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:53.770
that are being talked
about, but also full names.

01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:56.980
So, if - if you come in and
say my mother, [inaudible] Kim,

01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:00.310
wants to hear her
interview, I can search that.

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:06.570
It has to actually be put in.

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:09.140
So, there's a - there's sort
of a bounce that we're trying

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.770
to hit in terms of
broader themes,

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:14.060
but also very - a
lot of specificity.

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.830
And, here's a great
example actually

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:18.140
from the StoryCorps.me
website which has a lot

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.970
of great resources that sort of
walk you through what our best

01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:22.730
and ideal practice is.

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:26.550
So, you don't - you're not
completely limited to keywords,

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:29.640
but also the interview title
can be very descriptive.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.820
So, here it's Flatbush Community
Garden Center, Jane and John

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.870
on the transformative
power of urban gardening,

01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:39.280
and then summary
and descriptions.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.170
So, in this example,
I found the summary

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.660
and description really
important because it talks

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.570
about the relationship
actually between the interview

01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:48.850
and interviewee, as they
are both the co-founders

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:52.660
of this garden that's
being talked about.

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:55.910
This is actually a
look at the public API

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:57.660
for the StoryCorps.me.

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.720
So, once you submit your - press
the submit button on the phone,

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.190
it's actually immediately
available on the API publically,

01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:07.490
which I find really amazing.

01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:11.240
So, you can find, for example,
in this - this is an example

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.610
from the last couple of days
from the great Ramadan listen,

01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:17.990
which is another big
initiative by StoryCorps.me.

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:20.310
And, so you can see
that there are -

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:22.830
there are very specific
keywords,

01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:27.170
but in this one really,
they are just really Muslim

01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:28.470
and Islam related keywords

01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:30.200
and they're actually the
only keywords really,

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.960
so they're very sparse
in that way.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.720
So, you can see another example
here of how these keywords look

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.250
on the public API if
you were to submit them.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:42.470
So, Ramadan and then the
locations, Oregon, United States

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.770
and dates and so forth.

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:47.210
I thought it would be really
interesting because of the -

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:50.440
the discussion about diversity
and cross sections to look

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.920
at some MALA StoryCorps
keywords that were put in.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:58.330
So, I found it really
interesting that in -

01:21:58.330 --> 01:21:59.890
in a broad number
of them actually,

01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:04.790
it seemed like maybe Islam and
Muslim were not explicitly put

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:07.040
in and yet, maybe there
are themes around it

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.150
or maybe it was part -

01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:11.260
it was part of this
collection in some way.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:15.160
And, so I think it - it
comes back to - over here,

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.780
here's another really good one

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.990
where the different keywords
included for example advice,

01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:24.570
aging, art, college,
divorce, ethnic identity,

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:26.920
cultural expectations,
independence,

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.750
leadership, volunteerism.

01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:31.990
And, these were definitely
very broad applicable themes

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:34.770
on this interview.

01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:38.210
But, maybe if I had
been looking for this

01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:40.240
and it hadn't been
labeled as part of MALA,

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.780
I would not have
found this collection.

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:45.450
So, if somebody came in and said
I want, you know, this interview

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:49.620
about Muslims - this interview,
for example, would have not -

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.800
would have not come
up in the search,

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.560
but I also think maybe it wasn't
- maybe it wasn't relevant.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.530
Going back to some of the
excerpts that we heard earlier,

01:22:57.530 --> 01:23:01.070
maybe this person didn't feel
comfortable self-identity

01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:07.100
strictly as Muslim or maybe
this person was atheist, but,

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:10.100
you know, had some sort

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.950
of cultural relationship
or - of some kind.

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:16.030
So, I think it's -
it's interesting to -

01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:20.020
to think about how these
labels are very important

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:23.110
and they have a very, very
practical usage, so we have -

01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:25.660
we have people coming
in all the time asking

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:26.960
about the StoryCorps interviews,

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.960
but also that there's a
high level of interpretation

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.040
when you go home and use
your phone and use the app

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.040
and that you can
self-identify if you want to.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:38.650
You can explicitly say I'm going
to identify as Korean American

01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:43.160
or I choose not to because
I feel like there's a sort

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.650
of flattening affect
with the keywords

01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:49.650
or I just don't feel
comfortable with that.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:52.810
So, that's sort of
my ten minutes.

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:56.370
But, I know you must think, wow,
this is chaotic, how do manage

01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:59.170
and classify when you
have 80,000 interviews.

01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:01.560
I'm just going to point out that
there's - there's a whole system

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.750
in place where we - at
the library and archivists

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.540
and librarians here
do this professionally

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:10.930
and their categories and ways to
do this, so this is a snapshot

01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:15.980
of our authority list,
specifically around Muslim.

01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:19.250
So, there're - there are
whole areas of study here,

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:21.110
but the point of the
app and in some ways one

01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:22.410
of the great things
about the app is

01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:26.550
that it embraces your own
interpretation and that if -

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:28.950
when - as you - when you -
when you go home and contribute

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:32.120
to this, you can do
whatever you want in terms

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:35.820
of identifying yourself or not.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.690
So, I would encourage you
to use the app and come

01:24:38.690 --> 01:24:43.690
and use your collections and
sort of keywords in ten minutes.

01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:45.490
Thank you.

01:24:45.490 --> 01:25:06.370
[ Applause ]

01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:07.670
&gt;&gt; Hello.

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:08.970
&gt;&gt; Hello.

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you to Julia
and thank you

01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:11.660
to everyone who's spoken today.

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:15.960
It's been an amazing couple
of hours of stories and -

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.950
and talking about
stories and talking

01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:19.250
about what they mean to us.

01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:22.690
So, we want to thank
everyone from MALA who's here

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:24.620
and everyone from StoryCorps.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.700
And, my name is Steve
Winick and I work

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.000
for the American
Folklife Center,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.360
so I'm from that third
organization you have been

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.690
hearing about quite a bit.

01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:34.930
And, I'm here to talk
to you about a sort

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.520
of more general approach

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.200
to collecting cultural
documentation.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.090
So, I think to begin we can say
that the genius of StoryCorps is

01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:47.690
that the - the StoryCorps
principal was

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:49.640
to facilitate these
kinds of interviews.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.120
Right. Make them really
easy for people to do.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.740
And, in so doing, they -
they sort of made a lot

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.030
of those background decisions
that you have to make

01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:00.180
if you're going to do
cultural documentation,

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.840
they made those decisions
for you and put them in place

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.680
so that you could just
go in and do interviews.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.400
And, the result of this is
is this amazing collection

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.550
of recorded interviews and
- and what comes out of

01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:14.340
that are these wonderful
edited stories that you hear

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.910
on the radio or that you can
see in animations on YouTube.

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:20.350
They've done some really great
things with them as well.

01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:25.120
The - the only thing about
this approach that can be seen

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.630
as a drawback is the, you
know, we've got a question,

01:26:27.630 --> 01:26:31.410
for example, are you going
to make a film documentary.

01:26:31.410 --> 01:26:33.950
And, you can't do that
with a documentation

01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:36.240
that StoryCorps has
produced exclusively.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.120
You would have to go in and make
other documentation including

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.230
footage in order to do that.

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:45.670
And so, taking a step backwards
is what I'm going to do now

01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:48.760
and talk about doing
documentation, but you have

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:53.310
to decide what the model is
before you start that process.

01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:56.640
And, I'm going to be talking
sort of jumping off from a book

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.110
that the American Folklife
Center has just put

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:00.410
out about a year ago.

01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:02.290
It's called Folklife
and Field Work.

01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:04.440
And, there are copies of this
book on the table outside.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.380
Everyone could have
taken one on the way in,

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.680
but you can now take
one on the way

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.760
out if you didn't take
one on the way in.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.830
And, this describes that process
of doing cultural documentation

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:17.890
from the sort of
beginning to the end,

01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:19.190
the soup to nuts approach.

01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:21.710
So, I'm going to start.

01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:23.570
So, this is really
about thinking

01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:29.190
about folklife field work
in - in a digital world.

01:27:29.190 --> 01:27:32.990
So, it begins with this
question of what is folklife

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:34.290
and here's where I'm nervous.

01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:36.260
You won't be able to read the
slide, but it won't matter,

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:38.180
because I'll - I'll
read it for you as well.

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.390
So, one of the great
things about being

01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:42.980
at the American Folklife
Center, our - our director

01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.780
at the beginning,
Betsy Peterson,

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.300
explained that we were placed
here at The Library of Congress

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:50.660
in order to document the
diversity of American folklife

01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:53.000
and that really is our
legislation and it's -

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.300
it's an inspiring piece of
legislation because it begins

01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:00.390
by saying how important
diversity is to American life

01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:02.260
and that we should be
documenting it and -

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.340
and keeping - preserving
that documentation

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.760
in The Library of Congress.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.270
And, so that's - that's a
great part of the legislation,

01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:12.860
but another part is that it
actually defines folklife

01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:15.590
so that it can direct
us as to what it is

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:17.110
that we're supposed to document.

01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:19.110
And so, this actually
- this definition

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:22.410
of folklife actually
comes from the public law

01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:24.140
that established the
American Folklife Center,

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:26.850
so this is the wisdom
of the U.S. Congress.

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:30.310
And, I'm not just saying
that because I have to.

01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:32.390
So, this is how they
define folklife.

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:35.850
The traditional expressive
shared culture of various groups

01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:39.790
in the United States,
familial, ethnic, occupational,

01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:41.590
religious and regional.

01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:43.960
It says expressive culture
includes a wide range

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.530
of creative and symbolic
forms such as custom, belief,

01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:51.840
technical skill, language,
literature, art, architecture,

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.100
music, play, dance,
drama, ritual, pageantry

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.350
and handy craft and
that it explains

01:28:58.350 --> 01:29:01.170
that these expressions
are mainly learned orally

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:04.730
by imitation or in performance
and are generally maintained

01:29:04.730 --> 01:29:07.990
or perpetuated without
benefit or formal instruction

01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:09.590
or institutional direction.

01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:15.180
So, essentially, it's saying
that - that folklife is -

01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.490
is sort of small scaled,
traditional culture

01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:21.240
that is maintained in
communities of all kinds.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.690
And, the American Folklife
Center exists to document

01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:27.450
and preserve such culture.

01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:31.650
So, now the question is
what is this word fieldwork,

01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:34.700
which is in the title, and I
put ethnographic in parentheses

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:37.320
because other disciplines
use fieldwork too,

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.300
like geologists consider
going out and collecting rocks

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:41.730
to be a form of fieldwork

01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:43.030
and that's not what
we're talking about.

01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:44.970
We're talking about
cultural documentation.

01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:50.000
So, what fieldwork really is
is the firsthand observation

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.480
and documentation of
culture and this results

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.470
in various forms
of documentation.

01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:58.510
And, you see a list of the kinds
of things that you might end

01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:01.240
up with if you did
ethnographic field work.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.970
And, many of these forms now are
going to be - come in the form

01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:06.270
of digital files, right.

01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:07.960
Even though they're written
notes, they're actually going

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.340
to be Word documents as opposed
to a notebook in a lot of cases.

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:14.540
So, you end up with a lot of
digital files and you also end

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:18.710
up probably with some analog
materials, drawings, objects,

01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:20.750
and I put forms in there,
because it's important

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.050
to get people's permission,

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:23.350
which we'll talk
about in a minute.

01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:24.650
And, so we - forms come

01:30:24.650 --> 01:30:27.750
with pretty much any
collection of this type.

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:32.320
And so, here's how you would
get started in such a process.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.270
The first thing that
you have to do is think

01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:36.720
about what your goals
and outcomes are, right.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.880
So, one kind of -
of documentation

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.350
or of field work is just

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:43.360
to understand the
community for yourself.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.860
So, you're a scholar, right,
and you want to know more

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.630
about this community,
so you go in to -

01:30:47.630 --> 01:30:50.200
to make that understanding
for yourself.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.480
But, another kind is when
you're helping the community

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.950
in some way, that is they need
to get a grant for example

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.220
and they need documentation
of certain of the things

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.570
that they do in order
to get that grant.

01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:02.630
So, that's another
possible model of -

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:03.930
of folklife field work.

01:31:03.930 --> 01:31:06.500
It's for helping the community
and the two, of course,

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.330
are not only not
mutually exclusive,

01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:09.980
but they work together
very well.

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:13.660
So, sometimes you start out
just learning about the culture,

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.660
but then people within
the culture realize

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:17.640
that there's some way
that you can help them

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.220
with this documentation.

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.180
That happens to folklores all
the time and we role with that.

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:25.580
We try to help the
communities as much as we can.

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.920
And, finally, a third thing that
you need to think about in terms

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:31.850
of goals and outcomes is
specific end products.

01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:34.730
Are you, for example,
thinking about writing a book

01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:37.940
or are you going to
make a documentary as -

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.240
as someone mentioned
in the room.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:42.430
All of these things - all
of these three decisions -

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:43.800
are you understanding
the community,

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.530
how are you helping
the community,

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:47.380
and what specific end
product do you want

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.900
to create will affect the
kinds of docu - documentation

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.200
that you produce, right.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.890
So, if you - if you know
that you want to make a film,

01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:58.700
then you have to start thinking
about that kind of documentation

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:02.120
about making video
footage, for example.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:05.280
And, then you decide
what to document.

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.180
And, I love the fact that
both Julia and I have the who,

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.220
what, where slide, right.

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.980
But, this is very important
because if you start

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.480
with something that's too broad,

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.630
you will never finish
your project

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:16.960
or even get your
project started.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.190
So, you - so really those three
are the three main questions

01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:22.490
that you usually ask.

01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:24.780
Who meaning which community
are you documenting?

01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:28.880
What meaning what facet of this
huge thing called folklife do

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.200
you want to study?

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.750
And, thirdly, where
are you going to do it?

01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:36.550
So, I mean, just as an
example, if you wanted

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:41.360
to study traditional
Pakistani weddings, right.

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.170
You could - you could say
well, I'll study them all

01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:47.520
over the world, but that would
not be a realistic project.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.500
So, you want to have, you know,
each one of these items, you -

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:55.190
you want to have an idea for -
for what the value of that is.

01:32:55.190 --> 01:32:57.370
So, I'm going to do it in
New York City, for example,

01:32:57.370 --> 01:33:01.780
and that will make that project
a lot easier to complete.

01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:05.990
And, then you want to think
in advance about archiving,

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:08.210
sustainability and
access, right.

01:33:08.210 --> 01:33:10.110
So, you are going
to create files,

01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:13.910
these - these digital files.

01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:16.250
In 20 years, is anyone
going to - going to be able

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:18.730
to use the files
that you've created?

01:33:18.730 --> 01:33:23.310
That's a problem for all
of us and it's a problem

01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:26.760
that is best solved by
consulting with professionals,

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:30.710
because it, you know, these
things change all the time

01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:33.290
and folks within archives
and libraries are the people

01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:35.490
who really know the
answers to these questions

01:33:35.490 --> 01:33:39.360
or at least know, you know,
the trajectories that we're on

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.980
and can give you the best
answers that we know today.

01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.160
And so, really what
this is saying is

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:49.450
if you want your collection
to be accessible in the future

01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:51.220
and you want the files
to be sustainable

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:54.800
so that even you can use them
in the future, you probably want

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.930
to talk to someone at some point
in your process and early -

01:33:57.930 --> 01:33:59.390
the earlier the better, right.

01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:02.660
So, if you talk to an
archivist before you even start,

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:06.170
that's probably better than
creating the documentation

01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:08.040
and then talking to them later.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.950
And, what this means is when
you're going to do a project,

01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:13.690
you sort of think about
in advance what kind

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:18.170
of archive do I think this
might belong in, find that kind

01:34:18.170 --> 01:34:20.470
of archive and talk
to someone there.

01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:23.060
And, even if they aren't
sure they're interested

01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:24.600
in the collection
until they see it,

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.470
which is quite often the case,
they'd be willing often to talk

01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:32.060
to you about what
standards they would accept

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:33.920
and why they would
accept those standards

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.140
and what your next best
option is and all kinds

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.440
of questions like that.

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:40.480
So, we really encourage
you to talk to an archive

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:44.210
in advance of doing a project.

01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:46.770
There are ethics
considerations involved

01:34:46.770 --> 01:34:49.290
in any field work project.

01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:51.890
Mainly, the main
issue is to be honest

01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:53.450
and transparent about
everything.

01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:55.130
So, never deceive people.

01:34:55.130 --> 01:34:58.360
Never collect information
on false pretenses.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.930
If you don't know what
you're going to do

01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:04.170
with the documentation, it's -
that's okay, but if you do know,

01:35:04.170 --> 01:35:06.980
if you know you're making a
film, then you should tell them

01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:08.590
that that's what you're doing.

01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:10.910
There's - there's really
not a good reason usually

01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:14.010
to conceal what you're
doing from the people

01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:15.630
that you're interviewing.

01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:17.970
And, the second part
of this is to make sure

01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:20.230
that you get permission,
express permission,

01:35:20.230 --> 01:35:24.050
to use people's materials, that
is their image, their voice.

01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:26.800
And, usually we do this through
the use of release forms,

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.720
which I'll talk about a little
bit in a - in a few minutes.

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:35.330
After you've done all that,
right, after you know what kind

01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:37.720
of project you're doing,
where you're doing it,

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.480
what kind of archive you might
want to turn this material into,

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.010
what kind of standards
that archive would need,

01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:46.070
all of those questions,
then you can decide

01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:47.880
on the equipment needs

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:51.040
for recording this
particular project.

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.560
After you do that, you do
some preliminary research,

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.310
that is to say you're studying
Pakistani weddings in New York,

01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:02.120
well you go online and see what
you can find out about that.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.700
You go to the library and you
see if there are books about it,

01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:09.950
articles about it that can help
you in your - in your planning

01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:12.020
of the initial kinds
of fieldwork.

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:13.890
And, then you start making
community connections.

01:36:13.890 --> 01:36:17.270
Now, in many cases, people
who are starting this kind

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:18.820
of project are starting it

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.590
because they already have
community connections.

01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:22.390
They know someone in
the community, they -

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:24.890
they've been interested
in it for a long time,

01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:27.910
but if you don't, you
look for cultural centers.

01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:29.870
You look for civic
organizations.

01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:33.270
Those kinds of places that
are used to being brokers

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:36.920
between the culture and other
people who are from outside.

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.070
And, you go and talk to them
and see whom might be interested

01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:41.890
in talking to you, what
use this project might have

01:36:41.890 --> 01:36:44.620
within the community and
how you can help and fit

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:47.100
into the community's needs.

01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:50.120
And, after you do that,
you can then decide

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.450
on the real specifics of
what you want to document.

01:36:52.450 --> 01:36:56.150
So, you know, I've got
to now come up with a way

01:36:56.150 --> 01:37:01.750
to document the dress,
the music, and the food

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:03.880
that are going to be part

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.140
of three Pakistani
weddings in New York.

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.960
This is just a project that
I made up for the purposes

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:11.760
of this talk, but that's an
example of the kinds of things

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.150
that you - that you then come
up with when you narrow it

01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:18.190
down to - to this
level of the specifics.

01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:21.790
And, you then start
thinking about this process

01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:25.680
that in anthropology or folklore
we call participant observation.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.510
Okay. So, how is it that you are
going to be part of these events

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:33.740
and not be in the way and
there are two ways to do that,

01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:37.160
usually that - that - that
ethnographers use a lot.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.200
One is to become a
learner of some kind.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.700
So, if you're interested in a
musical tradition, for example,

01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:44.450
you apprentice yourself
to a player and you learn

01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:46.570
to play the instrument
and you document it

01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:48.710
through that process
of learning.

01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:50.730
And, the other is to become
a helper of some kind.

01:37:50.730 --> 01:37:53.280
So, if you're - if you're
not going to be the chef

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.370
at the wedding, you can
still help sweep the floor

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:59.470
and do other unglamorous
but very useful tasks

01:37:59.470 --> 01:38:03.030
that will put you in the place
that you want to be in order

01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:05.670
to document it and make
you useful to the community

01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:08.330
so that they're happier
there and they're happy

01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:11.790
that you're documenting
their event as well.

01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:15.610
And, then once you've - you've
got yourself, you know, you -

01:38:15.610 --> 01:38:18.230
you - you got yourself
placed, that's when you figure

01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:20.940
out who the people are that
you're going to interview

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:25.710
and you're going to setup
your first interviews.

01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:28.220
And, then, of course, before
you actually go in the field,

01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.690
you have to learn to use that
equipment that you selected

01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:32.010
through that other process,

01:38:32.010 --> 01:38:34.520
which just means you have a
little practice, you know,

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.640
have some practice sessions
and go through that.

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:40.440
And, I mentioned release forms.

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.630
You want to design release forms
or obtain them from somewhere.

01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:45.570
This book has release
forms in it,

01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:48.550
so that's a very helpful
thing that you can just pull

01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:50.980
out the versions
that are in here.

01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:53.880
And, those release forms are
again to give you permission

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.760
to use what you collect.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.470
So, if I have done an interview
with someone on video and I want

01:38:59.470 --> 01:39:02.310
to put it in a film, it's
helpful from the beginning

01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:03.840
to have had that
person's consent,

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.850
because otherwise you
might go back to them later

01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:08.180
and they say well, you know,
I was happy to talk to you,

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:11.300
but I don't want it in the
film and then, you know, that -

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.800
that amount of footage is
not as - as helpful to you

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.100
as it would have been.

01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.030
So, it's always good to
know these things in advance

01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:20.460
and this is why you have your
release forms at the outset.

01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:26.260
And, then you can go ahead
and schedule your interviews.

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.590
You create your questions,
so you, you know,

01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:31.160
you figure out what it is you
want to ask and how you're going

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.920
to get the information that
you need and you go ahead

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.840
and you conduct your
first interview.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.460
So, now my point in going
through all those steps was

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.360
to show you that
with StoryCorps,

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.210
the wonderful thing is
you walk into the booth

01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:44.180
and you conduct your
first interview.

01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:47.830
You don't have to go
through those - those steps.

01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:50.970
But, if you're doing a different
kind of documentary project,

01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:53.660
you do and it's a really
good idea to have all

01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:56.280
of this stuff thought
out in advance

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.190
and this is what the process

01:39:58.190 --> 01:40:00.040
of folklife fieldwork
often is like.

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.340
So, that's just the beginning.

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.530
So, then you've just gotten
your first interview and then,

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:06.460
of course, from there, you
just take it from there, right.

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.820
Those people will introduce
you to other people,

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.400
you know what the events
are, you've thought

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.320
about what the events are
that you have to document

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.200
and how you have to do that, so
you then you have a plan for -

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.300
for the process of this project.

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:23.170
So, as you see, there are a lot
of steps involved in planning it

01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:26.190
that - that you don't have to do
at StoryCorps, but if you're -

01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:28.450
if you're starting from
scratch, you might have

01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:30.250
to do all of these things.

01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:31.550
One thing to keep in mind,

01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:34.610
I know that this can sound
daunting, and so the last thing

01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:37.430
to keep in mind is have
fun on your project.

01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:39.910
Don't let it get - don't
let it bog you down.

01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:41.210
And, a lot of the
time, you know,

01:40:41.210 --> 01:40:45.420
you'll find that you get
interested in doing a project

01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.190
like this because you
already have relationships

01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:51.180
in the community and sometimes
the community has already

01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:54.220
started the process of
documentation and you are sort

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:57.210
of contributing to something
that's already ongoing.

01:40:57.210 --> 01:40:58.760
And, if that's the case,

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:01.750
although you can't
make this plan

01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:04.260
from the very beginning
the way I just outlined,

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.770
you can take a look at
what's already there,

01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:09.810
see how well it fits
into these parameters

01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:13.620
and do anything retro -
retroactively that you can

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.450
to get this ready
for archiving later.

01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:19.450
And, if you - there
are other tips.

01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:22.590
I can't go through the
whole book, but you can,

01:41:22.590 --> 01:41:24.990
because the book is free and
it's right outside on the table.

01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:26.690
So, there are other tips

01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:30.570
for doing a whole
ethnographic project

01:41:30.570 --> 01:41:35.810
and for making those materials
that you create sustainable

01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:39.780
and accessible in the future in
an archive and we really hope

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:42.390
that you'll do that and you'll
think about all the great ways

01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:44.890
that you can go out there
and - and document culture.

01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:48.060
So, once again I want to
thank all our friends at MALA

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:51.500
and StoryCorps and on behalf of
the American Folklife Center,

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.510
just say thank you for coming.

01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:58.090
[ Applause ]

01:41:58.090 --> 01:42:01.790
