00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.580
Now that we know how to load images into the canvas,

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.680
let's start thinking about how we're actually going to start drawing on that.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.810
To do so, I've gone ahead and changed out the code over here.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.080
And instead of the image, I've switched in the methods fill rectangle and

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.770
stroke rectangle.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.370
I've also made the canvas a little bit bigger if you're following along.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.420
Fill rectangle and stroke rectangle work fairly, similarly.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.730
Got their starting x and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.400
y coordinates and then their widths and heights all patched in a parameters.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.267
So let's go ahead and see what these two look like.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.990
I will come over here and open up this document.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.340
Cmd+O &gt; Stroke Canvas &gt; Open.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.730
And we see that this code creates two different rectangles.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.437
The filled rectangle starts at 100, 100 and has a width of 100, 100 and

00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:49.035
that's this big black rectangle right here.

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:54.294
And the stroke rectangle starts at 50, 50 and is 50 by 50 pixels wide.

00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:57.243
And that's this gray rectangle right here.

00:00:57.243 --> 00:00:58.950
Or I guess you could call them squares,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.880
because they have the same widths and heights.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.269
But either way, this demo is to show that filled rectangles are filled in

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.080
with colors while stroke rectangles are not.
