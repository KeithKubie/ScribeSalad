00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.380
Justin Verlander and a Chocolate Milk

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.700
In High School, Justin Verlander, Major League
Baseball star pitcher and recent victim of

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.519
a hacker who stole explicit pictures of Verlander
and his girlfriend Kate Upton, traded a small

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.689
percentage of his eventual $3.12 million signing
bonus for a 50 cent chocolate milk.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.039
This happened while the future MLB superstar
was in the 10th grade at Goochland High School

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.039
in Virginia.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.449
Short 50 cents needed for a chocolate milk
that day, he asked his friend Daniel Hicks

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.449
for the money.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.590
“So I said, ‘How about I give you [.001%]
of my pro signing bonus if you give me 50

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.590
cents now?’

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.820
He found a napkin, wrote it up, and I signed
it.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.370
I forgot about it, but after I signed [with
Detroit], he comes over and whips out this

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.370
old napkin.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.820
I’m like, oh my God!

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.480
My bonus was 3-point-something million.”

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.290
That worked out to a little over $3K for the
industrious Daniel Hicks who turned 50 cents

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.829
into $3120 in just about five years when Verlander
signed with Detroit in 2004 out of college

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.369
for a guaranteed contract of $4.5 million
(max of $5.6 million) with a signing bonus

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.090
of $3.12 million.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.720
This might not have worked out quite so well
for Hicks had Verlander not come down with

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.979
strep throat at a key time in High School.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.810
At that time, Verlander was regularly throwing
93 mph, but when scouts were coming to take

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.280
a close look at him at the start of the season,
he got sick with Group A Streptococcus (a.k.a.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.369
strep throat) and thereafter his velocity
dropped to around 81 mph for a good portion

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.959
of the rest of the season.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.640
By the time he recovered most of his velocity
at the end of the year, the scouts were no

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.979
longer around, so he went to college.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.369
Had he signed out of high school, he very
likely wouldn’t have gone nearly so high

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.679
in the draft and his signing bonus would have
been significantly less.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.039
In college at Old Dominion University, he
drastically bolstered his value in scout’s

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.520
eyes in the three years he attended, setting
a school record for strikeouts in a single

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.979
game (17), a single season (139 and then broke
it again at 151), all-time strikeout leader

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.929
(427 in 335 innings), and finished with a
2.57 ERA in college.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.300
In 2003, a year before he was drafted, he
also helped the U.S. win a silver medal in

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.530
the Pan Am Games.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.670
Ultimately he was drafted second overall in
2004, after Matt Bush.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.030
As you might expect from becoming instantly
wealthy right out of college and since bolstering

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.720
that with a seven year $180 million contract,
among other earnings throughout his career,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.790
Verlander does not regret signing the deal
for the chocolate milk.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.720
“Was a chocolate milk worth $3,000?

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.650
I want to say yes.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.590
I was parched.”

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.810
Bonus Facts:
• Milk is white thanks to a protein called

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.490
casein, which makes up about 80% of the proteins
in milk.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.860
Casein scatters and deflects light more or
less uniformly throughout the visual spectrum,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.930
so milk looks white in the human visible spectrum.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.490
• The reason raw milk goes bad so quickly
when left out, at least for drinking purposes,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.470
is that the lactose in milk ends up getting
processed by microorganisms into lactic acid.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.570
Depending on the microorganisms performing
this processing, this can produce a variety

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.810
of tasty products, such as various types of
cheeses, yogurts, buttermilk, etc. or create

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.140
something quite rancid.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.160
• Verlander was named Rookie of the Year
in 2006.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.480
At the time it happened, he was out washing
his car.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.860
He claims he even forgot what day the announcement
would be made so wasn’t thinking about it.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.720
He came inside half way through washing his
car to find 20 missed calls on his phone from

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720
the Tigers.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.140
As excited as he was finding out about winning,
rather than immediately celebrating, he stated

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.340
“I had to go out and finish washing my car—can’t
leave the soap on there.”

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.290
• Grade A and Grade B milk are the two varieties
allowed in the United States.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.740
Grade A milk is used for direct consumption.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.310
Grade B milk is used for making cheeses and
other types of milk product.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.410
There is very little difference between the
two; Grade A milk is cooled using refrigeration

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.370
(due to the requirement to keep it at 45 F
within two hours of milking) and Grade A milk

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.740
farms are inspected every six months.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.660
Grade B milk is typically cooled in cans immersed
in cold flowing water underground (with the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.350
same temperature of 45 F).

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.100
Grade B milk farms, though, only need inspected
every two years.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.459
There are also a few differences in terms
of bacterial count and things of this nature,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.680
but this isn’t a significant difference
when factoring in eventual pasteurization

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:37.930
and the like of milk sold to be drunk.
