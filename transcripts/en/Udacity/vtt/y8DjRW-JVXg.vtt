00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.230
This lesson introduced some of the more advanced compiler techniques that

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.480
help produce programs that work better with the branch predicted, out of order,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.570
multiple instruction per cycle processors that we have today.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.980
In the next lesson, we will look at the type of the processor that

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.260
simplifies its hardware by relying more on such compiler support.
