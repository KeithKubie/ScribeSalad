00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The solution is whatever area we're starting this, it's going to shrink to zero.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We know that because the motion dies out.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Eventually, the position will be fixed and the velocity will be zero.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So any initial condition will eventually be taken to the same single point,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which means that if I start with any area in phase space and forget all of these initial conditions

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of a time, they will converged to that single point which means the area becomes zero.
