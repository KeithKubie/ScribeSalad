00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.080
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and this is Crash
Course Statistics.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.960
So, for the last few episodes we’ve discussed
ways to summarize data using numbers.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.900
We used measures of central tendency and measures
of spread.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.449
But sometimes it can be helpful to actually
*see* your data in addition to having numbers

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.760
to describe it.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.540
Data visualizations are important to understand
because you’ll see them everyday.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.380
In the news, on Facebook, in magazines.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.660
Maybe I’ll make an infographic of all the
places we see data visualizations.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:38.640
INTRO

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.080
There are two main types of data that we might
encounter: categorical and quantitative.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.500
Quantitative data are quantities, numbers
that have both order and consistent spacing.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.229
For example, how many ounces of olive oil
are in each American home.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.749
If three families told you how many ounces
of olive oil they have, you could put them

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.440
in a meaningful order--from least to greatest,
or greatest to least.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.869
This order also has consistent spacing, an
increase in 1 ounce of olive oil is the same

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.060
whether you go from 0 to 1 ounce, or from
100 to 101 ounces.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.630
These properties allow us to do simple math
with the data--like taking the mean or calculating

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.900
the standard deviation.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.200
Categorical data doesn’t have a meaningful
order or consistent spacing.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.960
For example, favorite kind of pasta.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
You might like penne, rotini, linguine, or
even Angel Hair, but there’s no objective

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.869
way to put those pastas into a meaningful
order.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.979
Is penne truly better than linguine?

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.369
Where does rotini fit in?

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.250
It would be pasta madness to try to put them
in order.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.249
The simplest way to display categorical data
is to make a frequency table.

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.929
A frequency table shows you all of the categories
and the number of data points that fall in

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.759
that category (in other words, its frequency).

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.509
To change a frequency table into a relative
frequency table, we just need to take each

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.340
raw frequency and divide by the number of
total points to get a decimal between 0 and 1.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.880
Some of you may be used to reading decimals
as percentages, but if you’re not, just

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.540
multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.960
For linguine we have 10/50 which is 0.2 or
20% of the group.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.240
Relative frequency tables have the benefit
of being easy to compare.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.660
No matter what we’re measuring or how many
data points we have, it’s easy to compare

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.660
percentages.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.810
If 20% of people like linguine, we can see
that’s a smaller percent than the 67% of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.060
people who like pineapple on pizza or greater
than the 10% of my family who thinks statistics

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.480
are scary.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.030
The relative frequency table for favorite
pasta might look like this.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.430
We can also add more than one variable to
our frequency table.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.349
We could ask people to rate their favorite
pasta sauce and make a combined frequency

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.629
table, or a contingency table, of both pasta
and sauce preference.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.060
If I were planning a party, and needed to
pick some pasta for the group, my best bets

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.390
would be Rotini with Red Sauce and Penne with
Red or White sauce.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.140
And because I’m planning a party and because
I’m having food, I did look it up: the chance

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.100
of death by choking on food in the US in a
given year is 1 in 100,686

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.200
But, sometimes we don’t want just numbers
in our visualization.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.310
Earlier in the series, I talked about how it can be hard to wrap your head around numbers--especially

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.440
when they get really big or really small.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.970
There are other more visual ways to represent
categorical data.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.159
One way to do this is with a bar chart.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.060
A bar chart uses the frequencies that we saw
in our frequency table to create bars that

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.709
have a height equal to the frequency.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.940
That way, we can compare the height of bars
instead of looking at raw numbers.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.490
Here’s a bar chart representing the pasta
data we saw in our original frequency table.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.960
You can see that penne is by *far* the most
chosen pasta, and how it compares to Angel Hair.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.060
Bar charts display a lot of information in
a very simple graph, they can also display

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.480
the frequencies of multiple variables.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.420
Let’s say we want to compare each of these
pasta types with either white or red sauce.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.990
We can either stack frequencies so it gives
us the same information as our contingency

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.780
table, or we can have bar charts side by side.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.780
Pie charts are another way of displaying categorical
data.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.230
They use the relative frequency of categories
to portion out pieces of a Circle, just like

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.940
a pie.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.780
The higher the relative frequency, the bigger
the slice of pie a category gets.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.080
Pie charts are useful because our eyes are
pretty good at comparing slices.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.980
Our pasta data in a pie chart looks like this.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.250
Pie charts are great at visually displaying
one variable.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.750
But they struggle to effectively display more
than one variable, like our pasta and sauces

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.940
contingency table.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.900
Another way to display categorical data is
a pictograph.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.840
Pictographs represent frequency with pictures.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.040
A picture, like the ball in this basketball
participation graph, will represent some number

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.280
of units, say 100 kids.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.560
So if Riverdale High had 550 students participate
in their basketball programs, then the graph

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.900
would show 5.5 basketballs.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.560
Sometimes pictographs represent frequencies
by increasing the size of the picture instead

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.250
and it’s not wrong, but it’s more difficult
for us to visually compare, especially for

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.820
small differences, which can be misleading.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.440
Plus, at a casual glance, we don’t know
what the size difference means.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.530
Are we comparing the diameter of the basketballs?

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.500
Or are we comparing their areas?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.940
*BREAKING NEWS*

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.700
This is Channel 2 News.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.240
Looks like all you students out there are
really hitting the books!

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.720
Data from the US Department of Education shows
the graduation rate has been climbing!

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.880
So way to go everybody!

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.020
You’re passing the test of life with flying
colors!

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.700
Let’s push that stack of books even higher!

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.700
So, that last pictograph...not at all to scale.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.170
See how the stacks of books are not proportionate?

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.660
It shows a difference of 5% (from 75% - 80%)
with a stack of books that is over *double*

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.220
the height of the 75% stack.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.940
This makes the difference seem huge because
the axis doesn’t start at 0.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.600
And yet, an increase of 80-81% is shown by
two stacks that are BARELY different in height,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.500
even though the 5% difference looks huge.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.900
Always keep on eye on those axes.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.990
Let’s loop back to quantitative data, which
as you’ll remember, have a meaningful order

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.560
and consistent spacing.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.590
Frequency tables can be used to display quantitative
data, like age, or height, or ounces of olive

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.770
oil in your house.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.750
We just have to create categories out of our
quantitative data first.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.870
We do that with a process called “binning”.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.160
Binning takes a quantitative variable and
bins it into categories hthat are either pre-existing

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.160
or made up.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.250
For example I can say that 0-15 oz of olive
oil is “Very Little”, 16-32 oz is “Average”,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.400
33-49 oz is “A Lot” and 50+ oz is “Excessive”--like
suspiciously Excessive.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.150
Like Will’s 14 cats excessive.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.180
Why do you need so much olive oil?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.840
Anyway, once I’ve binned my data, I can
create a frequency table or relative frequency

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.060
table, just like with our pasta example.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.680
It might look something like this.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.380
Binning is most useful when there’s pre-existing
“bins” for our data.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.110
Like, you can divide age-in-years into the
bins “Child”, “Teen”, “Adult”

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.810
and “Older Adult” because those are pre-existing
categories.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.190
We can also take a score on a depression test
and create two bins: “clinically depressed”

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.660
and “not clinically depressed”.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.310
You can see from this example that bins don’t
HAVE to be equally spaced, but if you see

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.130
quantitative data that has been binned, make sure that the way it was divided up was appropriate

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.490
for the situation.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.270
Unequally spaced bins can be misleading unless
there’s a real world distinction to back

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.900
it up.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.420
Say politician X wants to make himself look
popular, but it seems like people in their

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.260
30’s really hate him.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.200
(probably because he said that the reason
they can’t afford a house is their brunch

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.800
habit).

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.240
Politician X wants to hide the fact that over
80% of people in their 30’s said they won’t

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.200
vote for him.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.660
So he does some “re-binning”.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.640
Traditionally the data are binned roughly
by decade 18 years old to 29 years old, 30

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.650
years old to 39 years old, 40 to 49...you
get the point.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.740
But Mr. X needs to hide these hateful 30-somethings
in the data.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.330
The old chart looked like this:

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.620
But Politician X decided to split up the 30-somethings
to make his numbers look better:

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.700
He moved the data around to hide the glaring
group of 30 year old dissenters.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.180
Instead of showing the truth that 30-somethings
despise him, we see a more...positive view

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.600
of his popularity.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.330
By splitting the 30-somethings and putting
some of them into two other, larger groups,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.340
he can obscure their political dissatisfaction.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.280
Looking at this new table, he’d win the
popularity vote in each of the 5 new bins.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.180
If I don’t show you the number of voters
per bin, it seems legit...

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.800
Another categorical graphing method we can
apply to quantitative data is bar charts.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.880
When we use bar charts for quantitative data,
we squish the bars together so that they’re

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.920
touching and we call them histograms.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.010
The bars are squished together because the
data are ‘continuous’ which means the

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.870
values in one bar flow into the next bar,
there’s no separation like in our categorical

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.760
bar charts.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.000
In histograms, like bar charts, the height
of the bars tell us how frequently data in

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.620
a certain range occur.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:47.230
A histogram also gives us information about
how the data is distributed.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.769
We can estimate where the mean, median and
mode of our data are as well as see how spread

00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:53.180
out the data is.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.420
Look at this histogram for our olive oil data.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.500
For this histogram, we can see that the range
of the data is approximately 85 since it covers

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:06.061
value 0-85 ounces and that it’s right skewed
(the tail is to the right), and that it’s

00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.569
center is around 25 ounces.

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:12.500
The histogram gives us more information about
the data than a frequency table does, but

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.250
they’re still obscuring WHAT the specific
data values are.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.209
If you read the news--or watch the news--you
will see these representations over and over

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:21.209
and over.

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:25.079
You will likely see far more of these charts
and graph than you will create.

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:31.019
The big take away here, as a consumer of these
things, is to look closely at what the visualization

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:32.620
is actually telling you.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.560
Or maybe trying to hide from you.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.440
These charts and graphs give us another way
to comprehend numbers--to see the big picture.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.320
Thanks for watching!

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.800
I’ll see you next week.
