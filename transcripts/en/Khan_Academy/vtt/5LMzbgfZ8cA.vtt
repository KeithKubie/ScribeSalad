00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.650
Lets say that we have the sum

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.660
one minus one plus one minus one plus one
and just keeps going on

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.990
and on and on like that forever and we can
write that with sigma notation.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.330
This would be the sum from n is equal to
one lower case n equals one to infinity.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.630
We have an infinite number of terms here
but see this first one, we

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.140
want it to be a positive one, and then we
want to keep switching terms.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.710
So we could say that this is negative 1 to
the lowercase n minus 1 power.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.040
Let's just verify that that works.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.750
When n is equal to 1, it's negative 1 to
the 0 power, which is that.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.910
When n is equal to 2, it's 2 minus 1; it's
negative

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.820
one to the first power that's equal to
that right over there.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.480
So this is a way of writing this series.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.950
Now what I wanna think about is does this
series converge to an actual finite value?

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.800
Or, and this is another way of saying it,
what is the sum?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.410
Is there a finite sum that is equal to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.260
this right over here, or does this series
diverge?

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.430
And the way that we can think about that
is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.990
by thinking about its partial sums let me
write that down.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.060
The partial, the partial sums of this
series.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.610
And the way we can define the partial
sums, so we'll give an index here.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.700
So capital N, so the partial sum is going
to

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.100
be the sum from n equals one but not
infinity but to capital

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.660
N of negative 1 to the n minus 1.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.820
So just to be clear, what this means, so
the, the partial sum with just

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.830
one term is just gonna be from lowercase n
equals 1 to uppercase N equals 1.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.770
So it's just going to be this first term
right over here.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.960
It's just going to be 1.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.050
The S sub two, s sub two is going to be
equal to one minus one.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.690
It's gonna be the sum of the first two
terms.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.560
S sub three, S sub three is going to be
one minus one plus one.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.950
It's the sum of the first three terms,
which is of course equal to.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.280
Equal to, let's see this equal to one.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.070
This one over here is equal to zero.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.640
S sub 4, we could keep going, S sub four
is going to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.650
be one minus one plus one minus one which
is equal to zero again.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.440
So once again, the question is, does this
sum converge to some finite value?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.530
And I encourage you to pause this video
and think about

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.180
it, given what we see about the partial
sums right over here.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.230
So in order for a series to converge, that
means that the limit, an

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.400
infinite series to converge, that means
that the limit, the limit, so if you're a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.930
convergence, convergence is the same
thing, is the same

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.980
thing as saying that the limit as capital,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.470
the limit as capital N approaches infinity
of our partial

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.400
sums is equal to some finite.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.310
Let me just write like this, is equal to
some Finite, so Finite Value.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.760
So, what is this limit going to be?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.690
Well, let's see if we can write this.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.015
So, this is going to be, let's see s sub

00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:32.020
n, if we want to write this in general
terms.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.200
We already see if s, if capital N is odd,
it's equal to 1.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.790
If capital N is even, it's equal to 0.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.140
So, we can write, lets write this down so
s sub n I could write it like this

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.960
is going to be one if n odd

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.620
it's equal to zero if n even.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.900
So what's the limit as s sub n approaches
infinity so what's the limit.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.250
What's the limit, as N approaches infinity
of S sub N.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.810
Well, this limit doesn't exist.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.630
It keeps oscillating between these points.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.470
You give me, you, you go one more, it goes
from 1 to 0.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.660
You give me one more, it goes from 0 to 1.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.450
So it actually is not approaching a finite
value.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.790
So this right over here does not exist.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.120
It's tempting, because it's bounded.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.160
It's only, it keeps oscillating between 1
and 0.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.100
But it does not go to one particular value
as n approaches infinity.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.090
So here we would say that our series s
diverges.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.810
Our series S diverges.
