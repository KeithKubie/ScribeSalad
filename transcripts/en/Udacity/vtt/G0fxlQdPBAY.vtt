00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.890
Registration is only open
during certain periods of time.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.340
So, before you go to register,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.240
you should check to see when
you're allowed to register.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.040
To do this, first click
Student Services &amp; Financial Aid, and

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.670
then click Registration.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.980
This will take you to
the Registration menu.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.270
&gt;From here, click Registration Status,
then choose which term to check.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.850
Here, you'll be shown during
which times you can register.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.650
There are two phases to registration.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.270
Phase one, a couple of months before
the semester starts, and phase two,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.500
right at the beginning of the semester.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.660
You'll get a time ticket for each.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.130
Here you'll also see if you
have any holds on your account.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.200
A hold will prevent
you from registering.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.850
If you see any holds, contact the
registrar's office for more information.
