WOMAN: I seek refuge in you from
the difficulties of affliction

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:08.441
and the burdens of hardship,
from evil judgments,

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.111
and from my enemies
maliciously rejoicing.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.979

to protect him.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.780
Hey, man, did
you see the news?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.349
They just let that asshole go.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.783
[yelling]
- Get out of here.

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.519
Get.
- Leave him alone.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.487
He didn't do anything.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:22.789

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.891
[screaming]

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.360
I need a gun to protect the
kids when you're not around.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.097
You'd be dangerous to
yourself and to the kids

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.865
more than anybody else.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:36.101

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.439
of their deaths.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.409
If you guys want a shot at
the guy behind Rip's murder,

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.642
the Prince is it.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.178
Last time I heard the
words credible source

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.414
coming from you, things
did not turn out well.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.082
They're exiting
through the back door.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.086
