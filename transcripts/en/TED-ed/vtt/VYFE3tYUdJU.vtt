00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:08.274
Everyone knows that stories

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.893
are made up of words,

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:10.681
from short poems

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.995
to epic novels.

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:13.077
But did you know

00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:14.852
that a single word itself

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:16.658
can tell an entire story?

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:19.613
You see, just as we can look at a story's plot,

00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:20.498
setting,

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:21.630
and characters,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.264
we can also study the history

00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:24.880
of an individual word,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.849
where it developed,

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.047
and the cultures and people

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:28.677
who helped shape it.

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:30.428
Looking into the story of a word

00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:32.643
is like counting the rings of a tree.

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:34.352
Newer words, like Google

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:35.630
or cyborg,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.885
have shorter stories.

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:38.435
But the older the word,

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:39.902
the longer the story

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:42.020
and the more it stands to reveal to us

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.604
not only about itself,

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:46.640
but about ourselves and our history.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.332
The oldest words in present-day English

00:00:48.332 --> 00:00:50.324
are those that come from Old English,

00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:52.502
the ancestor of our modern language

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:53.891
whose first seeds were planted

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:56.217
about 1500 years ago.

00:00:56.217 --> 00:00:58.715
Compared to languages like Greek or Chinese

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.712
that date back thousands of years,

00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:03.880
English is just a sapling in the lexical forest.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.632
But the stories of its words

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.298
often start long before English itself took root.

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:12.292
One such word is the familiar word true,

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:14.264
as in true stories.

00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:15.636
Let's take a look.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.636
True usually means factual, correct,

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:20.403
or faithful to reality.

00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:22.112
It can also mean exact,

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:23.272
properly positioned,

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:24.272
upright,

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:25.336
or straight.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:27.282
A true friend is loyal,

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:28.414
reliable,

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:29.102
faithful,

00:01:29.102 --> 00:01:30.698
and steadfast.

00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:32.881
The word true is a simple word,

00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:34.372
and we can add some affixes

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:36.080
to grow its family tree

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.411
with words like truer,

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:38.568
truest,

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:39.152
truly,

00:01:39.152 --> 00:01:39.905
truth,

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:41.235
and untruth.

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:42.818
But if we go in the other direction

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:45.538
to look at the roots of true itself,

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.374
we find even more relatives

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:49.841
further up the family tree.

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:50.758
The words trust,

00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:51.845
bethroth,

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:52.935
and truce

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:56.056
all derive from the same source as true,

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:58.229
and these words all denote faithfulness

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.793
or confidence.

00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:01.175
A thousand years ago,

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:03.547
the word true looked and sounded

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:05.469
different than it does today.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.337
In several Old English dialects,

00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:09.241
the word treow was a noun

00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:11.259
that meant good faith or trust,

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.500
a pledge or a promise.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.857
But it also had another definition,

00:02:15.857 --> 00:02:16.675
tree,

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:18.259
and that's no coincidence.

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.732
If we trace the roots back even farther,

00:02:20.732 --> 00:02:22.166
we find that both meanings

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.200
derive from a common origin,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.955
where some of the earliest expressions

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:27.535
of the concept of truth

00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:30.672
were associated with the uprightness of an oak,

00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:33.033
the steadiness of a silver birch,

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.282
and the fidelity of an orchard baring fruit

00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:37.003
year after year.

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:39.252
This may sound like a stretch at first,

00:02:39.252 --> 00:02:41.259
but trees are the oldest living organisms

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.713
on this planet.

00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:45.339
Some that would have been called treow long ago

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.174
still stand today.

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:49.087
The Fortingall Yew in Scotland

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:51.084
is more than 2,000 years old.

00:02:51.084 --> 00:02:52.932
A Californian Bristlecone Pine

00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:54.863
is more than 5,000.

00:02:54.863 --> 00:02:57.811
And Utah's Pando-quaking Aspen Grove

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.117
has a single root system

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:02.647
that dates back more than 80 millennia.

00:03:02.647 --> 00:03:04.312
Trees have also held a sacred place

00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:06.423
in many cultures throughout history.

00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:07.654
The Celtic peoples

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:09.331
who first inhabited the British Isles

00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:12.022
believed that trees housed deities.

00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:15.996
And, in fact, the ancient Druids take their name

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:18.672
from the same ancient root as tree.

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:20.920
Planting a tree is itself an act of faith

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.176
and commitment.

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:25.290
Not only are trees upright and prototypically straight,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.955
but they are actual, solid, and real,

00:03:27.955 --> 00:03:30.099
something you can see and touch.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.806
And they are as reliable and steadfast to us today

00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:34.787
as they were a millennium ago,

00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:35.532
nurturing us,

00:03:35.532 --> 00:03:36.356
sheltering us,

00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:38.656
and providing the pages of our books.

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:39.867
Philosophers and poets,

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:41.575
people in search of the truth,

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.902
have often sought it in trees.

00:03:43.902 --> 00:03:45.579
"What did the tree learn from the Earth

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.366
to be able to talk with the sky?"

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:49.086
asked Pablo Neruda.

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:50.784
"A tree falls the way it leans,"

00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:52.382
says an old proverb.

00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:54.293
Just as trees mark our landscapes

00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:55.747
and witness our histories,

00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:59.094
the stories of words landscape our language,

00:03:59.094 --> 00:04:01.967
capturing the rains and sunshine of generations

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:05.517
and sending roots and branches far and wide.

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:08.187
As there is a whole orchard in a single seed,

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:11.116
there is a whole story in a single word,

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:12.817
and that's the truth.
