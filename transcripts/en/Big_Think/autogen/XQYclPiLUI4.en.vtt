in our first book Freakonomics we wrote
 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.409
in our first book Freakonomics we wrote
about the economics of a crack selling

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419
about the economics of a crack selling
 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.499

gang in Chicago and it was really fun

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
gang in Chicago and it was really fun
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.120
gang in Chicago and it was really fun
and interesting because we have these

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
and interesting because we have these
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.700
and interesting because we have these
assumptions if you sell drugs you become

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
assumptions if you sell drugs you become
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.740
assumptions if you sell drugs you become
a millionaire and it turns out that the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
a millionaire and it turns out that the
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.079
a millionaire and it turns out that the
average criminal drug selling gang is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
average criminal drug selling gang is
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.880

set up kind of like a franchise kind of

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890
set up kind of like a franchise kind of
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.710
set up kind of like a franchise kind of
like a McDonald's really and that if you

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
like a McDonald's really and that if you
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.689
like a McDonald's really and that if you
own ten McDonald's you do pretty well

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
own ten McDonald's you do pretty well
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.370
own ten McDonald's you do pretty well
you make good money and if you're a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380
you make good money and if you're a
 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.740
you make good money and if you're a
manager at one you do okay but if you're

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
manager at one you do okay but if you're
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870
manager at one you do okay but if you're
an employee at one you don't you make

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
an employee at one you don't you make
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.130
an employee at one you don't you make
very little money and it turns out

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
very little money and it turns out
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.769
very little money and it turns out
that's the way a drug gang works that

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779
that's the way a drug gang works that
 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.999
that's the way a drug gang works that
the vast majority of the profits are

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
the vast majority of the profits are
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.549
the vast majority of the profits are
concentrated at the top and so we made

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
concentrated at the top and so we made
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.380
concentrated at the top and so we made
the argument that you know the average

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
the argument that you know the average
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.500
the argument that you know the average

crack dealer isn't you know they're not
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.240
crack dealer isn't you know they're not
very well off and you know the average

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
very well off and you know the average
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250

McDonald's well if crack dealers could

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
McDonald's well if crack dealers could
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.170

take lessons from their legitimate drug

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
take lessons from their legitimate drug
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.959
take lessons from their legitimate drug
selling counterparts they could do a lot

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
selling counterparts they could do a lot
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.099
selling counterparts they could do a lot
better so here's what I mean by that

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109
better so here's what I mean by that

generic drugs we think most people seem
to think because they're generic they're

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
to think because they're generic they're
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.649
to think because they're generic they're
priced the same that seems to be kind of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
priced the same that seems to be kind of
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929
priced the same that seems to be kind of
the way we think it should work because

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
the way we think it should work because
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179
the way we think it should work because
it turns out if you look at the pricing

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
it turns out if you look at the pricing
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.289
it turns out if you look at the pricing
data on generic drugs across different

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299
data on generic drugs across different
 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.950

companies retailers that sell it there

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
companies retailers that sell it there
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.770
companies retailers that sell it there
are instances where I could go to a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
are instances where I could go to a
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.520

would cost about a hundred and ten

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
would cost about a hundred and ten
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.789
would cost about a hundred and ten
dollars and the same exact bottle of

about ten or fifteen dollars so a markup

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
about ten or fifteen dollars so a markup
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.270
about ten or fifteen dollars so a markup
of like a thousand percent for the same

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280
of like a thousand percent for the same

that look pretty similar and that are

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
that look pretty similar and that are
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.670
that look pretty similar and that are
generic moreover so when you look at

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
generic moreover so when you look at
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.560
generic moreover so when you look at
this data it's just shocking you think

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
this data it's just shocking you think
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.380
this data it's just shocking you think
how can this possibly be not only how

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
how can this possibly be not only how
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.300
how can this possibly be not only how
can they get away with it I mean they

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
can they get away with it I mean they
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.830
can they get away with it I mean they
anybody can charge anything they want

nobody has to buy it but why would

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
nobody has to buy it but why would
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580
nobody has to buy it but why would
people buy it and it turns out the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
people buy it and it turns out the
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.280
people buy it and it turns out the
reason is very simply that most people

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
reason is very simply that most people
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.940
reason is very simply that most people
who get

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

they're by their prescriptions in a
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780
they're by their prescriptions in a
given place especially a lot of older

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790
given place especially a lot of older
 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.330

people who get you get more drugs as you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
people who get you get more drugs as you
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.890
people who get you get more drugs as you
buy more drugs as you get older and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
buy more drugs as you get older and
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.500
buy more drugs as you get older and
you're more on a kind of plan um you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
you're more on a kind of plan um you
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.910
you're more on a kind of plan um you
just cut they just kind of make the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
just cut they just kind of make the
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.180
just cut they just kind of make the
assumption that a generic pill is gonna

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
assumption that a generic pill is gonna
 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.040
assumption that a generic pill is gonna
be priced the same from one to the next

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050
be priced the same from one to the next
 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.260
be priced the same from one to the next
but it turns out there's massive massive

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
but it turns out there's massive massive
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.710
but it turns out there's massive massive
disparity in that so really you know

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720
disparity in that so really you know
 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.490
disparity in that so really you know
Walgreens is way better at dealing drugs

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
Walgreens is way better at dealing drugs
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.790
Walgreens is way better at dealing drugs
then drug dealers are if the if the goal

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800
then drug dealers are if the if the goal
 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.370
then drug dealers are if the if the goal
is is profit maximizing and I think that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380
is is profit maximizing and I think that
 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.260
is is profit maximizing and I think that
even though the people who are just

even though the people who are just
 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.300
even though the people who are just
selling at the counter at Walgreens they

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
selling at the counter at Walgreens they
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.240
selling at the counter at Walgreens they
are I'm sure not making very much money

you know the shareholders shareholders
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.040
you know the shareholders shareholders
of Walgreens appreciate that a firm like

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050

Walgreens is really good at dealing
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.240
Walgreens is really good at dealing
drugs and profit maximizing so from an

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
drugs and profit maximizing so from an
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.180
drugs and profit maximizing so from an
economic perspective you have to applaud

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
economic perspective you have to applaud
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.720

them from a fairness perspective you
 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.910
them from a fairness perspective you
have to decry them on the other hand

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920
have to decry them on the other hand

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
that's what's good about the digital
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.170
that's what's good about the digital
revolution is it makes information

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180
revolution is it makes information
