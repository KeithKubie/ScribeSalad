00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.300
How do you measure electricity before you've
invented the voltammeter?

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.350
How about with a frog?

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.090
This was Michael Faraday's solution to testing
electrical circuits back in the 1820s,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.830
before more sophisticated methods had hopped
along.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.710
Down in the basement of the Royal institution,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.080
Faraday and his mentor, Humphry Davy,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.500
kept a well stocked froggery, jumping with
healthy frogs.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.430
On the occasion that electrical equipment
or circuits needed testing,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.510
they would select a willing participant, hold
it by the legs and smash its head in to render

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.210
it, well, dead.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.660
"We are joined together today to celebrate
and commemorate the life of Sir Albert 'Hoppy'

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.590
Frogbert III - who gave his life valiantly
in the name of science..."

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.920
Repeating experiments conceived by Luigi Galvani
in 1780,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.510
a thin metal plate was then positioned underneath
each leg muscle, and wired up.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.120
If the circuit was live, the legs would twitch.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.230
Lucky for the frogs, Faraday invented his
voltammeter in 1833,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.290
a device that quantified electrical charge
as it passed electricity through chemical

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.600
compounds and measured the gas given off.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
Today this wooden panel is all that remains
of Faraday's froggery.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.470
Apart for the ghosts that is...

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.340
they've haunted the halls of the Royal Institution
ever since.
