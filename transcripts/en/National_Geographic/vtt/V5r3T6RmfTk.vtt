00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.005 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm really
grateful to be here,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.473
and the reason I'm so grateful

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
is actually, you're
really helping me out.

00:00:09.908 --> 00:00:12.244 line:0%
I made a promise to the people

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.613 line:0%
whose photograph ... photographs

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.382 line:0%
who you'll see tonight.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:18.051 line:0%
I promised them
that their stories

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.285
would be heard,

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
and you're helping me
to fulfill that promise.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
And so, for that,
I'm deeply grateful.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.892
The last time that I
was here in the US,

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.295
talking about Where
Love is Illegal,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.632
was soon after the
shootings in Orlando.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.469
And, that event
was, you know ...

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.971
shocking, of course,

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.840 align:start size:84% position:16%
as it was to everyone
here, I'm sure.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.376
But, it wasn't until
a couple of days later

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.211
that it really hit me.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:49.549
I received a post
on my Facebook page

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.283
from a friend of mine.

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:54.988
He sent me this clip of
CNN's Anderson Cooper

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.556 align:start size:84% position:16%
reading out the names
of the deceased.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.025
Maybe some of you saw that.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.960
He read their names,
and they showed a photo

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.228
of each of those
who were killed,

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.996 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they had a little
story about them,

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:07.199 align:start size:97% position:3%
and what they meant to
their families and friends.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:09.368 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was really,
really deeply moving.

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.271
And suddenly, those ...

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.206
The numbers became people,

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:15.741
and suddenly I felt
a connection to them,

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.311
and the victims were made real.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.216
The mission of this project,

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.484
Where Love is Illegal,

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.253
is about making connections.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.922
It's about amplifying

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.793 align:start size:94% position:6%
lesbian, gay, transgender,
queer, intersex,
voices that have

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.895
been silenced by bigotry.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.397
And by hearing their stories,

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.467 align:start size:84% position:16%
we get to make real
their survival.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.937
By understanding what
they have survived,

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.072
we maybe get some insight
and some understanding

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:49.942
of the true ugliness and impact

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:52.845
of homophobia and transphobia.

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.246 align:start size:84% position:16%
So tonight, I'm
going to talk to you

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.949 align:start size:84% position:16%
a little bit about
Where Love is Illegal,

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.216
the campaign,

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.118
I'll talk to you a
bit about the making

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:00.352
of the photographs,

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:01.620 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I know there
are some people

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.690
in this audience that
are interested in that.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.226
But what's just as, if
not more important, to me

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:08.995
is that you meet some
of the individuals

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:13.099
who are brave enough to
be involved in this work.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.969
This is Buje.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.039
Now, Buje is covering his face

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.508
because he is afraid.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.244
In fact, Buje isn't
really his name.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.480
He asked that we
hide his identity

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.148
because who he is means that

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.450
he can be put to death.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.686 align:start size:84% position:16%
I met Buje and
four other young men

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:37.490
shortly they had been
released from prison.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.558
They had languished
there for 40 days.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:41.093
They were tortured in jail,

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.764
and they were lashed
with a whip in court.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.533
Fortunately, their
case was dismissed,

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:49.401
but the community
in which they lived

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:51.337
were not satisfied
with the verdict.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.939 align:start size:84% position:16%
They waited outside
the courtroom,

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.240
armed with rocks
intending to stone

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.243
Buje and the other
young men to death.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.412 align:start size:84% position:16%
Buje went back
into the courtroom.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.979
His place of torture,

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.450
now a sanctuary until
the crowd dispersed.

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.353
But, his suffering
didn't end there.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.256 align:start size:84% position:16%
They went back to
their families, who,

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.091 size:84% position:42%
in turn, ostracized them.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.761 align:start size:97% position:3%
Buje fell ill, and a
relative came to him and said,

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.362
"God should take your life

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:20.867 align:start size:94% position:6%
because you've caused
such shame to the family."

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.603 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know, their physical
scars would heal,

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.237
but that rejection from
their own flesh and blood

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:26.239
cut deepest.

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.910
So, what was the crime
that Buje committed?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.112
What could possibly have
him tortured by the State,

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:35.648
nearly lynched by his community,

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.084
and abandoned by his family?

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:38.918
He's gay.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.654
And, you know, one
would think that

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.322
we would've moved past
this barbaric notion,

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:44.990
that one should be killed

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.359
for who they are attracted to.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.396 align:start size:97% position:3%
That to be LGBT is unnatural,
immoral, or unholy.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.699
And while, there are now,

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.635
thankfully 780 million people

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:58.771 align:start size:84% position:16%
living in countries
where same-sex

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.073
relationships are legal,

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:03.409
there are 2.8 billion people

00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:05.945
living in countries
where consensual

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.114
same-sex acts are a crime.

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:12.118
So, prior to starting this work,

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.352
Where Love is Illegal,

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:14.486
like many people,
I was a appalled

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:17.189
by homophobia and transphobia,

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:18.991
but like the Orlando shooting,

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.727
it wasn't until these
abstract concepts,

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:24.530
the abstract concepts of
homophobia and transphobia,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.866 align:start size:84% position:16%
it wasn't until they
became real that,

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:29.035
through meeting these people,

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:31.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
that I had any
real understanding.

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:33.739
Of course, hearing their stories

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:35.241
cannot be compared in any way

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.009
to living their experience.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.210
But in a small way,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.946 align:start size:84% position:16%
when I heard what
they've been through,

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:40.780
I felt it.

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:44.683
So, trying to get people to feel

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:45.918
is what I've been trying to do

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.386
with my work for
the last 15 years

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:50.289
since I left my home
country of New Zealand.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.256
I've been trying
to do that through

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.393
photography as a storyteller,

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:56.129 align:start size:81% position:19%
and as a human
rights campaigner.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.131 align:start size:88% position:13%
I've done many
different kinds of work,

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:00.833
like sexual violence,

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.636 align:start size:84% position:16%
work about street
children and famine,

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.803
and conflict,

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:06.839
and dictatorship,

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.206
and displacement,

00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:10.276
and environmental degradation,

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.978
and illegal mining,

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:12.812
and drugs,

00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:15.514
and prisons,

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:17.316
and disease,

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:19.552
and large body of work,

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.921
which I've been
doing since 2011,

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.890 align:start size:97% position:3%
on mental health in African
countries in crisis,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.359
which I called 'Condemned.'

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:28.894
Now, prior to starting this work

00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:30.997
during all that other work
that I showed you before,

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.198
seeing this work here ...

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, I was
starting to question

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.736
my role as a documentarian.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:41.674
I felt that I had
made the beginnings

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:45.544
of strong, important, and work

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:48.280
that could have purpose.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.381
In fact, it was one of the great

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:50.315
motivators for me when I

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:51.751
started out as a photographer,

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.786
I had this belief, like
many young photographers

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.554
who go into photojournalism,

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:57.156
that my work could be important

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:59.492 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that my work could
make a difference.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.760
And I thought that maybe,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.429
naïvely perhaps that my work,

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:07.533
by being published would make
people sit up and take action.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.070
And sometimes, my work did that.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.005
But, mostly it did not,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.541
and that made me
deeply frustrated.

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:18.377
It was really important for me

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:21.781 align:start size:84% position:16%
that my work felt like
it was meaningful.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.284
So, when I started this work

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:27.352 align:start size:97% position:3%
on mental health in
African countries in crisis,

00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:29.989
I started it with a mindset that

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
my work could no
longer be made solely

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:33.893
to raise awareness,

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:34.860
that it couldn't just be

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.629
to illustrate an article alone.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:40.065
I was determined that it
would make a difference,

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:43.635
and I started this work on
mental health in South Sudan.

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:47.339 align:start size:97% position:3%
I went there to cover a
referendum for independence,

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:50.542
and came away with a
story about a country,

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:51.677
which was in a time of hope,

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:54.012 align:start size:84% position:16%
had massive challenges
to deal with,

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:55.281
not least of all,

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.818
the psychological impact
of 20 years of conflict,

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.454 align:start size:94% position:6%
and almost completely
destroyed infrastructure,

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:04.957 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a country where
there are next

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.825
to no medical professionals,

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:07.926
and no facilities where people

00:07:07.926 --> 00:07:10.429
with mental health problems.

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:11.597
And I will move through this ...

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.931
And this environment,

00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:15.968
the prison had become a place

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:19.571
to warehouse people with
mental health problems.

00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:23.309
And I move through this
nightmare of a place,

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:27.680
understanding that I was seeing

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.017
a really devastating
human rights issue.

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:35.755
That was really a crime against

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:39.858 align:start size:94% position:6%
society's most vulnerable
and voiceless people.

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I moved through
here thinking,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.630 align:start size:84% position:16%
"If the world could
see what I was seeing,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.131
they wouldn't allow this."

00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.435
I was thinking, "I could
stop this with my camera."

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:52.738 align:start size:84% position:16%
I came across one
young man by himself

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:54.507
at the end of a cell,

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.577
naked and shackled,

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:01.581 align:start size:97% position:3%
with this thick colonial-style
chain around his ankle,

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.383
to the filthy floor.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:05.617
And as soon as I saw him,

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:07.520
"I thought this is the picture,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.691
this is the one that will
get people's attention."

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:14.393 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, most of the
people in the prison,

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:16.128
as I moved around, were
able to let me know,

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:17.362
one way or another,

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:19.164
if it was okay to take
their photograph or not.

00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:20.399
But, he couldn't.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.768
He neither looked,
nor spoke to me.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.403
In my mind, I was thinking,

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.037
"Okay, I'm here to document

00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:28.641
a grave human rights offense,

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.744
and that's the most
important thing."

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.981
But I paused.

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:37.849
Here was a vulnerable young man,

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:41.520
whose dignity had been
taken away from him,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.390
his liberty had been
taken away from him,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.826 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I was concerned,
was I abusing

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.661
his human rights further?

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.896
If this was me,

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:52.197
if this was my brother,

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:54.099
or if this was my son,

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:55.967
would I be okay with this image

00:08:55.967 --> 00:08:59.338
appearing on the front
page of a newspaper?

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.873
So, all of these things
went through my mind

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:04.910
as I was crouching down
over this filthy floor

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.480
with a camera raised to my eye.

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:11.050 align:start size:81% position:19%
And the conclusion
that I came to,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.085
because obviously
I took the picture,

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.754
is that the only
way that this image

00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:17.222
was going to be okay,

00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:20.325 align:start size:88% position:13%
is if it was made to
really make a difference

00:09:20.325 --> 00:09:21.827
in the lives of this man

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:24.397
and the lives of
people like him.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.331
Not raise awareness,

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.298
not illustrate an article,

00:09:26.298 --> 00:09:28.734
but really make a difference.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:33.372
So that day, in
fact that moment,

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:35.074
was transformational for me.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:37.076
I moved from being a ...

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.945
My intention changed

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:42.014
from a photographer
hoping to change,

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.215
to make change happen,

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:46.485 align:start size:84% position:16%
to a photographer
making change happen.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.087
I needed to say right now,

00:09:49.087 --> 00:09:50.922
because I know there
are photographers here,

00:09:50.922 --> 00:09:53.059
that, and lots of people
in the photo industry,

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:56.495 align:start size:94% position:6%
that I think there is
great value in photography

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:57.763
and storytelling,

00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:00.365
just for the sake
of making pictures,

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:02.735
and for the sake
of telling stories,

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:05.037
and for recording history,

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:06.238
and for raising awareness.

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:07.739 align:start size:84% position:16%
Those are all really
valuable things,

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:08.673
but for me,

00:10:08.673 --> 00:10:10.076
it wasn't enough.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.812
I came to this conclusion,

00:10:13.812 --> 00:10:15.046
and that is,

00:10:15.046 --> 00:10:17.983
that with witnessing
comes responsibility,

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.819 align:start size:88% position:13%
and with privilege comes
the moral obligation

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:24.089 align:start size:88% position:13%
to people less fortunate
than ourselves.

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:25.657
I decided raising awareness,

00:10:25.657 --> 00:10:27.759
raising awareness
was not enough,

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:30.029
and I decided that I
could no longer pretend

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:34.499
that making change happen
was someone else's job.

00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:37.436 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, I tell you this
story about this journey,

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:38.637
because ...

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:39.938 align:start size:84% position:16%
to provide some
context and hopefully

00:10:39.938 --> 00:10:41.840
some understanding
of my mindset when

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.676
I started to embark on this work

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:47.379
called, "Where Love is Illegal."

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:48.847 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, while I was
doing all this work,

00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:50.248
mostly in Africa,

00:10:50.248 --> 00:10:53.084
I was becoming aware of a rise

00:10:53.084 --> 00:10:55.588
in homophobia and transphobia.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:00.659 align:start size:97% position:3%
And this oppressive,
sometimes violent, reaction,

00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:03.729
I think came from these
conservative elements

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.831
of many African societies,

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:09.502
which I believe was born
out of, in large part,

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.903 align:start size:97% position:3%
out of the rise in
visibility of equality rights

00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:14.974
here in the US and
in Western Europe.

00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:18.043
In this globalized world,

00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:21.346
increased freedoms here
can be seen as a threat

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:23.248
to those who would
deny the freedoms

00:11:23.248 --> 00:11:25.951 align:start size:84% position:16%
for people in their
own countries.

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:27.286
And then, we ...

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:30.956 align:start size:84% position:16%
You have to combine
that with the

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.425
fact that you would have

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:36.161
conservative Christian
elements in this country,

00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:38.731 align:start size:94% position:6%
who were, perhaps, felt
like they were losing sway

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.201 align:start size:97% position:3%
and started to pivot towards
other parts of the world,

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.735
and starting ...

00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:47.773
had these Evangelicals sadly
going to places like Uganda

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.644 align:start size:81% position:19%
and fanning the
flames of bigotry.

00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:56.448 align:start size:88% position:13%
Encouraged by these
Evangelicals in Uganda,

00:11:56.448 --> 00:11:58.016
bills like

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.018
the Kill the Gays Bill,

00:12:00.018 --> 00:12:03.522
was brought into court
and passed into law.

00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:07.559
But we shouldn't think that

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.295
this form of bigotry
was entirely imported,

00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:12.164
there were local newspapers,

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:14.033
like Red Pepper,

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.067 align:start size:94% position:6%
who delighted in trawling
Facebook accounts

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:18.037
and taking people's photographs,

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:22.374
and putting them on the front
page to expose, in this case,

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:24.310
Uganda's 200 Top Homos.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:30.750 align:start size:94% position:6%
Unsurprisingly, it's
happened in many countries

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.785 align:start size:97% position:3%
with this kind of reporting
and with these laws.

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:37.389
There's a sharp rise
in homophobic attacks.

00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:42.394 align:start size:94% position:6%
The same homophobic
arguments that, you know,

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:44.829
many of us heard
in a less-tolerant

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:47.233
era in this country, were ...

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:49.768
Came out.

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:52.170 align:start size:88% position:13%
Things like the supposed
threats that gay men

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.006
have towards children.

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.042
It was particularly
disturbing to see

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.910 align:start size:81% position:19%
young kids marched
out in support

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.147
of homophobic laws as well.

00:13:02.814 --> 00:13:06.084 align:start size:97% position:3%
But, later when aid was
withdrawn from the country,

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:07.619
and just a couple of days before

00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:10.488
President Museveni of
Uganda was due to come

00:13:10.488 --> 00:13:13.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
to this city to meet
President Obama,

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:17.996
the law was taken off the
books by a technicality.

00:13:17.996 --> 00:13:21.901 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, while we have ... a
lot of people will say that

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.237
international pressure
doesn't work, clearly ...

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:28.573 align:start size:94% position:6%
And the Ugandan Government
would deny this too,

00:13:28.573 --> 00:13:31.276
but clearly it did in this case.

00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:33.612
So while Uganda got all the
international attention,

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:37.916
other African leaders also
saw some kind of benefit

00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:41.052 align:start size:84% position:16%
in attacking a
community that was too

00:13:41.052 --> 00:13:44.957 align:start size:94% position:6%
afraid to be able to
stand up for their rights.

00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:49.661 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, the Gambian Government
was particularly

00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:51.163 size:84% position:42%
vile and vocal.

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:56.368 align:start size:81% position:19%
But, sadly, across
the continent,

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.937 align:start size:81% position:19%
there was wide
spread support for

00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:00.238
these homophobic laws,

00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:02.106 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it became a
very difficult topic

00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:04.576
for me with my African friends.

00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:05.777
Sadly, people that I respected

00:14:05.777 --> 00:14:08.547
and who's time I
enjoyed being with,

00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:12.451
almost entirely held these views

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:16.055
that to be LGBT was
somehow un-African.

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.290 align:start size:84% position:16%
That it was imported
by the west,

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.227 align:start size:84% position:16%
that it was a threat
to the family.

00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:24.797
Most of ...

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:26.398
Everyone here will
probably think that

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:28.667
those sort of arguments are
repulsive and ridiculous,

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.470
but it's actually
not that big a step

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.606 align:start size:97% position:3%
to understand why they
might believe these things.

00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:36.508
After all, there was
only one narrative,

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:39.010
and that narrative
was that LGBT people

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.014 align:start size:84% position:16%
were unnatural,
immoral, and unholy.

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:46.485
Of course, you know,

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:48.820 align:start size:88% position:13%
we have to also remember
that it hasn't been

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.623
that long that we've
had more accepting ...

00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:54.093 align:start size:88% position:13%
We as countries, have
had more accepting views

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:55.361
of LGBT rights.

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.664
In fact, when I
was 12 years old,

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:02.500
my mother came to
me and said that,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.669
if I turned out to be gay that

00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:07.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
I would always be
welcome in the house,

00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:11.009 align:start size:88% position:13%
but my "special
friend" never would be.

00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:13.611
30 years later, my
mum's really proud

00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:16.281
that I campaign for
equality rights.

00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.984
So, there's hope there, right?

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:20.285 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's ... But you know,
you have to think,

00:15:20.285 --> 00:15:21.987
what changed her mind?

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:25.423
She was exposed to
other narratives

00:15:25.423 --> 00:15:28.761
that countered their
views, those views.

00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:33.965
Views that said that
LGBT people were not

00:15:33.965 --> 00:15:36.702 align:start size:84% position:16%
necessarily a
threat to her sons.

00:15:40.138 --> 00:15:41.706
So, my mum gives me hope

00:15:41.706 --> 00:15:45.144
societies and people can change.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:48.046 align:start size:94% position:6%
But, these LGBT narratives
are very rarely heard

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:50.416
on the African continent,

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.983 align:start size:81% position:19%
and the community,
in large part,

00:15:51.983 --> 00:15:53.886
is silenced and hidden.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.055 align:start size:84% position:16%
But, this is not just
an African issue.

00:15:57.055 --> 00:15:58.590
Clearly, half of the world makes

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.493 align:start size:84% position:16%
consensual same-sex
acts a crime.

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
And, you know, many
politicians see homophobia

00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:04.963
as a way to garner support from

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:07.132 align:start size:84% position:16%
the conservative elements
in their societies.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.967 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is the Malaysian
Prime Minister,

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.569
branding LGBT a ...

00:16:11.636 --> 00:16:12.904
People.

00:16:12.904 --> 00:16:15.607
LGBT people as the
enemies of Islam.

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:18.710 align:start size:97% position:3%
Of course, Syria is a
particularly dangerous place

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.479
to be LGBT right now.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.414 align:start size:84% position:16%
One of the Syrian
men I met in Lebanon

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:23.982
told me that about ...

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:26.085 align:start size:94% position:6%
The Islamic State, when
they take over a new town,

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:27.251
or a new region,

00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:28.520
one of the first things they do

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.122
is hunt down gay men
or transgender women

00:16:31.122 --> 00:16:34.393 align:start size:84% position:16%
and capture means
almost certain death.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.829
Russia introduced
homophobic laws.

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:40.666 align:start size:84% position:16%
They made LGBT
propaganda a crime,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.703 align:start size:88% position:13%
which makes campaigning
for equality rights

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:46.438
quite dangerous.

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:47.672
And what followed?

00:16:47.672 --> 00:16:51.609
Again, was a spike in
attacks on LGBT people.

00:16:51.609 --> 00:16:53.812 align:start size:88% position:13%
One group became
popular on social media

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:56.814
for baiting young gay
men with hookup apps,

00:16:56.814 --> 00:17:00.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
and filming them as they
beat and abused them.

00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:03.021
So, in all these places,

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.589
what we have is
LGBT voices which

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.824
struggle to be heard.

00:17:06.824 --> 00:17:09.761
Hate thrives where the
perpetrators of hate

00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:12.030
control the narrative.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:16.134
So I saw this single,
dangerous narrative

00:17:16.134 --> 00:17:17.736
strengthen and become wider,

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:19.571
and I wondered,
as a storyteller,

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.607
"How could I contribute?"
