00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.100
Let's learn a little
bit about fluids.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.940
You probably have some notion of
what a fluid is, but let's

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.110
talk about it in the physics
sense, or maybe even the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.280
chemistry sense, depending
on in what context you're

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.470
watching this video.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.680
So a fluid is anything
that takes the

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.030
shape of its container.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:28.550
For example, if I had a glass
sphere, and let's say that I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.110
completely filled this glass
sphere with water.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.640
I was going to say that we're in
a zero gravity environment,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.130
but you really don't
even need that.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.300
Let's say that every cubic
centimeter or cubic meter of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.010
this glass sphere is
filled with water.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.810
Let's say that it's not a glass,
but a rubber sphere.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.700
If I were to change the shape of
the sphere, but not really

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.520
change the volume-- if I were
to change the shape of the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.730
sphere where it looks like this
now-- the water would

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.220
just change its shape
with the container.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.620
The water would just change in
the shape of the container,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.410
and in this case, I
have green water.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.580
The same is also true if that
was oxygen, or if that was

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.110
just some gas.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.450
It would fill the container,
and in this situation, it

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.130
would also fill the newly
shaped container.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.070
A fluid, in general, takes the
shape of its container.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.510
And I just gave you two examples
of fluids-- you have

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.370
liquids, and you have gases.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.590
Those are two types of fluid:
both of those things take the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.180
shape of the container.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
What's the difference between
a liquid and a gas, then?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.760
A gas is compressible, which
means that I could actually

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.110
decrease the volume of this
container and the gas will

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.500
just become denser within
the container.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.750
You can think of it as if I blew
air into a balloon-- you

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.240
could squeeze that balloon
a little bit.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.800
There's air in there, and at
some point the pressure might

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.200
get high enough to pop
the balloon, but

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.400
you can squeeze it.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.780
A liquid is incompressible.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.020
How do I know that a liquid
is incompressible?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.750
Imagine the same balloon filled
with water-- completely

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.660
filled with water.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.760
If you squeezed on that balloon
from every side-- let

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.550
me pick a different color-- I
have this balloon, and it was

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.660
filled with water.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.370
If you squeezed on this balloon
from every side, you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.900
would not be able to change the
volume of this balloon.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.360
No matter what you do, you would
not be able to change

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.870
the volume of this balloon, no
matter how much force or

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.190
pressure you put from any side
on it, while if this was

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.650
filled with gas-- and magenta,
blue in for gas-- you actually

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.120
could decrease the volume by
just increasing the pressure

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.520
on all sides of the balloon.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.780
You can actually squeeze
it, and make the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.060
entire volume smaller.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.930
That's the difference between
a liquid and a gas-- gas is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.870
compressible, liquid isn't, and
we'll learn later that you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.710
can turn a liquid into a gas,
gas into a liquid, and turn

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.850
liquids into solids, but we'll
learn all about that later.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.620
This is a pretty good working
definition of that.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.920
Let's use that, and now we're
going to actually just focus

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.740
on the liquids to see if we
could learn a little bit about

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.410
liquid motion, or maybe even
fluid motion in general.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.470
Let me draw something else--
let's say I had a situation

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.160
where I have this weird shaped
object which tends to show up

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.050
in a lot of physics books, which
I'll draw in yellow.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.700
This weird shaped container
where it's relatively narrow

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.250
there, and then it goes
and U-turns into

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.010
a much larger opening.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.780
Let's say that the area of this
opening is A1, and the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.110
area of this opening is A2--
this one is bigger.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.550
Now let's fill this thing with
some liquid, which will be

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.930
blue-- so that's my liquid.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.740
Let me see if they have
this tool-- there

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.500
you go, look at that.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.880
I filled it with liquid
so quickly.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.190
This was liquid-- it's not just
a fluid, and so what's

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.250
the important thing
about liquid?

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.950
It's incompressible.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.610
Let's take what we know about
force-- actually about work--

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.990
and see if we can come up with
any rules about force and

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.250
pressure with liquids.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.680
So what do we know about work?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.490
Work is force times distance, or
you can also view it as the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.910
energy put into the system--
I'll write it down here.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.480
Work is equal to force
times distance.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.790
We learned in mechanical
advantage that the work in--

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.470
I'll do it with that I--
is equal to work out.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.500
The force times the distance
that you've put into a system

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.940
is equal to the force
times the distance

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.490
you put out of it.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.820
And you might want to review
the work chapters on that.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.700
That's just the little law of
conservation of energy,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.030
because work in is just the
energy that you're putting

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.160
into a system-- it's measured
in joules-- and the work out

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.010
is the energy that comes
out of the system.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.910
And that's just saying that
no energy is destroyed or

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.270
created, it just turns into
different forms. Let's just

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.940
use this definition: the force
times distance in is equal to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.260
force times distance out.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.080
Let's say that I pressed
with some force

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.510
on this entire surface.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.360
Let's say I had a piston-- let
me see if I can draw a piston,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.320
and what's a good color for
a piston-- so let's add a

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.690
magenta piston right here.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.350
I push down on this magenta
piston, and so I pushed down

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.380
on this with a force of F1.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.790
Let's say I push it
a distance of D1--

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.970
that's its initial position.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.460
Its final position-- let's see
what color, and the hardest

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.980
part of these videos is picking
the color-- after I

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.500
pushed, the piston
goes this far.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.120
This is the distance that I
pushed it-- this is D1.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.130
The water is here and I push
the water down D1 meters.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.890
In this situation, my work
in is F1 times D1.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.540
Let me ask you a question: how
much water did I displace?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.650
How much total water
did I displace?

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.370
Well, it's this volume?

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.370
I took this entire volume and
pushed it down, so what's the

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.530
volume right there
that I displaced?

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.360
The volume there is going to
be-- the initial volume that

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.510
I'm displacing, or the
volume displaced, has

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.640
to equal this distance.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.250
This is a cylinder of liquid,
so this distance times the

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.040
area of the container
at that point.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.565
I'm assuming that it's constant
at that point, and

00:07:25.565 --> 00:07:32.620
then it changes after that,
so it equals area 1 times

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.680
distance 1.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.510
We also know that that liquid
has to go someplace, because

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.990
what do we know about
a liquid?

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.510
We can't compress it, you can't
change its total volume,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.830
so all of that volume is going
to have to go someplace else.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.060
This is where the liquid was,
and the liquid is going to

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.400
rise some level-- let's say that
it gets to this level,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.640
and this is its new level.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.260
It's going to change some
distance here, it's going to

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.930
change some distance there,
and how do we know what

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.400
distance that's going to be?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.960
The volume that it changes
here has to go someplace.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.910
You can say, that's going to
push on that, that's all going

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.230
to push, and that liquid
has to go someplace.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.470
Essentially it's going to end
up-- it might not be the exact

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.630
same molecules, but that might
displace some liquid here,

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.530
that's going to displace some
liquid here and here and here

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.700
and here and all the way until
the liquid up here gets

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.880
displaced and gets
pushed upward.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.550
The volume that you're pushing
down here is the same volume

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.470
that goes up right here.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.830
So what's the volume-- what's
the change in volume, or how

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.610
much volume did you
push up here?

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.580
This volume here is going to be
the distance 2 times this

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.990
larger area, so we could say
volume 2 is going to be equal

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:55.080
to the distance 2 times
this larger area.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.170
We know that this liquid is
incompressible, so this volume

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.750
has to be the same
as this volume.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.470
We know that these two
quantities are equal to each

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:12.410
other, so area 1 times distance
1 is going to be

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.120
equal to this area times
this distance.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.580
Let's see what we can do.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.540
We know this, that the force
in times the distance in is

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.550
equal to the force out times
the distance out.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.010
Let's take this equation-- I'm
going to switch back to green

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.990
just so we don't lose
track of things--

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.510
and divide both sides.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.230
Let's rewrite it--
so let's say I

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.730
rewrote each input force.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.530
Actually, I'm about to run out
of time, so I'll continue this

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.400
into the next video.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.980
See you soon.
