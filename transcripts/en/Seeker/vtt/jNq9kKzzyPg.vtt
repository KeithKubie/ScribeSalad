00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.279
Is kissing really a universal sign of romantic
love, and sexual attraction?

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.790
Or could you be sending the wrong signals?

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.240
Hello everyone, Crystal here for DNews working
on my relationship skills and looking for

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.570
evidence that a kiss on the lips really does
mean the same thing in every culture...

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.230
In his writings, F. Scott Fitzgerald famously
said: “The kiss originated when the first

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.470
male reptile licked the first female reptile,
implying in a subtle, complimentary way that

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.039
she was as succulent as the small reptile
he had for dinner the night before.”

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.590
While weird and oddly sweet, this quote also
seems to imply that romantic kissing evolved

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.570
as humanity did, but science says that may
not actually be true.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.999
First of all what possible evolutionary benefit
would be gained by exposing ourselves to potential

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.499
pathogens and slobbering all over the person
we love?

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.040
...Honestly, kissing really should seem gross
but somehow ... really isn’t.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.760
In my favorite fun to talk about but difficult
to reproduce, “sweaty T-shirt study”,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.659
scientists demonstrated that women were attracted
to the smell of sweaty T-shirts belonging

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.860
to males that genetically expressed immune
related proteins that were complementary to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.219
their own; indicating a link between genetic
complementarity and sexual attraction.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.850
Given the intimate relationship that exists
between smell and taste it would not be surprising

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.219
to find that kissing is another way for us
to asses the genetic viability of our potential

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:23.219
mates.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.280
Actually, science has proposed that kissing
may be a way of using additional senses to

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.689
help us determine everything from health,
to the genetic deviation and hormonal profiles

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.840
of our partners.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.659
All of which are determining factors in sexual
attraction.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.270
But what evidence is there that “kissing
may be a human universal rather than a culturally

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.689
variable display of affection?”

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.450
Scientists from the University of Nevada Las
Vegas, and Indiana University asked exactly

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.130
that question in a recent paper published
in the journal American Anthropologist.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.539
In their study, the researchers asserted that
when it comes to kissing, intent matters.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.210
They defined romantic-sexual kissing that
occurs between lovers as a sub-group of general

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.509
kissing behavior and then they examined the
prevalence of that intentionally erotic, focused,

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.550
lip to lip contact in cultures around the
world.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.660
Using a combination of existing databases
and reports from individual ethnographers,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.970
the authors surveyed 168 cultures from nine
geographical areas and they examined incidence

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.470
of romantic-sexual kissing in common social
practice.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.940
The results indicate that the prevalence of
romantic-sexual kissing was not universal

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.940
at all.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.760
In fact, within the majority of cultures (54%)
surveyed, romantic mouth to mouth kissing

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.750
was not the accepted social practice!

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.800
While this may seem surprising to us, (previous
reports have indicated that kissing was near

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.620
universal) the authors warn against western
ethnocentrism by stating “while kissing

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.160
may be a way to communicate intimacy in some
societies or may function as a specific eroticized

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.930
activity in others, it is important to note
that for quite a few kissing is seen as unpleasant,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.560
unclean, or simply unusual.”

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.470
There are, as always, subtleties in the conclusions
of this study.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.260
For instance, there is no mention of what
portion of the total earth’s population

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.830
is composed of cultures that do not accept
romantic kissing as common practice.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.440
Interestingly, the authors do also report
a correlation between a culture’s level

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.880
of social complexity and the presence or absence
of the romantic–sexual kiss.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.810
They found that cultures that scored high
on a scale of social complexity and had distinct

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.530
social classes were more likely to accept
the romantic-sexual kiss as a common practice,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.390
and they speculate that the evolution of the
kiss may coincide with the development of

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.550
oral hygiene or social values of self-control
in public emotional displays.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.490
Regardless, after reading their study, we
are left with the idea that while kissing

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.410
may not be a universal part of the human sexual
repertoire, the behavior is anchored in the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.960
“truly universal human capacity for romantic
love.”
