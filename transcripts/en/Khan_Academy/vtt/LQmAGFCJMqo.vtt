00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.409
- [Instructor] Alright,
now let's get some practice

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:05.101
estimating, subtracting decimals.

00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:08.184
So, over here it says 12.93 minus 6.1

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:12.274
is approximately equal to what?

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:14.820
This squiggly-looking equal sign

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.730
you can view as roughly equal
to or approximately equal to.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.340
So, pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.152
And, you shouldn't
really need paper for it.

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:24.335
The whole point of estimation

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.716
is to be able to do it quickly
and get close to the answer.

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:29.310
You don't have to get the exact answer.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.143
Well, let's think about it.

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:32.565
The way my brain would do it is 12.93--

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.758
Let's just round each of them

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:34.984
to the nearest whole number.

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:37.824
So, this is going to
be approximately 12.93

00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:39.794
if I round to the nearest one

00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:40.870
or to the nearest whole number,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.973
I'm gonna round up to 13.

00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:45.395
And 6.1, if I round to
the nearest whole number,

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.450
I'm gonna round down to six.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.522
So, I could say this
is roughly 13 minus six

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.229
which is equal to seven,

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.896
and that is indeed one
of the choices there.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.396
And, when you're doing estimation,

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:01.058
you might have gotten a
slightly different result,

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:02.661
but I'm guessing that the way that

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.626
this question was set up,

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:07.206
that if you do any type
of reasonable estimate,

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:09.329
that you're going to have a number

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.661
that is closer to seven than
any of the other choices.

00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.449
And to be clear, sometimes you
could do this in your head.

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:18.153
For example, 12.93 minus 6.1,

00:01:18.153 --> 00:01:22.659
you could say 12 minus
six is going to be six.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.132
And then you have 93 hundredths minus,

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:27.895
you could do this as 10 hundredths.

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:30.235
So, it's gonna be 93
hundredths minus 10 hundredths

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:31.860
is 83 hundredths,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.693
plus .83.

00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:34.646
So, just like that,

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:36.110
you could do something like this and say,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.408
alright, the answer here
is gonna be 6.83 exactly.

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:42.291
And that, once again, is
approximately equal to seven.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.843
But, the whole point of this exercise

00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:46.099
is to get comfortable estimating things

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.969
because a lot of times in life

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.916
you don't need the exact answer.

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:50.232
You just need a rough answer,

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:53.811
just to know the ball park
of what you're talking about.

00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:56.323
Let's do another example.

00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:58.073
So here, we are asked

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:00.974
what is 56.75 minus 46.9

00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:03.998
approximately equal to?

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:07.588
Once again, pause this video
and try to work it out.

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:09.483
Well, here I'm gonna do the same thing.

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:11.436
I'm just gonna round each
to the nearest whole number

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:12.567
and then subtract.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:13.451
And, I'm gonna write it out,

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:15.556
but you could do this in your head.

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:19.094
So 56.75 rounded to the
nearest whole number is 57

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:20.103
round up,

00:02:20.103 --> 00:02:24.048
minus 46.9, I would also round up to 47.

00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:25.854
And, in our head this is
pretty straightforward.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.021
This is going to be equal to ten.

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:31.565
And, that is indeed is one of the choices.

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:33.044
And, normally in life
when you're estimating,

00:02:33.044 --> 00:02:34.455
you don't have choices like this.

00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:36.325
I guess this is just the easiest way for--

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:38.461
This if off of the Khan Academy exercises.

00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:40.213
So, for someone to be able to grade it

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:41.678
because estimations can be different,

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:43.427
so you have to pick
the one that's at least

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:46.359
closest to what you came
up as your estimate.

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.540
Now, let's do one more example.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.139
And, I will write in purple.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.314
Alright.

00:02:52.314 --> 00:02:53.766
So, pause the video again.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.638
See if you can figure this out.

00:02:55.638 --> 00:02:59.486
Alright, so 49.7, I'm
gonna round up to 50,

00:02:59.486 --> 00:03:02.132
4.16 I'm gonna round down to four.

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:06.221
So, that's going to be
approximately equal to 30--

00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:10.454
Oh sorry, that's gonna be
approximately equal to 46.

00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:13.717
And, we do indeed see
46 as one of the choices

00:03:13.717 --> 00:03:14.550
right over there.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.771
So, hopefully you feel comfortable.

00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:17.375
There's nothing fancy going on here.

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:19.403
The whole point of this
is to just get comfortable

00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:21.817
doing things like this in
your head and estimating

00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:24.405
and rounding numbers so you
can get a ball park sense

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:27.257
of what this difference is going to be.
