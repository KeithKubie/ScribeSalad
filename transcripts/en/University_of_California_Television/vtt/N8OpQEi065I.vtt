- [Sarah] So as we all know, mammalian
skin is decorated with diverse appendages

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.680
including our mammary glands, and hair
follicles with our associated sebaceous

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.900
glands, and apocrine glands which are
found in hair follicles mainly in the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.910
axillary regions in humans. And also,
eccrine sweat glands which play an

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.370
extremely important regulation in human
thermoregulation. So the questions I'd

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.570
like to address in this talk are: Firstly,
"How did these organs evolve?" And

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.460
secondly, "Do they have a common
evolutionary origin?" For the most part,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.150
skin has not left us with a fossil record.
And so, this makes it very difficult to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.170
answer these types of evolutionary
questions. But one approach to addressing

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.250
these issues, is to ask whether the
development and genetics of these organs

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.120
can give us some clues to their evolution.
So during embryonic development, it turns

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.800
out that the very early stages in the
formation of mammary glands, hair

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.710
follicles, and sweat glands, are
morphologically very similar. So the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:21.340
mammary gland develops from the ectoderm.
This is the outermost layer of the embryo

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.020
and it's diagrammed here in pink, and
underlying mesenchymal cells which is

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.600
shown as black dots. And the first sign of
glandular development is a localized

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.240
thickening in the ectoderm, which is
called a placode and this then buds down

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.270
into the mesenchyme and induces the
formation of a fat pad. After that, the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.730
mammary sprout continues to grow downwards
and starts to branch and develops a lumen.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.790
If we look at hair follicle development,
we find that this is also characterized

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.160
firstly by the formation of a localized
thickening in the ectoderm followed by

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.350
formation of a bud. And after that stage,
the development of hair follicles diverges

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.330
from the that of mammary glands.
The last organ to develop in embryonic

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.660
life out of these three is the eccrine
sweat glands which form around birth. And

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.130
these also form first through thickening
of the surface ectoderm, budding into the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.570
mesenchyme and then further down growth,
which in this case involves curling of a

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.230
tube to form the gland and the development
of the lumen. Another thing that these

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.110
organs all have in common is that we know
that it's extremely important that the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.400
cells of different types are able to
communicate with each other. So in each

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.790
case, the epithelial and mesenchymal cells
engage in extensive cross talk between

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:00.060
these different cell types. So this cross
talk is made possible by the secretion of

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.650
signaling factors from one cell that is
then received by another cell and cause

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.790
changes in this receiving cell that can
include changing its proliferation status

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.430
or its fate. Two of the really important
cell-cell signaling pathways that are

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.810
involved in early stages of appendage
development are the Wnt signaling pathway,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.480
and the ectodysplasin or EDA signaling
pathway. In each case, these involves

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.910
secreted Wnt ligans, secreted ligans that
are received by a receptor. In the Wnt

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.000
pathway, the ligan is known as Wnt. So
this is made by another cell and it floats

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.220
out and then starts to interact with
receptors on the receiving cell. And this

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.360
causes a whole series of intracellular
changes that end up with the activation of

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.680
target gene expression and these genes
then can cause a change in fate of the

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.180
cell.
Ectodysplasin signaling, similarly

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.790
involves a secreted ligan, in this case
called EDA, and this interacts with its

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.940
receptor and causes a different set of
changes intracellularly. But these also

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.810
result in expression of target genes. So
it turns out, that Wnt signaling is

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.870
absolutely key for the formation of all of
these different appendages, if its absent,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.410
they completely fail to form. And if you
over activate this pathway using genetic

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:45.130
tricks in mice, we see that you get extra
appendages forming. Downstream of Wnt

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.400
signaling, the ectodysplasin pathway is
activated. And this requires Wnt in order

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.190
to get started, but then takes over from
Wnt in further promoting the formation of

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.070
these organs. So both the similar
morphology and the similar molecular

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.030
pathways involved in the formation of
these diverse organs suggest that they may

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:16.580
have a common origin. If we look during
evolution, our ancient ancestors, the

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.820
sauropods, had, at least some of them,
were thought to have a glandular skin. And

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:32.610
this was selected for in the therapsids.
And these animals lacked scales, in fact,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:41.010
and had completely glandular skin. And
people have argued that one of the

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:48.970
functions of this glandular skin was to
provide moisture through skin secretions

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:54.190
to the eggs of these creatures, which are
known to have been very thin-walled and

00:07:54.190 --> 00:08:00.430
would likely have dehydrated otherwise.
The development of hair has been argued to

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:07.460
be possibly a specialization that could
have led to...that could have aided in the

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:14.770
delivery of glandular secretions to eggs.
So the mammals that exist today, fall into

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:21.550
several classes of which the Monotremes
still lay eggs and they lack nipples and

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.070
suckle their young via specialized hairs.
And these animals include the Spiny

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:34.790
Anteaters and Platypus. Whereas marsupials
do have nipples, but these "nipple

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:42.270
primordia" actually co-form hair follicles
and mammary glands during development as

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:49.040
I'll show you in a minute. The placental
animals which include ourselves have

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.880
developed hairless nipples. And these
probably facilitate the suckling of

00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:01.890
newborns. So there is also some molecular
evidence for this kind of a scheme. So, it

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:09.200
was thought that the mucus secreting
surface epithelia make anti-microbial

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.380
enzymes as an important function of these
epithelia, and these include xanthine

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:21.630
oxidoreductase and lysozyme. And as glands
developed in order to more effectively

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:28.820
secrete these antimicrobials and
eventually forming mammary glands. At the

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.440
same time as this development or evolution
occurred, the gene in coding lysozyme

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:43.110
actually became duplicated. And one of the
copies evolved into the alpha lactalbumin

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:49.830
gene and this encodes an important
component of milk and is also involved in

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:57.050
the manufacture of lactose, another
important component of milk. It's also

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:02.770
been shown that xanthine oxidoreductase
has a secondary function in addition to

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:09.340
its antimicrobial properties. It's also
important in encasing fat droplets in milk

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.180
and allowing their secretion.
So, these enzymes seem to have adopted

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:22.050
additional functions that allow them to
help in milk production. Another piece of

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:27.540
evidence that...for a common origin for
mammary glands and hair follicles came, as

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:36.100
I already mentioned, from studies of
marsupial mammary development. So in

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.490
marsupials, the nipple develops, as I
mentioned already, from a thickening in

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:47.480
the ectoderm. And this elongates and
develops two types of sprouts, a primary

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.510
sprout and secondary buds. And these
secondary buds go on to form mammary

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:58.960
glands whereas the primary sprouts develop
into hair follicles with associated

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.480
sebaceous glands. So this is all happening
during the embryonic development of the

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.380
marsupial. And the last stage of
development, the nipple actually everts

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.600
and it retains these sebaceous glands and
of course the mammary glands, but the hair

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.870
follicles degenerate in most marsupials.
Although it is known that koala bears

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:30.750
actually have hair still emanating from
their nipples. So, this common development

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:38.590
of these different types of organs in the
same structure really provides support for

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:44.580
the idea that these things may have
co-evolved. So of course, the numbers and

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.550
locations of mammary glands have evolved
to fit the litter size and feeding

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:55.880
position. So in humans, we generally have
one baby and we have two mammary glands.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:01.220
The babies are usually, we usually hold
our babies to our chest and that's where

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:08.670
the mammary glands are located.
By contrast, pigs have very large litters

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:15.330
with an average size of 10 and they have
12 to 14 nipples or tits. They tend to

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:21.320
feed in a lying position and their nipples
are located all along the side of their

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.640
body. Cattle, generally have a litter size
of one and only four nipples or tits. And

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:36.570
they feed standing up with the mammary
tits in an inguinal position. So, what are

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:42.040
the mechanisms that may have permitted
these adaptation of mammary gland numbers

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:51.040
and locations to fit the needs of these
species? So in many mammals, the embryonic

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.530
mammary glands actually form along a line
between the fore- and hindlimb buds in the

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.190
embryo and this is known as the milk line
or mammary line. And it gradually becomes

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:08.800
fragmented resulting in the formation of
mammary buds. And this is diagrammed for a

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.150
mouse embryo. We can see something very
similar in the rabbit embryo. And this is

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:21.520
a scanning electron microscopy that allows
us to actually visualize this raised

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.450
mammary ridge. And this can also be seen
in human embryos. So as I mentioned, the

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.630
Wnt signaling pathway plays key roles in
the initiation of mammary gland

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:39.110
development. So there's no mammary
development without this signal. And if we

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.410
over activate it, you can get extra
mammary glands. And we can visualize this

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.300
nicely by looking at one of the Wnt ligans
called Wnt10b, and here we're using a

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.810
technique called in situ hybridization
[sp] to look at where the Wnt10b mRNA is

00:13:54.810 --> 00:14:00.170
being made and this appears as a reddish
brown stain.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:05.280
So we can see the stains all along the
milk line and is elevated in the

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:11.070
developing mammary buds. And
interestingly, in mice which lack a

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:18.200
secreted inhibitor protein, which would be
expected to result in excess Wnt

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:25.170
signaling, we find that these developed
extra nipples and extra mammary glands. So

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.920
these findings suggest that changes in the
pattern of Wnt signaling activity could

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:37.850
underlie the adaption of mammary gland
location and number. So, like the mammary

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:45.850
gland, our hair and sweat gland formation
varies greatly between mammalian species,

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:52.850
but also, varies within species. So if we
think about humans, of course we have nice

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.920
long hair on our head and very short, fine
hairs over the rest of our body. But

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:07.630
within our species, that hair can vary
greatly in its texture and its thickness.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:13.200
Our apocrine glands, as I mentioned, are
mostly axial and we have eccrine sweat

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:20.450
glands all over our body. By contrast, a
polar bear has hair that's of rather

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:25.330
similar length over most of its body, but
this hair is specially adapted and it has

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:32.580
a large air pockets that allow much better
thermoregulation for the polar bear in

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:38.250
cold conditions. It also, interestingly,
has apocrine glands on the soles of its

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:44.100
feet and leaves a scent trail with these.
And its eccrine glands are confined to the

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.770
soles of the feet unlike in humans.
Horses apparently completely lack eccrine

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:57.140
glands and instead they sweat by a
different mechanism that utilizes apocrine

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:02.630
glands which are located all over the body
of the horse. And when these are active

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:07.950
you get this lathering appearance that we
see for instance in race horses.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:13.130
And the hair of the body is mostly...the
hair of the horse is mostly short but has

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:20.410
specialize appearances on their tail and
the mane where it's very long. So there's

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:26.120
an incredible amount of variation here.
For both hair follicles and eccrine sweat

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.770
glands, the ectodysplasin signaling
pathway plays various key roles at early

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:37.410
stages of development. And indeed, loss of
function of this pathway in humans leads

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:43.970
to syndromes where there is really an
absence of all these organs. More relevant

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.630
to evolution, though, it turns out that
there's a variant of the receptor for

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:56.370
ectodysplasin which is associated with
increased activity of this receptor. And

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:03.320
in Asian populations, this variant
receptor is specifically seen in people

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:09.740
who have thick, straight hair, and
increased numbers of eccrine sweat glands.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:16.030
Particularly in the Lee and Han
populations, this variant is extremely

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:22.960
predominant. And this is illustrated here
using a...looking at Asian populations and

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.140
individuals who have either straight or
non-straight hair. And you can see that if

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:35.610
you have the 370A variant of EDAR, you're
much more likely to have straight hair.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.610
Whereas individuals with non-straight
hair, have more or less equal chance of

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:48.090
having either that A or the V variant. And
we can model this in mice by genetically

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:56.630
replacing the V variant of the gene with
an A variant and this in mice, as well as

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.250
in humans, results in the formation of
thicker hair,

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.960
and also an increased number of sweat
glands. So, here we're looking at the foot

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.600
pad of a mouse, actually several mice, and
these are stained with blue stain to

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.270
reveal the glands. And you can see the
greatly increased numbers of these glands

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:24.570
in the A variant. So mutation of EDAR to a
more active form may underlie a subset of

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:31.010
human variation in hair thickness and
straightness, and sweat gland density. So

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:37.170
just to summarize what I've told you,
evidence from development, genetics and

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.760
evolutionary studies suggest that mammary
glands, sweat glands and hair follicles

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.420
may be derived from a common precursor.
The function of this precursor may have

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:53.110
been to hydrate and protect thin-walled
eggs and later developed nutritional

00:18:53.110 --> 00:19:01.260
functions as well. Mammary gland evolution
preceded the birth of live young. And

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.770
mammary gland adaptation may have occurred
in part through altered control of Wnt

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.270
signaling. Whereas variation in hair
thickness and sweat gland density are

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:16.510
associated with altered ectodysplasin
signaling. Now, there's an awful lot that

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.780
we don't know. Some very straightforward
questions such as, "What controls the

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:27.870
formation of different types of appendages
in specific regions of the body?" "How and

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.920
why did human eccrine glands becomes
ubiquitous to over our body and

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.620
intermingled with hair follicles?" And
very straightforward questions like, "Why

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:42.610
is human scalp hair longer than body
hair?" And of interest to many men in the

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:47.410
audience, "Why do many human males lose
their hair in a particular pattern?"

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.980
And I'm sure you can think of many
additional questions that we really don't

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:59.030
know the answers to yet and would like to.
So just to reiterate, that in future

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:05.160
studies, because of the relative dearth of
fossil records for mammalian skin, these

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.700
types of developmental and molecular
approaches to skin evolution can be

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:15.660
particularly useful. And this is just my
lab who contributed to some of the work

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.867
that I showed you. And thank you for your
attention.
