and in this change the challenges are
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.819
and in this change the challenges are
very clearly identified the solutions

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
very clearly identified the solutions
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.630
very clearly identified the solutions
are very clearly identified but the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
are very clearly identified but the
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.610
are very clearly identified but the
implementation is lagging behind because

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
implementation is lagging behind because
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.389
implementation is lagging behind because
the the generation before you and the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
the the generation before you and the
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.850
the the generation before you and the
generation before them as well he is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
generation before them as well he is
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.880
generation before them as well he is
struggling on the implementation from

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
