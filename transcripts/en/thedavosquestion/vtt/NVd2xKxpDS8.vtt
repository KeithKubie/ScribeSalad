MEL YOUNG &gt;&gt; Hi-um. Hi, YouTube. I'm Mel Young.
Um-I'm here at-ah-the world economic forum

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:12.870
at Davos. I'm President of the homeless World
Cup. I'm often asked here whether I'm pessimistic

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.410
or optimistic. And I'm optimistic-ah-because
I think although the world has-ah-problems

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.160
economically, there's lots of ways out of
this. And what we need to do is change the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.890
mood and the mood is about compromise.
The area I work in, in particular, is sport

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.410
and-um-I think there's a huge opportunity
for the values of sport-ah-which are about

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.120
teamwork, togetherness, a willingness to achieve-ah-victory
and adversity. Linked with our understanding

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.180
of sport is a sizable chunk of-of the industry
in-in the world. I think it's 2% of the GDP-ah-globally.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.739
So I think sport, if you start to look at
it not only in terms of its value in industry,

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.710
but in terms of the values that it has and
apply these across all sections, then you

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.680
start to have some answers.
So I'm optimistic about the future.
