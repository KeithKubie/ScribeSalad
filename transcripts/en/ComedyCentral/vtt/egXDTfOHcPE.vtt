00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.603
Really, let's get serious
for a second.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.906
There was really no preparing me
for this life.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.108
I was thrown into this
at 12 years old,

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:12.011
and I didn't really know what
I was getting myself into.

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.646
There's been moments
I'm really proud of,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.014
and a lot of moments
I look back

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.450
and I'm pretty disappointed
in myself for,

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:19.986
but the things that I've done
really don't define who I am.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.422
I'm a kindhearted person
who loves people,

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.590
and through it all I lost
some of my best qualities.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:27.960
For that, I'm sorry.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:29.896
But what I can say is I'm
looking forward to being someone

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.065
that you guys can all look at
and be proud of,

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:35.168
someone you can smile at
and see some of yourself in.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.669
Someone close to me
once said,

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.904
"It's how you rise
from a fall

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.839
that truly defines you
as a man."

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.274
I'm excited
for that challenge,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.708
and I want to say
thank you so much

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.010
for taking this journey
with me,

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.746
and I'm excited for you
to see what's next.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:47.947
Thank you, God,
for your grace

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.383
and for never
giving up on me.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:53.353
[cheers and applause]

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.167
But one more thing.
One more thing before I go.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.204
There's someone in my life who
I owe a special apology to.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.839
I'm talking about someone
who I really loved

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.674
and lost because
I screwed it all up,

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.909
but thankfully
that special someone,

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.178
the love of my life,
is here tonight.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:22.215
I just want that second chance,
so if you could come on out.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:29.989 align:start size:63% position:38%
This is your monkey.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:32.692
I missed you, buddy.
Want to go to the zoo?

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:33.693
I'm just kidding.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.495
Thank you so much
and good night.
