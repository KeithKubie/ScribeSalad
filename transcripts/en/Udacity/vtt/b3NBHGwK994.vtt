00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.090
Url_for accepts the name of the function
as the first argument, and a number of

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.450
keyword arguments each corresponding
to the variable part of the URL rule.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.290
So if my URL needs a variable for
a restaurant ID and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.190
a menu item ID, my url_for statement
needs to look something like this,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.590
taking in three arguments for

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.200
the function it will call and the
variables to pass into that function.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.490
So back in my template I can add this
code inside my anchor tags right

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.030
after the href equals.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.100
Since this is a method in Python and
I want the output printed on to

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.730
my HTML document, I will enclose
it with a double brackets.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.060
When I save my code now,
I see that there are edit and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.220
delete links for each menu item below.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.450
So you may be wondering why you would
ever want to build URLs instead of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.210
hard coding them into your templates.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.820
Well, now if you ever need to change
a URL path, with URL building,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.740
you can change your URLs all
in one place without having to

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.660
remember to change URLs all over
the place from within your application.
