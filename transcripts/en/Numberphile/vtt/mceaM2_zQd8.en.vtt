00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.500
I'm gonna try and capture, contain and investigate a higher dimensional sphere.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.280
Starting with a circle. So, if we begin in 2D, you've come across circles before. They look, you know, roughly like that.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.280
We're gonna try and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.600
contain a circle so we can look at how big it can be. So, what I'm gonna

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.149
do is start with a box, four by four, for reasons I'll explain in a moment. So that's four units that way,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.289
it's four units that way. And now I'm going to put some safety padding spheres in there.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.749
So if you kind of measure, if I was to actually split this into quarters, I'm gonna put safety spheres,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.649
well, they're, they're circles. I'm gonna call them spheres no matter what dimension they're in, right? So when I say sphere,

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.030
I mean 2D sphere,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.669
it's a circle. So, I'm not very good at drawing circles, so, there, there'll be one there, and it just touches,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.989
it kisses all four sides of that box. There'll be one there, which just touches, or, so that just contacts

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.869
that sphere, so that just contacts there, and that one just contacts there. And so

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:02.620
Brady: "You really are bad at drawing circles."

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.620
That's adequate, okay, that's,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.790
It'll do, it'll do. They're not overlapping

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.790
Brady: "Parker Circles."

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.480
That's a Par-

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.520
So. Meanwhile.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.299
So this is why I made the box four by four, because it means these are now unit spheres or unit circles.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.619
So they all have a radius, that's one in that direction, one, they've all got one in every, every direction.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.749
I'm now gonna see, what is the biggest

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.508
circle I can fit in the middle.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.150
So I've got my containing box, I've got my padding spheres, or circles,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.919
I've now got, this is the subject, this is the one we care about, and I'm now gonna try and fit the biggest

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.899
circle possible in the middle. So, how big is that circle? Well, there's the very middle of our box.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.258
Here is the center of this padding circle over here. We know that's one that way.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.579
That's one that way. So what we have, if we zoom in a little bit, so that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.790
complete length there, that whole thing is root 2, and that there is one. So that little bit there is

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.310
root 2 minus 1,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.509
which equals around about

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.969
0.414. So that's the biggest circle we can fit in the middle in 2D. Onwards and upwards to 3D. For 3D

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.710
we would have a cube with eight padding spheres, and so I've brought oranges.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.329
These are the, the cheapest spheres I could find in the grocery store.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.900
And, so that, that's the rough equivalent of what we had before.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.220
You know what, I don't think they're gonna, I'm gonna tape them in place.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.500
-kay, and those go on there. So I haven't got the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.460
containing box, but you can imagine that there is,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.480
the base is still four by four, that we had previously. That's four in every direction.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.440
But now, as well as four by four, we'd have another length up here.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.420
So we'd have another dimension this way, which is also four. And then here's the top of our four by four box,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.580
and we can fit twice as many

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.250
spheres in as last time, so four spheres in

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.540
2D, eight spheres in 3D. And you can see, again,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.530
there's a gap in the middle, right?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.700
So, inside our box, inside our padding spheres, in there is a void, and the question is, what is the biggest

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.820
3D sphere

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.600
that we can fit inside, inside there?

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.760
Here are four adequate...

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.700
...cir... ignore that. Okay, so,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.460
Brady: "They've gone a bit beyond kissing?"

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.280
They've gone, yeah, yeah, they're getting to know each other very well. And so, who am I to judge?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.920
So that is like the cross-section in here that lines up with the middle of the bottom layer of spheres.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.170
So what we've done already is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.970
for the center point

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.149
here in the middle, we know, from the middle of this one, it's one across to get there,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.450
it's one up to get there, and so that diagonal

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.239
was root two. And then, before, we subtracted off the radius just to get the difference there.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.829
But now, we want to, we need to go one, aren't we to go up, as well. And again,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.219
it's another quarter of the whole box. So we have to go up a single unit, and so we need to do Pythagoras with

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.539
that, our base is now root two, and then our height is one. And so to work out what that is, root 2 squared is 2,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.790
one squared is one. That there is root three. And actually, Pythagoras

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.239
generalizes to any number of dimensions.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.899
It's just the square of all the different orthogonal directions, take the square, add them together, take the square root. Very straightforward.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.370
So that's gonna make our lives very easy going forward. And once again, that diagonal, we want the difference between the radius of the sphere and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.770
what's left. And so our new

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:49.300
radius of the biggest sphere we can fit in there is root 3 minus 1, which equals

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.540
0.732 ... you know ... 05,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.560
some stuff, okay. So actually, it's slightly bigger.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.910
And that kind of makes sense, because, you know, there's not much room there to fit a circle in. There's a little bit more space

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.000
in there,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.330
because, you know, there are more directions you can go in.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.270
The question now is what happens in, in 4D? What happens in 5D? If we keep going

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.600
up and up and up and up and up, what's the maximum size?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.360
The box is never getting any bigger.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.660
It's always four in every direction. The spheres are never getting any bigger. The packing spheres are always radius one.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.460
The middle sphere is

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.240
always

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.290
inside

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.489
the void left between the box, which isn't getting bigger,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.920
it's getting more directions within it, but it's not getting bigger lengths, and the spheres, which, again,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.970
they go in more directions,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.999
but they're not getting bigger. And a sphere is always, in any dimension, all the points which are the

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.480
same distance from some central point, you just have more directions in which that can happen.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.680
So this is the dimension D that

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.020
we're currently working in, and this is the radius of the middle

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.100
sphere in

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.140
dimension D.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.919
So, we've already done the first couple. We, in 2D, it was 0.4142,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.929
3D, which we just did, 0.7320,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.310
4D, it's still the square of one, square of one, square of one,

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.179
square of one, for the fourth direction, add them together, take the square root,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.350
which is 2! That's not so straightforward. So in fact, the radius of

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.109
the central sphere in 4D is

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.520
root 4,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.200
which is 2 minus 1, which is 1. So now, the middle sphere

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.680
has exactly the same radius as the padding spheres around it. So there will be 16 padding spheres in 4D, and the single one

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.426
in the middle is exactly the same size.

00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:40.320
Brady: "That's awesome!"

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.560
It's pretty, it's pretty cool. 4D, lovely stuff happens.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.549
5D - let's see what happens. You have now got

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.840
32 padding spheres, the box is 4 in all of 5 different directions, and the middle one has a radius of 1.2360,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.220
so now it's bigger. The middle one is is bigger than the other ones around it. That's odd.

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.029
Let's keep going. In 6 dimensions,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.939
it is 1.4494 bunch of stuff, a little bit bigger again,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.920
but hopefully slowing down. 7 dimensions, 1.6457.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.020
8 dimensions, 1.8284.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.380
9 dimensions, it's 2.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.060
So, in 9D, the middle sphere

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.270
has the same radius as

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:36.830
the distance from its center to the outside of the containing box. So in 9D, the middle sphere has just

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.370
contacted

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.370
the outer

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.829
surface of the box. It's, it's somehow got past the padding spheres, which are all over it,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.400
it's got through them, even though it's limited

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.920
by them, like, they, they define how big it is.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.340
Brady: "It's not allowed to touch them."

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.520
It's not, it kisses them, it's not going through them. Somehow,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.880
it's big enough that it's contacting the box without

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.859
going through the spheres touching it.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.039
An in 10D, slightly disturbingly, it escapes the box completely. It's now 2.162.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:17.899
So, as of ten dimensions, and indeed ten dimensions onwards, it is bigger than the original box which was containing it.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.040
I mean, the short moral of the story is that higher dimensional spheres are really weird.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.840
And difficult to contain.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.100
Brady: "How are you reconciling this in your head? How does it make sense to you?"

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.600
Ah!

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.780
There, there's a trick you can use in mathematics called not worrying about it.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.560
Everything we have learnt

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.660
no longer really works.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:41.809
And so, people who do have to come to grips with higher dimensional spheres will describe them as being spiky.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.700
Higher dimensional spheres are spiky.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.860
There's some of those spikes are making it out of the box.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.220
Brady: "Like that ship that Superman went up in in the original Superman movie?"

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.760
That, I mean, I was trying to think of a good example

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:58.219
which everyone will be able to, you know, really connect with. And I think you've nailed it with that

00:08:58.889 --> 00:08:59.940
70s?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.480
Superman reference, if I remember the film? Well, good job, good job.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.320
I can see how you're the master of bringing science to the masses, Brady.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.800
Brady: "I'm gonna put the picture on the screen!"

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.060
Okay, you put the picture on the screen. Good point, good point.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.109
No, yeah, so, so imagine that, imagine your favorite film with a spiky thing in it. It's a bit like that.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.690
And so, people don't get hung up on that. So you just go, higher dimensional spheres are spiky.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:27.289
And our word "spiky" is not perfect, but in some way it grasps what's going on in higher dimensions.

00:09:27.289 --> 00:09:31.440
It just turns out, the more dimensionss the sphere is in, the pointier it gets.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.920
