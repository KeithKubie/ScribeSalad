00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay. So this next part what we're going to talk about I have to admit is a little bit tricky.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It will require some serious focus, and it's something I was never shown in school

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but after having seen this what I'm about to show you I had to say my mind was fairly blown.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So just for some anticipation, I want to show you what we have. We have a one-dimensional motion.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We have a mass moving back and forth in a straight line on a spring.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I don't see any right triangles here, do you? I don't think so.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yet, what we're going to get pretty soon is an entirely new way of looking at trigonometryâ€”

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the science of right triangles.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This graph is a graph of position versus velocity so on the x axis here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we have position and I've divided by Xmax, the maximum possible position.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So if I were to put a dot here that would mean that at some point in time

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the mass was all the way at the maximum possible position.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's why this number is 1 and notice that I put it here. I didn't put the dot here or here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And that's because on the vertical axis, I have velocity.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Here velocity can be as much as positive Vmax, which we calculated earlier.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Or negative Vmax. Positive this way. Negative that way.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But we know that for the instant when the block is over here its velocity is equal to 0.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It stops for that instant before it gets pulled back to its equilibrium. Okay.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So this is a point on our graph of position versus velocity.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's see if we can fill out some more points.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I promise you we are going to see something very interesting.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I've given you four possible suggestions for points that should exist on this graph.

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can you select the appropriate one?
