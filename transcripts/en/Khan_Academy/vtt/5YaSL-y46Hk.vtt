00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:02.805
Voiceover: Let's do a quick
review of contango and

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.472
backwardation because they
really are opposites of each

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:08.005
other, but they're used in
different context, sometimes

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.206
with the exact right meaning,
sometimes with the not so

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:12.804
right meaning, so let's clarify
what we're talking about.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:17.404
So if you hear a commodities
trader say that a market

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:21.537
is in contango, they're normally
just referring to the fact

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:24.738
that you have an upward
sloping futures curve.

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:27.190
So technically it'd be just
you would call it a normal

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.357
futures curve because it's
upward sloping. They would

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:32.205
call it contango. It sounds a
little fancier and if you were

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:35.869
to hear a commodities trader
say that a market is in

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.861
backwardation, they're
really just talking about an

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:41.125
inverted futures curve.
They're just talking about

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.945
something like this. Now, if
we were to be more precise

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:47.695
with those, that's how it's
used in kind of common every

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.124
day lingo but if you
wanted to be more precise,

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:53.610
if someone were to tell you
that we're to talk about

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.526
contango theory ... contango
theory may be in an academic

00:00:57.526 --> 00:01:00.724
setting, then they're talking
about the notion that the

00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:05.902
future delivery price is
actually higher than what people

00:01:05.902 --> 00:01:09.267
expect the price to be at that
date. The problem with that

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:12.002
is it's just a theory and
there's no way to know ahead of

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.936
time what that expected price
actually was, so it's very

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:18.777
theoretical. Similarly, if
someone is talking about

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:21.987
backwardation theory or even,
I guess more particularly if

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:25.258
they use the word "normal"
backwardation. If they say

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:28.488
the theory of normal
backwardation, they just don't say

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.322
backwardation by itself.
They say the theory of normal

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:34.737
backwardation, they're talking
about the idea that the

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:39.107
future delivery price is
lower than some expected price

00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:43.261
because the seller is willing
to sell it at discount so they

00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:45.796
can essentially lock their
prices in, but once again it's

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:50.020
a very theoretical idea and
it's really hard to observe it

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.102
in the real world because
you actually don't know

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:54.528
what the expected price
is. So if someone is saying

00:01:54.528 --> 00:01:56.861
backwardation, they're usually
just talking about an inverted,

00:01:56.861 --> 00:02:00.915
an inverted futures curve.
If someone talks about normal

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:03.885
backwardation or the theory
of normal backwardation,

00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:07.379
they're talking about the idea
that the future price, the

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.919
future delivery price is below
the market's expected price.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.850
I've even seen the word
"normal contango" used when

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.203
they're talking about contango
theory. The idea that the

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:21.002
future price would be above
the expected price, so

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.467
contango theory is the
opposite of the theory of

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.799
normal backwardation. Now,
for both of the theories,

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.703
you never know what this
expected price is, so you can't

00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:33.464
literally observe it, a
snapshot in real time and the

00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:37.666
closest thing we can do
to observing either a real

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.769
contango in a market or
real normal backwardation

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.852
in a market, is if in the
example of contango, if the

00:02:45.858 --> 00:02:49.266
future delivery price right now
is higher than the expected.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:52.192
As we get closer and closer
to that delivery date,

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.659
it should converge or it
should move down so you can

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.391
kind of observe contango
over time when this price

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:02.102
moves down as we go forward
in time. This is a snapshot.

00:03:02.102 --> 00:03:05.102
This is it moving it down
... moving down as we move

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:09.470
ahead in time. Same thing
for normal backwardation.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.457
The only way that you can
really observe it or even

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:14.325
attempt to observe it, is
to look at what happens to

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:17.992
this price over time. If eight
months, the deliver price

00:03:17.992 --> 00:03:21.392
is $50, but as we move future
... as we move forward in

00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:24.943
time and that contract becomes
closer and closer to its

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:28.058
actual delivery date. It will
converge with the spot price

00:03:28.058 --> 00:03:32.027
and it will move up, so this
observation of the futures

00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:34.724
price moving up as you
get closer to delivery,

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:39.026
that's a better way of
observing that a market is

00:03:39.026 --> 00:03:41.394
experiencing normal
backwardation. Hopefully that

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:43.255
clarifies some things.
