00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Narrator] Welcome to Homework 1.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The way homework will work in this class is a little different from what you might expect if you took CS101 with me.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There will be regular homework questions; these will mostly be multiple choice

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or questions where you need to enter a number or a string.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They might involve using programming to solve problems,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but you won't be expected to submit code.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You'll be writing programs to be able to answer the questions that are provided in the homework.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There will also be open discussion problems, and these will usually involve either

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
designing a solution to our problem, designing a protocol perhaps,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or analyzing a provided solution.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There's no graded aspect to these discussions,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but I think it will be a valuable part of the course for you to think on your own

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
how to solve these problems, and then to join the discussions

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the forums to see other how people have solved them, and to see whether your solution is popular

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or other people notice problems in it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The third kind of problem will be challenge problems.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
These will be problems that you can submit answers to.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
They'll be separate from the regular homework, and these are problems

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that we expect to be quite challenging.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They'll probably require a fair bit of time to solve,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and they'll get more challenging as the course goes on.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's not necessary to solve these to feel like you're following the course and getting a lot out of the course,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but if you do have time and enjoy challenges, I hope you'll tackle the challenge problems as well.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If you are able to solve a challenge problem,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
please don't spoil the fun for other students in the class.

00:01:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Don't post your solution to the problem until after the deadline has passed.
