JONATHAN LEE: This
is the first panel

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.720
in the afternoon that
attempts to kind of examine

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.020
the practice of design, what's
kind of behind the scenes.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.180
And we have some
wonderful guests here

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.570
that I'm very, very pleased
to join on stage with.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.570
I'm going to do some
brief introductions.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.569
And then I'm going to
let these guys speak

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.360
for themselves and for
some of the programs

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.720
that they are kind of
chairing or leading.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.270
And we'll have some lively
discussion, hopefully.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.650
Vivian, immediately next to me,
is an award-winning designer

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.200
and entrepreneur.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.190
Currently, she is
the Chief Founder

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.120
in Residence at 30 Weeks.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.880
It's Google's founder
program for designers.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.490
Previously, she was
founder and CEO of Snaps

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.390
and co-founded the design
studio Tronic in New York City.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.830
Scott Doorley is the
creative director

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.790
of the Stanford D
School, where he teaches

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.120
visual design and
communication design.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.650
He's the co-author of
the book "Make Space."

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.810
And he designs spaces for people
looking to bring creativity

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.940
into their life and
their workplace.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.600
He's a designer, teacher,
mentor, artist, and father.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.570
And most importantly,
he loves ampersands.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.580
Andre joins us from
General Assembly.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.000
And he has spent the
last six years designing

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.350
learning experiences at
Apple, Obama for America,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.420
and of course, GA.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.820
For the past two
years, he's been

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.080
working to create the
User Design Experience

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.840
Immersive, a 10-week, full-time
program at General Assembly.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.040
Enrique Allen is a general
partner and co-founder

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.870
at Designer Fund.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.830
Previously, Enrique was
a designer at VC firms,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.010
including 500 Startups,
Facebook Fund, and Venrock.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.370
At those funds, he helped invest
in companies like Wildfire,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.280
which was acquired by Google,
and Behance, which a lot of you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.150
probably know, which
was acquired by Adobe.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.890
He's also a Stanford
alum and is teaching

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.730
D Media at the Stanford
School of Design

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.380
and has been teaching that
for the past five years.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.950
And finally, on
the end, Michael is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.039
the founding partner
and creative director

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.350
of 2X4 in New York City, a
National Design Award winning

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.790
firm.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.030
He has three decades of design
education experience teaching

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.810
at the Rhode Island
School of Design,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.680
teaching at Yale School
of Art, and is currently

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.460
the Director of the
Graphic Architecture

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.740
Project at Columbia's graduate
program for Architecture.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.560
His new book
"Multiple Signatures"

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.250
was published by
Rizzoli last year.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.145
And with that, I'm going to
advance to some of your slides.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.170
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL:
Hello, everyone.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.180
I'm Vivian Rosenthal, Founder
in Residence of 30 Weeks.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.650
30 Weeks is a program
aimed at design founders

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.310
with an education bent,
sort of an incubator

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.000
meets education model.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.280
It's 30 weeks long,
as the name implies.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.720
It's in New York City.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.110
And to date, it's been
fairly under the radar,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.890
as we've just launched
this September.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.440
The image behind me is a shot
of our space down at 250 Hudson.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.090
So this is led by
Google but also has

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.380
a number of incredible design
schools partnered with us,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.950
including Hyper Islands and
Cooper Union, SVA, Parsons,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.100
and Pratt.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.040
And what we're
really looking to do

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.500
is to help people with a
design background become design

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.890
founders, by bringing together
design business and technology.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.390
So it's very much about
a collaborative process.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.510
And we're really looking
to get the word out.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.740
So obviously, this is an
audience of designers.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.920
So please come find me
afterwards or find me

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.540
on Twitter, if you're
interested in learning more,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.990
because we're hoping to change
the way that education happens,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.464
by giving people a chance to
move into what we call learning

00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:03.880
through launching,
which is really

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.136
the mantra of the program.

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:08.660
JONATHAN LEE: I had
asked each panelist

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.820
to supply an image
of their program,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.529
as well as an historical
or personal image to kind

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:16.820
of kick start the conversation.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.754
So this is Vivian's.

00:04:17.754 --> 00:04:18.670
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL: Yes.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.399
So when I was asked to
give a historical image,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.930
I was very influenced
by the Bauhaus.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.914
I used to be an architect.

00:04:26.914 --> 00:04:27.830
That's what I studied.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.920
And the Bauhaus,
if you translate it

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.220
literally from
German to English,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.120
it's the school of building.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.240
And so I think today what
we're doing with 30 Weeks,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.180
as part of this
new incubator, is

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.760
thinking about a
school of building.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.700
But of course, now
what we're building

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.670
is often intangible and digital.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.310
But nonetheless, it's building.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.080
I think there's been a shift
in what building means,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.100
but it's interdisciplinary
practiced.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.690
And so this is something
that I studied in school

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.250
and really excited me, to see
all these different arts coming

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.750
together.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.420
And for the same reason,
I'm excited about where

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.375
we are collectively today.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:11.750
JONATHAN LEE:
Moving on to Scott.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.124
SCOTT DOORLEY:
I'm Scott Doorley.

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:17.230
I'm the Creative Director
of the Stanford D School.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.090
The D School is a little
bit of a misnomer.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.907
We're not a school.

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:22.740
That would be like the
School of Engineering

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.030
or the School of
Education or the Graduate

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.530
School of Business.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.870
And we teach design, but
we teach design mostly

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.770
to non-designers.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.770
So we take people who are
coming to the university

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.260
as graduate students mainly,
looking at getting a business

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.310
degree or an education degree
or an engineering degree.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.339
And then we give them a process
to approach problem solving.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:44.630
So we have a lot of people
who are starting businesses.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.070
And they're starting businesses
with the design bent.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.380
Or we have people who
are creating curriculum.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.960
And we help them create
a curriculum design bent.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.250
And for us, that means
they're human-centered.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.610
They're highly intentional.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.430
And they prototype
their way to an answer.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.520
Within that though,
we do teach a lot

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.310
of design-oriented classes.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.460
I teach few, one
with the Enrique,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.000
D Media, which is about
designing across platforms also

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.580
another one called Storytelling
Visual Communication Studio

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.650
that's about thinking
about how you communicate.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.986
This example I gave-- we've been
playing around with getting out

00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:22.610
of the classroom,
because what we found

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.800
was we give projects
to students.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.280
Everything's project-based.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.160
So a lot of the
learning is actually not

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.880
happening when we're with them.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.620
We're with them for three
to four hours a week.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.830
But there are all these
gaps where they're actually

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.210
doing a ton of learning,
and we're not there.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.550
So we thought, how can we
get in touch with them.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.340
We created this
thing called Minnow,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.160
which serves like a home
brew little web app that

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.280
allows us to send super-short
videos under a minute to closed

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.120
groups.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.950
And the way we're using
it is for students teams

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.680
to reflect on what
they're doing or to send

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.950
tips, when we know they're
about to go into something

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.440
that might be taxing for them.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.700
Like they're about to go into
user testing, and we know that.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.450
And we can send them something
to just give them a little hit.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.130
And the thing we found
when we started testing it,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.350
which was simultaneously
discouraging and exciting,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.140
was that a lot of the
students came back.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.360
We gave them, as our first
test, four one-minute videos

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.371
over a weekend when they were
going to do some prototyping.

00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:24.870
And the students came back and
said, I learned more in those

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.139
four minutes that I had
in four weeks of class,

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.180
which on the one hand,
you're like, that's great.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.510
Wow, we taught you
in four minutes.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.176
And on the other hand,
you're like, what

00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:34.450
happened in the
rest of the class.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.080
But as it as it turns out, I
think that's not totally true.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.175
I think that was the
perception that they had.

00:07:40.175 --> 00:07:41.870
They felt like they
had learned more,

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.884
just because the timing of
the content was so good.

00:07:44.884 --> 00:07:46.550
To be totally honest,
I shot the videos,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.680
and they were kind of crap.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.810
They were not great videos.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.316
But the timing was something.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.690
And so we're
looking really start

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.480
to look at when are
we giving students

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.600
content as a big question
that we're asking.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.720
And then I just
want you to absorb

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.910
this photo for one second.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.250
This is Charles Eames house.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.660
And there are a bunch of
nuns sitting on the floor,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.310
and there's a noose in
the middle of the room.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.444
And I was looking for
an image like this

00:08:16.444 --> 00:08:18.110
because I wanted to
share somebody who's

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.830
a hero of mine, who's a nun
named Carita Kent, who taught

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.310
at the College of the
Immaculate Heart in LA.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.780
She taught Art and Design there.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.960
And she was like one of
these visionary people who

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.970
brought in the community
around her, to really teach

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.034
the students that were
there, many of whom

00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:37.450
were studying to
be nuns, which is

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.126
why you have so
many nuns in here.

00:08:39.126 --> 00:08:40.250
I should explain the noose.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.140
But I'm going to hold on for
a second before I do that.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.630
But she had this way
of really bringing

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.260
in people from the community.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.770
So she had brought
in Charles Eames.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.170
She brought in Alfred Hitchcock.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.700
She brought it
Buckminster Fuller

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.630
to teach very small
groups of nuns.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.515
And it was just kind
of amazing that she

00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:00.080
was able to draw that energy in.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.200
And the second thing is, she
was the queen of the assignment,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.480
creating an assignment
that really pushes students

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.390
to explore what
they're thinking about

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.429
and how they're
doing their own work.

00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:14.470
And she used a lot of
numbers in her assignments.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.630
She would say, you have
to do 100 of these.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.470
You have to do 50 of these
and then take 20 of those

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.160
and do 20 more and then take 10
of those and do 10 more those.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.230
And it just reminded
me that there's

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.290
something about being able to
be in an educational environment

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.290
that gives you freedom
that you don't have.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.740
So the noose is--
Charles Eames set up

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.080
a noose in the middle of his
room with a stack of boxes,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.150
so that his kids could fly
into the boxes, which I thought

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.990
takes this kind of
frightening object

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.331
and makes it kind of delightful.

00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:45.830
Thanks.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:46.715
JONATHAN LEE: Thanks.

00:09:46.715 --> 00:09:47.480
ANDRE PLAUT: Cool.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.402
Hi, everyone.

00:09:48.402 --> 00:09:49.360
My name as Andre Plaut.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.060
I'm a Product Lead at
General Assembly working

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.710
on all of our
full-time programs.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.210
And the idea behind
General Assembly

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.980
is to really help folks from all
sorts of different backgrounds

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.350
enter the world and kind
of transition their career,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.656
be it anywhere from
marketing to an architect

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:08.030
into the world of
web development

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.810
or UX design or
product management.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.120
And so for last two years,
I've been really building out

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.400
our 10-week, full-time
UX Design program

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.030
with a number of amazing
designers all around the world.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.340
And this picture really
shows-- to something

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.210
that Scott was talking about--
the importance and the emphasis

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.500
that we put when we designed
our program in actual creation

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.490
and doing.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.405
And something that was
really important to us

00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:35.780
when we were
building our program

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.760
was that our students didn't
spend a whole lot of time

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.600
in the classroom, that there's
only so much so you can really

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.370
learn by listening to someone.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.060
You will never really reach
this capacity as a designer,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.991
if you don't actually
create and talk to people.

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:52.740
So we have a huge
emphasis on our students

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.510
to just get out of the
classroom, go into a park,

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.830
talk to people, watch
how they use technology,

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.510
really try to understand
what their needs

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.440
and how they just behave.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.959
And that's ultimately
how we think

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:08.250
you'll become a great designer.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.470
And again, our goal is to really
sort of spark that interest.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.450
So the greatest
compliment we've ever

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.150
gotten from one of our students
is, that through this program,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.620
they were sort of able
to find the thing that

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.420
got them excited to
wake up in the morning.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.500
And so yeah, that's the program.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.240
In terms of my
inspiration, I feel

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.330
like I went sort of totally
to a different place.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.497
But the way that I look about
building learning experiences

00:11:33.497 --> 00:11:35.080
is the way that you
should be building

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.800
any type of experience, be it
an app or a service or something

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.460
that I really draw
inspiration from and love,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.600
which is music and
Bonnaroo, which

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.740
are what these images are.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.310
So when we were actually
building this UX program

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.626
and the way that I've
tried to approach things

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.000
I've done with
the Obama campaign

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.320
and Apple is to really
think through what

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.650
are the type of experiences
that not only help

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.829
people learn something.

00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:02.370
But what are the
types of experiences

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.300
that motivate people, that
sort of elevate them to become

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.640
something different
or something better?

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.200
What kind of experience
helps people come together,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.060
sort of in a uniting purpose?

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.500
And I think those kind of
experiences are all around us.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.840
And so this is just one thing
that kind of inspires me

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.570
on a day to day basis, so not
specific to design education,

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.510
but just an incredible
experience generally.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.680
ENRIQUE ALLEN: Cool.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.217
Hey, everybody, so
excited to see you.

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:31.800
There are all these
laptops out there.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.425
Are you guys googling
stuff right now?

00:12:33.425 --> 00:12:34.420
What are you doing?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.920
Just checking that
you guys are awake.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.270
As Jonathan mentioned,
my name is Enrique Allen.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.880
I co-founded Designer
Fund with the mission

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.051
to help designers
create businesses

00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:45.550
with meaningful
impact in the world,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.960
hopefully in spaces that really
need design help from you guys,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.500
like in education, health,
energy, and environment.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.170
And one way that we
achieve our mission

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.339
is by investing in designers
who are starting new companies.

00:12:59.339 --> 00:13:01.630
Another way that we do that
is through our professional

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.370
development program, Bridge,
which you see pictured here.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.070
And Bridge really just
connects experienced designers

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.390
like yourselves
with top companies

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.440
here in the area
and our community.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.950
And really, what
we're interested in is

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.825
helping accelerate the career
of really the best designers

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:21.820
and exposing them
to what it takes

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.177
to be great individual
contributors, great managers,

00:13:26.177 --> 00:13:28.010
potentially design
directors, and maybe even

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:28.870
founders one day.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.770
So that's what we're really
interested, in terms of Bridge.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.541
And for my inspirational
historical design reference,

00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:37.290
how many of you guys
know who this guy is?

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.160
Crickets maybe-- all right,
this is a John Dewey,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.590
who was a really world-renowned
education reformer who's

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.920
quite prolific in his
writing and published

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.750
a number of books, including
"Democracy in Education,"

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.110
I believe, in 1916.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.560
And he was also a huge
proponent of hands-on learning

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.050
as well as experiential
education and learning.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.300
And one of the frameworks
that Dewey inspired

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.340
was this really, super
simple, basic feedback

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.330
loop, which is activity.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.820
So we spend most of our
time doing activity;

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.070
reflection, how we
synthesize our experience;

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.914
and theory, how we
conceptualize that

00:14:20.914 --> 00:14:22.580
into some framework
or some abstraction.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.250
So there's some basic loop of
Activity Reflection Theory.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.910
And when I started to reflect on
the designers that we work with

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.580
at Bridge, my own experience,
we spend most of our day--

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.560
let's say, at least
50%-- doing activity,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.890
working on our
products and services.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.590
Maybe we spend the other
40% with our family,

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:42.630
our personal time.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.080
So that leaves maybe 10%
time for continued education.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.480
So how should we structure
that remaining time?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.130
And one of the
ah-ha moments I had,

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.290
inspired by John Dewey
and Scott Doorley,

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.060
is I think that we
might not actually

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.350
make enough time for
reflection in our process.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.314
And arguably, we don't
need anymore theory.

00:15:03.314 --> 00:15:04.730
We already have a
ton of activity.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.270
We might be really
lacking in the reflection

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.070
part of that cycle.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.486
And so that's
something that we've

00:15:09.486 --> 00:15:13.390
been considering and
changing in our curriculum.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.016
Thanks.

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:17.550
MICHAEL ROCK: I'm Michael Rock.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.632
And I represent the rear guard
for this committee, I think.

00:15:21.632 --> 00:15:25.980
I have two images that are
actually related and informally

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.160
related and also
conceptually related.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.660
And this one is
from the Yale School

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.100
of Art, a final critique.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.960
And the second one is
one from about 1926, also

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.250
a kind of final critique.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.140
I teach simultaneously at
Yale in the School of Art

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.390
and at Columbia in the
School of Architecture.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.500
And there's this
interesting overlap

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.333
between these two
different ways of thinking

00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:48.820
about making in general.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:54.670
But I think the thing
that's common in all design

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.420
experiences,
educational experiences,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.730
is that it's a
combination of immersion

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.530
and this close looking
and that being together

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.030
and looking at
things really closely

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.620
in a very comparative way.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.170
And so I love this
image form Yale,

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.044
because there's just so
much visual material.

00:16:09.044 --> 00:16:11.740
And it's a complete
immersive environment.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.100
But if you go to the
next one, this is 1926.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.280
It's Kazimir Malevich at
the Unive Assen, which

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.280
was one of the revolutionary
schools of design

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.420
that came after the
1919 Revolution.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.560
And what I like about
this is, that again,

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.750
it's a kind of
immersive environment.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.370
It's a group of people,
both teachers and students,

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.870
looking together and
looking really closely.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.217
But I think what was really
interesting about this period--

00:16:36.217 --> 00:16:37.800
because this school
basically came out

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.560
of the Vkhutemas,
which is really

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.880
the precursor to what
the Bauhaus became,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.960
and this idea of really trying
to create a revolution in form,

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.460
as well as a
political revolution

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.390
and trying to rethink the world
new, through the aesthetic

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.630
and trying to create an
image of a new world.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.040
And what I find especially
interesting about that

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.120
is that when we Lenin
visited the school,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.760
he was getting
old at that point,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.635
and ultimately
declared the work they

00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:10.280
were doing contrarevolutionary,
because it was in inaccessible.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.960
It was elitist kind
of work, because it

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.810
was the work of a kind
of an aesthetic elite.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.589
And so while they're
trying to enact,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:20.859
in one way, aesthetic reform
or an aesthetic movement,

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.900
somehow they become
distanced from the political.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.970
And I think this
kind of connection

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.390
between the aesthetic
and the political

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.280
is really something
we grapple with still.

00:17:31.097 --> 00:17:31.930
JONATHAN LEE: Great.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.010
Well, thank you all for
sharing your programs.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.130
And I wanted to
start our discussion

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.400
to kind of ask you to share the
audience what your students,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.900
or whatever you might
call them-- actually,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.120
I'd loved actually know
what you call your students.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.360
If they're not students,
what's the actual nomenclature

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.440
you use for that?

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.430
But what is the kind of
composition and the makeup

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.560
of them, as they apply, or
they come to your program?

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.222
What are you looking for?

00:17:59.222 --> 00:18:00.430
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL: I'll start.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.810
So we specifically don't call
them students at 30 Weeks.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:05.950
We call them designers.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.470
And that was a very
conscious decision,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.429
for them to think of
themselves as not-- we

00:18:13.429 --> 00:18:15.470
felt like students was a
little bit more passive.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.390
And we want them to be
really taking an active role.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.890
So that was sort of
critical in the makeup.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.860
But yes, if you
want to just talk--

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.900
SCOTT DOORLEY: Yes.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.740
We're at a large university,
so they are called students.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.514
But we do play a
lot with language.

00:18:31.514 --> 00:18:32.930
And I think it is
really important

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.720
to put them in a posture.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.470
And our students
are actually not

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.250
Design students,
most of the time.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.870
We have, I'd say,
10% Design students.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.731
And ours are coming in from
all different directions.

00:18:45.731 --> 00:18:47.980
ANDRE PLAUT: We do call our
students students as well.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.438
And we were just talking about
this a little bit backstage,

00:18:50.438 --> 00:18:52.850
this sort of interesting thing
where all of our students

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:53.850
are adults.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.120
They're not necessarily--
they're certainly not kids.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.130
And most of them have
graduated and have Masters.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.860
And I think it's a really
fragile and vulnerable place

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.370
to be in a learning environment,
once you've already started

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.940
your career, or you're sort of
trying to perfect something.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.630
And so I certainly
don't think there's

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.820
anything negative about
the term students,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.252
but that you acknowledge
that we are all students.

00:19:17.252 --> 00:19:19.710
It's about kind of elevating
that term, I think, as opposed

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.930
to the thinking of it more
from the lunch box and desk

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.860
kind of mentality.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.500
ENRIQUE ALLEN: Yes,
likewise for us.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.030
We don't call the designers
that we work with students.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.280
I would assume many of you
maybe aren't interested

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.010
in going back to Design grad
school or something like that.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.410
So we're interested in learning
from each other as a community,

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.150
as a network and sharing those
best practices that are rarely

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.050
shared publicly, but
doing that and more

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.193
of a peer-to-peer style.

00:19:48.193 --> 00:19:50.600
MICHAEL ROCK: Yes, I
think it's similar.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.090
I taught in Holland for a while,
at the Jan Van Eycke Academie.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.837
And there, they very decidedly
excised the word student

00:19:57.837 --> 00:19:58.670
from the vocabulary.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.630
And everyone was referred to as
a participant, which I though

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.585
was an interesting
approach, but in a way,

00:20:04.585 --> 00:20:06.210
somehow breaks down
the idea that there

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.190
is something to learn.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.180
And there are people
who are teaching

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.388
and people who are receiving.

00:20:09.388 --> 00:20:13.240
And I think that
whatever that term is,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.885
we still believe at least that
there's something to impart,

00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:17.640
that there's
knowledge to impart.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.976
And that relationship between
teacher and student is intact.

00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:26.110
JONATHAN LEE: And so
what are your students

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.190
or and designers
and non-designers

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.446
in Scott's case, what are they
kind of coming to you for?

00:20:33.446 --> 00:20:34.820
Or what is it that
they're trying

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.970
to participate in and learn
from in your programs?

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.930
What are the core
issues that you're

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.782
seeing in today's context?

00:20:42.782 --> 00:20:43.740
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL: Sure.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.700
So one of the things
that we recognized

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.310
is that designers are
often seen as sort

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.980
of this work for hire person.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.360
And so with 30 Weeks, we're
really trying to break that,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.420
and not that there
isn't a role for that.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.970
Obviously, there is.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:09.160
But in our case, almost
everyone who applied up to date

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.170
had sort of been paid for
their services as a designer.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.090
And we were really trying
to implement a shift

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.540
into the role of
being a founder.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.680
And that doesn't mean you have
to start your own company.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.520
It might be sort of being
a leader within an existing

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.420
company and really
pioneering change that way.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.750
But it was really
a shift in mindset

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.110
and looking for the people
that had that grit and tenacity

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.120
and also a real desire to
make change in the world,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.190
rather than just solving
for a specific brief

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.830
and then moving on to the next
brief and so on and so forth.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.680
So we wanted people
to pick their heads up

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.840
and look at the world
around them and say,

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.815
what are the opportunities
here for change.

00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:56.041
JONATHAN LEE: Those are
all preexisting designers?

00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:58.040
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL: Yes,
in that case of 30 Weeks,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.300
people are all designers,
from product design,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.960
architecture, interactive
design, graphic design.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.060
Really, it runs the gamut.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.180
JONATHAN LEE: I'm going to
hop around a little bit,

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.820
because I'd like to stop
going across the row.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.165
This isn't a classroom,
by any means.

00:22:11.165 --> 00:22:13.415
Andre, can you speak a little
bit about your audience?

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:14.519
ANDRE PLAUT: Absolutely.

00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:16.560
I think what's interesting
is that the folks that

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.552
come into GA are really
at the very beginning

00:22:18.552 --> 00:22:19.260
of their careers.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.140
So they aren't designers
when they come in.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.390
They, again, might come
from a world of marketing

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.350
or engineering or literally
pretty much anywhere.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.360
And they're coming
into our program

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.820
to transition and their careers.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.260
So it's really to enter
the world as UX designers.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.930
And so really, the
point of the program

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.900
is to, A, sort of help them
fall in love with this industry

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.600
and the craft and give
them just enough skill.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.427
And the way we look at
it is, really, you're

00:22:48.427 --> 00:22:50.510
going to learn how to do
this throughout your life

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.635
and throughout your career.

00:22:51.635 --> 00:22:54.920
And that 10 weeks certainly
can't replace years and years

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.720
of experience, but
that it's supposed

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.640
to be this initial spark
that allows you to then go on

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.990
to a lifelong
learning experience.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.450
And places like 30
Weeks and Designer Fund

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.480
are perfect places
for our students

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.420
to go to, once they have had
those experiences of working

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.559
somewhere and developing their
skills, which is sort of cool.

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.100
They can work together
in that sense.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.180
JONATHAN LEE: Its kind of
like minimum viable skills.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.020
It's a ship.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.234
And how about at D School?

00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:22.900
SCOTT DOORLEY: Yeah,
I was going to say,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.150
there's actually--
I mention that there

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.610
are a lot of non-designers.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.520
And that's given, I think,
me a particularly interesting

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.920
vantage point on what
design education is doing.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.410
And we are trying to
give them challenges

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.226
that push their
creative thinking.

00:23:37.226 --> 00:23:39.350
And we give them these
challenges, and they go out.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.058
And they do them.

00:23:40.058 --> 00:23:42.410
And immediately, whatever
challenge they're working on,

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.736
the design education gets
sucked into that challenge.

00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:45.610
I'll give an example.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.187
So we have students
working on K-12 schools.

00:23:48.187 --> 00:23:50.520
And what we're thinking the
assignment that we're giving

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.430
them is that they're
going to go and use

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.950
design process to figure out
how to change-- I don't know--

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.760
whether it be curriculum
or the community

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.900
or the space of the school.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.130
And then what happens is,
the teachers in the school

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.580
want the design
curriculum for themselves.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.730
Or they go into a business.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.150
And they're like looking at
how do people work together.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.010
And how do we redesigned
collaboration space

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.100
at an office?

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.630
And then the people
in the business

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.500
want the design curriculum.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.250
And so I think what I'm
seeing is, at this moment

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.540
right now, design,
everybody wants it.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.470
And I think it's a
growth moment for design,

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.460
whether it be for
non-designers or people

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.790
who are trying to move
into design or people who

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.050
are long-term designers.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.900
There's just this hunger for it.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.430
And I think there's something
about the approach of design

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.080
at this moment that's really
useful, both in terms of it

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.920
working and in terms
of education that

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.680
has to do with being able to
engage the world to figure out

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.130
your problem, which is
just a useful thing when

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.437
the world feels really dynamic
versus thinking about as, I'm

00:24:54.437 --> 00:24:55.770
going to learn a bunch of stuff.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:56.750
And then I'll know something.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.770
And then I'll be able to go
out and conquer the world.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.730
I'm going to learn how
to find the knowledge I

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.490
need at any given moment.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.610
To me, that's what design
is about and then use

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.010
that knowledge to bring
something into reality.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.870
So in a sense, our
students are designers,

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.740
because they want
to use a tactic

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.190
to create something
in the world.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.490
JONATHAN LEE: So
are they designers,

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.985
or are they using
design process?

00:25:15.985 --> 00:25:18.250
SCOTT DOORLEY: I
mean, it's tricky.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.770
I go back and
forth between that.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.030
Sometimes I want to say,
they're not designers,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.900
but they do design.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.040
They're not a professional,
but they do design.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.161
And then other times, if
I call them designers,

00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:29.160
it makes them feel good.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.920
And they do better work.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.036
So I call them designers.

00:25:31.036 --> 00:25:31.910
You know what I mean?

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.990
And I think it's
valid either way.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.140
But it is different
than, say, trying

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.550
to become where your
practices is only design.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.650
I'm working with people, so that
I can serve a design function

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.184
in whatever is
happening versus--

00:25:46.184 --> 00:25:47.600
I'm going to do
what I do, and I'm

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.580
going to approach it from
a design perspective.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.180
They're definitely
different, but I

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.200
like to play with
what we call them.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.310
JONATHAN LEE: And Michael
how is that affecting

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.185
the universities?

00:25:57.185 --> 00:25:59.060
MICHAEL ROCK: Well, I
think it's interesting,

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.450
because I think that-- it's
very hard to generalize

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.230
because there are so
many multiple ways

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.690
that people decide
to go to school.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.030
But I think you could, in
the most general terms,

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.640
say that half the students
are escaping something.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.840
The other half are trying
to get into something.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.050
So half are basically
in a career,

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.160
and they're not necessarily
happy with where it is

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.160
or what they're doing.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.730
And so they use
school as a lever

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.650
to escape from that situation.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.310
And so it allows them to
reinvent themselves in a way

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.720
and rethink themselves
into some kind of new form.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.410
And I think the other
half are basically

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:34.190
trying to enhance what they have
and professionalize in a way

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.242
that they couldn't do
professionally in the industry.

00:26:38.242 --> 00:26:39.700
So some people, I
think, are really

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.562
trying to have this
life-changing experience.

00:26:42.562 --> 00:26:44.520
And then that's probably
a little bit different

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.070
when you go to a two-year
graduate program,

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.370
where you're
getting yourself out

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.750
of your life and
starting something else,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.083
rather than doing some kind
of professional development.

00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:53.050
But I do think there's
this aspect which

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.550
is to deprofessionalize.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:59.570
It's a really big desire
for a lot of students I see.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.490
JONATHAN LEE: And how would
you define where we're headed?

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.250
It sounds like you
all how educate

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.110
people on design processes
and design thinking.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.250
And if you call it a designer
or you call it something else,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.280
that's up for debate.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.580
But where we going?

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.020
And how should we
continue this growth?

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.840
Does it need this full spectrum?

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.430
Do you anticipate
everyone creating programs

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.760
that service all the different
phases of arc as a designer?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.867
Or is it that you--
where should we go next?

00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:34.450
ANDRE PLAUT: I think
there's something

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.480
that Scott said that I
completely agree with.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.110
It's that there's
a sort of moment

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.909
that we're in right
now with design, where

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:42.700
a lot more people are
becoming aware of it.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.325
And a lot more people
are understanding

00:27:44.325 --> 00:27:46.760
how we can improve
things, regardless if it's

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.340
health care or politics
or how you get a cab.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.680
And I think what's interesting
about design education is

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.330
that, first of all, everyone
in this room, you guys

00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.362
have a set of skills and methods
and practices that don't just

00:28:00.362 --> 00:28:02.570
solve the problem that you're
immediately working on.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.780
They solve almost every problem.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.310
And so I think the way that we
talk about design and the way

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.950
that we've individually
approach it

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.300
and how we mentor people
in our organization

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.200
and how we bring it
to our everyday lives

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.660
is sort of where I
think it needs to go.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.910
In terms of design education
as a more formal kind of idea,

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.660
I think it is about bringing
the process and design

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.570
thinking and these
practices to other areas

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.254
and seeing where it
can be impactful.

00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:37.110
ENRIQUE ALLEN: Yeah, I think
that the future of design

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.510
education will require a lot
more collaboration and a lot

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.660
more coordination amongst
organizations and institutions.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.330
So schools-- and 30 Weeks
is a great example of that,

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.080
partnering with a number of
universities in New York.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.880
I think we can do a lot better,
in terms of industry informing

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.560
curriculum at our
top schools here,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.890
at TCA, at Berkeley,
at Stanford, et cetera.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.570
And then once someone actually
leaves the institution,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.820
then what-- whether it's GA,
or whether it's online courses,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.320
or whether it's
continued education,

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.340
professional development
at that company.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.780
So I think it's going to take
coordination and collaboration

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.300
across multiple phases of
a designers life cycle.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.930
And I think one thing that we
really don't understand well,

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.770
at least in our research
is, what really sets apart

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.690
a top designer from
a junior designer.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.110
What really sets apart
senior versus junior?

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.220
And what are these nuances that
are missing in the curriculum?

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.220
JONATHAN LEE: Yeah, I
want to know a little more

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.760
about any of your thoughts on
what makes a great designer.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.400
And how many great
designers are your programs

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.670
shipping essentially?

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.200
Are we just making designers
that are mediocre ?

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.870
Or is this the formula for
making badass designers?

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.540
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL:
I know at 30 Weeks,

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.120
we're sort of shifting the
definition of even what

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.980
a designer is a little
bit away from aesthetics

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.390
and more towards
human-centered problem

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.510
solving and thinking
about how do you

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.940
create value in the world.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.810
And in our view, a designer
is someone, hopefully,

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.694
who has empathy and can see
a problem and the solution

00:30:17.694 --> 00:30:19.360
from many different
perspectives and can

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.890
try to help solve for
that, rather than just look

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.650
at things through
an aesthetic lens,

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.960
not that that's not important.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.310
So we're taking a bit
more of a holistic view

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.680
of what a designer
is or what we'd

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.620
like a designer to include.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:39.050
JONATHAN LEE: I guess I'm trying
to get at-- your program's

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.200
focuses are on various aspects.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.580
But I'm wondering.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.430
Are we neglecting
the other skills?

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.380
Do we think that
our designers are

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.270
being less good at color theory?

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.850
And they're kind of sucking
at typography even more.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:57.565
And what should a
modern designer be?

00:30:57.565 --> 00:30:59.315
MICHAEL ROCK: Well
maybe it is that design

00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:01.610
has become such
complex practice,

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.040
that you can't
really say there's

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.320
one core skill you have to have.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.250
So in a way, all
of these programs

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.804
represent the fact
that you need lots

00:31:08.804 --> 00:31:10.470
of different kinds
of education for lots

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.010
of different kinds of things.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.759
And one of the things
I always think about

00:31:13.759 --> 00:31:16.250
is that the people in
class now are basically

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.510
finishing their career in 2060.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.180
So what do they need in 2060?

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.280
We have no idea yet.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.814
So we presume
they're going to need

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:23.980
new skills as they go along.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.837
But on the other hand,
you like to believe

00:31:25.837 --> 00:31:28.420
that there's certain things you
learn in school that you carry

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.767
with you your whole life,
that are part of you

00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:32.100
and that you keep going back to.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.308
There's a well there that
you can keep going back to,

00:31:34.308 --> 00:31:35.770
and it doesn't run dry.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.260
So I think that there has
to be some combination

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.800
of some core things
and some things

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.190
which get added
on in the future.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.450
And I think that's what all
these programs are doing.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.825
I think they're kind of creating
these prosthetic devices

00:31:46.825 --> 00:31:48.160
to help us through or something.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.317
It's kind of like design your
own Design education approach.

00:31:52.317 --> 00:31:54.900
SCOTT DOORLEY: And I also think
what Michael is getting to is,

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.360
there are different
facets of it.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.880
I do you think its
expanding so much

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.222
that the definition of a
designer is totally changing.

00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:04.180
And people who are calling
themselves designers

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.140
now may not have felt
comfortable calling themselves

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.620
designers 20 years ago.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.780
And that's great, because it
means that more people are

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.720
trying to be responding
to human needs.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.700
And it means that
more people care

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.010
about how something
communicates through form.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.050
It means that more people
are being experimental

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.341
in the way they develop things.

00:32:26.341 --> 00:32:27.460
So it's great.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.540
It's killer.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.690
And then, at the same
time, I think design

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.890
as a practice, a
professional practice,

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.100
is getting more
and more nuanced.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.650
It's just deepening and
deepening and deepening.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.530
And it really needs to.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.220
And there need to be
people who are going down,

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.900
down, down to the depths.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.200
But they don't necessarily
have to be the same people.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.170
And we're going to call
them the same thing.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.420
We're going to call them a
designer maybe for a while.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.500
But maybe they're
really different things,

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.510
and that's OK too.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.030
But I think the
word kind of brings

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.100
with it-- in fact,
as I was totally

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.580
stalking Michael's
site this morning.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.380
And he's got these three-word
design manifestos on there

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.820
that are just amazing.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.030
They're great.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.590
I don't know anything
about the project.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.730
But they're really cool because
they're all really different.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.400
And yet, they're all design.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.390
They're all design.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.360
You read them, and you're like,
yeah, that's what design is.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.920
But none of them are the same.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.394
They're fundamentally different,
and I think that's OK.

00:33:25.394 --> 00:33:26.810
JONATHAN LEE: And
I think maybe it

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.268
relates to what Enrique was
saying too about collaboration.

00:33:29.268 --> 00:33:31.550
Because I think that
probably increasingly

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.820
we're going to have to
cobble together these skills

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.910
to do things, where
everyone doesn't have

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.600
to be great colorists,
for instance.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.917
But you need to know a great
colorist at some point,

00:33:42.917 --> 00:33:44.500
to solve something
or to do something.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.490
So the problems are probably
big enough and complex enough,

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.367
to where collaborative teams
of lots of different skills

00:33:51.367 --> 00:33:51.950
come together.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.908
And that's where, again,
you can educate people

00:33:53.908 --> 00:33:55.484
in lots of different ways.

00:33:55.484 --> 00:33:56.900
ENRIQUE ALLEN: We
definitely think

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.970
about how we can just
learn from the best

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.930
people in the business, so
bring together awesome designers

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.240
at Dropbox, at Pinterest,
at various companies,

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.409
to break down our
creative process,

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.040
look at the tools they're using,
the iteration cycles, what

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.107
date we're getting back.

00:34:12.107 --> 00:34:14.190
So I think the more that
we share that information

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.179
as a community, we
can raise the bar

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.889
and continue to
keep that bar high.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:22.600
So we think a lot about, again,
that peer to peer and role

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.530
models that we can
learn from each other.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.363
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL: I
think just the one thing

00:34:26.363 --> 00:34:28.219
I'd add-- in terms
of collaboration,

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.686
if we look at the
tech start-up scene,

00:34:30.686 --> 00:34:34.130
the typical founders tend
to be engineers or someone

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.780
with an MBA or
business background.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.980
And so one of the other things
we're looking at 30 Weeks

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.909
is how do we elevate designers
to think of themselves

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:48.810
as that triumvirate of they're
the third and missing link.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.620
And if you bring together
those three types of people,

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.949
you have a really strong base.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.690
And so that was something
that we're really

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.740
keen onto is collaboration
and making sure designers

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.165
are part of that practice.

00:35:06.165 --> 00:35:08.880
ANDRE PLAUT: It's
such a powerful--

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.580
it's crazy to think that there
are so many things in the world

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.710
that we use and are so integral
to our lives that haven't been

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.190
designed or have been
designed by default.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.230
And yeah, the work of 30
Weeks and just so much

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.052
of what we're all doing
is about putting designers

00:35:25.052 --> 00:35:27.010
into that conversation
and at least introducing

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.080
more people who can
ask the right questions

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.210
and go through
the right process,

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.019
regardless of where they are.

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:33.810
JONATHAN LEE: Cool.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.540
Well, I think I'm
going to wrap it up.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.270
I'd like each of
you to tell me where

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.104
you hope your program
will be in the future.

00:35:41.104 --> 00:35:42.478
I know that,
Michael, you brought

00:35:42.478 --> 00:35:44.280
that it's a hard
thing to speculate on.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.514
But where do you aspire toward?

00:35:48.514 --> 00:35:50.180
SCOTT DOORLEY: I can
throw it out there.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.580
I kind of began with
the thing talking sort

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.940
of leaking out of the
classroom a little bit.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.240
And I think we did
a project recently

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.460
called Stanford
2025, which is funded

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.040
by the School of Engineering,
to look at what's the on campus

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.090
experience for students
in the year 2025,

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.240
in the age of online education.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.290
This is Google.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.400
YouTube is probably one
of the best learning

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.340
platforms in the
world, for real.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.390
And that's happening.

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:19.470
And that's just one.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.950
That's just one example.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:25.510
So how do we let people come
into a safe place, where

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:29.210
they can misunderstand things
and explore, but then give them

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.600
something when they get beyond
it that keeps them connected

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.700
and keeps what Enrique
was talking about,

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.080
keeps them reflecting
on what they're doing

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.930
and not just getting
into the grind

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.240
and delivering,
delivering, delivering.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.550
But what did I just do?

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.710
How did I deliver that so
well and that not so well?

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.330
And that ability
to reflect and stay

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.760
connected to a learning
community, whose agenda is

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.000
learning and expanding
and growing, I think

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.570
would be something
I'd like to see.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.320
ANDRE PLAUT: Yeah.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:01.377
I think, for our program at GA,
it's about a couple of things.

00:37:01.377 --> 00:37:02.960
The first, I would
say, is just trying

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.320
to open up access to
more and more people.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.337
And this is something
we're consciously

00:37:07.337 --> 00:37:08.170
always trying to do.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:09.794
It's how do we make
it more accessible,

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:11.320
especially to
folks that are just

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.514
completely underrepresented
in this field?

00:37:13.514 --> 00:37:15.680
So we have this thing called
Opportunity Fund, where

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.400
we essentially just massively
reduce the cost of the program.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.530
And that's a huge goal for us.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.880
And the other one, because
we're so at the bottom of that

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.012
funnel in terms of-- or rather
at the top of the funnel, where

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:30.470
we're getting a lot of folks
who haven't heard about design

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:34.360
and who might be interested
in becoming a designer, kind

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.270
of evangelizing the
field as a whole in

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.980
and going out to
people who maybe

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.510
are really into product and
maybe who have opinions on it.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.122
But they don't understand what
it took to create something.

00:37:44.122 --> 00:37:45.580
Or they just have
no idea how to go

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.330
about making something
of their own, so really

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.500
evangelizing design as an
industry and as a practice

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:56.862
and as a mindset and
helping people come into it.

00:37:56.862 --> 00:38:00.589
ENRIQUE ALLEN: I think
it's pretty simple for us.

00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:01.880
Fast forward 10 years from now.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.010
If we look back,
have we played a role

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.120
in helping start great
companies, like Airbnb,

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.295
et cetera?

00:38:08.295 --> 00:38:09.670
If we look back
all the designers

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.530
that have participated
in Bridge are they

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.600
amazing individual contributors,
managers, directors,

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.350
even founders?

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.180
And then I think
the bonus for us

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.180
is if we can look back and say
that we've contributed to some

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.770
of this fundamental
infrastructure

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.570
that I think is needed
for designers to continue

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.860
to succeed to through tech.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.360
MICHAEL ROCK: I
think [INAUDIBLE] we

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.860
have this interesting
condition where only about 30%

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.960
of people who study
architecture practice it.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.100
And so I would
say, that in a way,

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.070
I would hope that we'd
even get to a smaller

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.528
percentage of that,
because I think

00:38:40.528 --> 00:38:42.610
that the study of
architecture as a kind

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.800
of intellectual activity is an
incredible foundation for doing

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.720
lots of different
kinds of things.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.860
And making buildings
or making cities

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.780
is only one sliver
of those things.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.330
And I think that
increasingly, we

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.340
see the school as a school
of architectural thinking

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.140
and a way of thinking
about the diagram

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.950
or thinking about design, that
has multiple applications.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.530
And I think that
in the future maybe

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.502
you have 10% who are
actually building buildings.

00:39:08.502 --> 00:39:09.460
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL: Yeah.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.760
And then just to sort
of follow on that.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.530
For us, it's sort of taking that
kind of thinking and curiosity

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.890
and passion and
then bringing that

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:23.210
into creating a
product or a business

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:27.020
or service and sort
of fueling that.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.640
And so we would obviously hope
that some of the designers

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.396
go on to start
companies or become

00:39:32.396 --> 00:39:33.770
great leaders at
other companies.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:38.760
And we're also looking to
scale the program, either

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.380
with other geographies
or larger class

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.184
sizes, so a lot
of the same goals.

00:39:45.184 --> 00:39:46.600
JONATHAN LEE: Well,
thank you guys

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.460
for sharing some your
thoughts on where

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.600
modern design is,
design education.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.330
And I think we've burned
through a lot of our Q&amp;A time,

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:58.080
so I'm going to
release us at that.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.530
So thank you guys very much.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.080
[APPLAUSE]
