00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.520
Before we get into
the meat of algebra,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.728
I wanted to give you a quote
from one of the greatest

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:08.029
minds in human history, Galileo
Galilei, because I think

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.240
this quote encapsulates
the true point of algebra

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.960
and really mathematics
in general.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.230
He said, "Philosophy is written
in that great book which ever

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.610
lies before our eyes--
I mean the universe--

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.850
but we cannot understand
it if we do not first learn

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.320
the language and grasp the
symbols in which is written.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.440
This book is written in
the mathematical language,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.580
without which one wanders in
vain through a dark labyrinth."

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.030
So very dramatic, but very deep.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.830
And this really is the
point of mathematics.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.639
And what we'll see as we start
getting deeper and deeper

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:46.180
into algebra is that we're going
to start abstracting things,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.700
and we're going to start
getting to core ideas that

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.640
start explaining really how
the universe is structured.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.500
Sure, these ideas can be
applied to things like economics

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.850
and finance and
physics and chemistry.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.080
But at their core,
they're the same idea,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.890
and so they're even more
fundamental, more pure,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.800
than any one of
those applications.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.190
And to see what I mean by
getting down to the root idea,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.770
let's go with a-- I guess we
started with the very grand,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.410
the philosophy of
the universe is

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.076
written in mathematics--
but let's start

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:17.409
with a very concrete,
simple idea.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.950
But we'll keep
abstracting, and we'll

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.080
see how the same idea
connects across many domains

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.330
in our universe.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.370
So let's just say
we're at the store,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.800
and we're going
to buy something.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.370
And there is a sale.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.800
The sale says that it
is 30% percent off,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.080
and I'm interested.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.802
I don't shop at
too fancy a store.

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:39.760
So let's say I'm interested
in a pair of pants.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.150
And the pair of pants before
the sale even is about $20.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.800
And that is about how
much I spend on my pants.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.360
So I'm interested in
a $20 pair of pants.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.770
But it's even better, there's
a 30% off sale on these pants.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.480
Well, how would I
think about how much

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.656
I'm going to get
off of that $20?

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:58.780
And this isn't algebra yet.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.071
This is something that you've
probably had exposure to.

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:04.590
You would multiply
the 30% times the $20.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.919
So you would say your
discount is equal

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.100
to-- you could write
it as 30% times $20.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.147
I'll do the $20 in purple.

00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:18.230
Or you could write it, if
you wanted to write this

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.900
as a decimal, you could
write this as 0.30 times $20.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.060
And if you were to do the
math, you would get $6.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.640
So nothing new over there.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.690
But what if I want to
generalize it a little bit?

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.032
That's the discount on this
particular pair of pants.

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.240
But what if I wanted to know
the discount on anything

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.310
in the store?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.880
Well, then I could
say, well, let

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.020
x be the price-- let me do
this in a different color.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.740
So I'm just going
to make a symbol.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.930
Let x be the price
of the product

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.520
I want to buy, price,
the non-discount price

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.052
of the product in the store.

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:02.510
So now, all of a
sudden, we can say

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:11.305
that our discount is
equal to 30% times x.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.306
Or if we wanted to
write it as a decimal,

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:18.930
if we wanted to write
30% as a decimal,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.190
we could write 0.30 times x.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.590
Now, this is interesting.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.180
Now you give me the price
of any product in the store,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.320
and I can substitute
it in for x.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.390
And then I can essentially
multiply 0.3 times that,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.620
and I would get the discount.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.530
So now we're starting
to, very slowly,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.740
we're starting to get into
the abstraction of algebra.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.560
And we'll see that these will
get much more nuanced and deep

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.470
and, frankly, more
beautiful as we

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.310
start studying more and more
kind of algebraic ideas.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.540
But we aren't done here.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.480
We can abstract this even more.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.500
Over here, we've said
we've generalized

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.570
this for any product.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.430
We're not just saying
for this $20 product.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.950
If there's a $10 product, we
can put that $10 product in here

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.140
for x.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.280
And then we would
say 0.30 times 10,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.610
and the discount would be $3.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.940
It might be $100 product, then
the discount would be $30.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.630
But let's generalize even more.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.290
Let's say, well, what is
the discount for any given

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.430
sale when the sale is
a certain percentage?

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.320
So now we can say
that the discount--

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.170
let me define a variable.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.320
So let's let m equal-- or I'll
say p just so it makes sense.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.800
p is equal to the
percentage off.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.590
Now what can we do?

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.040
Well, now we can say
that the discount

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.610
is equal to the percentage off.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.170
In these other examples,
we were picking 30%.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.580
But we can say now it's p.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.250
It's the percentage off.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.630
It's p.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.870
That's the percentage off
times the product in question,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.895
times the price, the
non-discount price

00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:04.020
of the product in question.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.330
Well, that was x.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.437
The discount is
equal to p times x.

00:05:08.437 --> 00:05:09.770
Now, this is really interesting.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.350
Now we have a general
way of calculating

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.420
a discount for any given
percentage off and any given

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.880
product x.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.720
And we didn't have to use
these words and these letters.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.295
We could have said let
y equal the discount.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.989
Then we could have written
the same underlying idea.

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:33.530
Instead of writing
discount, we could

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.810
have written y is equal to
the percentage off p times

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.801
the non-discount price
of the product, times x.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.300
And you could have defined these
letters any way you wanted.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.980
Instead of writing
y there, you could

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.260
have written a
Greek letter, or you

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.530
could have written
any symbol there.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.030
As long as you can
keep track of it,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.847
that symbol represents the
actual dollar discount.

00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:58.430
But now things get
really interesting.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.330
Because we can use this type
of a relationship, which

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.550
is an equation--
you're equating y

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.632
to this right over here, that's
why we call it an equation--

00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:09.590
this can be used for
things that are completely

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.610
unrelated to the price,
the discount price,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.330
at the store over here.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.050
So in physics,
you'll see that force

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.180
is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.590
The letters are different,
but these are fundamentally

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.130
the same idea.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:36.360
We could've let y is equal to
force, and mass is equal to p.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.580
So let me write p
is equal to mass.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.850
And this wouldn't be an
intuitive way to define it,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.620
but I want to show
you that this is

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.680
the same idea, the
same relationship,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.060
but it's being applied to two
completely different things.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.105
And we could say x is
equal to acceleration.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.710
Well, then the famous force
is equal to mass times

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.210
acceleration can be rewritten.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.380
And it's really
the same exact idea

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.310
as y, which we've
defined as force,

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.890
can be equal to
mass, which we're

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.620
going to use the
symbol p, which is

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.930
equal to p times acceleration.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.690
And we're just going to happen
to use the letter x here,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.840
times x.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.560
Well, this is the
exact same equation.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.995
This is the exact same equation.

00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:23.290
And we could see that we
can take this equation,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.650
and it can apply to
things in economics,

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.700
or it can apply to
things in finance,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.890
or it can apply to things in
computer science, or logic,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.410
or electrical engineering,
or anything, accounting.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.900
There's an infinite
number of applications

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.150
of this one equation.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.000
And what's neat
about mathematics

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.890
and what's neat about
algebra in particular

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.240
is we can focus on
this abstraction.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.480
We can focus on
the abstract here,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.920
and we can manipulate
the abstract here.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.160
And what we discover
from these ideas,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.090
from these
manipulations, can then

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.630
go and be reapplied to all
of these other applications,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.720
to all of them.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.560
And even neater, it's
kind of telling us

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.540
the true structure
of the universe

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.420
if you were to strip away all
of these human definitions

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.470
and all of these
human applications.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.730
So for example, we could say,
look, if y is equal to p times

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.860
x-- so literally, if someone
said, hey, this is y,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.250
and someone says, on the
other hand, I have p times x,

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.333
I could say, well, you
have the same thing in both

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.320
of your hands.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.460
And if you were to divide
one of them by a number,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.420
and if you wanted them
to still be equal,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.640
you would divide the
other one by that number.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.770
So for example, we know that
y is equal to p times x.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.200
Well, what if you wanted
to have them both be equal?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.789
And you say, well,
what is y divided

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.549
by x going to be equal to?

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.159
Well, y was equal to p
times x, so y divided

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.870
by x is going to be
the same thing as p

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.370
times x divided by x.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.790
But now this is interesting.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.290
Because p times x
divided by x-- well,

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.155
if you multiply by something and
then divide by that something,

00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:57.280
it's just you're going to
get your original number.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.710
If you multiply by
5 and divide by 5,

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.430
you're just going to start with
p or whatever this number is.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.140
So those would cancel out.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.750
But we were able to manipulate
the abstraction here and get y

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.060
over x is equal to p-- and
let me make that x green.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.890
And now this has implications
for every one of these ideas.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.090
One is telling us
a fundamental truth

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.010
about the universe,
almost devoid

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.470
of any of these applications.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.784
But now we can go and take
them back to any place

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:29.450
that we applied.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.910
And the really
interesting thing is

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.909
we're going to find there
are an infinite number

00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:34.950
of applications,
and we don't even

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.230
know, frankly, most of them.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.930
We're going to discover new ones
for them in a thousand years.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.710
And so hopefully this
gives you a sense

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.450
for why Galileo said
what he said about really

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.870
mathematics is really the
language with which we can

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.620
understand the philosophy
of the universe.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.590
And that's why people tell us
that if a completely alien life

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.370
form were to ever
contact humans,

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.150
mathematics would probably
be our first common ground,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.910
the place that we can start
to form a basis that we

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.620
can start to communicate from.
