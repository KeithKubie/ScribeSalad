00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.542
- [Voiceover] An emulsion
is a uniform mixture

00:00:02.542 --> 00:00:05.384
of oily substances and watery substances

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:07.427
which usually don't mix.

00:00:07.427 --> 00:00:10.304
To take the most common
example of salad dressing,

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:14.044
you'll know that olive
oil and vinegar don't mix,

00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:15.756
unless you add the egg to it.

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:16.737
Then you can froth it up

00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:19.044
and make a uniform mixture of the two.

00:00:19.044 --> 00:00:22.224
Well in paint, emulsions
work the same way.

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:25.389
In fact, one of the same
emulsifiers is used,

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:27.104
and that is egg yolk.

00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:30.124
de Kooning, among others,
would add egg to his oil paint,

00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:33.244
which is typically compatible
with solvent, like turpentine,

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:35.209
but after adding egg yolk,

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:36.939
it was compatible with water as well.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:39.204
By adding water, he could
then froth up the paint

00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:41.204
to get a very interesting texture,

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:43.304
as well as a matte quality of that paint.
