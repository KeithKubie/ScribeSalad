00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
[Enrico Giusti, Curator, Garden of Archimedes] Eratosthenes was the first to measure the diameter of the earth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
He used astronomical techniques

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to perform this task.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The idea was that, in Summer Solstice,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the sun was vertical on Syene,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but it's more angled in Alexandria.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And Eratosthenes measured the distance between Syene and Alexandria,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and, from this and from the measure of the angles,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
was able to deduce the angle

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
between the two cities

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and, therefore, the radius of the earth.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The sun is vertical

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
on the Summer Solstice,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because Syene is on the Tropic,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so you have no shadow.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Actually, Eratosthenes noticed that, from the bottom of a pit,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you could see the sun exactly

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
vertical on your head.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So, for this calculation,

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Eratosthenes used only a little trigonometry, and this was all.
