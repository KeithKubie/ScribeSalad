00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.090
I think the key to improv is always listening.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.090
It’s embracing.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.090
It’s positivity.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.790
It’s hearing things and not shutting them
down.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.030
It’s trying to find ways to make them work.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.930
And in the business world I would imagine
that’s very invaluable, the idea that it’s

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.660
very frustrating just to be told no all the
time.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.560
Improv really revolves around the idea of
like whatever you come at me with I’m going

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.560
to say yes to it.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.560
That’s our reality.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.560
Let’s get to work.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.560
Let’s start there.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.610
So just the idea of saying yes to each other
and not shutting down ideas, seeing if there’s

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.100
way to make ideas workable, making that your
default setting of like I really want to respect

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
what you’re saying.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.510
See if there’s a way to take it somewhere
else versus here’s all the things that are

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.510
wrong with it.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.440
I think it’s just a very positive mentality.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.429
So I think a lot of people that come across
it get very addicted to it because it does

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.309
feel different, especially the New Yorker.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.760
We’re just used to a world where everybody’s
kind of grumpy all the time and moving fast.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.769
They don’t want to deal with each other.

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.559
The idea of showing any emotion in public,
not good.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.500
The idea of slowing down to deal with someone
else’s ideas and emotions, not good.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.609
Like we’re New Yorkers.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.670
We want to get where we’re going.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.530
So I think improv really looks at a side of
life that’s like well what if we let all

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.970
that go for a little while and just really
work on sort of positively embracing each

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.530
other’s ideas and really listening hard
to what other people have to say.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.920
So it’s a pretty beautiful thing when it’s
going right.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.250
Very often what you’ll see happen in improv
class is when people get nervous about how

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.590
it’s going is they’ll start saying hey
when dad gets home he’s going to be really

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.719
mad.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.009
Or they’ll say like hey, when we get to
Reno stuff’s really going to hit the fan.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.899
And they start saying like hey this thing
that’s going to happen or this thing like

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.719
hey, remember when you did that thing back
then?

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.159
I’m really made about it.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.369
I think one of the things about listening
is that it’s always at its most powerful

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.030
when it’s present, when it’s right here,
when it’s right now.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.970
And that’s a lesson about improv that I
think just made me a much more social person.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.030
Like it just made me like when I would go
have pitch meetings I was just able to have

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.100
it better even in my personal life.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.829
I got – when I started really thinking hard
about these improv lessons not to get weird

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.330
but like my dating like just got so much better
because the thing I always stress that I think

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.170
applies to just any conversation I always
ask people to answer these three questions

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.240
when they’re improvising.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.650
Why these people?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.050
Why right here?

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.050
Why right now?

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.120
I always just drill that.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120
Why these people?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120
Why right here?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120
Why right now?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.750
Meaning if you’re in a scene and there’s
two people and you’re talking about people

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.710
who aren’t here like they’re not here.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.990
They probably aren’t the most interesting
thing for an audience to hear about.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.960
If you’re talking about a different location
than the one the scene is taking place in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.941
then why isn’t the scene unfolding there?

00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:43.941
It sounds more interesting.

00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:45.400
Why are you teasing an audience?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.520
So and another thing to people will often
go like hey, you’ll never believe what’s

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520
inside this briefcase.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.190
And it’s like well that’s invisible.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.900
Let’s just talk to each other – us, things
we can find common ground whether that’s

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.000
positive things, disagreements we might actually
have.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.320
Why are these people in this location at this
time?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.250
Why is this the scene we’re choosing to
show the audience.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.480
So the more we can just make things present
between the people right there, the less the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.900
audience has to suspend their disbelief and
imagine the better the listening is going

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.290
to be and the harder it’s going to hit.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.580
And what we find when that happens in improv
is you’re simple choices can actually get

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.060
huge reactions because if you and I were doing
a scene and I came at you and started the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.440
scene by saying you know what?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.570
Like everything that happened in Canada we
can never talk about it again.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.590
That sounds like it has really high stakes.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.950
But now the audience has to figure out well
what happened in Canada and why are we all

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.950
scared of it.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.610
Whereas if I just looked at you and said hey,
I’m so scared and I need you to help me

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.610
through it.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.300
That sounds like a more vague thing with less
comedic potential but an audience will go

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.300
they’re scared and you have to help each
other.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.300
Why?

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.300
Why are they scared?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.350
They’re scared right now and they can help
each other.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.350
Great.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.980
And it’s a human connection that we can
latch on to.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.230
So being present in the moment with each other,
nothing else you’re going to work out.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.810
It’s going to make your improv scene so
much better.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.140
I feel it makes a lot of conversations better
too.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.470
I’m a really big fan mainly of the phrase
slow is fast.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.489
Slow is fast.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.020
And what I mean by that is like especially
in the context I can speak to it in the context

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.150
of people who go on stage which is like we
forget that when we’re on stage and we’re

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.819
improvising we’re bouncing ideas back and
forth.

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.500
An audience it’s really hard for them to
keep up and they don’t really know why we’re

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.530
making the choices we’re making because
we’re trained in this and we have classes

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.530
in this.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.240
So we can go so – to them it looks like
it’s moving a million miles an hour.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.960
Like most people when they see an improv show
if they like it they remember that first one

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.539
as being like the best show they ever saw.

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.419
And it probably was and it’s probably just
that these people knew what they were doing

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.560
so much.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.550
So one of the things I always like to stress
about slowing down, slowing down, slowing

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.689
down is this idea it’s actually something
that I learned from my wife who uses this

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.810
phrase because she is an aerialist.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.909
She was an aerialist for many years.

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.520
She was a dancer who would do all this work
with harnesses and rigging and flying around

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520
from the ceiling.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.780
And she told me that phrase and it stuck in
my head because she always said like if you

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.139
have a problem with your harness you want
to get it fixed fast so you can go back to

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.139
the act.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.919
You want to get back in there.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.150
But remember to the people watching like no
matter how long it takes, no matter how slow

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.129
you move you’re still flying around in the
sky.

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.930
And I think for improv that really applies
well.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.520
No matter how – we can really take a breath.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.610
The audience is going to be blown away if
we do our jobs right.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.400
We don’t need to move fast to impress them.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.740
Like the desire is just joke, joke, joke,
laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh and you

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.740
can smother it.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.889
That’s another think I often say about it
too is like we have to remember when we’re

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.650
improvising like it’s sort of like building
a fire.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.970
Like you have to start with the kindling.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.100
You have to start with just a spark.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.639
You can’t just throw the big logs on.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.060
If you can just try to pile anything on it’s
not going to go anywhere.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.900
The audience is going to smell a rat and you’re
not going to be with it.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.050
So for me I think the advice I can give anyone
is just remember someone who is a professional

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.030
doing what they do at any speed is probably
going to blow away a novice.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.509
They’re probably going to have total control.

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.050
And when we rush we actually can give that
away.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.139
And when we consciously take a breath and
slow down it demonstrates a confidence and

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.340
mastery of our craft which I know is a very
pretentious thing to say but that’s what

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.970
I used to say to people when I taught them
in their improv acting classes which can be

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.030
kind of pretentious.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.979
So that’s the main thing is remember what
we do is impressive.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.020
We don’t need to speed through it because
they’re going to be blown away as long as

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.770
we do it with integrity.
