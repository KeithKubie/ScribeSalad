00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.040
In storyboard,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.250
Apple refers to a transition between
view controllers as a segue.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.710
These segues are depicted using this

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.370
gray arrow that's interrupted
by this circular icon.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.530
You can see a lot of segues and
storyboard for

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.270
this make your own adventure app.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.610
Which you'll see a lot more of if
you stick around for lesson 5.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.310
Here on the roll the dice method of our
role view controller dot swift file,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.660
we saw how to present view
controller's programatically.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.580
Now we're going to move onto a second
way of presenting view controllers,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.390
by combining code with
a storyboard Segway.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.480
Now, I don't want any tears, but

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.420
first we have to delete all of the code
code in our roll the dice method.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.350
Back in storyboard we're going
to open up our pop up menu for

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.810
the role view controller.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.010
And under triggered segues we're going
to drag this manual segue to the dice

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.380
view controller.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.140
Here we have a few options for
the segue.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.920
I'm going to choose modal here.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.550
But we'll talk more about the push and

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.180
custom options when we get
into the navigation lesson.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.770
Next we need to set the storyboard
identifier for our segue.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.710
So let's close this outline view and
open up the utilities pane and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.540
then if we click on the segue we can
see in the attributes of inspector

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.340
where we can set
the storyboard identifier.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.940
So we'll call it roll dice.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.180
Now we have our segue from storyboard.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.500
But we need to write
the code that calls it.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
We want the segue to happen
when the dice is rolled.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.054
So we go into the rollTheDice method
in our RollViewController.swift file.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:31.270
Here we're going to invoke the method
performSegueWithIdentifier.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.360
And our identifier,
of course, is rollDice, and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.450
our sender is self okay let's run it and
see what happens when we roll the dice.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.440
You can see that a new view is
appearing but other was no dice.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.690
Why would that be?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.210
Well we never set their values.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.240
And in fact our first view controller
never even had a reference to the dice

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.190
view controller.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.740
Let alone the dice.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.510
So how are we going to
set those dice values.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.090
Let's leave that question open for
now and posture review the steps for

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.080
creating the segway.
