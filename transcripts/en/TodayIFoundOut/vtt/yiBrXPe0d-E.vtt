00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:25.980
There actually are B batteries, but they aren’t
something you’ll usually see stocked at

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.250
most stores any longer.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.920
Since the invention of the battery, there
have been a pretty amazingly diverse number

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.940
of battery types used with different sizes/shapes/voltages/storage
capacities/etc., and also named a variety

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.940
of things.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.380
This gave rise to the need for an industry
wide standard, particularly as the lack of

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.430
an international or even national standard
during WWI was problematic for the military.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.079
As such, after WWI, the War Industries Board
and several other government agencies got

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.040
together to try to come up with standard specifications
for batteries.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.520
A few years later, in 1928, the American Standards
Association, the predecessor to the American

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.979
National Standards Institute (ANSI), officially
adopted this proposal, introducing a list

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.340
of battery cell sizes and their corresponding
label.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.400
For these labels, they used the suggested
convention that A would be the smallest; as

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.280
you went up in the letters, the batteries
would get larger in size.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.899
There was also a “No. 6” battery that
was the largest.

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.670
This was just adopted as it had previously
been one of the most popular battery cell

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.329
sizes used (a 6 inch battery), so it was grandfathered
in, though now given more strict guidelines

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.349
to its exact specifications.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:37.659
Others came along later, such as the AAA size,
which wasn’t adopted into the standard until

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.009
1959.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.939
Since then, the ANSI standard for batteries
has been revised numerous times as battery

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.429
technology has evolved.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.649
Why it appears there is no B (or A, F, etc.)
anymore is simply because those particular

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.239
battery sizes never really caught on commercially,
at least on the consumer end of things.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:59.719
The ones that were most popular just ended
up being the AA, AAA, C, and D. Now-a-days,

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.859
because those are the most commonly available
to consumers, most manufactures continue to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.849
use those battery types over the many other
sizes that are available to power their devices.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.000
However, B batteries are still made and sold
and pack a decent punch for their size, 21.5

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.879
mm x 60 mm (.8464 in.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.400
by 2.36 in.), producing 1.5 volts and 8350
mAh for the alkaline variety.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.900
(For reference, standard alkaline AA’s ring
in at 1.5 volts and 2700 mAh).

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.840
‘A’ batteries are also still in production,
last most commonly used in early-model laptop

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840
battery packs.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.180
F batteries, on the other hand, are still
commonly used within something you can find

00:02:38.180 --> 00:04:06.930
at your local supermarket- rectangular 6 volt
batteries.
