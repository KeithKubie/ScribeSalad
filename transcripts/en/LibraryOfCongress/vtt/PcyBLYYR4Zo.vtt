00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.490
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.510
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm Carla
Hayden, Librarian of Congress.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.150
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.550
And this has been my first national
book festival as the Librarian

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.680
of Congress and what
a day it has been.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.600 position:56%
I have learned so much about the
outstanding writers who participated

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.560
in this event and I
will never forget all

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.990
of the book lovers I have seen
from all ages, all backgrounds,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.820
and I just came back from the
poetry slam and I have to tell you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.890
if you want to see raw
talent and emotion,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.820
next year you have to be there.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.640
It was wonderful.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.940
And I'm especially pleased to
be able to present to you one

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.950
of the greatest authors that I've
met because he is the Library

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.530
of Congress' National Ambassador

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.510
for Young People's
Literature, Gene Luen Yang.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.210
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.780
And I'm going to congratulate
him once again

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.510
for being named a MacArthur Genius.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.310
[ Applause ]

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.810
Gene is the fifth National
Ambassador

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.470
for Young People's Literature

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.040
and the first graphic artist
to hold this position.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.300
And before we get to his program,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.900
I just want to make a
special announcement.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.690
Mark your calendars
for September 2, 2017.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.400
That will be the date of
the next book festival,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.290
right here at the Washington
Convention Center.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.010
So, I hope you can attend.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.500
Back to Gene and enjoy and
thank you all for being here.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All right.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.580
Hi. How do you follow that?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.470
How do you follow a historic
new leader of this institution

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.790
between her and a brand new genius?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.790
It's just, you know,
we'll do what we can.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.420
But, my name is Michael
Cavna, a columnist cartoonist

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.720
with the Washington Post.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.320 position:56%
I do the Comic Riffs blog and I also
did the syndicated strip Warp you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.560
can find at gocomics.com.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.080
I've spent a lifetime in comics
and a lifetime as an art senator

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.300
and believe that graphic novels
are one of the most important

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.030
and crucial forms of communication

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.620
for young readers,
for reluctant readers.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.270
I come from a tribe of educators.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.120
We have an educator here.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.990
Educators are my people.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.730
So, three years ago,
when my daughter was

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.670
in a nearby school
and she had read Maus.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.050
And she comes home, she's
sad, she's almost crying.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.350
I said what's wrong.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.390
She said my teacher said
graphic novels aren't books.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.290
Can imagine my response to that, so
I went and marched to the principal

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.060
and the principal said, oh, yeah,
graphic novels aren't books.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.940
So, I spent the next year
proving, in the Post,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.400
that graphic novels are books.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.270
And one of the first people I went
to, I thought who is an educator,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.370 position:56%
who understands librarians, and who
is a great graphic novelist himself?

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.000
And who just happened to be coming
through town but Mr. Gene Luen Yang

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.210 position:56%
and we walked around the Post and we
shot a little video and at the end

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.600
of the year we had an
award-winning serious that proved--

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.180
the judges said once and for
all graphic novels are books.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.030
So, that educator isn't very far
north of here, so do you mind just

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.660
as a favor to me one time saying,
for me, graphic novels are books.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.610
On three. One, two, three.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.470
Graphic novels are books.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.770
Thank you.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.600
I needed that.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.900
I needed that.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.690
And we have an institution
here wise enough to know that.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.910
It is my true pleasure to have
Gene Luen Yang as our headliner,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.210
finishing off this night.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.620 position:56%
It was January when we were not far
from here in the Library of Congress

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.020
and Gene was being inaugurated
as the National Ambassador

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.480
for Young People's Literature and
they couldn't have chosen better.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.290
He began drawing comic
books in the fifth grade.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.430 position:56%
In '97, he received a Xeric Grant
for his first comic, Gordon Yamamoto

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.840
and the King of the Geeks.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.980
Here is a man who proudly
calls himself a geek.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.260
He has written things
like Duncan's Kingdom,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.300
the Rosemary Comic
Book, Animal Crackers.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.360
It was a decade ago,
American Born Chinese,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.040
a brilliant cross-culture book.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.560
Yes. Brilliant.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.950
So many beautiful metaphors
all threading through.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.000
Became the first graphic novel to
be a National Book Award finalist.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.290
He followed that up with such
projects as Boxers and Saints,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.310
which also was a National
Book Award finalist.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.160
So, I think you're due pretty soon
for a third one in about a year.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.490
He is just-- he did a brilliant
book about the Shadow Hero.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.120
You should definitely
check that out.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.930
He won an Eisner for
the Eternal Smile

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.630
and now he's doing this
wonderful-- he's, again, sneaking--

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.670
now he's sneaking education
into the graphic novels

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.090
with this series Secret Coders.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.520
It's part comic, but you read
it and realize he's getting kids

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.240
to do problems, to solve, to think,
and that's part of his genius.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.890
He taught high school for
nearly two decades in Oakland.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.090
He's working on a long project,
Dragon Hoops about that teams--

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.440
that basketball team,
a diverse team.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.670
He just does it all.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.160
He even-- on top of Avatar: The
Last Airbender, on the side,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.360
writing Superman-- just to
kind of through that in.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.010
A think that's a lifelong
dream for many people,

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.530
he's just throwing that in there.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.900
So, he's doing it all.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.670
He just-- he's-- I've
had the pleasure

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.820
of moderating him numerous times.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.810
He's just a fantastic
talent, a fantastic voice,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.030
and a fantastic ambassador, I
believe globally, for comics.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.570
Please welcome Gene Luen Yang.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.510
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:52.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So--
and-- all right.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.160
Well, thank you for coming here.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.460
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
thank you for having me.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.140
Thank you all for being here,
especially at the very end.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.440
Thank you so much.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.740
And thank you to Michael.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.500 position:56%
I don't know if you all know this,
but Michael is kind of like a ninja.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.810
You know? He's at the post, he
dresses up as newspaper man,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.010
but really he's a comics guy.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I am a geek who
likes to play with sharp things.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.590
That's why I'm a ninja.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.970
And thank you.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.450
I mean, you know, I
was texting Gene-- I--

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.640
a little bird told me that
Gene would be getting--

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.370
just heard a little bit in
advance, a Genius Grant.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.290
And so I'm like when can I
text him, when can I text him.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.220
And here's someone you
can text, like, you know,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.510 position:56%
in the middle of the night and for--

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.410
in the name of comics,
he will respond.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.720
He will be there.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.070
He's a voice.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.040
You know? So, it's fantastic.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.630
Is the word-- I want to start,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.400
is the word genius--
are you tired of it yet?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well, I want to
hear it out of the mouth of my wife.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.390
That's my goal.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I met your wife.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.990
It's not going to happen.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:05.110
She-- because she's too smart
to fall for that, right?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.030
But-- and your kids right?

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh, yeah.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.310
Yeah. Anybody you see on a
daily basis is hard to impress.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And,
well, and I don't know

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.310
about you praising your
family because that came

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.550
with a $625,000 no
strings attached grant.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.640
The one string is just to
support people who support comics.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.280
You know? But, you know,
I wanted to ask you--

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.470
so, in January, you were
inaugurated as the ambassador.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.720
You're used to-- you spent
your career in schools.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.140
Now you get to go to schools.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.650
You get to spread the Gospel
while you're still creating.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.060
How are you finding it?

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.360
You know, it's a little bit

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.280
like winning an intellectual Miss
Universe where you have to show

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.890
up at so many functions, wear
the sash, but in the name

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.860
of graphic novels, in the names
of young people's literature

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.380
in many forms, but now
that you've been doing it

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.260 position:56%
for almost 10 months, how's it been?

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.560
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well,
first, that's my second goal.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.140
I want my wife to call
me Mr. Universe.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.850
That would be awesome.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.500
But it's been great.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: For 625,000
you might be able to-- yeah.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.610
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's been great.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.260
It's been a little bit hectic.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.390
I think this is one of the most
hectic years I have ever lived,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.890
but it's also been awesome.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.780
I love going to schools
and talking to kids about--

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.660
not just comics, but
books and reading.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.420
And about how sometimes we put up
these artificial walls, right--

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I was going to
say, can you talk about you theme?

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.000
Your message?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.120
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So, every
ambassador picks a platform,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.680
the platform I chose is
reading without walls and by

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.820
that I just mean I want kids to
explore the world through books

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.110
and I want them to do it
in three specific ways.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.410
Number one is I want them to choose
books about people who don't look

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.980
like them or live like them.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.960
Two is I want them to
choose books about topics

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.860
that they might find intimidating.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.830
And, three, I want them
to choose books in formats

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.840
that they might not
normally read for fun.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.850
So, if you're a kid that
normally only reads chapter books,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.480
I want you to try a graphic
novel or a book in verse.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.030 position:56%
And if you only read graphic novels,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.140
I want you to try a chapter
book, any sort of other thing.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.020
So, did you practice
what you preach as a kid?

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.080
You were doing comics,
but, you know, you,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.080
you know, you're brilliant.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.250
You know, your knowledge in
computer programming is brilliant,

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.550
but were you reading everything?

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.180
Were you sort of open?

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.090
Did comics help you
break down other walls?

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.540
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well, one of
the reasons I wanted to do reading

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.080
without walls is because
it's something

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.180
that I would tell myself
to do when I was a kid.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.430
I do remember-- I went
to the library a lot,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.450
mostly because my mom took us.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.120
Took me and my brother.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.940
It was sort of a free
babysitter, I think.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Was
this in the Bay Area?

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.590
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It
was in the Bay Area.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I-- literally,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.190
my mom at the same time
taking us to the library.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.820
We might have been at the same
library in the same comic aisle.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.150
OK. Yeah.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.450
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well,
that's the thing is that with--

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.470
I remember at my local
library we didn't really have

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.220
that great of a YA section.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.900
It kind of went from J to adult
and there was nothing in-between.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.800
I remember getting to like fourth,
fifth, sixth grade and starting

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.740
to feel a little bit lost
at the library and that's

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.040
when I discovered comics.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.640
And they filled something for you.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.940
Filled that gap.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.240
Yeah. What was your
first comic that you--

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: The very first
comic I got was a DC Comics Presents

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.670
number 57 staring Superman
and the Atomic Knights.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.270
And here you are writing
Superman now.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.570
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
it's kind of crazy.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.870
It's a really crazy thing.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Do you
ever pinch yourself and--

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.470
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Absolutely.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.000
Yeah. I think-- it's unbelievable.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.300
It's unbelievable.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.780
I think if I had-- if
I could go back in time

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.720 position:56%
and tell my 10-year-old self that I
would be doing what I'm doing today,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.190
he would have just peed
himself and melted.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.120
I mean-- ridiculous.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I'm going to
move on from that image, but, no,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.660
but you were more of a Marvel guy.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.210
DC was your first, but not
your first love necessarily.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.510
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: No, no.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.020
I actually-- I mean my mom
bought me that Superman comic.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.830
I actually didn't want it.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.770
The one I had wanted was a Marvel
two-in-one staring the Thing

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.070
and Rom the Spaceknight.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, wow.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Both of whom were

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.970
like way cooler than
Superman, right?

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.270
Superman is such a square.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, but that's
what your mom would buy you.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.280
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Exactly.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Your mom
buys you Superman, right?

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.880
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.180
Yeah. But then that Superman
comic was mind-blowing.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, that was it.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.250
And so but Marvel-- I
mean Marvel is known for,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.250
for those that don't know,
is flawed characters,

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.380
often family dysfunction,
youthful dysfunction.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.680
A lot of uncertainty.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.460
Instead of the big blue boy scout.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.650
It speaks to kids because of that,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.420
which so much good
literature does, right?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.770 position:56%
It speaks to you in areas that
maybe you feel different or unusual.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.230
So, did Marvel do that for you?

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, I
definitely was more of a Marvel guy.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.170
I did read some DC.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.150 position:56%
I-- when I was a kid, Justice League
is not what we think of today.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.260
It was not Superman,
Batman, Wonder Woman.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.410
It was actually a bunch of DC
Comic's C- and D-list characters

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.930
and they sort of operated in
this weird sitcom environment

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.360
where they were constantly
making fun of each other.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.200
That was the one book that I loved.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.500
I loved that DC book.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.100
Absolutely.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.400
Well, it was two years ago here
at the National Book Festival,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.630
on Friday night there's a
gala nearby and Gene was one

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.990
of the speakers and he spoke
about comics and he spoke

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.660
about giving yourself permission--
any author, any writer--

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.370
to write cross-culturally,
but due diligence.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.670
Do the homework.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.560
And you talked about
Dwayne McDuffie,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.920
the late Dwayne McDuffie
died at just 49--

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.540
fantastic writer, comics
writer, animator.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.770
And you talked about as a young
African-American boy he was turned

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.680
on by Black Panther, again Marvel,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.380
which was written by
two Jewish creators.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.680
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.980
Created by two Jewish guys.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
they didn't, you know,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.610
you said it was so--
they were so unsubtle.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.810
They said we have to-- you
can't just name him the panther,

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.270
we have to call him
Black Panther, right?

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:54.340 position:56%
We have to label it and yet to a boy
like Mr. McDuffie, it spoke to him

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.420
and so you spoke-- he gave one

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.660
of the most rousing speeches
they've ever had there

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.990
on why we need diverse books.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.570 position:56%
You can go online, you can
certainly find it at Washington Post

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.920
if you do Gene Luen Yang,
National Book Festival,

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.220
diversity, you'll find it.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.170
It's worth reading.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.950
You-- that was a powerful talk.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.080
Can you talk about some of your
passion that went into that talk?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.380
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Sure.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.190
I mean I think growing
up in America,

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.670
growing up with American stories,
it was very difficult for me

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:27.060 position:56%
to find characters that look like me
in the stories that I was watching

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.580
and in the stories
that I was reading.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.770 position:56%
And I think, you know, there's a
professor by the name of Rudy Bishop

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.410
who talks about how literature
serves as both windows

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.820
into other people's lives
and mirrors into our own

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.350
and how kids really need to grow
up with those windows and mirrors.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.990
And I felt like I had
a ton of windows;

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.800
I didn't really have any mirrors.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.700
So, when I encountered Dwayne
McDuffie's work, you know,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.920
he used to write an online column
and he talked about his love

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.600 position:56%
of Black Panther, who is really this
flawed character, at least in terms

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.390
of representation, but he
talked about how Black Panther--

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.700
reading a Black Panther comic made
him feel like African-Americans,

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.080
black people, black
people were inevitable.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.380
They became inevitable.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.480
They were no longer
incidental to the story.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.350 position:56%
And when I read that column, I
though he is talking about something

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.400
that I myself had experienced.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.840
The talk that I gave at the
gala really came out of my--

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:30.050
it really came out of my experience
as a teacher at Hamline University.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:35.140
I teach creative writing
through a university in Minnesota

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.530
and one summer-- the summer
right before that gala, actually,

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.480
we started talking a
lot about diversity.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.990
And it was part of a
larger conversation

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.470
that all books are having.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.770
All storytelling.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.010
We're having it in
terms of our movies,

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.070
our television series,
and our books.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.360
And, you know, a lot of
my students expressed fear

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.830
about writing diverse characters.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.420
They were worried about getting
it wrong and what my response

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.660
to that is-- well, in some
ways, that's kind of good.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.220
It's good that you're scared that
you're going to get it wrong,

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.560
but what you should do with that
fear is not necessarily shy away

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.600
from the story you wanted to tell,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.150
that fear should really just
drive you to do your homework.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.660
It should drive you
to do your research.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.010
I really do think, though,
that the diversity question--

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.310
it's two different questions.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.670 position:56%
There is the question for the writer

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.300
and then there is the
question for the gatekeeper.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.900
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Right?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There
is the page and the pen.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: What we're
seeing on the page is the mirror

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.520
and then what we can't see, who is
getting an opportunity to create.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.820
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Exactly.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.720
So, I do think from the
writer's perspective, you know,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.590
I know from being a writer myself,

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.860
you are constantly
dealing with fear.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.990
You are constantly dealing
with mental obstacles and,

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:52.150 position:56%
as a teacher of writers, I am really
reluctant to add any more obstacles

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.200
into writers' minds, right?

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.050
But then, from a larger
perspective, from the perspective

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:02.420
of a gate keeper, when you look out
there and you say, you know, for--

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.240
let's say for Asian-Americans.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.320
Let's say, you know, 80%--

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:12.250
if you find 80% of stories about
Asian-Americans are not written

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.590
by Asian-American authors,
there's something kind

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.890
of funky about that, right?

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.640
And it's not the responsibility
of the writer to deal with that.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.730
The writer is just dealing
with his or her own fear.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's the--

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.630
that's the responsibility
of the gate keeper.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:25.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.830
Yeah. It's so, so true.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:31.430
Now, how did you find early
on, you're pursuing comics

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.080
and things are opening up,
did you find it difficult?

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.680
Were you running into walls?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.130
Were you running into windows?

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.080
Can you talk about
sort of your early ears

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.110
as a creator, as a writer?

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.610
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I came up
through comics in the 90s.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.870
In the 90s, nobody knew
what a graphic novel was.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.660
That was not a popular term.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.320
In the 90s, Marvel Comics
had declared bankruptcy

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.970
and people were expecting it
to just blink out of existence.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.170
In the 90s, you could go
to Comic-Con in San Diego

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.440
and you could get tickets same day.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.100
On Sunday, there were more
exhibitors on the floor

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.400
than there were attendees.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.900
It was a really bleak time
to be in comics, right?

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Except
for the lines.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.070
Shorter lines, but
everything else was bleak.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.230
You've already talked about
it; it's a revolution.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.530
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Yeah, it really is.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.250
So, when you're-- when you're--

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.760
like there are no gatekeepers when
there's no money around, right?

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: They
disappear mysteriously.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
they mysteriously disappear.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.300
So, the bad thing about
that is that, you know,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.560
when I came up in comics through
the 90s, I was not expecting

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.590
to ever be able to make
a full-time living--

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.130
I was never expecting to be able
to make money at it period, right?

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.210
But the benefit of that
is that I just felt

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.060
like I could tell whatever
story I wanted

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.360
and no one was going to tell me no.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.400
Mostly because only 16
people were reading it, but--

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
so you pursued--

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.250
you became an educator and you've
worked with high school students,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.660
you recently-- is it Bishop O'Dowd?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.960
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's right.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.670
Yeah. I taught at Bishop
O'Dowd high school in Oakland,

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.860
California for 17 years
and that was not--

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.370
that was more than
just a day job for me.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.470
That was not something that I
was doing while I was trying

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.770
to make comics.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, yeah.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.400
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It was because--
I mean, I genuinely like teaching.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.960
Teaching's kind of awesome.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, yeah.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.560
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's a
really awesome profession.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And so
you taught computer science.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.160
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I did.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.760
So, how did you balance
that with creating comics?

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well, for years,
the way I would live is I would wake

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.970
up a little bit early, I'd work on
some comics before I went to work.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.420
I'd go to work and then when
I got home, after dinner,

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.990
I would work on comics again.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.820
I just didn't watch a ton of TV.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.150
Stopped talking to like
half of my friends.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.580
You know?

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Now,
here's the question.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.550
Did you tell your students
that you were doing this

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.110
or did you maintain being a comics
creator for as long as you could

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.170
as like a secret identity,
if you will?

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.720
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: At the
beginning, I totally told them.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.320
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I remember
my first two years of teaching,

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.150 position:56%
the very first day of every semester
I'd be like I am also a cartoonist.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.290
Because I thought would be--

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.140
yeah, I thought they would think I
was cool, but they totally didn't.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.440
No, it didn't work at all.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.280 position:56%
No, no. They thought it was-- they
thought it was a dorky, dorky thing.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.860
And even worse than that
is when things got hard

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.160
in my class they would ask me
comic book-related questions

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.460
to get me sidetracked.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.760
Yeah.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
would you get sidetracked?

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.360
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh, yeah.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.660
Absolutely.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.290
So, after a while, after a
couple years, I just made sure

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.280
that they were two separate worlds.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.880
Keep it--

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.180
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It really felt
like two separate identities.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You had to
have that different identity.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.780
Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.680
Well, can you talk a
little bit about, you know,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.790 position:56%
you have depicted yourself in
comics at times and here what we see

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:36.000
on the screen, if we could go
to it, we just saw model sheet,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.830
but could you talk about, you
know, what we're seeing here?

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.530
Just talk about the origin of this.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:42.830
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Sure.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.920
This is a page from American
Born Chinese and in this scene,

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.320
the main character, Jin,
Chinese-American boy,

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.000
is thinking about his
classmate's curly hair.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.180
And this eventually leads
to him getting a perm.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.210
This is actually loosely based
off something that a friend

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.510
of mine in junior high did.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.470
I had this friend who was Chinese.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.140
He was fairly popular, he
was athletic, you know,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.720
in seventh grade he had
a bunch of girlfriends.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.810
And then when he came back
from eighth grade, we--

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.110
you know, I didn't
see him all summer.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.400
When he came back from eighth
grade, he came back with a perm.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.280
In general-- in general, perms
on Chinese people are a bad idea.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.580
Just in general.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.880
At least Chinese men.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.080
And I remember because he
was like the most popular kid

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.440
in our little group,
nobody said anything,

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.760
but that always stuck
out to me in my head.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.920
Like I didn't understand
why he would get a perm.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.700
So, in the book, I play
with that a little bit.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.460
You know? The perm for Jin is a way

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.590
of him expressing his
own insecurities.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.020
I don't know if that's true
of my friend, like my actual,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.610
actual friend, but that's the story
purpose it serves in the book.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: When you were
creating American Born Chinese,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.640
which, again, came out
about a decade ago,

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.940
I mean it's a masterwork.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.150 position:56%
Did you feel as though you were
creating a masterwork in the process

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.130 position:56%
or were you just one perm at a time?

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.350
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well, first,
thank you for saying that.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.700
When I was doing American
Born Chinese,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.010
I was doing it as mini-comics.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.220
I finished a chapter, I would
Xerox it, I'd staple it by hand,

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.100
I'd take it to local
conventions and sell it.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.610
There was a comic book
store in Berkeley,

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.140
California that was
willing to sell Xerox comics

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.080
and I sold it through there.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.600
So, like literally 16 people
read it, you know, in that form.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.100
It's not a-- I mean I just--
what I wanted to do was I wanted

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.400
to impress my cartoonist friend.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.390
I wanted like Derek Kirk
Kim to read the book

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.900 position:56%
and go oh you did a pretty good job.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And did he?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: He did.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK, so you
impressed 16 friends at a time.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.290
And can you talk about this?

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.590
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.420
This is-- this is the--
this is Jin with the perm.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.020
Yeah. Look at that.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.320
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: My friend
actually looked more ridiculous

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.620
than that.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.180
It was-- I'm not skilled enough to
capture the actual ridiculousness

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.540
of what a Chinese man
looks like with a perm.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.140
And what about this?

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.560
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: This is a
page from Boxers and Saints,

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.650
which up until this point has been
my most time consuming project.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.750
It's a two-volume graphic novel
all about the Boxer Rebellion,

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.840
which is a war that was fought
on Chinese soil in the year 1900.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.130
I have two volumes because I
personally could not decide

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.590
who the good guys were.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.940
So, in one book the
Boxers are the good guys.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.660
They're these Chinese
teenagers who believed

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.450
that they could call the
Chinese gods down from the skies

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.220
and these gods would
give them super powers

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.250
so they could fight
off the foreigners

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.070
and in the other book it
is the Chinese Christians

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.600
who are the good guys who were
the enemies of the boxers.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.930
Well, there's two parts of that
I want to take and, first of all,

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.490
did you realize-- I mean
it's like reading two epics.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.500
You get two epics for
the price of one.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.800
Did you realize what
you were getting

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.930
into when you couldn't
decide which side to take

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.280
that you-- it would be this tome?

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: In my
original-- in my original proposal,

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.110
I had proposed one book that
would be about 200 pages

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.090
and I just kept writing
and writing and writing

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.760
and it just got-- it
got out of hand.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.060
It got--

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It's
over 500, approaching 600?

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.660
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
it's over 500 pages.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.990
Yeah. It just got out of hand.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, the
boxer side, to me, had--

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.760
you can't get the Marvel
geek out of you.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.420
I mean when they're
calling the gods,

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.540
it also plays like
fantastic superheroes to me.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.840
Was that intentional?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.400
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I mean
it was Chinese Shazam.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.690
Like I would read about this
history about these kids, you know,

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:20.070
getting possessed by these old,
old Chinese legendary heroes

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.690
and it really felt like I
was reading about Shazam.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.820
You know? That's what it was like.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.120
And I don't know if that's--

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.020
I mean that's probably the
superhero geek in me as well.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.620
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I
really-- as I was researching,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.060
I saw a lot of parallels
between Chinese opera

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.460
and American superheroes and
that's why I have Chinese opera

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.760
in this scene.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.970
So, the way these kids would
find out about these old,

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.300
legendary Chinese heroes
was through opera.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.690
They didn't have comic books.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.990
They didn't have cartoons.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.290
They didn't have TV shows.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.960
They had these traveling
acting troops that would go

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.610
from one village to the other,

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.580
performing traditional
Chinese opera.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.180
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And they
were colorful, they were full

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.850
of superpowers, and they
were basically inspired

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.980
by their pop culture, these
operas, the same way we are.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.640
And in some ways this
possession, you know,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.290
this Chinese Shazam dynamic
really felt like cosplay to me.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.720
It felt like-- you know?

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.320
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Like if-- if--

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.330
if they weren't in
such dire situations,

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.710
if their country was not literally
falling apart all around them,

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.220
they would still have this impulse
to become their heroes, right?

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.520
The same way we do.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: But that's amazing

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.120
to even attempt, if
you think about it.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.420
We're going to-- you're going
to take the Boxer Rebellion,

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.730
something that serious,
but let's work Shazam

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.160
and let's work cosplay into that.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.460
I mean that's amazing.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.370 position:56%
And I will say on the saints' side,
you know, you deal with Christianity

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.810
and it feels like you're calling
upon your own religious upbringing

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.110
in some way.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.390
You can't do that without--
I would think-- doing that.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.060
Can you talk about that side of it?

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.360
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Sure.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.010
I-- I grew up-- I grew up in
a Chinese Catholic community

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.780
that met right outside of San
Francisco and then I think

00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:00.060
like most adults who
consider themselves a part

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.880
of a faith tradition, I
did go through a period

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.370
of really serious doubt and
then eventually I came back.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.080
I came back to the faith tradition

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.300
of my childhood, but
in a different way.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.260
Definitely in a different way.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:19.290
So, the saints' side was really
inspired by one of my relatives.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:23.880
I have a relative who converted
to Catholicism as an adult

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.160
and when she was a
kid-- when she was born,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:32.840
she was born under a bad luck day
on the traditional Chinese calendar

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.720
and because she was born on
this day she had a grandfather

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.020
that hated her.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.330
She had a little sister that
was born on a good luck day

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.470
and whenever the grandfather
had treats, she would--

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.950
like the little sister would get
the treats, but she would not.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.350
As an adult, she converts
to Catholicism.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.950
She converts to this
faith of another culture

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.030
and she never connects
these two things together,

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.180
but it seemed to me so obvious.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.650
You know? She was-- she
couldn't find a place for herself

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.060
in the beliefs of her family,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.910
so she looked for the
beliefs of this other culture.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.510
It's so powerful.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.810
It's such a multilayered work.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.110
If you haven't read Boxers and
Saints, I highly recommend it.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.440
And here we're talking
about transformation, right?

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.740
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.040
This is the Shazam moment.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:22.430 position:56%
This is the-- the possessing god is
actually the first emperor of China.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.950
He's the guy who made China
into a single unified country.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.120
And you're mixing the big splash
panels with the smaller panels.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.550
And this is actually a
ritual that the Boxers did

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.390
that I found in my research.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.070
They would bow a certain--
like they believed they had

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.360
to perform this ritual in order
to call the Chinese gods down,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.240
so they would bow a certain
way, they would eat ashes,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.040
they would like-- they
would write these charms

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.660
and eat the ashes of the charms.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.370
They would breathe-- they
would control their breathing

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.000
in a certain way and when this
happened the gods would come down

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.300
and take over their bodies.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And we'd
get something like this.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.900
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.200
Yeah. And that's another
transformation.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, not
just superheroes, you were--

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.810
I mean you must have really
studied opera visuals and really--

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.090
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, I got a
bunch of books about Chinese opera.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:08.020 position:56%
And, like I said, looking at it from
the lens of somebody who grew up on

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.520 position:56%
like superhero comics, it all looked
like it was using the same language.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.290
Yeah. On some level,
I'm sure it was.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.010 position:56%
Yeah. And then you got the Avengers.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.310
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.740
That's exactly what it is.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.040
The Avengers.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There is a
super team, historically set.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.470
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah and Boxers

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.630
and Saints is definitely
my bloodiest book.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.900
By far. Like, in the
beginning, if you look at--

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.440
if you look at the
boxers' book especially--

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.730
in the beginning, I tried to keep
all of the violence off panel.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.700
You know, you just see
splashes of blood flying.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.240
And then by the end
I was just like--

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Which
is what you do--

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.270
and Secret Coders gets
pretty bloody, right?

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.640
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
in the later volumes.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.940
Lots of decapitations.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.540
So, can you talk about this work?

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.840
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: This is
from a book called Level Up,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.510
which I did with a friend
of mine named Thien Pham.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.280
He's one of my best friends, but
every now and again I do hate him.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:00.360
And level up is actually about a
young man who loves video games,

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.430
but one night he's visited by these
angels and these angels tell him

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.950
that it's his destiny
to go to medical school.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.150
It is inspired by the
life of my brother.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.970
I have a brother who is younger
than me, he's four years younger.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.670
He is actually a medical doctor.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.230
So, he is the Asian parental dream.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.450
And when he was going
through med school,

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.840
he would tell me all these stories
about what he had to do, right?

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.120
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And--
are any of you doctors?

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.840
Or you must know doctors, right?

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.730
Doctors look-- they
look so professional

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.370
in their little white suits,
those little white jackets,

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:37.040
but what they had to do to get
that doctor degree is gross.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.340
It's disgusting.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.500
So, my brother would call me up,
he'd tell me all these stories

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.110
about gross things that
he would have to do,

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.680 position:56%
how he'd have to put his hands in
places that hands just don't belong.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.980
It's just gross.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.350
And every time he told me one of
these stories, I thought, man,

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:52.750
this would really work great in a
graphic novel, but the problem is

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.660
when I'm trying to
think through a story,

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.460
I want like a narrative thread.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.130
I want some kind of underlying
dramatic spine that kind

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.630
of ties everything together and
what he was giving me was not that.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.650
He was just giving me one
interesting thing after the other.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:13.000
Oh, I had to collect my own fecal
matter to examine my own gut flora.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.420
You know? Or oh, I had to
label hemisected human heads.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.780
And then finally one day he calls
me up and he gives me that thread.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.080
So, this is what he says.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.380
He calls me up and
he says, you know,

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.010
I'm thinking about being
a gastroenterologist.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:27.310
You all know what that is?

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.600
That's a doctor who specializes
in the digestive tract.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.200
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Like from
the beginning to the end.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.540
My brother is an incredibly,
incredibly squeamish person.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.950
When we were kids, I remember
we had these action figures

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:43.490
that were a certain color of
yellow and he gave them away.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.970
Like I came home one
day and they were gone.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.270
I was like what happened
to the action figures

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.450 position:56%
and he said well they kind of
looked like barf and I couldn't deal

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.750
with it, so I gave them away.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.420
That's how squeamish he is.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.670
So, I said to him-- I said
out of all the people I know,

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:57.280
you would make the worst
gastroenterologist because you--

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.350 position:56%
like you realize you are going to be

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.740
like elbow deep in
human fecal matter?

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.040
You're not going to be
able to deal with it.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.410
And he said well, but the other
day I did this colonoscopy

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.610
and it was kind of like playing
video games up somebody's butt.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh man.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:13.950
Oh.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.250
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And as
soon as he gave me that,

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.550
that was my narrative thread.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.240
Like Pac Man.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.130
Everything takes on a different--

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.430
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.980
I mean it just-- I saw the
entire story unfold like--

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I just give you
credit you didn't call it GI Joe

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.130
meets GI tract.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.130
That would have been
[inaudible] than that,

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.070
but no, but it's beautiful.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.650
Even the way you do it
in blue monochromatic--

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.950
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, well
I can't take credit for that.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.060 position:56%
That was from-- that was Thien Pham.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.360
He did the art on that one.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It's wonderful.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.800
Well, here we have-- you spent
a year following a high school

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.100
basketball team.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.400
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, a season.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: A season.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.800
A season. What-- as you've said,
you know nothing or knew nothing

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.570
about basketball, so this wasn't
like a passion project sport-wise.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.770
What compelled you to say
I want to follow a team,

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.290
a high school team, for a season?

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:05.120
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well,
basketball was always a point

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.980
of pain for me when I was a kid.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.950
Mostly because I sucked at it.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.360
You know? And then I was
relatively tall for an Asian,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.870
so within Asian communities at
least, people would look at me

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.580
and expect me to be good at it
and then as soon as they saw me

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.110
on the court they were like oh.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.410
I was a train wreck.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.710
I was a train wreck on the court.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.010
So, I never liked basketball.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.740
That just started to
change fairly recently.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.920
My son had something to do with it.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.520
He started getting
interested in basketball,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.960
he plays for a school team now.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.080
Jeremy Lin had something
to do with it.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.410
And then I started paying
attention to basketball stories.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.710
Books had something to do with it

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.240 position:56%
because I started reading basketball
books and what I realized was

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.630
that basketball specifically
as a sport has all sorts

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:48.250
of overlap with culture, you know?

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.180
There is a reason why certain
cultures gravitate towards

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.630
basketball because--
like for instance--

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.710
for instance, in early
immigrant Catholic communities,

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.950 position:56%
basketball was huge and basketball--

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:05.200
like Catholic universities
still dominate basketball.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.300
If you look at the NCAA tournament,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.160
Catholic universities are
usually overrepresented.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.720
Right? And it's because--
because of Catholic immigrants

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.260
because Catholic immigrants,
when they came to this country,

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.900
they could not afford
to maintain fields.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.290
Maintaining a grass
field was too expensive,

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.630
so they immediately just put
all of their athletic resources

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:31.920 position:56%
into this sport that only needed two
hoops, a ball, and some concrete.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.410
Right? And then in China as well.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.660
China actually learned how to
play basketball about a year

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.860
after it was invented because
of these YMCA missionaries.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.720
And they immediately
latched on to the sport.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.900
They latched on because these YMCA
missionaries told them, you know,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:54.220
the health of your country is
tied to the health of your bodies.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.740 position:56%
So, they look at these missionaries,
these missionaries grew up,

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.070
you know, eating a western diet.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.230
They were usually like
six inches taller

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.910
than the average Chinese
person at the time

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.280
and then their country was
falling apart all around them.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.690
This was right after
the dynasty fell apart

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.130
and they're like that makes sense.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.260 position:56%
So, they started playing basketball.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.570
And basketball was
one of the few things

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.790
that Chairman Mao did not
excise out of his country.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.390
The few western elements that
Chairman Mao did not excise

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:22.430
out of the country when the
communists came into power.

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:27.840
So-- so to this day the Chinese
are fascinated with basketball.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.160
It's like the second-largest--

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.690
it's the fasting growing
sport in the country, right?

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.290
And it all dates back
to that original idea.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.510
Strong bodies lead
to a strong country.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.430
So, you know, I started
reading about basketball.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:41.420
It became really fascinating to me

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.670
and then I discovered
this amazing story

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.830
that was happening
right on my campus.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.160
I went and talked to the
coach of the varsity team.

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.500
His name is Lou Ritchie.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.800
That's him right there.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.380
That's my drawing of him right
there in the lower corner.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.000
And he told me that he
was an alum of O'Dowd.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.690
He had also gone to the same
school where we were both teaching

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:08.180
and when he was a junior
he had gone with his team,

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.920
the varsity men's basketball team,

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.820
to the California State
Championship.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.530
They were down by one
with seven seconds left.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.660
He gets the ball in his
hand, he puts it up,

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.080
it goes through the
hoop, they're up by one,

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.860
the buzzer sounds,
everybody freaks out.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.800
Everyone's celebrating and then
the refs invalidate that last shot.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, man!

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.300
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: They
invalidate it because one

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.570
of his teammates had his hand
over the rim, so it was--

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Like
a goal tending.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.470
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
it was offensive violation,

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.340
but Lou plays this tape back
for me over and over again.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.300
He goes, look, do you think
his hand was over the rim

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.230
and I got to admit, hard to tell.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.750 position:56%
So, Lou goes-- Lou goes on, he plays
for UCLA, he plays for Clemson,

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.770
he gets a hamstring
injury, it's over,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.530
and then he comes back
to O'Dowd as a coach.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:36:00.070 position:56%
And, as a coach, he leads six teams
to the California State Championship

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.560
and he loses all six times.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Not on a
goal tend each time, though?

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.960
OK.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.260
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: No, not
on a goal tend each time,

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.560
but he never redeems himself.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.860
You know what I mean?

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.160
He never redeems himself.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.020
So, supposedly the 2014-2015
season was his best chance

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.320
at finally winning.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And we're
not going to say what happened.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.660
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So, I
mean-- it's over, right?

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.030
I can tell you what happened.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I mean the book
isn't out, so it's up to you.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.810
It's up to you and
your publisher, right?

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.110
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well,
I'll tell you this.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.410
They made it to the
State Championship

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.620
and it was an amazing game.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.920
It was the most amazing basketball
game I have ever, ever seen.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.220
It was crazy.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.270
Yeah, afterwards I-- Thien,
who I did Level Up with,

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.900
he's also a cartoonist,
after that game was over,

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.650
he calls me up and
he goes I hate you.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.960
You just got the-- you just
got the best ending ever.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.690
I hate you so much.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, you can guess.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.420
So, but to me in terms of
diversity and cultural richness,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.630
you've got two, you know,
you and I talked about this,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.580 position:56%
there's sort of two distinct levels.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.300
One thing-- we can get
into the team in a moment,

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.570
but you talk about school.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:07.870
You have teachers.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.150
You said within the
cafeteria groups sat--

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:15.330
we think sometimes only kids sit
according to whether you're a nerd

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.650
or drama club or whatever,

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.230
but you said there was among
the teachers sort of divisions.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.530
Can you talk about that?

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.830
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I mean there
were a few teachers at that school

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.260
that would drift from
group to group,

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.150
just like there are a few
kids that do that, right?

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:28.490
But a lot of us, most of us,
would sit with our own kind.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.690
So, all the nerdy teachers
would sit together,

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.690
all the drama teachers
would sit together.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.780
All the PE teachers
would sit together.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:40.700
So, like, me and Lou-- Lou
was not the kind of guy

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.410
that I would normally
be friends with.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.720
You know? He's a jock.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.890
He walks around with a
swagger that I just don't have

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.410
that I find really intimidating.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:50.650
But, as I got to talking
to him, I realized that he

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.050
and I just have a lot in common.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.450
He also loves books.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.250
He also loves statistics
and numbers.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.550
He's like a nerd at heart.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.080
He's a nerd who knows
how to play basketball.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.380
That's all it is.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.500
Right? And I think that's
going to be something I talk

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.640
about in the book as well,
how he and I became friends.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.930
Well, also you found out
this richness about the team.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:13.480
You found out this richness
about the-- like there was one--

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.220
was there one player who
actually-- was he wearing headgear?

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.080
Was he wearing, you
know, religiously?

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.380
Can you--

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.820
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: He wasn't--
no, he wasn't wearing headgear.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.650
So, there was this one Sikh player

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.930
and he was the only Sikh
player in the league.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.910
He did not observe
kesh, so he didn't--

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:33.780
he didn't wear the traditional--
the traditional head coverings.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.350
But, when I followed team,
I realized that he just--

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.070
he just took a lot of crap.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.720
You know? People would call him
a terrorist from the stands.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.450
People would call him an Arab.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.200
People would call him Osama been
hoopin', which he laughed at.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.480
He thought it was funny, but
it also was really irritating

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.740
and what I realized was that, you
know, if you look at the history

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:59.220
of basketball, basketball has
always been this weird pot

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.150
of racial tensions.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.750
You know, early on there were a lot
of ethnic teams, they played it up.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, it was
the immigrant experience they grew

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.600
up in.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.900
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.200
Yeah, they played up
their ethnicities.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.500
There was a Chinese team that
played early on in the history

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.330
of basketball and they would--

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.660
they would speak in Cantonese even
though they all spoke English way

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.190
better than they spoke Cantonese.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.450
The Harlem Globetrotters
started off as a gimmick team

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.240
and eventually they
transcended that,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.640
but they started off
as a gimmick team.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.860 position:56%
So, that racial animosity, I think
when we look at it as modern people,

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.720
we look at the modern basketball
court, we think that's gone.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.020
We're over it.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.320
We're past it.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.540
Because nobody goes and insults
each other explicitly, right?

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.640
Except for this one Sikh kid.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.900
Like most people who go
and watch basketball,

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.370
they know not to insult any of
the African-American players,

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:47.670
so they take all that tension and
they direct it at this one Sikh kid

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.150
and it was-- it was
just a little bit--

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.750
it was a little bit
shocking for me to see.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.350
And how did he deal with it?

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:54.650
I mean, you know--

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.650
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: He-- yeah,
that's something that I talk

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:00.930
about in the book, but he--
eventually it just-- he just--

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.150
he just learned that he had to let
it be like water off a duck's back.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.870 position:56%
You know? And I don't even know if--

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.580
I mean I don't think
that's fair to him.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.550
I don't think that's the best
way for him to deal with it,

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.340
but that was the way
that he kept playing.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.260
He-- what he wanted was he
wanted his game to speak for him.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.560
You know?

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.570
You've always written on many
layers and written obviously things

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.410
and family friends
can all feed that in,

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:26.950
but before you were
always writing fiction.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.250
You have freedom.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:29.570
Here, nonfiction.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:30.870
You're a reporter.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.700 position:56%
You're a journalist and you're in
the locker room and sometimes it's--

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.430 position:56%
sometimes you're disappearing in the
locker room and sometimes, you know,

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.880
it's always are you affecting
the story that you're covering

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.180
when you're present, right?

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.480
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Exactly.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, there's
a host of challenges you face

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.590
by writing a nonfiction narrative.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.080
How is that going?

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.380
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's--
it's been really hard.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.670
I got to say it's been really hard
because-- because it's a cartoon,

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.350
there's automatically a level
of fiction there, right?

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:58.100
The way I'm drawing them is not the
way they actually physically look

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.960
and even the action I have to both
simplify and exaggerate in order

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.290
for it to work on the comics page.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.010
So, what I try to do is I try

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:08.010
to make sure all the
words are accurate,

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.720
but then the pictures
have to lie a little bit.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.260
You know? In order for it
to work as a graphic novel.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.570
So, we talked about
O'Dowd, did you--

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.530
being in schools for a couple
decades, did you see a difference

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:22.940 position:56%
in how graphic novels were received?

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.240
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.540
Absolutely.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.050
When I got on that campus, no
teachers were using graphic novels

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.440
in the classroom, even me.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.670
And now I can at least count
half a dozen, if not more.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Was it
ignorance, bias, and prejudice?

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.840
What-- a mix of all that?

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.070
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I think it
was just a lack of awareness.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.780
You know? Actually,
I take that back.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.200
When I got on campus, there was
one class that used a graphic novel

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.090
and it was a holocaust
history class that used Maus.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.470
But, at that point, I
think when people thought

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.770
of literary graphic novels,
they only thought of Maus

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.850
and now they think of
Persepolis, they think of Smile.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.150
You know? It's been amazing.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And they--

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.760
you make sure they think of
Boxers and Saints all the time.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.580
Part of that too is-- one thing you
said to me several years ago was

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.630
that librarians get it sooner
because they're on the front lines.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.930
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You know,
teachers, you're in your classroom,

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.620
you can have your lesson plan,

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.380
but teachers are every
day getting the requests.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.200
Can you-- you saw a
shift there, too?

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.800
Absolutely.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.100
I mean librarians have always
been on the front lines.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.400
Right? Librarians realize
that the presence

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.080
of graphic novels increases
overall circulation by 30%.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.170
That's something that
most librarians have seen,

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:32.470
have firsthand experience of.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.690
And it just takes the rest of us
educators a little bit more time.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:36.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Another thing

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.470 position:56%
where we're seeing a profound change
is what I would call gender equity

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:42.770
and geek culture.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.460
Some studies, depending on
how you define geek culture,

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.960
actually have said roughly 50-50%
boys and girls, men and women.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.490
I know when I-- when I
first as a teenager went

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.040
to San Diego Comic-Con, I
talked to Stan Sakai about this.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.330
He would bring his family and
he said often in a room my wife,

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.540
my daughter might be the
only women anywhere near--

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:09.450
it was so male dominated and there
are reasons for that, but the--

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:14.280
web culture has changed things,
but discovering the appeal

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.760
of certain books to girls,
YA classrooms, we-- that--

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.370
I believe that's another area where
we're seeing a revolution, right?

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:23.670
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: We are.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.970
We are.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It feels-- I have
a daughter and it feels massive.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.560
Can you talk about that?

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.860
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
It's hugely massive.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.160
I think it's hugely massive, right?

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.780
I think it's taken this long
for publishers to realize

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.530
that young girls love comics.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.500
You know? It took-- like
Raina had a really hard time--

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Raina Telgemeier.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.100
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Had a
really hard time selling Smile

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.870
and now everybody-- every publisher
is trying to get their own Smile.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.170
I think it's-- I think
it's wonderful.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.470
I think it's amazing.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:51.910
I think it's such a hopeful time.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It really is.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.230
I mean I've talked with Scott
McCloud this [inaudible],

00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:00.400
he thinks within a decade women
are going to dominate comics.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.520
He thinks the pendulum
is going to swing.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.380
All I will know is like the
first time my daughter--

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:09.650
Raina Telgemeier was unknown
and she walked up to the booth

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.050
and she said I like
this and Raina smiled

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.440
because there was something there.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.740
And I listened--

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.040
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
And then millions of--

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Millions
topping the best seller list.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.280
Yeah. Absolutely.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.580
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's an
incredibly hopeful time to be--

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.180
So, as you travel around,
you're seeing--

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.480
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Oh, we did get the--

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.780
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did we get it?

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.080
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, we did.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Do we
have time for any questions

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.750
or do we have-- couple questions?

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.120
Anyone? Bueller?

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.170
Bueller? Yes.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:46.550
&gt;&gt; Hi. I work for a company that
makes water filters with writing

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.670
on them for water sanitation
education

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:53.540
and it's always a challenge to
make things culturally appropriate

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:57.040
and to do your due diligence
and to make things fit.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.370
How do you go about
researching cultures

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:04.240
where you can't necessarily
go-- you have to rely on forums

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.830
or other people, do you-- do
you have to immerse yourself?

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.080
What is your practice?

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.380
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.680
It's hard.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.980
Right now I'm writing
the new Superman book.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.280
It's set in Shanghai.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.500
I've never lived in Shanghai
before; I've only visited twice.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.790
What I've been doing is
I've been reading a lot.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:22.280
I read-- I read books about
what modern China is like.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.060
I read blogs about people--
by people who live there,

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.230
and I've also gotten-- I've also
been lucky enough to get in touch

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.910
with people who actually
live in Shanghai,

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.950
so I can email them
questions and stuff.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.430
Like what music are you guys
listening to, that sort of thing.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.270
But it's always that--
I think it's always hard

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.350
to do your due diligence, but I'm
thankful that you're doing it.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:40.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:41.950
Absolutely.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.250
And one thing you said in your talk

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:47.080
in 2014 was do the
homework, find people, vet it.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.390
Find people who really
know it and go through it.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.390
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Find
insiders, I think that's--

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:56.530
you just can't-- you
can't replace that.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:57.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:59.130
Absolutely.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.430
Yes. Right here.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:01.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:03.030
Really enjoy your talk.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.260
I'm proud that I share some
part of your Asian parts and,

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.020
as you can tell, I have two boys.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:13.600
And so I have a question,
very practical.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.240
This is a parenting-- you
have-- your parents have this--

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.510
I guess this extremely
successful parenting model for you

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.510
and your brother, so
I want to do both.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.880
Please come and-- what
your parents--

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.410
the tips, three or
five, and I can emulate.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.200
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: My parents?

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.250
My parents-- my parents-- well, OK.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.920
So, my dad was very much
a typical immigrant dad.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.920
He gave me three choices in life:
doctor, lawyer, or engineer.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.050
And I kind of did one, right?

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.120
I majored in computer
science and I kind of did it.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.520
And when I was a kid especially,

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.980
I just ended up fighting
with him a lot.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.800
I wanted to do cartoons.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.070
He wanted me to do
something more practical.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.560
As an adult, I look
back and I see that--

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.610
I think my parents had a
point, especially my dad.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.540
Health insurance is
an important thing.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:08.090
And now I really believe
that-- I believe in a balance.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.470 position:56%
I believe in the balance of pursuing
your dreams while respecting the

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.390
wisdom of your parents.

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.920
While getting health insurance.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, if
some of your kids only want

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.090 position:56%
to be comics creators and never want

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:20.860
to do anything else,
you're good with that?

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.160
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: No.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.770
Well, what I would tell them-- what
I would tell them is this-- is--

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.340
is in order for-- I--
in order for you--

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.830
so, not every cartoonist agrees
with me and there are plenty

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.430
of successful cartoonists that
use a different model, right?

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:38.240
But what-- but the model that
I felt like I follow was this.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.810
In order for you to protect--

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:41.550
perfect your craft--
not even perfect it.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:43.220
In order for you to
work on your craft,

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.470
it's going to take you
10 years of losing money.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.090
At least 10 years of losing money.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.420
How are you going to feed
yourself those 10 years?

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.630
If you're planning on
feeding yourself with art,

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.460 position:56%
you're going to end up drawing
things that you do not want to draw.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.010
That is not going to help
you develop as an artist.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.750
So, you need to find some other way

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.890
of feeding yourself while
you work on that art.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:02.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure.

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:03.490
And what if your child says
I'm going to feed myself

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.080
on the MacArthur Genius Grant?

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.150
[ Laughter ]

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.280
We have time for one-- one?

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.580
&gt;&gt; So, I originally
had a ton of questions

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.220
about Avatar: The Last Airbender.

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.520
Huge fan.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.820
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Me too.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.920
&gt;&gt; But, I'm also a
graphic novel artist.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.990
I actually graduated from
Carnegie Mellon for music major

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.920
and then I got into comics later.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.960
So, I was wondering, for you, what
was like your step one in terms

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.260
of like getting your work out there

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.050
so people know it exists
and then like--

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.550
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: My step
one was printing it out.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.420
Was taking it to Xerox.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.970
Eventually I moved
to offset printing,

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:39.550
which was a little
bit more expensive,

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.190
and then just handing out.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.510
Like selling it by hand at shows.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:44.810
That was my step one.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.780
Nowadays, if I were to do it
over again, I would still do

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.440
that because I love print, I
love holding something physical

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.180
in my hand, but I would
also try to use the web.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:57.920
For sure. I think networking
was hugely important to me.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.390
I met some cartoonists who
were at about the same place

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.540
in their careers, really,
really early on

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.840
and we ended up pushing each other.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.740
As soon as one of us met an
editor, all of us would meet

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.260
that same editor because
we would get introduced

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.670
and that was incredibly important.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:12.970
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well said.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:16.350
OK. Well, your wife just texted me.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:19.640
She says, OK, you are a genius.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.030
So, thank you.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:22.330
You're there.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:23.630
Thank you.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.460
Please give a big round of
applause to Gene Luen Yang.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.090
Thank you all for staying.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.390
Wonderful to talk to you all.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:30.690
Thank you.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All right.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.320
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.900

of the Library of Congress.
