00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.750
I really didn't like Scandal, but dammit if
I was going to miss one furtive glance from

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.200
Fitz, or one wine-fueled monologue from Olivia
you are WRONG.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.620
I hate-watched the crap out of that.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.529
Hey scandalized voters, Trace here for DNews
coming at you from the 2016 Democratic National

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.089
Convention in Philadelphia!

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.120
So, if we hate-watch shows all the time, and
hate-friend people on social media… can

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.439
you hate-vote?

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.309
Why do we vote for people we don't like?

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:29.130
Does likeability even matter?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.739
Firstly, absolutely, being likable is important
to presidential candidates.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.780
So, politicians get pollsters out into the
populace to see how likable they are.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.030
According to Gallup polls,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.190
in January of 2000, Bush was 3 percent more
likable than Gore, in May of 2012, Obama was

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.120
29 percent more likable than Romney.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.129
Today, Hillary Clinton is 10 percent more
likable than Donald Trump but, they both sorta

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.210
suck… according to the numbers.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
Pollsters can also measure likability by asking
thousands of people if certain "characteristics

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.609
and qualities apply to Hillary Clinton or
Donald Trump," things like: moral character

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.930
(Hillary is 3 above Trump there), honesty
(Trump by 1) and even "Cares about the needs

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.360
of people like me" (Hill by 7).

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.290
Polling also measures a candidate's "favorability
rating," -- or how they feel about the candidate

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.710
overall (Bernie wins that one by 13), and
"job approval rating" -- how they're actually

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.579
performing once in office.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.829
Aside from the metric of likability, Hillary
and Trump both have historically low favorability

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:25.960
as candidates.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.149
According to polling from the Roper Center
and IBD/TIPP: Hillary is in the high 30s and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.439
Trump is just above 50 in the metric: STRONGLY
UNFAVORABLE.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.509
You don't WANT to get a high score on that
one.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.829
One third of Americans rank Hillary as strongly
unfavorable, and more than half do for Trump!

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.100
In fact, if it weren't for Trump, says FiveThirtyEight,
Hillary's strong unfavorability would be the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.869
lowest ever seen for a candidate.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.479
Interestingly, this time around we have an
election in the U.S. with few historical data

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.810
points, because one of the candidates is female.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.890
A while back we did a video about female leaders
showing they're perceived in many ways as

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.829
superior to males, but not so much in likability.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.310
Mainly because likability doesn't really have
a specific definition.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.160
Even the dictionary's pithy, "pleasant, friendly,
easy to like" is surprisingly broad.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.970
The thing is, the American political system
isn't an election of everyone in the United

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.260
States, we're (allegedly) a republic with
a two-party system, thus we have a limited

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.260
selection.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.790
It's not about who's the most likable person
in politics, we're picking from those who

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.790
are available.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.470
In this case, neither candidate is more liked
than they are disliked, based on these polls.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.910
But that probably doesn't really matter.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.240
In 2014, Cass Sunstein published a paper about
partyism showing identification with a political

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.530
party elicits more prejudice, in some, than
even racism.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.770
So, it would seem hate-voting is a thing,
and likability, doesn't really matter that

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.770
much.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.980
I mean, even President Obama only has a 49
percent job approval rating right now (similar

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.900
to Reagan's at this time in his presidency,
and slightly less than Bill Clinton's).

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.050
This is slightly lower than the average of
53 percent when you take into account all

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.210
U.S. Presidents since 1938.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.850
So, if you think about it, no U.S. President
is ever likable all the time.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.270
Truthfully, discussions about who you want
to have a beer with (usually male candidates),

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.640
or who's too brash or shouty (usually female
candidates), often become media fodder in

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.580
lieu of questions like "who can do the job,"
"who has experience" or "who would display

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.900
good judgement," and so on.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.100
American leaders may be rarely likable, but
they are often tough, fair, competent and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.100
hardworking.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.480
So, as one Republican said, it's up to us
to vote our conscience.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.210
If you want to learn how ladies can lead too,
and they can, often better.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:42.230
Check out the video we made on that here:

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:54.660
What do you think?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.270
Do you think you have to "like" a candidate
to vote for them?

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.710
Do you hate-vote?
