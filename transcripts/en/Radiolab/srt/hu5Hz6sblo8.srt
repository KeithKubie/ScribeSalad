1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,490
Leadership support for more perfect
is provided by the Joyce Foundation.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,200
This is more perfect series about the
supreme court. I'm Jed up and Rod.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,880
In February of 2017 Supreme Court,

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:18,110
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said
something that surprised a lot of people.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,521
Well,

6
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:23,230
I would say that we are not
experiencing the best of times.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,180
She stepped straight into the political
fray and addressed this political

8
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:28,860
moment.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,970
It was a great man.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,830
Once said that the true symbol of the
United States is not the Bald Eagle.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,050
It is the

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,883
pendulum,

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,320
and when the pendulum swings
too far in one direction,

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,250
it will go back.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Some terrible things have happened in
the United States that one can only hope

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,640
that we learn from those bad things.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,420
Today we're going to ride the
pendulum to the dark side.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,620
I'm going to start with one of the most
infamous decisions the court has ever

19
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,820
made. The Korematsu decision, right?

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,210
You might imagine it's not going
to be the happiest of situations,

21
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:19,740
but the story that we're going to tell
you today and tomorrow as well, actually,

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,141
they're not stories,

23
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:27,141
a bitterness because this curious
thing happens in both cases when our

24
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:31,620
characters can't find justice
inside the Supreme Court,

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,980
you stop looking for it there.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,100
Okay.

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,000
And they find it somewhere else entirely.

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,390
Producer Julia Longoria starts us off.

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,253
[inaudible]

30
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,730
the year is 1967 and the place is San
Lorenzo high school in the East Bay of

31
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:55,954
California.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,850
No school day.

33
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,190
We're in a US history classroom.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,470
I was actually a junior in high
school. This is Karen Korematsu.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I'm the executive director and founder
of the Fred t Komatsu Institute in San

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,430
Francisco. So on this particular day,

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,560
Karen is sitting at the back
of the classroom and our
teacher had assigned each

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,210
of my classmates a little
paperback book to read, you know,

39
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,430
books about American history, government.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,200
And the assignment was to then get up
in front of the class and give an oral

41
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,330
book report. I mean
this is a long time ago.

42
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,880
So that's the way they used to do
things. I don't even remember what my,

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,910
my book was or my subject, but,

44
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,020
but Karen said she was just sitting
there in class listening as one by one.

45
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,190
Her classmates got up,

46
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,790
talked about George Washington
or Abraham Lincoln or whatever.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,340
And then my friend Maya,

48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,570
who is a Japanese American
third generation like myself,

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,660
got up in front of the class and her
book was called Concentration Camps USA,

50
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,060
about the Japanese American
internment. And I thought,

51
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,790
no, that's interesting. I hadn't heard
about that before. What's that? About?

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,130
Maya's book report when
something like this

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,130
in 1941 divided states
of America was attack

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,090
and the president, President Roosevelt
as commander in chief had to respond.

55
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,200
I have to erect it, let him all the
measure eyes be taken. [inaudible]

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,970
so in terms of defense,

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,630
one of the big questions for Roosevelt
was what happens if the Japanese

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:35,940
[inaudible]

59
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,710
fade? The continental us

60
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,470
America sounding on a long,

61
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,130
they'd probably come in on the west
coast and you had more than a hundred

62
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,500
thousand Japanese Americans
living on the west coast.

63
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,280
Like would they turn against the
United States? They didn't know.

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,760
And so her friend Maya
explained to them [inaudible]

65
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,680
class on February 19th,

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,680
1942 President Roosevelt issued
executive order nine oh six six that gave

67
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,850
the military the authority to forcibly
remove any one of Japanese ancestry from

68
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,504
the west coast,

69
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,170
said as soon as an aliens or
like what happened to move.

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,430
She goes on to explain these,

71
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,950
the horrific circumstances
and how you know,

72
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:22,830
120,000 people of Japanese
ancestry had been, you know,

73
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,190
forcibly removed from their homes.

74
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,350
She explained they were put into these
detention camps really without any due

75
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:33,280
process of law. But
then she went on to say,

76
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,350
but there was this one man who refused
to go to the camps and he was arrested

77
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,540
and he sued the government and took his
case all the way to the supreme court.

78
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,180
And then he became LM
Mark's Poom court case.

79
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,350
And that man's name is Fred Korematsu. Oh,

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,850
I said to myself, that's my name.

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,790
She says the class got really quiet and
I had 35 pairs eyes turned around and

82
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,200
looking at me. Okay. Yes. She
thought my last name is Corp Matsu.

83
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,670
My Dad's name is Fred, but no
way. There's no way it's my dad.

84
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,220
Someone would've told me. So of course,

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,020
and I go running home and
confronting my mother and asking her,

86
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,940
what does she say? Well, I got
the standard to answer, uh,

87
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,140
wait until your father gets home and
you can ask him that voice you heard.

88
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:33,110
By the way, it was Ellie, Ms Doll or
legal editor. And by the time he, uh,

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
had got home, it was eight
o'clock in the evening.

90
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,590
And so that's a long time after,
you know, three 30 in the afternoon.

91
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,840
And I calmed down a little bit and
I asked him and, and he said, uh,

92
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,320
it happened a long time
ago. And what he did,

93
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:50,380
he thought was right and
the government was wrong

94
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,590
and it was at clear and simple.

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,120
I could just see this hurt going over
his face and I just couldn't ask him any

96
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:04,120
more questions. Karen says,

97
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:08,470
it wasn't until years later that she
learned what really happened and why her

98
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:10,060
dad never wanted to talk about it.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,940
Well, I was a 21 then.

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,690
This is Fred Korematsu. It's tape
of him from the denture archives

101
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,080
and I was up on the hill Sunday
morning, but my girlfriend

102
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,980
and Fred story starts out on a date.

103
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,600
You know when you're that age,

104
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,000
you know you have a girlfriend
just like anybody else.

105
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,660
And then she was more
important to me than anything.

106
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,510
Fred and his girlfriend, Ida,

107
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:43,230
are driving in the hills above San
Francisco looking down on the city,

108
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,260
the Golden Gate Bridge. He'd been
dating this girl for a while now. She,

109
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,280
she was Caucasian, Italian American.
Most of his friends were Caucasian

110
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,090
and we were in a car and we were
deciding what to do with such a nice day.

111
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,350
Either go picnicking or something like
that. And then all of a sudden I heard,

112
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:00,960
yeah,

113
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,270
we interrupt this program to bring you
a special newest product to the Japanese

114
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:07,860
attacked Pearl Harbor. Hawaii bite,
eh brother than rose has Justin.

115
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,430
He came on the air and your car radio

116
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,290
calm without electrifying.

117
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,640
No little crowds right now gather
to the front of the White House,

118
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,660
State Department and the
company then. But the,

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,220
and I was quite shocked.

120
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,233
Both were,

121
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,040
Fred knew there was a war on and that
the U S was likely to get involved.

122
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,860
He'd even tried to enlist
in the u s military,

123
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:33,110
but was denied because he was Japanese
American and he said, sitting there,

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,560
one of his first thoughts was, why
does it have to be Japan? Okay?

125
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,880
Some country was going to
attack the alarm, Bro. I
wish it was Russia. You know,

126
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,560
I just thought about that. You know,

127
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,430
I was better with Japan
to having this happen.

128
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,910
So I took her home and then I went home

129
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,140
[inaudible]

130
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,030
so he gets home.

131
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,340
My parents were all shocked.

132
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,400
They were all sitting
around the living room.

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,760
The house is just in
despair. His mom is in tears.

134
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,160
They were proud of being Japanese,
you know, they obeyed the law.

135
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,270
They did everything that supposed
to, and then to have this happen,

136
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,620
it put them in shame. It was even
hard to talk to them after that.

137
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,440
Fred had a traditional immigrant,
Japanese American family.

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,600
His parents were born in Japan,

139
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,010
and then all his brothers were born here
in the u s born in Oakland, California.

140
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,720
He was the third out of four
brothers and being the third,

141
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,260
not the second or the first
that mattered. Absolutely.

142
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,390
Fred was an innate position as
the third son. He could resist.

143
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,830
We asked Lorraine Banai,

144
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,370
I teach at Seattle University
School of law for some context.

145
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,490
She's a law professor and a friend of
Fred's family. The cultural tradition

146
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,890
is that the first son is the favored son.

147
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,520
The oldest was going to inherit the
family garden and nursery business.

148
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,870
The second would help out with that
business. Fred as the third son,

149
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,090
was very low on the totem pole.

150
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,690
His parents didn't have the same
expectations of him, relatively speaking.

151
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:16,820
He was kind of off the hook.
Unlike his older brothers,

152
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:21,020
he didn't speak much Japanese and he
felt more American than anything else.

153
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,260
When I was in school, we started each
day with the pledge of allegiance.

154
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,610
I studied American history. I've
always been a good American citizen.

155
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,820
So when he came home that Sunday
when Pearl Harbor was attacked,

156
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,120
his family's response to the
whole thing was unsettling. I, um,

157
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,990
I didn't know what to do.

158
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,190
And Fred says pretty soon
after things got very weird.

159
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,290
Within a few days they put spotlights on
the whole nursery at night and they had

160
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,890
a guard standing right here in our
home there round. We're on the fence,

161
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,880
they're watching us cause I went out
one night to have a cigarette and I were

162
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,760
standing on a part and I lit
a cigarette and a guard. Yeah,

163
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,640
bother. If I was signaling
somebody, they're ridiculous.

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,970
Then came Roosevelt's executive order.

165
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,680
Okay,

166
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,970
big order nine oh six six authorize the
military to make a series of smaller

167
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:21,800
ones. The first set of orders was a curfew
order saying that Japanese, Italian,

168
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,630
and German, this were
subject to her curfew.

169
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,280
The second order was a freeze order
directed just at the Japanese on the west

170
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:28,970
coast.

171
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,110
They weren't allowed to leave the area
and then the third order wasn't ordered

172
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:38,111
that they could not remain on the west
coast except for in the custody of an

173
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:41,240
approved location by the army.

174
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,600
All persons of Japanese descent
were required to move with them.

175
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,610
There were about 15 of these assembly
centers and Japanese Americans were told

176
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,870
to report to one of these
centers by a certain date.

177
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,930
Native evacuation notice came,
Fred's family began to scramble.

178
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,630
They had the worry about
what they were going to take,

179
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,920
what was going to happen to the nursery.
So especially when my mother, you know,

180
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,870
the tension and worries. So in
the days before his family left,

181
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,410
Fred made a decision. Me being
the third son, you know, I,

182
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,760
um, I had my own worries. I had
mom, girlfriend mio and problems.

183
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,210
He decided not to go with his family.
I, um, talked to them that, uh,

184
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,120
that I didn't want to leave.
I won't leave with you.

185
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,540
You didn't want to leave
Ida behind any thought.

186
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,120
Maybe the two of them could
make a break for it later on.

187
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,510
Leave the state before
the evacuation deadline.

188
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,840
And, um, they said, fine,
if you can do it, go ahead.

189
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,660
He was the third son.

190
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,110
So he knew that his older brothers would
be able to take care of the family and

191
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,050
they said he was a grownup and he should
make his own decisions. And so he did.

192
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,510
He went off and got his own apartment
and his own job as a welder and kind of

193
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:03,650
lived under the radar.

194
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,240
He knew his brothers would be
there to take care of his parents.

195
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,930
If you're with a family, like my
family or any Japanese family,

196
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,030
you feel the pressure and the sadness

197
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,360
[inaudible]

198
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,500
but on the outside is definitely
just like a normal wipe, you know?

199
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,540
Just like we've been living all the time.

200
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,140
Yeah.

201
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,300
I felt right at home, you
know as well. I had got,

202
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,630
I'm an American citizen too, you know?

203
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,883
[inaudible]

204
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,490
I didn't feel guilty because I
don't think I did anything wrong.

205
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,950
No ma'am.

206
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,350
Do you have a sense that he was
politically aware at this point?

207
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,630
If you're asking me about whether he
refused to go as an act of political

208
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,030
resistance, I don't think initially,

209
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,840
unconsciously he probably knew that what
was happening to Japanese Americans was

210
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:06,800
wrong, but I don't think he had the
words for it that we might have today.

211
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,740
[inaudible]

212
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,000
it's on his way home from work.

213
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:15,450
One day that he reads in the newspaper
about his parents and all the other

214
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,510
Japanese Americans in the
area. Being taken away to camp

215
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,620
made me sick to my stomach, you
know, I can see my parents going in,

216
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:28,660
you know, and my brother's
climbed into camp and uh,

217
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,110
I'm not there, you know,

218
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,250
but that was the only time that I felt

219
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,640
kind of lonely, you know, like, well,

220
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,320
what am I going to do now? You know,

221
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,930
it begins to slowly dawn on him what
he's done by staying in the bay area.

222
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:54,830
He is officially breaking the law and
he and Ida aren't sure what that means.

223
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:57,410
Like will they be thrown in jail or worse?

224
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,860
He talks in the archives about how he's
worried and Ida's worry too because now

225
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,860
he could get arrested. So they
start to think about their options.

226
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,790
Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish
sounding last name on it so we won't be

227
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,450
recognized as Japanese. And then Ida says,

228
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,760
essentially that might not be enough.

229
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,880
She pulled out an article regarding
the plastic surgery and uh,

230
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,590
she says, what do you think of this?

231
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,610
I looked it over and well,

232
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,720
I didn't think it was a good idea,

233
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,020
but she said, hey, why
don't you think about this?

234
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:38,860
This might be a good thing that
will allow you to stay here.

235
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,190
So the idea would be that he, you know,

236
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,630
have his eyes doubled
or something like that,

237
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,560
a plastic surgery procedure where
you put a fold in the eyelid,

238
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,170
so you look more white, less Japanese.

239
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,140
Then she says, do you think at
work? And I said, I don't know.

240
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,400
Well, she says, shall we look into it?

241
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,650
And um, why is that? Then
Ma'am got anything to lose?

242
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,870
So we decided to try it.

243
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,340
[inaudible]

244
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,300
so Fred gets into his car and he drives
into the city, into San Francisco,

245
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,750
and he just stops in front
of the doctor's office

246
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,440
and he starts pacing, walking
up the steps of this victory

247
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,733
Korean, and then

248
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,460
walking down the steps to leave
thinking this was a really crummy idea.

249
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:38,350
And then walking back up the steps
thinking, well yeah, maybe I just right,

250
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:42,640
it's a good idea. And the down the
steps, this is a ridiculous idea.

251
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Giving some doctor your hard
earned money to change your face.

252
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:54,270
So he goes up and down and up
and down and up and down until

253
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,033
you decided to just

254
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,400
go in and have the procedure done.

255
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,530
He really did it as a way to protect
them as they try to leave the state.

256
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,130
The doctor said he was going to work
on his eyes and then also fix a broken

257
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:12,690
nose.

258
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,690
I had a broken nose from playing
football and I never had it fixed and um,

259
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,490
said he could do pretty good work on me,

260
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,040
but it turned out he didn't do
everything he said he would.

261
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,560
Well you just took my money.
That's what it was. I actually,

262
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,240
there wasn't anything change except
I didn't have a broken nose anymore.

263
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,930
So he drives back to the East Bay
with a new nose, but the same eyes.

264
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,810
And shortly after that day
at the doctor's office,

265
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:45,350
he's out buying cigarettes at
a convenience store and a clerk

266
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,860
recognized him and reported him.
And one day walking down the street

267
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,940
was stopped and arrested,

268
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,100
um,

269
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,930
and spent his memorial day in
1942 in the San Leandro jail.

270
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,120
When we got caught, they
called her into yeah.

271
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,940
And um,

272
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,460
I seen the police chief talking
to her for quite a while.

273
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,530
I imagine it's a small jail
and he's just been admitted.

274
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:27,490
So He's sitting in the lobby and he
sees Ida come in to the front desk.

275
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:28,680
Wow.

276
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,800
He's just out of earshot. He can't
make out exactly what they're saying,

277
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,380
but at a certain point
they stopped talking

278
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,710
and she just walks out.

279
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,440
So that was the end of it.

280
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,260
I never did see her again.

281
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,753
[inaudible]

282
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,140
he never saw each other again.

283
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,650
So he's sitting there alone in the
San Leandro jail and they ended up

284
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:12,080
transferring him to Oakland
jail for some reason.

285
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,880
And then he ends up at the federal prison
in San Francisco because resisting the

286
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:18,260
order was a federal offense.

287
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,860
Anyway. Um,

288
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,090
one day I got a call from the guard

289
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,150
and told me I had a visitor and I
didn't know who it was. You know,

290
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,410
I knew all my friends were in
Kane or they were in the military.

291
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,650
Fred goes down to the visiting room
anyway, and there's this man there.

292
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,920
Hi, I'm a New Yorker.

293
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,303
Hello.

294
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,840
I believe in civil liberties and when
the right of people is being denied,

295
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,500
this is something that
I'm concerned about.

296
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,140
The man says his name is
Ernest [inaudible], and then
he was a very nice foul,

297
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,820
easy to talk to.

298
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,990
You ask me if I need some cigarettes
or something like that, you know,

299
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,220
just to break the ice.
By the way, I asked him,

300
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,510
who do you represent? And
earnest responds, well

301
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,430
[inaudible] and I thought it was maybe
one church or something like that.

302
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,173
See,

303
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,860
we have no way of knowing what exactly
was said between Fred and Ernest

304
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,260
[inaudible]. Both men have passed away,

305
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,670
but it seems like something important
must have happened in this conversation

306
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,310
because if, as Laurie Banai says,

307
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,610
I don't think he had the words
for it that we might have today.

308
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,320
Fred didn't have.

309
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,530
People would think the language
of resistance before this moment.

310
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:49,140
Something in that conversation must
have given it to him because when Ernest

311
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,190
Bassett asked him, do you want me
to represent you in a court of law?

312
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,260
Fred says, yes.

313
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,570
What do you imagine the words were that
might've turned him in that moment?

314
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,240
I imagine that best seg
must've said to Fred,

315
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,940
we think that what's happened to
Japanese Americans is unconstitutional.

316
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,220
We'd like to bring a lawsuit to say the
Japanese Americans are being sent away

317
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,820
only because of their race. And in that

318
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,560
he gave Fred language.

319
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,650
I think Fred knew what's wrong.

320
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,723
[inaudible]

321
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,440
basic tried to get Fred out of jail,

322
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,700
but the military stepped in and said
he had to join his family and camp.

323
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,480
They were at a place called
tamper and racetracks.

324
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,420
It was a temporary holding spot.

325
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,780
So that meant that the first place that
Fred went after jail was a converted

326
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:08,800
horse stall.

327
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,910
I opened the door and uh, there's
gapping holes on the walls.

328
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,240
The wind just blew in there. The
desk blew in there and everything.

329
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,970
And this was a small horse doll
because Fred had asked for his own,

330
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,630
you wanted to sit and think
about what to say to his family.

331
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,740
We're also at Tam Fran.

332
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,970
He sat and looked at the single loan
bare light bulb above and the smell of

333
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,930
manure and hey,

334
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,250
I mean it's made for horses,
not for human beings.

335
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,113
[inaudible]

336
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,650
and then all of a sudden I hear a
knock on the door and I opened it.

337
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:49,330
It was my brother. He says,
Hey, you can't stay here. You,

338
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,960
you gotta come and see the pokes.

339
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:57,710
[inaudible]

340
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,990
so we walked spread over to the
store where his family's been living

341
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,950
and I was surprised the way
they fixed up their style.

342
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,210
They filled up all the cracks and they
put newspaper photo wall papered it all

343
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,054
up.

344
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,630
This was a common thing
for these families.

345
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,010
Thousands of them were transferred to
more permanent camps and many stayed there

346
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,920
for up to three years. Over time,

347
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,310
the community kind of tried
to build lives for themselves.

348
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,480
You hear stories and see pictures of
people building small Japanese gardens out

349
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,020
of what they found in the area.

350
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,160
He saw newsreels about the
people who made the desert bloom.

351
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,250
[inaudible] [inaudible]

352
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,160
we eventually saw people forming,
you know, baseball teams.

353
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,083
[inaudible] [inaudible]

354
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,513
[inaudible] [inaudible]

355
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,631
yeah, my brother,

356
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:27,631
he was involved in various
Japanese activities and uh,

357
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,470
he thought it might be a good idea for
me to get some suggestions and opinions

358
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,720
regarding to, uh, if I
should find the case or not.

359
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,210
So Fred's brother calls a meeting,

360
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,930
he got about 30 young people together,

361
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,750
I imagine it was like in a mess
hall or something like that.

362
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,060
And they discussed Fred's case.

363
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,270
They were discussion at to themselves
or little groups and I stood around and

364
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,900
waited for someone to speak,

365
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,390
but no one actually
came up to speak to me.

366
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,080
I can see Fred kind of standing in a
corner as people are gathered in small

367
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:28,330
groups whispering to each other,

368
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,090
stealing glances at them,

369
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,820
but no one says a word to him.

370
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,373
Uh,

371
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,360
finally one day. And you said Fred, uh,

372
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,930
were undecided on if I should fight the
case or not because they didn't want to

373
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,010
make any more disturbance.

374
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,490
Okay.

375
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,490
Anything to upset the parents right at
this time because they were too upset

376
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:12,220
already and being just being an end cap.

377
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,060
They told them their parents
had been through enough,

378
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,420
leaving their lives behind.
Basically they said,

379
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,740
we can't help you,

380
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,080
but there was one Japanese American group
that did decide to say something about

381
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:31,914
Fred's case.

382
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,720
What's the name of the
group? J a. C L. Ernest

383
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,860
spastic had a nickname for this group,
the Japanese American Citizens League,

384
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,720
the Jackal's I met,

385
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,680
who is the leadership of
that group? Several of them.

386
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,150
I urge them to oppose the exclusion,

387
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,230
but they didn't seem to be
particularly interested.

388
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,300
The JACL condemned Fred's case and anyone
else who fought against the government

389
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:05,320
orders said it would not support any of
these individuals who were fighting the

390
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:10,000
orders and called them
self-styled martyrs. Wow.

391
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,740
They use that phrase. Yes.

392
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,280
They would basically get
everyone else into trouble

393
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,410
to do this by myself.

394
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,600
I just wonder if I was doing wrong
or maybe putting them in shame by,

395
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,500
uh, bringing the issue up again. Uh,

396
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,470
because of Japanese people, they,
they're peaceful people and they,

397
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:36,471
they like to leave things alone if they
can because they were in enough trouble

398
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:41,990
as it is because of this Pearl Harbor
attack and the country blame them.

399
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,180
And so they had this sort of
a guilty complex, even though,

400
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,320
uh, they had nothing to do with it.

401
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,240
Majority, I'm just avoided me. So
therefore, I, uh, assume that, uh,

402
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,393
uh,

403
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:02,740
[inaudible]

404
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,573
that

405
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,520
I got myself in this problem and, uh,

406
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,910
therefore it was my
problem and not theirs.

407
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,610
[inaudible]

408
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,680
Fred continued to fight his case.

409
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:23,610
He argued that basically rounding
up thousands of Japanese Americans,

410
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,510
American citizens without a
trial, without due process,

411
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,440
basically amounted to
racial discrimination.

412
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,840
His case made its way up and
down the courts. And eventually,

413
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,530
two and a half years after he'd met
Ernest Basset in that jail cell,

414
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,370
the case arrives at the Supreme Court.

415
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,410
You, he, he thought that by the time
his case got to the Supreme Court,

416
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,180
that's Fred's daughter care. And again,

417
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,170
he would be able to vindicate his
family and everyone that had been

418
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:58,650
incarcerated, right? I mean, that's how
much he believed in the Supreme Court.

419
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,840
And so when, when that didn't happen,

420
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:06,680
he felt like if he felt
like it was his fault,

421
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,793
yeah,

422
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,370
that's a big burden to carry around.

423
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,020
What ends up happening
is on December 18th,

424
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,020
1944 the supreme court ruled against Fred.

425
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,050
It's kind of a complicated decision.

426
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,400
The Supreme Court said racial distinctions
when the government is making racial

427
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,610
distinction, it's serious. We need
to look at this very, very carefully.

428
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,100
And that was a big precedent.

429
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,400
So in a lot of ways it's kind of a
victory for people fighting racial

430
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:44,010
discrimination. But then the
court turned around and said,

431
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,670
even though racial
distinctions are serious,

432
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,810
this one is not strictly racial.

433
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,510
We're at war with the Japanese empire.

434
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,570
Therefore rounding up Japanese American
citizens is a way to defend the nation.

435
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,271
Kind. A few, Fred,

436
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:08,750
at this point like it sounds like it
sounds like lonelier than I can almost

437
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:13,640
imagine because you're, you're by
yourself pretty much on all fronts,

438
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,440
the country that you feel.

439
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:19,430
So a part of that you want to actually
enlist in the military to fight for

440
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,440
doesn't seem to want you at that moment.

441
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,250
Your own community
doesn't seem to want you.

442
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,900
Your family is ashamed by you.

443
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,220
Your girlfriend is gone.

444
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,010
[inaudible]

445
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,230
I can't imagine being
more alone at this point.

446
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,500
And he never shared that with my brother
or I, he shared it with my mother, but,

447
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,670
but we didn't, that wasn't part
of our dinner conversation.

448
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,123
[inaudible]

449
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,990
they're discussing drafting a proposal
to reinstate a registry for immigrants

450
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,490
from Muslim countries and perfectly
perfectly honestly say it'll hold

451
00:29:57,491 --> 00:30:00,400
constitutional muster. We did it
during World War II with Japanese,

452
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:04,270
which you know, call what you will.
Maybe you ban. We're not proposing.

453
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:07,570
We go back to the days of
internment camps. I go, no, no, no.

454
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm not proposing that at all, Megan.

455
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,900
But what I am saying we
need to protect America.

456
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,810
That's the kind of stuff that
gets people scare Carl. Right.

457
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,200
But I'm just saying there is precedent
for it and I'm not saying I agree with

458
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:18,034
it.

459
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,950
This is the crazy thing about
the core Matson decision.

460
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,620
It is still on the books.

461
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,850
That Guy Carl Higbee got on Megan Kelly
and said this stuff about Korematsu and

462
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:34,340
the very next day he got on
and apologize for saying that,

463
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,690
but he's right core Matsu is
technically still good law.

464
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,020
Justice Antonin Scalia one said that,

465
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,240
sure core Matsu was wrongly decided,

466
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,740
but if you think that it's not going to
happen again, you're kidding yourself.

467
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,890
The court isn't going to get this across
the precedent in international American

468
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,073
say.

469
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:01,700
Would you like it too? Um, I think so. Um,

470
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,550
would you like it to know

471
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,530
that's not entered in school yet?

472
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,040
It's a judge named Richard Posner and
at the time the Ellie talked to him,

473
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:14,240
he was on the Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals and he was widely considered by

474
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,050
people on both the left and the right
to be one of the most influential judges

475
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:18,884
in the country.

476
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,560
He sometimes called the 10 Supreme Court
justice and he's a big defender of the

477
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:25,670
Korematsu decision.

478
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,770
What do you say then to Fred
Komatsu? What do you say then to,

479
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:33,030
to a Japanese American about
kind of the law and the court?

480
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,740
Well, they were given compensation.

481
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,380
Right. I mean there's, there's,
you know, the, there is, you know,

482
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:44,990
pain and suffering there is
there, there is an anguish, right,

483
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,940
that we can't exactly commodify.

484
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,790
Uh, yeah. But um,

485
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,070
at the time it all happened
shortly after Pearl Harbor.

486
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,800
It seemed like the right thing to do and
it probably was the right thing to do.

487
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:06,490
And I imagine that the officials
and federal government,

488
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,960
and I'm 1941,

489
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:14,350
they probably didn't know anything about
Japanese Americans on the west coast.

490
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,890
I think Roosevelt had ever met a Japanese
American. Right. Doubt it. Right.

491
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,313
Thanks for that. You know,

492
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,840
the fact that he hadn't ever met anybody
might've been a reason for him to be

493
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:27,980
more restrained in his
executive orders, right?

494
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,120
No, because all he cares about is
the defense of the United States.

495
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,690
If there's any possibility of Japanese
American somehow cooperating with the

496
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,850
invasion force,

497
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:46,130
then he has to move the Japanese
Americans. That's, that's,

498
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,190
I'm sure that's all he
would've thought of. Right.

499
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,710
I mean I think it's all he did think of,
but what else could he have thought of?

500
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,970
That's the only thing
he is going to focus on.

501
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,580
And if he does and he could be impeached.

502
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,140
Well he could also worry about
citizens. Right. And I think one of the,

503
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,820
no, no, no, no. Look you're not.

504
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,900
You're missing the priorities.
The priority is defense.

505
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,740
That's the priority. That's what
these people are thinking about.

506
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,470
You think they have time
to be thinking about any,

507
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:26,010
any kind of Nice ideas for protecting
people any more than than Lincoln did.

508
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,120
What he's referring to,

509
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:35,710
there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham
Lincoln basically tossed this alleged

510
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,360
confederate in jail without due process
and then justified it by saying he had

511
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:43,780
to save the Union and that
case Supreme Court justice,

512
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,570
Roger Tani ruled against
him, should legal said,

513
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,210
oh well Tani he's the chief justice.

514
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,100
And he said this jerk should be
released. I guess I have to do that.

515
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,350
Here's the chief justice. No,

516
00:33:56,351 --> 00:34:00,400
you do that enough times as
the president you're out.

517
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,180
It seems to me that that's why we
have courts. We have, oh, come on.

518
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,100
What's the restrain the executives use?

519
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,343
Why do we have,

520
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,500
we do not have courts so that presidents
can be checked in situations of a

521
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:19,570
national emergency. That
was my courts were set up.

522
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,600
So that then what I mean, I guess I'm,

523
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,890
I'm flailing now, but then
what stops them? What if,

524
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,740
cause if Congress can't stop them
and if the courts can't stop them,

525
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,010
like what can stop a
president in a time of war?

526
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,450
There's nobody. There's
nobody can check that.

527
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,430
That's the presidents responsibility.

528
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,220
[inaudible]

529
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,000
obviously I like a do over because
somehow in the heat of the moment,

530
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,360
I forgot that I'm talking about
defending the rights of actual American

531
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:00,234
citizens.

532
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,590
And Posner is talking about people
who are rebels to the country.

533
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,690
Um, there's probably a way where I
could have said pointed that out to him.

534
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,310
Um, in terms of the court
stepping in, I mean, it happens,

535
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:16,260
it happened to Truman. But you know,

536
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:19,920
judge Posner is right that
it doesn't happen a lot,

537
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,350
which is why he gets to be judge Posner.

538
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:24,150
And I'm the guy that
had to check Wikipedia.

539
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,200
And by the way,

540
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:30,520
do you think these supreme court
justices are great big brains,

541
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,120
big stars who were selected because of
the best lawyers in the United States and

542
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,340
their decisions

543
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,290
are, are usually great. You
think all of that? I don't,

544
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,020
I don't have a high respect
for the Supreme Court at all.

545
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,760
Um, I'm, I mean, you
look at their decisions

546
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,990
[inaudible]

547
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,450
you look at them how they're
pointed, who appoints them,

548
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,600
right. This is,

549
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:04,580
so why do you think the supreme court
has such a great balance to the president

550
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,613
in a war?

551
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:11,720
[inaudible]

552
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,440
but this is what gets me up and gets me
going because I still think it can be

553
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,870
used as a precedent. So
you're, you're, you're, you're,

554
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,190
you're still worried that it
can be used. Yes. And that,

555
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,230
do you think it will be like,
do you felt like, you know,

556
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,660
I think we cannot take this for granted.

557
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,893
[inaudible]

558
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,313
coming up

559
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,620
since Fred Korematsu couldn't get
justice inside Supreme Court question is,

560
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,240
can you find it on the outside

561
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,290
more? Perfect. We'll continue in a second.

562
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,690
I'm Preet Bharara every
weekend. My podcast, stay tuned.

563
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,900
I answer your questions about what's
really happening in Washington.

564
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,590
I wonder if it is legal for president
Trump to initiate military action against

565
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:21,740
North Korea. What happens
if Mueller returns?

566
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,400
I'm indictment again, the
president. I just want to know,

567
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,190
are you a table genius?

568
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,930
Subscribe to stay tuned
from cafe and W NYC studios.

569
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,020
This is more perfect. I'm Chad. I'm rod
here with Julia Longoria. All right,

570
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:46,950
so getting back to the story of Fred,
uh, picking up from the decision.

571
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:47,970
What happened after that?

572
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,180
So the interment camp where
Fred was staying closed in 1945,

573
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,660
um,

574
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,100
and Fred had gotten permission by that
point to work at a steel mill in Detroit.

575
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,730
So he was living in Detroit. He fell
in love with a woman named Catherine.

576
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,350
They got married, moved back to
the bay area and had two kids.

577
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,090
And Karen,

578
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:12,240
his daughter says that they were kind
of ostracized from the Japanese American

579
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:15,660
community. They grew up outside
of the Japanese community.

580
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:20,010
He was involved in boy scouts, girl
scouts. So I was at girl scouts.

581
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:23,790
So you know, the camps, when we had to
open the camp, it would work on that. Uh,

582
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,820
the Presbyterian church in Oakland
and then he became an elder.

583
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,390
So even joined the lion's club
and he was president twice.

584
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,830
And Karen says throughout the
forties, the 50s, the 60s,

585
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,640
she never heard him talk about
his case. No, never. No, never.

586
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,230
He just, he never, he never,

587
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,260
he never told a story even after she
confronted him about it in high school.

588
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,790
Yeah, it's, that's it.

589
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,640
But she says in like 1969 ish,

590
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,510
68 or 69 when the world was
in a very different place.

591
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,310
They got a phone call back
in those days, you know, you,

592
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,930
my parent's phone number was in
the phone book of all things.

593
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,250
Cause I mean my father would get phone
calls from law students want to interview

594
00:39:08,251 --> 00:39:11,430
him, but he really didn't want to
talk about his case much. He just,

595
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,020
it was just too painful.

596
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,350
But this time there was a professor
on the line from the University of

597
00:39:16,351 --> 00:39:20,400
California, Berkeley. He was a Japanese
guy actually, and he told Fred,

598
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,250
I really, really want you
to come into my class.

599
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,900
There was a ethnic studies class
that was actually off campus.

600
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,140
Ethnic studies was not even
recognized then. So he,

601
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,130
he talked at this ethnic studies
class and these kids were brutal.

602
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,820
I mean UC Berkeley at that
time had this, you know,

603
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,440
notorious reputation
of being very radical.

604
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,280
People were asking questions during
the whole hour. This is Jean Kwan,

605
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:48,890
former mayor of Oakland. She
was in the class that day.

606
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,020
It was a important time that you,

607
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,950
at different times of your life you
had to learn to stand up to authority.

608
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,340
And certainly these students who are like,
you know, fist pounding saying, well,

609
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,580
why didn't you, why didn't you
protest? Why didn't you do this?

610
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:05,890
Why didn't you do that? Why didn't you
fight harder? And we're almost, you know,

611
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,330
angry that he wasn't angry. You know,

612
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,160
I think you've got to remember that a
lot of these students even know anything

613
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,200
about the camps. Many,

614
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,680
many kids had not had frank
discussions with their own parents.

615
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:23,270
So of course Matsui was probably a
surrogate for like their parents.

616
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,290
How could they have gone through that and
never told me they had no right not to

617
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,190
tell me and so they're really angry
at their parents surrogate or not.

618
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,520
Fred felt like he was being
indicted all over again.

619
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,400
It was such a painful
experience for my father.

620
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,530
He never wanted to speak to anyone again.

621
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,500
Fred would ultimately
challenge his conviction in a
lower court and he would win

622
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,920
the Supreme Court decision still stands,

623
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,760
but he was able to clear
his own personal name

624
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:04,800
[inaudible]

625
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,330
and in around 1990 again the
world in a very different place.

626
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,450
He finds himself again
on a college campus.

627
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,780
This time the University of of Michigan,

628
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,480
my father and mother were walking with
some other students across the campus to

629
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:25,830
see the newly renovated
library and you know,

630
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:30,000
my father loved architecture. It
was very old gothic a library.

631
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,850
So they're walking through this sort of
open quad looking the architecture and

632
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:36,920
then they come upon
this group of students,

633
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,550
a group of Arab American students.

634
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,410
The students start walking toward him.

635
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,500
They all of a sudden kind of surrounded
my father and they had this certificate,

636
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,770
um, to give to my father, to
thank him for speaking up.

637
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,380
So that was meaningful to him.

638
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,660
Why, why did that make you
emotional? Why that story

639
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,010
[inaudible]

640
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,590
Oh, uh, well

641
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,090
because it, it meant so much to my father

642
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,130
that this group really honored him
that also had been racially profiled,

643
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:23,721
you know,

644
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:28,721
to think that he would be
able to touch their lives.

645
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:34,310
It kind of reinforced what he was doing.

646
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,790
[inaudible]

647
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,810
do you have the same faith in the
Constitution that your dad did that? Yes,

648
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,710
I have great faith in our constitution.

649
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,440
It's a great document.

650
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,650
It is so happens though that it's the
way that certain people interpret it that

651
00:42:56,911 --> 00:43:01,050
gets us into trouble. Yes, definitely.

652
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:05,723
Okay.

653
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
[inaudible] Julie Envoy

654
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,040
[inaudible] this from
our legal editor, Allianz

655
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,910
[inaudible]. The danger is
the law, the need for my

656
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,950
travel ban 3.0 coming here tonight.

657
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:57,660
The top administration unveiling new
travel restrictions on certain foreign

658
00:43:57,661 --> 00:44:00,690
nationals from eight countries
where they're gonna go,

659
00:44:00,691 --> 00:44:03,650
because they sold everything with the
feeling where they're thinking they're

660
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,730
going to start a new
life in United States.

661
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,250
[inaudible] this is the one we won. We
won the freedom we want to deliver to

662
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,530
people. We are the people, we
the people. But there are many,

663
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:31,080
many lawyers here. They're
all working pro bono.

664
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:35,250
They're from different organizations
is what resistance looks like.

665
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:40,251
This sends a message that they cannot
do away with constitutional protections

666
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,630
without people standing
up for the constitution.

667
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:48,720
So I think this is inspirational.
I think it's wonderful,

668
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:52,170
and I think we need to be
vigilant and keep fighting.
