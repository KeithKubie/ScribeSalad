<v 1>hey, I'm Janet. Boom. Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.850
This is Radiolab and our topic today is totally tubers. Yeah, yeah, totally.

10
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.610
And when you call it what you want, it doesn't matter.

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.670
It doesn't matter because the topic is tumors, famous tumors,

12
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.850
and our next and final tumor related Dale is one.

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.020
I've been wanting to do this particular tumor story for a forever for like two

14
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:51.470
years ago, I think. Oh, longer than that. Yeah.

15
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.350
It's a story that comes from a friend of mine, Rebecca Skloot.

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.690
You want me to talk? Make noise? That's her. Like we can move me closer.

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.310
She's a journalist and she has been wanting to tell this story even longer since

18
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:05.050
she was in the womb and she had been researching the story for 10 years. Hello,

19
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:05.690
hello, hello.

20
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.100
And she just wrote a book called the immortal life of Henrietta lacks and,

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.670
and the story. Okay. It's about a tumor that expands and never stops.

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.700
Begins in 1950 a black woman in Baltimore is in her bathroom and she discovers

23
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:23.960
pretty much all on her own that she has cancer. Um, it's all,

24
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.660
it's a little bit of a mystery how she initially knew this,

25
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:28.250
but she knew it was there.

26
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.890
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

27
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.090
<v 3>and not she called it.</v>

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.710
She had told to her cousins for a while that she thought there was something

29
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.990
wrong with her, with her womb,

30
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.970
and she climbed into her bathtub and she slid her fingers up inside of herself

31
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.530
and found this lump chapter one first.

32
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:50.760
She went into her local doctor.

33
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.380
I happened to be an attending at that time.

34
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 1>The guy she eventually ended up seeing at Johns Hopkins University was this</v>

35
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:00.740
fellow Dr. Howard Jones.

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200
<v 3>This, I'm 98. Next month I'll be 99.</v>

37
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.760
<v 1>Wow. So when she came in to see you,</v>

38
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.710
can you tell me anything about what she was like?

39
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.790
<v 3>Well, she was a uh, uh,</v>

40
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.360
<v 4>okay.</v>

41
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.360
<v 3>You didn't remember anything? No, I really don't. But you remember her tumor,</v>

42
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.210
right? Well, absolutely. I never saw anything like it before or after

43
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.320
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

44
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.220
<v 3>and this doesn't look like a normal tumor. It was,</v>

45
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.060
it was deep purple and about as big as a quarter,

46
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.310
I'm sort of shiny or soft. That was another thing about it on examination,

47
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.910
slightly raised and you touched it, you might think it was a red Jello.

48
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.660
There was something very strange about the way it looked

49
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.060
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

50
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.220
<v 3>so doctors took a sample? Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:48.090
So they would cut off these little teeny tiny pieces of really small bite or two

52
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.070
and they would take a piece,

53
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.280
put it in a tube and one would go to the lab for diagnosis. And in this case,

54
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:53.210
since it was Hopkins,

55
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.990
they would take an extra piece and give it to a man named George Guy

56
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.230
<v 1>to too. So George Guy was a researcher who worked at Hopkins.</v>

57
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.680
He had a deal with the clinic that anytime they got a patient with cervical

58
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.790
cancer, they'd give him a tiny piece of the tumor. What he really wanted to do.

59
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.940
His main mission, actually not just his scientists everywhere,

60
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.050
we're trying to do this.

61
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.140
They wanted to find a way to grow human cells outside of a human being in a

62
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:22.750
dish, in a dish. George Guy had been trying to do this,

63
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.490
working on this for decades and why exactly. Um, it's sort of like,

64
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.100
it's sort of like having a little tiny bit of a person in a,

65
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.910
in a lab that's detached from them so that you can do whatever you want with

66
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.780
them. You know,

67
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.620
you can't bombard some person with a bunch of drugs and just wait to see how

68
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:40.840
much they can tolerate before their cells all explode.

69
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.020
But you can do that in cell culture. So, oh, so this is like,

70
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.930
this is like the basic thing. You need to study human biology.

71
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.880
You need cells in a dish. Yes.

72
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.950
Problem was anytime they tried to grow human cells in a dish,

73
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.990
<v 5>my dog, they would die. Yeah, they die.</v>

74
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.380
<v 1>This is George Guy's former lab assistant. Can you just tell me your name?</v>

75
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:06.870
You know, my name is so and so. My name is Mary.

76
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.360
I'll put my maiden name in there. Oh sure. Toy Cooper cheque.

77
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.690
Mary lives just outside of Baltimore.

78
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.770
About an hour from where she used to work with George guys. This is Dr. Guy.

79
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.810
Show me some pictures and he's sitting at at a microscope we can have, he looks,

80
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.990
he seems like a really big guy, like a really tall guy. He was a big guy.

81
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.780
At least six, five judging from the picture. Yeah, he was.

82
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.320
And in every slide that she showed me, he had kind of a crazy smile on his face.

83
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.230
Like he's got a like he's having a good time. Bear of a man.

84
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:36.570
That's what I always thought. Oh yeah. In any case,

85
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.470
Mary says they were completely stumped at why the human cells always died,

86
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.660
but they just did. Yeah. So on the day that George Guy Walked in,

87
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.470
handed Mary two was a little chunk of a nameless women cervical cancer inside.

88
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.930
I knew nothing about her. No one expected any.

89
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.670
<v 5>No, he was doing that. Well, he probably, yeah, always ever hopeful,</v>

90
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.900
but you know, I was eating lunch and I thought, oh, the heck with it. You know,

91
00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:02.360
it's not going to grow. I'm going to finish the sandwich. Yeah,

92
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.123
and that's what I did

93
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.460
<v 1>three then I went in and she gave the, sell some food,</v>

94
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.830
get my usual turn on all the machines and left,

95
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.890
came back the next day they hadn't died,

96
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.210
so she came back the next day and they were growing and then the next day still

97
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:23.890
growing. They just kept

98
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.880
<v 6>lagging alone in the next drew a lot.</v>

99
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.590
Rebecca says they doubled in size every 24 hours. Yeah. They just grew.

100
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:35.670
All of a sudden, you know, I kept transferring them, making more tubes,

101
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.520
transferring them, making more tubes to transferring.

102
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.370
They weren't very reliable and stronger.

103
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.800
They just kept plugging along and alone. Meanwhile,

104
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:47.120
the woman had spawned all these cells, died right.

105
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.080
Officially she died of uremia,

106
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:52.950
which is a like toxicity of the blood because she wasn't able to get rid of the

107
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:56.790
toxic waste. That usually goes out in your urine log, in the log in the wall,

108
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.060
but herself and to college.

109
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.270
This story is a privilege to introduce Dr. George.

110
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.800
Guy Wasn't long after the George Guy appeared on TV holding in his hand a little

111
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.820
bottle? No. Let me show you a bottle, like an alarm,

112
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.970
which we have grown my fifth quantity of catheter style.

113
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.740
So did you want to look at the photos?

114
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.150
You can't really get a sense of how aggressive this tumor was until you go to

115
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:23.570
the Hopkins Archives and looked at George guy's pictures and videos. Okay,

116
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.680
this is Ken here to heal a cell phone. Then it hits you,

117
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.100
but you're at a large 10,000 times. Oh my God.

118
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.860
Swirling hurricanes of cells.

119
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.240
Tuesday thousands hi Raul.

120
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.690
And some very large together.

121
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.760
Kept transferring them and making more to think them under the mic.

122
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.120
Looks like something is just exploded. They're going to be,

123
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.630
she's getting bigger, bigger and strong. It's indestructable,

124
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.340
it's indescribable. Nothing can stop me.

125
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.190
<v 1>Why? Hers just sort of took off and grew.</v>

126
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:02.840
And the other ones that they had tried before,

127
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:06.890
it didn't is just a little bit of a mystery. Nobody really knows four,

128
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.930
unless George Guy knew what he had.

129
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.450
This new cell line was what they'd all been waiting for. So early on,

130
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.920
right after this woman died,

131
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.290
George Guy sent Mary back down to get more cancer cells from the [inaudible].

132
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.920
<v 5>Oh he sent me down to the morgue. Yeah. Really? Oh yeah.</v>

133
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.780
So I went down there and um, the uh, coroner, I don't know who he was.

134
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.400
Dr God was there too and they were standing down at her feet sort of. Yeah.

135
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.020
Meanwhile, she's like, she's lying out there. She's already open.

136
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.130
I got some samples. Coroner would take them out and getting a, Timmy,

137
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.080
what'd she look like? I couldn't look at her face. I couldn't look at her.

138
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.380
The only thing I looked at were her toes and they had chipped nail Polish on

139
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:56.620
them. And that was really like, oh this is a real person.

140
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.870
What was it about the nail Polish that hit you? Oh cause it was chipped.

141
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.470
Cause you know that she hadn't been able to take care of her nails for a long

142
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:08.180
time if they got shipped like that.

143
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.810
And it's showed that she was proud of herself.

144
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.050
Not everyone wears nail Polish on their toes. Yeah.

145
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.990
<v 1>Over the next several months. Wow.</v>

146
00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:21.240
This woman's body laid decomposing in the ground,

147
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.840
George Guy and Mary produced hundreds of thousands of herself or tumor cells and

148
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.070
he named them the heela strain.

149
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.270
Heela like Hella h e l a [inaudible].

150
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.580
No one would actually know why he had named them that for about two decades.

151
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.870
But what he did with these cells, you know, would be unusual nowadays.

152
00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:42.300
Like if somebody now found a cell that was special,

153
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:46.050
they'd run off to the patent office and then sell it to Merck for 1 billion

154
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.260
bucks. But George Guy, hey, just pass them out freely.

155
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.020
Didn't try and make any money off a nice,

156
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:55.110
nice new thing that could help science Mary,

157
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.420
that George Guy began to send Hilo all over the world. Yep.

158
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.490
And pretty soon she was in hundreds of labs and you know,

159
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.490
this was in the midst of the polio epidemic. Even when polio was at its worst,

160
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.900
we're talking early fifties right? Yeah. So there's 1951 52 you know,

161
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.890
schools are being closed, kids are being kept inside

162
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.680
<v 7>today's cruel disease. Medical science still has no complete onset.</v>

163
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.710
<v 1>There was this enormous effort to develop a polio vaccine.</v>

164
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.180
Problem was in order to develop a vaccine, you had to have enough polio virus,

165
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.580
you know enough quantity to be able to study it in the lab.

166
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.200
And they had no way of making enough. So whether they do, well, one of the guys,

167
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:35.460
that guy, one of the guys that guy had sent the sales to this collaborated,

168
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.070
your friend of guys discovered something kind of amazing,

169
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.070
which was that polio loved the heela sell,

170
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.730
put polio inside a Hilo cell healer would copy and in the process make more

171
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:48.120
polio. So which the Super Xerox cell, no matter what you want to do,

172
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.490
like make a copy, make a copy, make a copy. Yeah.

173
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.420
So now they had a way of making polio either could just be a polio factory.

174
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.400
And so the government made a factory at the Tuskegee Institute. A real one.

175
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:00.870
Literally a factory. So they had

176
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.400
<v 8>these big, you know,</v>

177
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.390
stainless steel of that sort of culture medium that were sort of rotated

178
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.570
constantly autoclaves for sterilizing all their equipment over with five

179
00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:15.640
microscopes, crazy frankensteinish gizmos.

180
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.340
They had this machine,

181
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.280
it was like an automatic cell dispenser and it had this organ,

182
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.810
one mechanical arm in squirt a certain amount of this cultural medium filled

183
00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:30.250
with Hilo selves into it too. Wow. This is like a beauty of industry right here.

184
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.400
Yeah, it is. It absolutely. The cells that were produced at this factory,

185
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:37.110
she says, we used to test the polio vaccine vaccine to rub them.

186
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.180
They'd rather do the, the test that they were doing in Norris.

187
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:44.770
It was the largest field trial ever done at its peak. The

188
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.530
Test Kayla

189
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.480
<v 1>production center was producing about 6 trillion cells a week. Wow. Um,</v>

190
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.600
which is kind of inconceivable,

191
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.730
but that was actually only the beginning says Rebecca,

192
00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:59.780
because this factory led to an even bigger one. It was for profit. Right.

193
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.760
And that second factory was the first time any human biological material was

194
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:08.330
commercialized. So this was the first biotech company? Yeah. Basically. Okay.

195
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.410
When they first started mass producing Hilo,

196
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.830
what sorts of things were done to these sales?

197
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:14.930
What sort of sort of problems were investigated?

198
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.610
Like anything that you can imagine? Yeah,

199
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.370
<v 8>so they infected the Hilo cells with every kind of virus and hepatitis e coin</v>

200
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:28.080
and cephalitis virus, yellow fever, herpes, measles, mumps, rabies, whatever.

201
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.630
Like you, just any, any banks. And this was just,

202
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.710
and it's as a revolution for scientists and research on chemotherapy drugs.

203
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:38.910
He was, cells went up and some of the first space missions. Really? Yeah.

204
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.760
So they were, ula went into space, into space.

205
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:45.540
And every time I hear what I think of it like Beulah in despair,

206
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.271
why?

207
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:52.320
I mean just because the premise was to see what happens to human cells in zero

208
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:54.070
gravity. You know, if we're going to be sending people up

209
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.780
<v 1>into space, what's going to happen to them up there?</v>

210
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.250
So Hilo went up before any humans did. Um, and then she eventually went up his,

211
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:03.160
she the cells there was actually interesting little slip up.

212
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.203
<v 6>Yeah, I know.</v>

213
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:07.401
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:12:07.401 --> 00:12:11.330
So let's actually skip forward in the story to the point where that that slip

215
00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:12.020
up,

216
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.020
you just heard that pronoun confusion gets personal,

217
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.430
you know. Well what happened? Okay,

218
00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:24.350
it's a late sixties and a Hilo has it led to a revolution in science and now

219
00:12:24.351 --> 00:12:25.850
there are hundreds of cell lines,

220
00:12:25.851 --> 00:12:30.170
not just Hilo but hundreds and somewhere along the way scientists discover that

221
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.540
hula is so aggressive that she's actually been contaminating and taking over all

222
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:40.530
of these other cell lines where you just said she, but I get your point and she,

223
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.350
she does it in the way it does it in the strangest way. Cells can,

224
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.050
you know, they can float on dust particles. They can write

225
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.860
<v 6>what they can float on dust particles. Yeah. So they can,</v>

226
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.130
you mean they can hop out of addition, just get on a particle and just float

227
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.850
out the door, the stairs down the hall,

228
00:13:02.851 --> 00:13:05.500
one Hilo Cell into a lab rops into,

229
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.350
into a dish cell culture where there's other cells growing. And because he was

230
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.000
<v 1>cells are sort of powerful cells they take over.</v>

231
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.310
<v 6>So on the heels of this catastrophe, someone at Hopkins decides to make a test.</v>

232
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.830
Let's make a test that will allow us to genetically determine if a cell is heela

233
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.210
or if it is. And to make a long story short, this desire for a genetic test,

234
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.240
lead scientists and then journalists to ask a question, which is

235
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.930
<v 1>amazingly, for 25 years, had not been asked who was this woman?</v>

236
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.660
And that's when we found out her name Henrietta lacks.

237
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.030
<v 8>This is the sound of Rebecca Reading Henrietta's medical records for the first</v>

238
00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:55.864
time.

239
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.690
This is a 30 year old colored woman she's sitting with.

240
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.600
Henry had his youngest daughter, Deborah, 2nd of November.

241
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:08.860
So this is again when she was pregnant with you and Rhiana had five kids when

242
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:12.700
she died at the age of 31 most have no memory of her because they were too

243
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:14.680
young. And that's especially true of Debbie.

244
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.080
<v 9>That was only 15 months old and I don't remember anything about my mother.</v>

245
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.000
<v 1>Yeah. So she, you know, she,</v>

246
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.830
she had spent her entire life just sort of longing to know who her mother was.

247
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.600
And did she like dancing? You know,

248
00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:31.950
I always wanted to know what she liked to do, what she went,

249
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.830
where she liked to eat. Did she breastfeed Debra?

250
00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:37.650
She was really sort of almost fixated on that idea.

251
00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:39.510
She wanted to know if she was breasted.

252
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.340
<v 9>Oh I don't know. You know, I don't know what I would give up just to,</v>

253
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.790
just to have her heads, hey

254
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.970
<v 1>to see her in a whole her.</v>

255
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:55.350
So in 19 three when a scientist calls the lacks family and Deborah hears that

256
00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:00.790
little bits of the mother that she never knew are still alive and oh by the way,

257
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:03.200
can we take a blood test from you and your family?

258
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.110
Cause we're having some contamination problem. We need these genetic markers,

259
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.260
Blah Blah Blah. Well, as you could imagine, tell me about the prize.

260
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.510
It really did. It was really confusing. I mean, how much is the,

261
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.160
how much of a is out there? You know, eventually she went online,

262
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.150
did some searches and found thousands and thousands of hits. Like for instance,

263
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:23.100
on Heela clones. And Debra had heard, you know,

264
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.240
various journalists in the past had come to her and mentioned, you know,

265
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.450
dolly the clone sheep and said, you know your mom,

266
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.070
they did this with your mom too.

267
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.410
Meaning that's actually where the technology started.

268
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.570
The first cells that are cloned were heela cells,

269
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.320
but that was just cloning a cell, not cloning an entire being.

270
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.350
That distinction is very complicated,

271
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.500
particularly for somebody who doesn't know what a cell is. Yeah. So Deborah,

272
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.690
between what journalists had told her and googling Henrietta lacks and clone

273
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.900
thought there were thousands of clones of her mother around. And really,

274
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.380
you mean like a bunch of Henrietta's walking the streets, walking around.

275
00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.230
Rebecca says that one of Deborah's biggest fears was bumping into one of these

276
00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:02.760
clones. She said, you know, she would say,

277
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:05.880
I would have to go talk to her and she wouldn't know that I was her daughter

278
00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:08.640
and, and, and I don't know that I could handle that. Wow.

279
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.110
It sounds so fantastical. Like,

280
00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:12.990
how could someone believe that there are copies of her mother walking around,

281
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.490
but at one point 25 years after their mother died, someone called and said, Hey,

282
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.020
part of her still alive, and you know,

283
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:22.350
we've grown enough of her so that it could wrap around the earth several times.

284
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.790
At that point, all bets are off. Yeah, right, exactly.

285
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.150
<v 6>Not to mention that it's actually not that crazy because your DNA is in your</v>

286
00:16:31.151 --> 00:16:34.900
cells. So if your cells are taken out of you and they still grow,

287
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.360
well, isn't that still you?

288
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.640
<v 10>Hey</v>

289
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.870
<v 6>alive. It's of you, but it's clearly not you and any, it's going on and on.</v>

290
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:47.550
That's, it's a funny middle space, that's for sure. Yeah.

291
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.040
So here's what happened is Rebecca went off in search of Henrietta lacks.

292
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.660
Every so often Deborah would come along and sit with her as they interviewed,

293
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.680
you know, anyone they could find friends, family, and eventually over many,

294
00:17:01.681 --> 00:17:05.460
many years, the picture does emerge

295
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.150
<v 1>of who this woman was. She was born in, in Roanoke,</v>

296
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:16.210
1920 Virginia and I think she was the 10th of the 11 children.

297
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.650
But apparently she was the one that stood out.

298
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.900
Everybody talked about her as just being, you know, she was the cat.

299
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.710
<v 4>Oh my goodness. I don't think I could top her.</v>

300
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.250
<v 1>This is Sadie Sturdivan Henrietta's cousin, right?</v>

301
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.680
<v 4>What's a beautiful girl? I was the for myself, but hint,</v>

302
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.510
it was very pretty name brand. [inaudible].

303
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.900
<v 1>Okay. And this is Henrietta's sister Gladys Knight and complacent.</v>

304
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.290
Everyone that they spoke with zeroed in on the same few points.

305
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.370
Like first she was really meticulous about her nails, always painted them red.

306
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.030
It's very deep. Red. And Henrietta just had this,

307
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.170
she was very strength, forthright, very Sassy,

308
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.220
like herselves. Now the unfortunate thing is that when it comes to her life,

309
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.310
you know how she lived. There's not a ton of detail.

310
00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.813
<v 8>Right? October.</v>

311
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.510
So this is when she first went in with her cancer in that hotel room,

312
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.730
and the two of them were flipping through the medical records.

313
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.620
They did start to get some detail

314
00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.680
about how she died. Things I want to take notes tonight.

315
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.920
Was she in a lot of pain when she died? This was the hardest thing.

316
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.640
She was eventually in an unbelievable amount of pain,

317
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.290
complains of pain in the right lower quadrant, wheeling and,

318
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.570
<v 1>and crying and you know, moaning for the Lord to help her.</v>

319
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:37.690
And according to the records, doctors tried everything. Morphine,

320
00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:40.720
they injected a hundred percent alcohol straight into her spine.

321
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.530
<v 8>Wow. The pain spite of the alcohol injection last week.</v>

322
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.190
And she would have these fits of pain

323
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:48.910
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

324
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.930
<v 2>to spasms where this waves of pain would hit her and she would rise up out of</v>

325
00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:54.310
the bed and thrash around.

326
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.970
So they strapped her to the bed and her sister will,

327
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.180
along with one of her friends,

328
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.511
<v 1>you know,</v>

329
00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:05.240
one of them would tighten the straps and the other one would put a pillow in her

330
00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:07.010
mouth so that she wouldn't bite her tongue

331
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.750
<v 9>if I only just had the chair. So take care of her</v>

332
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.160
<v 1>now dealing with how her mother died was one thing,</v>

333
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.460
but the cells made it more complicated. Whatever of her,

334
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.940
her mother was alive in these cells somehow. So if that's true,

335
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.800
that left very big questions.

336
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.830
And the first of them for Deborah was how can Henrietta rest in peace if part of

337
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:36.470
her with part of her soul is being, you know,

338
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.750
shot up to the moon and injected with all these chemicals and radiated and

339
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:40.584
bombarded.

340
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.330
<v 9>Painful. No one, you know,</v>

341
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.130
they had whole shells on the back of a donkey going to Turkey,

342
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.090
you know, and the airplanes just going all over the world.

343
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.920
Uh, I just don't know.

344
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.740
<v 1>You know, she worried about them. She worried that it hurt her mother.</v>

345
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.740
When you infect the cells with Ebola,

346
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.180
does somehow her mother feel the pain that comes with Ebola and had a scientist

347
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.260
that were like sat down with her?

348
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.050
I mean just explained to her like this is no, never,

349
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.490
nothing cause it spread.

350
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.950
It just strikes me that it wouldn't be that hard to explain it.

351
00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.960
Like when you take cells out of a body,

352
00:20:19.961 --> 00:20:23.320
it's kind of like when you cut your fingernail off, it just doesn't,

353
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.140
but your fingernail doesn't keep growing and living after you cut it off.

354
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.580
It's a, it's really hard.

355
00:20:27.581 --> 00:20:31.450
There is no other example of some way that you can take something from someone's

356
00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:36.451
body and have it keep living and not have a person feel it and all these worries

357
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.690
says her Baga began to build and Deborah's mind and build and build

358
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.570
<v 8>there came at this point. So we were at her cousin's house,</v>

359
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.010
this her cousin Gary,

360
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.180
she was broken out in hives and she was telling him all the stuff that she'd

361
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:54.980
recently learned. You can almost hear it on the tape. She says to him,

362
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.780
<v 12>the one of the there,</v>

363
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.400
<v 8>she can't carry the burden of these cells anymore if she can't</v>

364
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.060
<v 12>do it, I don't want to. [inaudible]</v>

365
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.900
<v 8>and I had been sort of trying to talk her down and he was trying to talk her</v>

366
00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:07.734
down

367
00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:08.780
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

368
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.510
<v 8>and then just out of nowhere, he just started</v>

369
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.563
singing

370
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.393
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.343
<v 12>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

372
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.203
<v 13>Ooh.</v>

373
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.160
<v 12>[inaudible]. I know those [inaudible]</v>

374
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.860
<v 8>and he started preaching thing that came that he held her head in his hands</v>

375
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.400
<v 4>and we come to you tonight,</v>

376
00:21:43.401 --> 00:21:48.401
the author and the finish of our faith and we thank you for being awaiting mic.

377
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.480
You made a path in the middle. You're called the Milton's,

378
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.230
the skip Lego rams and [inaudible].

379
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.750
We thank you to that. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.

380
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.590
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus.

381
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.320
<v 14>Hey Man. Hey Man. [inaudible] great.</v>

382
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.240
[inaudible] great.

383
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.630
<v 8>And she just relaxed.</v>

384
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.810
<v 4>He like him, man. I feel like, Huh?</v>

385
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.340
<v 8>She didn't realize it then, but that night Debra was on the verge of a stroke</v>

386
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.660
<v 4>one walk up into the building my wall. Okay.</v>

387
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.300
You mean he said it's just up this hill. Yeah.

388
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.690
<v 8>One of the most striking moments of this story is when the two of them visit</v>

389
00:22:45.691 --> 00:22:48.420
Hopkins, I feel. Yeah, a bit.

390
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.960
And Debra meets her mother's cells for the first time.

391
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.090
<v 4>I should have, I'll show you that Jerome, and I can show you that sound okay.</v>

392
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.160
<v 8>Because the scientists had finally contacted her. Christoph Lingara,</v>

393
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:02.950
the scientist who invited us into his lab to see the cells.

394
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.380
He had projected them onto a screen

395
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.790
<v 13>bit confused. They look green here. Okay.</v>

396
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.030
<v 8>There's so neon green in this particular,</v>

397
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.500
<v 0>hi, I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

<v 8>I'm Janet. Boom. Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

405
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.820
This is radio lab and our topic today is totally tubers. Yeah, yeah.

406
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.990
<v 1>Well you call it what you want. It doesn't matter.</v>

407
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.670
It doesn't matter because the topic is tumors,

408
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.260
famous tumors and our next and final tumor related Dale is one.

409
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:58.300
I've been wanting to do this particularly tumor story for forever,

410
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.850
for floor like two years ago, I think. Oh, longer than that. Yeah.

411
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.760
It's a story that comes from a friend of mine, Rebecca Skloot.

412
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.000
You want me to talk? Make noise? That's her.

413
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.270
I think we can move me closer to him.

414
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.690
She's a journalist and she has been wanting to tell this story even longer since

415
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:15.170
she was in the womb. I mean, she has been researching the story for 10 years.

416
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.033
Hello? Hello. I know.

417
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.640
And she just wrote a book called the immortal life of Henrietta lacks and in the

418
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:24.050
story, okay, it's about a tumor that expands and never stops.

419
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.340
Begins in 1950,

420
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:30.341
a black woman in Baltimore is in her bathroom and she discovers pretty much all

421
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:34.340
on her own that she has cancer. Um, it's all,

422
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.070
it's a little bit of a mystery how she initially knew this,

423
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:38.600
but she knew it was there.

424
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.190
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

425
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:46.780
<v 3>I not, she called it. She had told that her cousins for a while,</v>

426
00:24:46.781 --> 00:24:50.380
that she thought there was something wrong with her, with her womb,

427
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.390
and she climbed into her bathtub and she slid her fingers up inside of herself

428
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.900
and found this lump chapter one first.

429
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:01.150
She went into her local doctor.

430
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.770
By chance I happened to be an attending at that time.

431
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:09.060
<v 1>The guy she eventually ended up seeing at Johns Hopkins University,</v>

432
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.130
who was this fellow, Dr. Howard Jones,

433
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.640
<v 3>this, I'm 98. Next month I'll be 99.</v>

434
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.160
<v 1>Wow. So when she came in to see you,</v>

435
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.980
can you tell me anything about what she was like, well, shoot.
