00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
 

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.300
What we've got over here is a
triangle where all three sides

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.740
have the same length,
or all three sides

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.000
are congruent to each other.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.470
And a triangle like this
we call equilateral.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.695
This is an equilateral triangle.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.700
 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.840
Now what I want to do is prove
that if all three sides are

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.110
the same, then we know
that all three angles are

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.070
going to have the same measure.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.916
So let's think how
we can do this.

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:31.290
Well, first of
all, we could just

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.374
look at-- we know that
AB is equal to AC.

00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:36.040
So let's just pretend
that we don't even

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.080
know that this also
happens to be equal to BC.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.700
And we know for
isosceles triangles,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.790
if two legs have
the same length,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.090
then the base angles
have the same length.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.250
So let's write this down.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.260
We know that angle ABC is going
to be congruent to angle ACD.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.630
So let me write this down.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.120
We know angle ABC is
congruent to angle ACB.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.490
 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.690
So maybe this is my
statement right over here.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.800
 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.207
And then we have reason.

00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:17.790
And the reason here,
and I'll write it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.060
in just kind of shorthand, is
that they're base angles of,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.540
I guess you could
say an isosceles.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.620
Because we know that this
side is equal to that side.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.203
And obviously, this
is an equilateral.

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:27.460
All of the sides are equal.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.609
But the fact that these
two legs are equal so

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:30.900
that the base angles are equal.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.510
So we say two legs equal
imply base angles are

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.515
going to be equal.

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:43.140
And that just comes from what we
actually did in the last video

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.069
with isosceles triangles.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.110
But we can also view this
triangle the other way.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.790
We could also say that
maybe this angle over here

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.800
is the vertex angle, and maybe
these two are the base angles.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.220
Because then you
have a situation

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.800
where this side and this side
are congruent to each other.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.450
And then that angle
and that angle

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.680
are going to the base angles.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.680
So you could say
angle CAB is going

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:22.310
to be congruent to angle ABC,
really for the same reason.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.480
We're now looking at different
legs here and different base

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.980
angles.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.430
This would now be the
base in this example.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.870
You can imagine turning an
isosceles triangle on its side.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.362
But it's the exact same logic.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.070
So let's just review
what I talked about.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.920
These two sides are
equal, which imply

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920
these two base angles are equal.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.890
These two sides
being equal implied

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.090
these two base angles are equal.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.820
Well, if ABC is congruent to
ACD and is congruent to CAB,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.620
then all of these angles
are congruent to each other.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.560
So then we get angle ABC is
congruent to angle ACB, which

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.860
is congruent to angle CAB.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.415
And that pretty much gives
us all of the angles.

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:09.040
So if you have an
equilateral triangle,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.680
it's actually an equiangular
triangle as well.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.750
All of the angles are
going to be the same.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.080
And you actually know
what that measure is.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.913
If you have three things
that are the same--

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:20.840
so let's call that x, x,
x-- and they add up to 180,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.660
you get x plus x plus x is equal
to 180, or 3x is equal to 180.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.880
Divide both sides by 3, you
get x is equal to 60 degrees.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.870
So in an equilateral
triangle, not only

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.190
are they all the same
angles, but they're all

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.104
equal to exactly-- they're
all 60 degree angles.

00:03:44.104 --> 00:03:46.020
Now let's think about
it the other way around.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.080
Let's say I have a triangle.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.960
Let's say we've got
ourselves a triangle where

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.920
all of the angles are the same.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.010
So let's say that's point
X, point Y, and point Z.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.180
And we know that all
the angles are the same.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.100
So we know that this angle
is congruent to this angle

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.150
is congruent to that angle.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.240
So what we showed in the last
video on isosceles triangles

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.790
is that if two base
angles are the same,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.459
then the corresponding legs
are also going to be the same.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.529
So we know, for example,
that YX is congruent to YZ.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:28.990
 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.105
And we know that because the
base angles are congruent.

00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:39.760
 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.310
Now we also know that
YZ-- so I'll rewrite YZ--

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:57.237
is congruent to XZ,
by the same argument.

00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.320
But here we're dealing
with different base angles.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.861
So now, once again,
you can view this

00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:03.470
as almost an isosceles
triangle turned on its side.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.300
This is the vertex
angle right over here.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.560
These are the two base angles.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.980
This would be the base now.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.590
And we know that because these
two base angles are congruent.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.430
So by the same logic.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.070
Over in this first
case, the base angles

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.940
were this angle and that angle.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.930
In the second case,
the base angles

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.490
are that angle and that angle.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.020
And actually let
me write it down.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.780
The base angles in
this first case--

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.590
let me do that
same magenta-- are

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:38.130
angle YXZ is congruent
to angle YZX.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.075
 

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:42.200
That was in the first case.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.480
These are the base angles.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.070
So based on the proof we
saw in the last video,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.120
that implies these
sides are congruent.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.100
Here, we have these
two base angles.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.730
Let me do that in green.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:01.510
Angle XYZ is congruent
to angle YXZ.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.410
 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.010
And so that implies that
these two guys right over here

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.020
are congruent.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.220
Well, there we've proved it.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.090
We've said that this side
YX is congruent to YZ.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.190
And we've shown that
YZ is congruent to XZ.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.750
So all of the sides are
congruent to each other.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.750
So once again, if you
have all the angles equal,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.541
and they're going to
have to be 60 degrees,

00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:24.430
then you know that
all of the sides

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.710
are going to be equal as well.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.456
They're going to be congruent.

00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:28.956
