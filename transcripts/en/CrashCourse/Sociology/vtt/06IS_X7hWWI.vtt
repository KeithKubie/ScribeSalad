00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
As we noted last week, an armed robber
and a pacifist have something in common:

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.620
They're both social deviants.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.340
But they're obviously also really different.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.920
It's hard to imagine that some people resort
to armed robbery for some of the same reasons
that other people reject violence.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.300
That’s why there are many different theories of deviance that can give us some perspective on how and why both the armed robber and the pacifist become deviant.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.200
Through sociology, we can explore how the
deviance of these two very different people
relates to society at large.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:39.440
[Theme Music]

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.300
To understand where deviance comes
from, we have to go back to the three major
sociological paradigms.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.560
And, as you might expect, structural functionalism,
symbolic interactionism, and conflict theories each
offer a different perspective on the matter.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.040
Way back in episode 5, we touched on Emile
Durkheim’s structural-functionalist approach
to deviance.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.040
His basic insight was that, since deviance
is found in every society, it must serve some
function.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.100
And Durkheim argued that deviance serves four
functions in particular:

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.060
First, he said, deviance helps define cultural
values and norms.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.640
Basically, we can only know what’s good
by also understanding what’s not good.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.080
He also argued that society's response to
deviance clarifies moral boundaries.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.620
This means that when society reacts to
deviance, it’s drawing a line,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.480
saying that when behaviors cross a certain
moral threshold, they can be sanctioned, either
formally or informally.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.000
So this can range from a bank robber being
sent to jail, to someone being made fun of
for the way they dress.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.360
Durkheim also said that these reactions bring
society together.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.360
By reacting in similar ways to something that
seems not-normative, we’re basically affirming to each
other that we’re an “us,” and the deviants are “them.”

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.170
And this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.800
In the more serious instances of deviance
– like, school shootings, for example –

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.500
you see people uniting around that moral boundary
that’s been breached, and supporting each other.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.200
The spontaneous outpourings of outrage, grief, and
charity that you see in response to school shootings
are all examples of this pattern in action.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.300
And finally, Durkheim pointed out that deviance
can actually encourage social change.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.100
We talked in episode 5 about Rosa Parks’ civil
disobedience, which was by definition deviant,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.780
and it was a factor setting off major
changes in American society, in the form
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.680
Now, while deviance might be necessary, some
societies can have more or less of it than others.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.670
To help explain the difference, American sociologist
Robert Merton proposed, in the 1930s and ‘40s,
what he called strain theory.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.540
Merton argued that the amount of deviance in a
society depends on whether that society has provided
sufficient means to achieve culturally defined goals.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.340
In the US, financial success is one of the
strongest culturally defined goals.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.300
And the means of achieving it include things
like getting an education.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.080
So what we call “the American Dream” – the
idea of working hard to achieve financial stability –

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.100
is a prime example of what Merton called
conformity: achieving culturally set goals by
way of conventionally approved means.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.760
Go to school, get good grades, graduate, get
a good job. Work hard. Get rich. Success.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.480
Right? Well, of course, even if wealth is your goal,
this approach isn't an option for a lot of people.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.140
Many who are raised in poverty, for instance,
lack a realistic path to prosperity.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.830
And if you don’t have access to the means – like
money for an education or good-paying job
opportunities – then the goal will be elusive, too.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.300
So one response to the lack of acceptable
means is to use unacceptable means – that
is, deviant ones.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.520
Merton called this innovation, but here,
innovation means something a little different
from what you’re used to.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.800
Merton used it to describe deviant solutions
that people come up with to reach their goals.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.610
In this case, it could include everything
from petty thievery to organized crime.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.700
The goal is still financial success, but the
illegitimate means used to get there make it deviant.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.740
Now, you might also respond in the opposite
way, by giving up on the goal – in this case,
economic success –

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.810
and instead committing
totally to following the rules.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.340
You might decide that you may never be rich,
but at least you’re not going to be deviant.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.720
Merton called this ritualism, a deep devotion
to the rules because they are the rules.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.060
Of course, your other option is to reject
the whole system altogether – the means,
the goals, all of it.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.000
In this kind of response, which Merton labeled
retreatism, a person basically “drops out” of society,
rejecting both the conventional means and goals.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.100
Merton classed drug addicts and alcoholics in
this group, because he saw these addictions as a way
of escaping the pressures of the goals and means.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.120
But rejection can also be constructive:

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.080
Rebellion is a rejection of goals and means, but in
the context of a counterculture – one that supports the
pursuit of new goals according to new means.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.680
The artist who doesn’t want financial
success, but instead pursues recognition from
their peers is an example of this.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.860
So the structural functionalist perspective
on deviance provides some useful ways of thinking
about how deviance works on a macro scale.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.640
But it works on the assumption that everyone
who does deviant things will be treated as deviant.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.320
The other paradigms of sociology call
this into question:

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.560
They point out that social status impacts
how deviance is punished.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.300
Or whether it’s punished at all.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.440
For example, a symbolic interactionist understands
deviance through what’s known as labeling theory –

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.740
the idea that things like deviance
and conformity are not so much a matter of
what you do, but how people label it.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.020
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to see how
labels can make a deviant.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.860
Imagine a student skipping school.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.490
This is an example of primary, or minor, deviance.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.150
On its own, the transgression isn’t going
to affect the student’s self-concept.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.080
That is, it’s not going to cause her to
think of herself, or label herself, as a deviant.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.360
And if she’s an otherwise good student,
then her teacher might just write it off as
a one time thing,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.940
and the fact that she cut classes would just
remain a minor, primary deviance.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.460
But if the teacher responds more strongly, and
punishes her, then that same infraction of the rules
can escalate into secondary deviance.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.000
In this case, a strong sanction could make
the student start to think of herself as a truant.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.900
And this can lead to what Erving Goffman
called a stigma:

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.540
a powerfully negative sort of master status
that affects a person’s self-concept, social identity,
and interactions with others.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.200
One of the most powerful effects of stigma
is that it leads to more labeling, especially of
what a person has done, or might still do.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.880
For example, a stigmatized student could be
the subject of retrospective labeling,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.820
where her past is reinterpreted, so that
she’s suddenly understood as having always
been irresponsible.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.320
Likewise, she could be subjected to prospective
labeling, which looks forward in time, predicting
her future behavior based on her stigma.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.440
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.360
As you can see, the whole process of labeling
can be extremely consequential.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.599
And it affects not only how we think of ourselves,
but also who responds to deviance, as well

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.240
as how they respond, and how the deviant person
is understood in society.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.800
Drug abuse, for instance, has largely been
understood as a moral failing.

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:12.749
But it’s increasingly being seen as an illness.

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:17.220
And as that perception has changed, so too
have the people who respond to drug abuse.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.560
Instead of just being a job for law enforcement,
today, instances of drug abuse often involve
both police and medical professionals.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.380
And instead of getting jail time, in some
places, violators are given medical and
psychological treatment.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.880
In other words, how people respond is beginning
to change.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.240
And finally, instead of being judged as
personally culpable for some moral failing,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.380
addicts are increasingly seen as suffering from
a disease, freeing them, in part, from some degree of
personal responsibility for their behaviors.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.140
So the very way in which they’re understood
is also evolving.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.880
There are a couple other symbolic interactionist
approaches to deviance that don’t focus
on the power of labels.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.620
Differential association, for example, argues
that who you associate with makes deviance
more or less likely.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.780
And control theory focuses on a person’s
self-control as a way of avoiding deviance,

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:04.559
as well as their ability to anticipate and
avoid the consequences of their actions.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.120
All of these symbolic interactionist approaches
highlight the interpersonal responses to deviance.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.640
But a Conflict Theory approach links deviance
to social power.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.300
If we look at society, we find that the socially
deviant are not necessarily the most dangerous.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.560
Rather, a conflict-theory perspective points
out that they are often the most powerless.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.160
Conflict theory can explain why this is so
in a few different ways:

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.880
For one thing, conflict theory posits that
norms and laws reflect the interests of the
powerful.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.660
So the powerful can defend their power by
labeling as deviant anything that threatens
that power.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:40.000
For instance, in capitalist societies, deviant
labels are often applied to those who interfere
with the way capitalism functions.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.900
And since capitalism is based on the private
control of wealth, stealing is clearly labeled
as deviant.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.000
But there are also different rules for when
the rich target the poor:

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.440
Petty thieves are treated as deviant in a way
that corporate criminals are not, even though
they both steal from other people.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.760
An employee taking goods out of the backroom is
hauled in by the police, while the boss who withholds
overtime pay often doesn’t even pay a fine.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.520
And this is the case, according to conflict theory,
because the powerful are able to defend themselves
against labels of deviance,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.680
so deviant actions are less likely to lead to a
deviant label and thus reactions to that deviance.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.220
Finally, conflict theory points out that norms
have an inherently political nature,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.700
but the politics tend to be masked by the
general belief that if something is normative,
it must be right and good.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:26.420
So while we may take issue with how a law
is applied, we much more rarely ask whether
the laws themselves are just or not.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.860
Conflict theorists see these explanations
at work wherever the inequality of social
power can be found –

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.400
across gender, among races, and between
groups of different socioeconomic status.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.800
Ultimately, structural functionalism, symbolic
interactionism, and conflict theory all give
us useful tools for understanding deviance.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.800
Each of these paradigms is powerful, and we'll
be making use of all three next week, when
we look specifically at crime.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.280
Today we learned about how the three major
paradigms in sociology approach deviance.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.620
We talked about structural functionalism and
how deviance can fulfill a function in society.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.960
Then we turned to symbolic interactionism
and looked at how deviance is constructed.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:04.030
Finally, we discussed conflict theory and
how deviance is connected to power and inequality.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:10.680
