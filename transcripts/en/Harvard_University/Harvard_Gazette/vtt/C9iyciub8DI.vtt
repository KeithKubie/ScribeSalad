00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.690
When you find yourselves alongside

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.110
our sailors and soldiers in the battle

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.240
fields and combat of 1943 and 1944,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.939
you will feel that we are your worthy

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.670
brothers in arms and you will know that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.029
we shall never die nor weaken, but march

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.580
with you into any quarter of the world

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.790
that may be necessary to establish the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.980
reign of justice and the law among men.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.079
We do not need scholars or politicians

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.840
like Lord John Russell of whom Queen

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.210
Victoria remarked, he would be a better

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.760
man if he knew a third subject, but he

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.140
was interested in nothing but the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.070
constitution of 1688 and himself. What we

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.199
need are men who can ride easily over

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.690
broad fields of knowledge and recognize

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.050
the mutual dependence of our two worlds.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.449
"Don't teach my boy poetry," an English

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.220
mother recently wrote the Provost of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.189
Herald. "Don't teach my boy poetry, he's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.470
going to stand for Parliament. " Well

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.119
perhaps she was right, but if more

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.850
politicians knew poetry and more poets

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.100
knew politics, I am convinced the world

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.720
would be a little place in which to live

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.720
on this Commencement Day of 1956.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
I have no gold and silver to give to the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.460
American people, but I give my sisters

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.150
and I hope together with them, you will

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.020
go in search, like Mary, go in haste to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.009
find the poor and if you find them, if

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.380
you come to know them, you will love them.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.040
And if you love them, you will do something

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.260
for them. The poor you may have right

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.470
in to your own family.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.040
I learned a lot here at Harvard about new

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.430
ideas and economics and politics. I got

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.340
great exposure to the advances we made in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.820
the sciences, but humanity's greatest

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.630
advances are not in its discoveries, but in

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.540
how those discoveries are applied to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.850
reduce inequity, whether through

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.750
democracy, strong public education,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.860
quality health care, our broad economic opportunity,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.160
reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.280
If you choose to use your

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.360
status and influence to raise your voice

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.520
on behalf of those who have no voice, if

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.730
you choose to identify not only with the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.490
powerful but with the powerless, if you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.800
retain the ability to imagine yourself

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.510
into the lives of those who do not have

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.270
your advantages, then it will not only be

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.370
your proud families who celebrate your

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.370
existence, but thousands and millions of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.680
people whose reality you have helped

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.310
change. We do not need magic to transform

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.860
our world. We carry all the power we need

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.590
inside ourselves already, we have the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.440
power to imagine better.
