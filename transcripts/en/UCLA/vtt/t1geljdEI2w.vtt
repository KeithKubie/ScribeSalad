00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.501
We have to believe

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.753
that we can be better.

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:03.879
To help people understand

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.422
their full potential.

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:06.798
It's something in me

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.926
that I canâ€™t, turn it off.

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:09.843
Why did I start this

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.261
in the first place?

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.930
I think it's passion,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.972
empathy.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.140
The belief that

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.891
we'll make the world

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:16.975
a better place.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:18.602
That I have a role,

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:20.312
and that everyone has a role.

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:21.522
Having that hope,

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.439
is really what

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.024
keeps people going.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:24.900
I believe that everybody's

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.568
given a gift,

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.653
but it's just up to us

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:29.488
to decide how we want to use it.

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:30.656
Building the strengths

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.616
that make the problems obsolete.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:33.116
You've got to do

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.952
everything within your power now

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:36.370
to be the best you.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.371
You have to look,

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.373
you know, beyond yourself.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:40.040
You can never let

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.668
your circumstances define you,

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:43.293
make sure they

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:44.670
always inform you.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.380
We fail all the time.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.089
Biggest thing is

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.674
to try to get back up,

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:49.800
and once you're up,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.884
to keep going.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:51.843
We define ourselves

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:52.511
in our own words

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.679
and our own ways.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.681
That's optimism.
