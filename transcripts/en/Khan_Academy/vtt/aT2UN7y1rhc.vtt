00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
Arthur wanted to investigate how
the amount of exercise he does

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.990
affects his weight.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.050
Each week he recorded
the number of hours

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.420
he exercised during the
past week and the change

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.440
in his weight during that week.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.370
Positive number means
he gained weight.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.590
Negative number or negative
means he lost weight.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.420
Suppose Arthur wants to create
a scatter plot according

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.210
to the data presented below.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.180
Complete the sentences below.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.590
The amount of exercise
should go on the-- well,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.570
we want to put the driving
variable on the horizontal axis

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.790
and the dependent variable
on the vertical axis.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.550
So the amount of
exercise is what drives

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.440
or what in theory drives his
weight gain or weight loss.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.690
So we would want to put the
exercise, the thing that's

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.080
driving the other
variable or that

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.580
might be driving
the other variable,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.200
that we want to investigate
whether it's driving

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.616
the other variable,
we want to put

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:59.130
that on the horizontal axis.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.690
The range of that axis
should be from-- well,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.800
we just have to see what's
his range of exercise

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.720
over this investigation
he's doing?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.590
So let's see.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.760
His largest amount of exercise
that he performs in hours

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.390
is, let's see,
there's an 8.9 here.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.340
That looks like the largest
amount of exercise he performs.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.010
And what's the least, the
smallest amount of exercise

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.260
he performs?

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.290
Looks like it's 0.3 is the
smallest amount of exercise.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.666
And so we would want
it to be from 0.3,

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:39.175
or I guess we could go from
0 all the way to-- well,

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:41.800
8 won't be good enough, because
we have a couple of data points

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.020
that are at 8-- 8.4, 8.9.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.710
We need to go all the way to 10.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.200
We definitely don't
have to go negative,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.520
because there's no negative
amount of exercise here.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.010
So 0 to 10 should be sufficient.
