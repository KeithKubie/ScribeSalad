Remember how much fun it was to run around
the playground after school even though you

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.490
knew you should probably go meet your waiting
mother?

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.099
Yeah, that playtime might have turned you
into a pretty good human.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.359
Hey guys, Amy here with you on DNews today
talking about everyone’s favourite thing:

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.689
not working!

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.669
Playing is actually crucial in childhood development,
giving kids a safe and fun way to learn the

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.650
physical, intellectual, and social skills
that will ultimately turn them into well-rounded

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.650
adults.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.700
One common type of play is fear-based play;
think climbing trees where the danger is falling

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.039
and getting hurt.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.829
Kids will typically start with a low tree
and gradually climb higher, taking risks in

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.460
moderation and at their own pace.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.300
It’s a way for kids to explore fear safely.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.410
They learn to manage their emotions and understand
that they can control their fear, fear doesn’t

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.840
control them; something any adult would do
well to remember.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.120
Mock fighting similarly allows kids to develop
emotional depth.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.760
Play arguing with a best friend will teach
kids to know when they need to walk away for

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.850
self-protection or calm down and solve the
issue.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.300
Even playing out fantastical scenarios like
running from an imaginary witch through an

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.700
imaginary forest has benefits.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.932
Playing through scenarios that evoke fear,
anger, and sadness all help kids learn to

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:11.620
deal with these emotions.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.631
In older children, play allows kids to blow
off steam and recharge their brains, which

00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:19.190
means recess is actually an important part
of the school day.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.740
One 2006 study found that kids who have recess
breaks lasting 10 to 20 minutes were able

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.750
to focus better afterwards and were ultimately
more successful in academics.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.660
And the benefits of play don’t disappear
when we reach adulthood; think drawing, a

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.930
hanging out at the beach… basically anything
that you enjoy that distances you from sources

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.190
of stress.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.710
Research shows that unstructured play is a
vital break from life’s daily stresses.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.320
Playing relieves stress, boosts creativity,
improves brain function, and can even improve

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.660
our relationships with peers by building stronger
bonds of trust, meaning those horrible icebreakers

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.490
you play on office retreats are actually kinda
useful.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.950
Play, non-sexual in this case, can also help
couples rekindle a romance, allowing them

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.040
to explore new levels of emotional intimacy.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.030
So a lot of this sounds anecdotal, but there
is research backing up these claims.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.440
Granted, experiments have been done on rats
and monkeys because there isn’t really a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.280
humane way to measure the effects of play
deprivation on humans.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.049
One 1964 study published in the Journal of
Comparative Neurology saw a group of neuroscientists

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.000
raise rats in two different settings: one
group in solitary confinement and the other

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.540
in an exciting space filled with toys.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.090
When the researchers examined the rats’
brains, they found that those raised in the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.760
toy-filled space had thicker cerebral cortices,
the outer layer of neural tissue responsible

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.299
for memory, attention, perception, awareness,
thought, language, and consciousness.

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.239
Subsequent research confirmed that the rats
raised in the stimulating environment had

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.489
bigger brains.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.319
More recent research found that after bouts
of rough-and-tumble play, rats show increased

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.790
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
a protein that is essential for the growth

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.430
and maintenance of brain cells.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.799
And that same protein has been found to increase
when rats are free to explore their surroundings.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.120
So playing is great!

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.299
But according to Boston College psychology
professor Peter Gray, free play time is becoming

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.390
a thing of the past.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.849
In an article in the American Journal of Play,
he said that since 1955, children’s free

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.629
play time has been steadily declining, in
large part because adults are exercising increased

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.269
control over their kids.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.180
The effect is that mental health in adolescents
and adults is declining.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.450
So do what you can for your brain and start
playing now!

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.219
And it’s a great time, too!

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.749
After a ten-year wait, the all-new Toyota
Tacoma is finally here, and it’s been fully

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.760
redesigned to play whenever and wherever you
want.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.670
The new Tacoma encourages you to break the
rules and play now.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.310
I feel a lot less guilty about my Spice Girls
dance breaks now.
