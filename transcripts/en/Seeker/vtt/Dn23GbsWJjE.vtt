00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.130
You smell that?

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.529
That’s the Universe, son.

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:07.880
I love the smell of the Universe in the morning.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.790
Hello everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.699
Space is awe inspiring, and whether you’re
looking at high resolution photos of Andromeda

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.900
from Hubble or just staring at the night sky
through your window, it’s a feast for the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.900
eyes.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.649
But Have You Ever Wondered What The Universe
Smelled Like?

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.679
It’s a very Jaden Smith question, but a
valid one nonetheless.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.270
Well fortunately for us we have sent people
into space equipped with the latest in nose

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.610
technology and they’ve told us what space
smells like.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.970
Now obviously they’re not smelling space
while they’re in the middle of spacewalks

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.990
because in order to smell, chemicals would
have to reach the olfactory sensory neurons

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.500
inside their nose.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.320
If they’re smelling the universe from inside
their suit, that means space is getting in

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.180
and that’s kind of the opposite of what
the suit was designed for.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.690
But when they get back inside the airlock
and take their helmets off, the star stank

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.530
clings to their suits, and there have been
a couple different comparisons depending on

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.530
who you ask.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.820
NASA’s Kevin Ford said his space walk smelled
like nothing he’s smelled before, but he’ll

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.820
never forget it.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.409
Don Pettit, an astronaut aboard the ISS, was
a little more descriptive and described it

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.299
as a sweet, pleasant metallic smell, and it
reminded him of his summers spent welding.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.859
Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency
says it’s like a mix of walnuts and the

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.149
brake pads of his motorbike.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.340
He also described it as a pile of wet clothes
after a day in the snow, which sounds drastically

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.060
different from his other description.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.329
And space tourist Anousheh Ansari said the
smell reminded her of burnt almond cookies.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.539
Apparently space odor is the most nostalgia-inducing
thing ever.

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.009
So what makes space inter-smeller?

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.030
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.750
They’re rings of hydrogen and carbon that
are abundant in the universe and they’re

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.810
associated with new stars.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.149
They form easily, can be found on comets and
meteorites, are abundant in burned steak,

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.959
and they give some nebula their red hue.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.560
It’s estimated 20% of the carbon in the
universe is tied up in polycyclic aromatic

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.829
hydrocarbons, and it’s possible they were
the seed for life as we know it.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:57.939
Pretty crazy, right?

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.290
Of course if you go elsewhere there may be
different smelly smells that smell smelly.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.600
Like on the moon, for example.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.950
Buzz Aldrin compared the smell of moon dust
to slightly damp ashes in a fireplace, and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.890
fellow Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmitt described
it as spent gunpowder.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.220
And based on the spectrums we’ve analyzed
from the center of our galaxy, the dust cloud

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.450
Sagittarius B2 is silly with ethyl formate,
meaning it smells like rum.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.690
To me this is only further evidence of space
pirates.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.860
Like I said you wouldn’t want to smell space
by floating around in it unprotected because

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.170
of your imminent death, but it wouldn’t
be as quick or horrible as you might think.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.740
Trace covers that down here.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.630
So, any other off-beat questions about space
you want us to cover?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.450
Let us know in the comments or find me on
twitter @JHug00 and I’ll see you next time

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.450
on DNews.
