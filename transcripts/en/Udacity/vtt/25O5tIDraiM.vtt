00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.870
Okay, let's try one last interesting pedigree before wrapping

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.400
up here. We're going to turn our focus to the sometimes

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.320
ignored mitochondrial DNA and look at an inheritance pattern

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.240
that's referred to as maternal inheritance. And it's maternal because

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.150
it's inherited via the mitochondrial DNA. So based on

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.330
just that information alone, I want to see if you

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.840
can tell me, which children would be affected. All of

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.760
these with the question marks here, I haven't told you,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.300
if they're going to be affected or not. Based

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.980
on all the information you see here, and knowing that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.740
this is a maternal inheritance pattern, I want you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.415
to check the boxes for which children would be affected.
