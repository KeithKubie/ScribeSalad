00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
the Federal Reserve's borrowing facility
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910
the Federal Reserve's borrowing facility

inflation in the current situation and
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.360
inflation in the current situation and
so I think the Fed's monetary policy is

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370

needs to happen is that there needs to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
needs to happen is that there needs to
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.480

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640
that needs a little bit of rethinking
and I think the next president will take

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650
and I think the next president will take
 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.410
and I think the next president will take
that seriously will have to take that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
that seriously will have to take that
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.000
that seriously will have to take that
seriously whoever that that is
