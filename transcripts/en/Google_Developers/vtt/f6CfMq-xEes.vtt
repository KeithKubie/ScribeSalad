TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.200
and this would be an episode
of The Developer show,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.910
but I'm on vacation.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.670
However, when I was in
Tokyo, I spent some time

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.190
at Cloud Next,
in-person, checking out

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.290
everything that was
happening on the ground

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.340
so that you could get
a peek at that as well.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.370
Let's check some of that out.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.179
This is Cloud Next, Tokyo.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.970
I'm here to show you
around the conference,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.090
so let's go check it out.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.930
I'm here with Caz at
the Thing Translator.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.680
Caz, what's a thing translator?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.030
SPEAKER: Yeah, Thing
Translator is a web application

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.189
[INAUDIBLE] mobile boss.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:52.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's a web app.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.120
SPEAKER: Yeah, it's a web app.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.695
SPEAKER: So it's so simple.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:55.750
So anybody can build it.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.090
And you can press a button
to take a picture like this.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.030
So now it's sending the--

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.100
SPEAKER: --the word or
describes the object,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.750
as well as the
translation to Japanese.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, so this
is Japanese for flower.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.840
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.440
And just so you can
notice that there

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.710
are some other [INAUDIBLE]
so a couple things,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.664
like flower, plant, flower.

00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:17.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I see.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.180
SPEAKER: Very accurate system.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome!

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.791
What are some other things
that we can translate?

00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:25.530
SPEAKER: Yeah, I can try you.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.210
- [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Clothing.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.210
SPEAKER: That's true.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
am wearing clothing.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.420
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is true.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.791
What about can we
try the ceiling?

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:32.290
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:36.215
- [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Ceiling.

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:37.200
SPEAKER: Ceiling.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.784
Yes, it works.

00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:38.991
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's great.

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:40.500
Now, what tech is this built on?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170
SPEAKER: So this is
a web application,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.910
and behind the scenes there is a
back end that takes the picture

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.660
and sends the
pictures to the vision

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.680
API, this using a machine
learning APIs we provide.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.742
So that has the
vision recognition--

00:01:53.742 --> 00:01:56.910
the image recognition engine is
based on a deep learning model.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.970
So that's how it works.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.928
Thank you so much, Caz.

00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:01.860
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.312
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And that's
