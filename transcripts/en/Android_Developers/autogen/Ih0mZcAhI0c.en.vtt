00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.320
 Welcome and welcome to this video where 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.640
 We will show you all the exciting new features 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.540
 In Google Play Services 4.3. 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.400
 If you are new to Google Play services 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.690
 You've come to the right place because Google Play services 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.030
 Amazing. 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.650
 But if you are a software developer, this is great news for you 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.160
 Because you will get the latest 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.010
 The amazing things we create here at Google. 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.430
 And will integrate them into your applications. 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.860
 Let's take a look at the key features of this release. 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.110
 First, we'll show you the new Address API interface, 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.560
 Then we'll look at some of the great new features 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.740
 For Google Play game services. 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.740
 We'll also describe the Analytics and Google Tag interfaces 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.050
 Manager API are two new additions to services 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.390
 Google Play. 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.910
 We will end this video with a view 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.970
 New things in the Google Drive Android API. 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.780
 Let us start. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.020
 Ladies and Gentlemen, Here's the new API interface. 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.775
 Welcome to the Address API interface with warm applause. 

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:02.150
 Go back to work. 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.090
 Okay Sir. 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.560
 How many of you tried to buy something 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.420
 Online through his smartphone 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.990
 Then he reached the part where he must 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.310
 Write the delivery address. 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.880
 Oooff, an unpleasant experience. 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.580
 Big fingers on small keys. 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.660
 But no doubt, if you want to shipping to your current location 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.590
 You can use the Location API 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.840
 To fill in the title, this makes things easier for you. 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.590
 But what if you are at work 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.481
 You wanted to ship what you bought to your home? 

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:30.980
 Here exactly can interface 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.390
 Address API that is blowing to help you. 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 With this interface, your app can provide a user interface 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.870
 Displays all addresses recorded by the user. 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.760
 The user can then select an address 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.620
 Such as (John Smith) in the example shown in the picture, 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.900
 And so on. 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.080
 The address will be available for the great bike shop 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.620
 To complete the purchase. 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.780
 Time will no longer be wasted because of the large fingers and small keys. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.370
 Is not that great? 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.930
 Shopping with your smartphone is like taking a walk 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.220
 Thanks to Google Play services. 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.030
 Now go to the Google Play Games services. 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.199
 The number of mobile games is now greater than ever. 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.170
 We continue to add new features to this interface. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.820
 Through this release, we launched Game Gifts 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.230
 Which allows players to send virtual requests within the game 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.350
 To anyone in Google+ circles or through the search function 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.350
 About the player. 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.130
 The player can now send Wish Request 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.700
 To request a feature or element within the game of another player. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.530
 The other player can send Gift Request 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.920
 To grant an item, feature, or something, 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.690
 This is both players happy in the end. 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.700
 This feature completes the multiplayer functionality 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.000
 Which were issued earlier and will promote social participation 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.200
 Among the players in your games. 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.400
 One example of using gifts is to ask for more play times 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.630
 From your friend in case your game times are over 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.385
 in the game. 

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:56.255
 Be careful. 

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:59.460
 Use this short video for the LiquidFun Physics Engine. 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.130
 I strongly invite you to see it. 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.140
 There are great things that Google Play services offer, 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.120
 Be sure to use them all in your games. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.010
 Now go to the Google Analytics and Google Tag interfaces 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.845
 Manager API. 

00:03:11.845 --> 00:03:12.470
 [Background music] 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.490
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is true, these two fronts are new. 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.520
 Welcome to Google Analytics and Google Tag 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.535
 Manager API hot applause. 

00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:25.910
 Go back to work. 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.530
 Okay Sir. 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.360
 These two fronts have in fact been presented as independent fronts 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.350
 But now fully integrated into the API interface series 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.310
 For Google Play services. 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.370
 This is great because it limits the memory footprint 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.350
 Of your application and these two interfaces can be used side-by-side 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.610
 With all other interfaces making them ready 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.760
 For use in creating this wonderful app. 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.260
 Let's take a look at the contents of these two faces now. 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.120
 We'll start with the Google Tag Manager interface 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.630
 Which enables you to use tags in your application instead of embedded encoding values. 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.260
 These tags replace the values 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.300
 That you stored in Tag Manager at run time. 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.160
 This can be used for example in background color management 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.480
 Your application, game settings, and translation settings. 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.810
 Because tag values ​​are stored in Tag Manager, 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.510
 This excludes the need to transfer the entire application 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.880
 From Google Play again; 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.160
 You can easily change the tag value in Google Tag 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.060
 Manager. 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.510
 This takes us to the Google Analytics API. 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.930
 If you have not used Google Analytics before, 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.960
 I strongly urge you to try it. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.690
 The Google Analytics interface puts detailed statistics in your hands 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.240
 About how your app is used by your users. 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.560
 For example, the functionality of your application 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.480
 The most frequently used or activity is paid 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.720
 Users to switch from applying ads 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.700
 To a paid application. 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.940
 This knowledge can be very useful 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.730
 In delighting your users 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.320
 And get your next monthly paycheck as well. 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.450
 So do not miss out on the Google Analytics API 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.550
 Because it can provide a lot of valuable information 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.090
 is yours. 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.830
 This takes us to the Google Drive Android API. 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.450
 As you know, Google Drive released the Android API 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.340
 Officially in the latest version of Google Play services 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.210
 This is often a good start 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.740
 With group API interface enhancements. 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.230
 The first of these improvements is the installation. 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.000
 You can now install files that should be 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.760
 Updated locally. 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.190
 This ensures that the application can use these files 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.860
 Even when the user is offline. 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.120
 As well as this, our application folders allow for your application 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.590
 Creates files that the user can no longer see. 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.110
 Such as storing temporary files in a picture editor, 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.860
 This function is similar to a data folder 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.700
 App in the Google Drive API that was used for a short time. 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.090
 In this release, we also have "Changes Notifications" 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.750
 Which allows re-logging 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.970
 And receive a notification when a file or folder is changed. 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.000
 That means you no longer need 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.060
 To query the drive continuously to verify that the data has changed, 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.160
 All you need to do is place a change notice 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.910
 Your API will connect to you when the change occurs. 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.190
 We've also added a number of improvements 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.480
 On metadata information, 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.600
 Something you can not do. 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.020
 In order to meet your potential need for metadata information, 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.010
 You will be happy to know that we are 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.470
 We've added a set of new fields in this version. 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.130
 We've addressed everything in this version of Google Play services 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.480
 But stay in touch because we'll be announcing more. 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.430
 Now it's your turn. 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.650
 Get started and create great apps 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.540
 And do not forget to tell us everything about your experience.
