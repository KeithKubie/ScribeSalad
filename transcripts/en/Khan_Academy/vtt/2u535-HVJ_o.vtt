00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.330
We define the equation
of the plane containing

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.400
the straight line-- They give us
the equation right over here--

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.700
And this plane has to be
perpendicular to the plane

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.040
containing the straight lines.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.590
This thing, right over
here, x/3 is equal to y/4,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.140
is equal to z/2.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.880
And also it has the line x/4 is
equal to y/2, is equal to z/3.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.230
Now just to visualize
this properly,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.522
let me draw the planes.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:29.980
The first plane in
question that we

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.270
need to find the equation
of-- Let me draw it.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.960
So we need to find the
equation of this plane.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.750
And I'm going to try to do
this whole problem using vector

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.840
notation, because
it's easier in my mind

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.150
to manipulate vectors in a way
that you can find perpendicular

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.750
vectors and
equations for planes.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.070
There's other ways that
you could do this problem.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.920
So we've defined the equation
of this plane right here.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.210
We need to find the equation.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.550
Now we know this plane
contains this line,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.650
and this line, if we
look at right over here,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.920
it contains the point 0, 0, 0.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.890
If x and y and z are
equal to 0, then all sides

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.020
of these equations are 0.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.400
So it contains
the point 0, 0, 0.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.000
Or you could even view it as it
contains the position vector 0,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.430
0, 0.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.030
And it also contains
the point 2, 3, 4.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.290
Because if x is 2, y is 3,
and z is 4, then all of these

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.830
are going to be equal to 1.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.650
So let me draw that
right over here.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.470
So it also contains the
point, or the position vector,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.060
we could say 2, 3, 4.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.120
So if we wanted to
just draw this line,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.200
to point specify the line,
this line would look like that.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.970
But if we wanted to
think about a vector

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.710
that this plane
contains, it would

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
be the vector that goes
from 0, 0, 0 to 2, 3, 4.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.970
So it would be this
vector right here, which

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.319
really is the position
vector 2, 3, 4.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.110
And I'm going to write
an ijk notation just

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.070
to make it clear that
this is a vector.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.110
So this vector that lies
in the plane in question

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:12.089
is the vector 2i-- I'll write it
over here-- 2i plus 3j plus 4k.

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.630
I just wrote in unit
vector notation.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.361
I'll say a, I'll
call this vector a.

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:17.830
Vector a is equal to that.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.600
And I'll write a over here.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.544
Now we need to figure out
the equation of this line.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.460
And the best way to do
it, or at least the way

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.570
my brain is telling
me to do it, if I

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.570
can find another
vector in this plane,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.880
then I can find a normal
vector to this plane.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.860
And then using a normal vector
and some arbitrary other vector

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.050
on this plane, I can then figure
out the equation of the line.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.390
Because the normal vector dotted
that arbitrary other vector

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.720
has to be equal to 0.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.780
Now if none of that
makes any sense, maybe

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.510
as we go through the problem
it will make more sense.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.080
So what I'm going to do is use
these other lines, or really

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.460
the other vectors,
that are implicitly

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.590
defined by these
lines to figure out

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.350
another vector in
this plane over here.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.930
So let me draw what I'm talking
about, that might be easier.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.730
So let me draw this other plane.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.810
And I'll draw it in white.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.420
And this other plane
also contains 0, 0, 0.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.530
Or actually, both of these
lines over here contain 0, 0, 0.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.030
So let me draw it over here.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.080
So this other plane, I
think what I just said,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.506
if I do it step by step, it
will make a lot more sense.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.630
So the other plane, that's
when it comes vertically

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.070
above this plane, and it goes
vertically below the plane

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.110
as well.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.840
And we see the
plane that contains

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.141
these two lines is
perpendicular to this.

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:41.640
They're perpendicular
to each other,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.410
and we need to find the
equation of the yellow plane.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.750
Now this blue line over here
contains the point 0, 0, 0

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.862
and the point 3, 4, 2.

00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:52.820
Same logic that we've
got to get to this point.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.690
If this is 3, this is 4,
this is 2, they all equal 1.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.650
The equation holds.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.360
So let me just draw
some arbitrary place.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.430
So 3, 4, 2.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.330
And I want to be
clear, I haven't even

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.780
defined the coordinate axis.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.370
We don't know what angle
we're looking at this from.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.250
This is just for
visualization purposes.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.166
So this line right over
here, I could draw it,

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:14.140
would look something like this.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.600
It would look
something like that.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.420
It sits on that white plane.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.070
We can do the same thing
for this magenta line.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.850
The magenta line also
contains 0, 0, 0,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.286
but it contains the
point 4, 2, and 3.

00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:29.660
So let me just
draw it over here.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.222
So that's the magenta line.

00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:39.430
And you wouldn't even see
it if this was transparent.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.640
You would see the line, it would
just keep going down like that.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.810
Now, I'm going to
attempt to explain

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.190
how I'm going to tackle
this problem again.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.280
I'm going to use vectors
defined, that are implicitly

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.887
defined, by this blue line
and this magenta line.

00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:55.220
I'm going to take the cross
product of those two vectors

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.070
to find a vector that is normal
to this entire white plane.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.890
And that vector has to sit
in this perpendicular plane.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.190
And then I can use that vector
and vector a to figure out

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.010
a normal vector for this plane.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.840
And then I'll be able to figure
out the equation of the plane.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.290
Let me just do it, instead
of keep trying to--

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.330
So what's a vector?

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.160
What are two vectors that
sit in this white plane?

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.130
Well, the point 0,0, 0, or the
position vector is 0, 0, 0.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.080
And the position vector
4,2,3 is in this plane.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.060
So the vector, I'll
call that b, the vector

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:41.340
b is equal to 4i plus 2j plus
3k is also in this white plane.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.490
And you really, I'm just
subtracting this position

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.377
vector from that position vector
to get this position vector,

00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:50.710
which clearly sits in the plane.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.812
This vector starts at the
origin goes to 4, 2, 3.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.520
This plane contains
the origin is clearly

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.870
sitting in that plane.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.985
And by that same logic I
could figure out a vector.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.360
It's actually the
position vector

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.120
itself sits on this plane.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.170
So this is the vector
I'll call that c

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.019
is equal to 3i plus 4j plus 2k.

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:15.060
The fact that everything
is at the origin kind of

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.643
simplifies it.

00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:20.700
The position vectors
themselves sit on the plane.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.309
If this wasn't
centered at the origin

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:23.600
we wouldn't be able to do that.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.930
We would have to subtract
between these two vectors,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.000
or between two other
points to actually get

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.370
vectors on the plane.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.600
But with that out
of the way, I could

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:39.550
take the cross
product of b and c,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.980
and that will give
us some vector that

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.900
is perpendicular
to both b and c.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.550
Which means that
it's perpendicular,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.810
or it's normal to this
entire white plane, which

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.320
means it must sit in
this yellow plane.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.240
So I need to find,
I want to find,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.850
a normal vector that's in the
yellow plane, just like that.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.280
Let's call that vector d.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.940
So the vector d is going
to be equal to this.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.740
And so the cross product of b
and c, this is how I remember,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.800
is the determinant
of you take ijk.

00:07:15.276 --> 00:07:17.150
I'm going to explain
this in a lot more depth

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.700
in the linear algebra playlist.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.060
But it's determinate of that,
The next row is vector b.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.610
So it's 4, 2 and 3.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.730
And then the next
row is the vector c.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.790
So 3, 4, and 2.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.840
And so this is going to be
equal to-- let's think about it.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.640
So for i you cross out
that column, that row,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.090
it's 2 times 2 minus 3 times 4.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.500
So that's 4 minus 12.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.130
So it's negative 8.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.862
Negative 8 times
i minus-- remember

00:07:57.862 --> 00:07:58.820
you have to swap signs.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.800
You go plus, minus, plus when
you're taking the determinant--

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.700
so you ignore the j,
so it's 4 times 2.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:12.070
4 times 2 is 8, minus 3
times 3, which is negative 1.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.090
So this would be
a negative 1 here,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.960
but I already have a
negative out there.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:23.410
So it's going to be plus
1j and then finally, the k.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.010
You cross out that row, that
column, 4 times 4 is 16.

00:08:30.214 --> 00:08:33.819
16 minus 6 is 10.

00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:36.940
So plus 10.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.740
Let me make sure
I got that right.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.030
So the first one, I
always have to make sure.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.810
So i got 4 minus
12 is negative 8.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:51.130
Then j, cross that out, 4 times
2 is 8, minus 9 is negative 1.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.250
But the j has a negative,
so that's right.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.600
And then k, 4 times 4 is 16.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.080
16 minus 6 is 10.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.056
So that looks right.

00:09:01.056 --> 00:09:04.230
So plus 10k.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.906
So this vector right here,
this is the vector d.

00:09:06.906 --> 00:09:07.780
This is the vector d.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.540
I just figured it out.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.700
Now, if we take the cross
product of d and vector a,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.350
the vector that
was-- you can kind of

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.350
view it as lying along
this line over here--

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.100
then we will get a vector
that is normal to this plane.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.190
We could call that
vector n for normal.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.860
That is normal to
the yellow plane.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.600
And it would actually
sit in the white plane.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.554
So let's figure that.

00:09:36.554 --> 00:09:37.970
We'll see in a few
steps, probably

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.240
in the next video, why
that is actually useful.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:53.570
So let's find what d cross-- so
if I take the cross product-- d

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.655
cross a is going to be
equal to our normal vector.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.030
Which is equal to
the same thing, ijk.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.860
We're going to take d,
which is negative 8, 1, 10.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:19.182
And take the cross of that and
the vector a, which is 2, 3, 4,

00:10:19.182 --> 00:10:20.640
and we will get--
and actually I'll

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.010
continue this in the next video.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.610
Just so that I don't make
these videos too long.
