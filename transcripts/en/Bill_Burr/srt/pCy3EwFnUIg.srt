1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,060
Hey, what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:05,370
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:10,080
May 30th, 2016. How are
you? How's it going?

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,363
Oh Wow.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,950
Oh look at show. What do you
do from Memorial Day? Yeah,

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,910
yeah. It's, you fill up the above ground
pool or God bless Ya. Go. I bless you.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,450
I'll be over with a couple of hours.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,500
You know what I've been
drinking late, Stacy.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:31,450
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,760
Yeah. Over here. You know
what? I paid tricking lately.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,620
I don't know why I started drinking
the cause light again. I remember them.

12
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,930
Silver Bullets fucking prom night.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,240
Um, how many did you get in your class

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,740
of Jesus Christ? Um, Happy
Memorial Day. Everybody.

15
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:55,880
Thank you to everybody in the military
for doing what it is that you do.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,980
Um, so that morons like me can run
their fucking yaps and not, uh,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,430
have a black van pull up and
take me away to get reeducated.

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,680
Um, that's it. Happy, happy,
happy day off on a Monday.

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,680
They should have one of these
a fucking month. You know,

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,740
they should have one three
day weekend a month. If,

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,400
if Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders
would get on board with that,

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,470
the two candidates that the people want,

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,550
people want to vote for either one
of them too, and they're gonna Ramel,

24
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,960
Hillary, right down. You're fuck
El Cuckoo clock face herself.

25
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,310
Write down your fucking

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,690
throat. That's what they're gonna
do. I watched this clip on Facebook,

27
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:40,870
so you know, it had to be true
were Chris Matthews right?

28
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,250
Was basically just mind fucking everybody
saying that Hillary was gonna win it

29
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,300
and blah blah blah, blah, blah.

30
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:50,710
Just say when she wins it and all that
type of shit and she wasn't doing like a,

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,430
he wasn't doing like a dude I called
the type of thing. He's just doing that.

32
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:58,150
Like the rich, the rich liberals,

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,140
you know those ones, y'all, the ones who
act like they care about anybody else,

34
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:02,661
they actually, they,

35
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:06,190
they're worse than rich
Republicans because Republicans
don't act like they give

36
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:09,100
a fuck about other people.
But rich liberals, AH,

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,060
they're the fucking worst
bleeding heart, you know,

38
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,940
caring about everybody in their
fucking gated communities.

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,650
Oh Jesus, pill the fuck
did you have for breakfast?

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,960
What did I have for breakfast? Say
Two eggs way g two eggs over easy.

41
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,170
And I always buy these eggs from this
fucking Lilly's farm because it sounds

42
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,420
like it's some chick down the street who
just has a hen house and she's making

43
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,850
them from my neighborhood. But God, no,

44
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:39,100
she knows some giant corporation and I
dunno what the fuck they're doing with

45
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:39,790
these eggs.

46
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,140
They have the thinnest slash
hardest egg shells ever.

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,570
So if you tap real lightly poop
in the bottom of the fucking pad,

48
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,380
they will not break. And
if you get them this, this,

49
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:54,550
this one fucking sweet
spot that you hit the,

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,550
you hit the fucking egg shell, that will
actually crack and it won't break yolk.

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,790
All

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,250
right. I don't know if you guys
know about this, know this about me,

53
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,130
but I do not break egg yolks. Okay.

54
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,370
And I'm also superstitious when
it comes to breaking egg yolks.

55
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,410
I feel like if you break the fucking Yolk,

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,490
that means your day is going
to be a shit show, right?

57
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,020
It's a metaphor. You had a plan
and the whole thing went to shit.

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,920
And then you got a scramble it up.
Right. That's how I look at it.

59
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,070
So not only did I break, I broke one,

60
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,080
the other one was okay,

61
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,820
but then I was just so fucking frustrated
because you want them runny cause then

62
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,590
you still have the
nutrition in there. Right.

63
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,810
All these people to have it
over hard. Yeah. Over hard.

64
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,960
Like you're fucking
arteries. Right. So, uh,

65
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,110
I go to flip the thing and I'm so fucking
frustrated that it's gonna turn into

66
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:47,470
basically a fried egg sandwich. I got
mad and I go to flip the other one.

67
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,550
I broke that one too. I just was in
my kitchen by myself going, yeah,

68
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,700
there you go. Fuck the whole thing,
right? Yeah. Fuck the whole thing.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,120
The nini downstairs. Are you all
right? Yeah. Fine. What are you doing?

70
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,500
Oh, just making some eggs,
honey. Does it sound like it?

71
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,650
Okay. I, I've to interrogation, right?
It comes to fucking interrogation.

72
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,780
Like Norbert Leo Butz,
his wife on bloodline.

73
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,880
Oh my God. That character is
driving me up the fucking wall.

74
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,810
Not saying the actress, she's phenomenal.
But that whole dynamic, it's like,

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,860
can you just shut up? Can
you leave the man alone?

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Is anybody watching bloodline? I'm not
going to ruin any of this shit, but a,

77
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,900
you got to fucking watch it. You
got to watch it. I'm like, uh,

78
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm already five episodes into season
two. What just came out? Um, you know,

79
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:47,520
I had a nice three day weekend, so Billy
fucking, ah, red cakes here. I, um,

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,610
I've been fucking Netflix the whole
weekend. Started off the weekend.

81
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,650
I watched the do over

82
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,480
Adam San Louis new movie with
David Spade. It was fucking great.

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,190
I always loved Sandler's fucking movies
and uh, I love spades character. I,

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,920
that's hard to talk about a movie
without saying what the fuck happens.

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,530
Just watch it. And also just being a fan
of people out here in Hollywood that,

86
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:16,350
that do their own goddamn thing. Um,

87
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,220
I guess Sandler's movies crush
it on Netflix. So he's like,

88
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,740
but why fucking take it to the movie
theater? I'll just take it right to you.

89
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:26,610
So we cut a deal with them for like his
next, I don't know, four to six movies.

90
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,120
And they went right right to that. So I
believe this is the first one and I'm,

91
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,960
I fucking loved it man. I love it.
I got a, I can't say what happens,

92
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,200
but there was this one thing
that Sandler did and I was like,

93
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,130
that's probably gonna be the most
disgusting thing I'm going to see for the

94
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:45,210
first half of the year.

95
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,400
And then something else happens that
involves a fucking old lady. Um,

96
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,350
so there you go. I just primed the
pump, check it out if you get a chance.

97
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,780
And I been watching
bloodline and then, uh,

98
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,770
somebody else recommended I am
road comic and it was about, uh,

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,700
just these comics, Wayne Fetterman and
these guys doing this road gig and uh,

100
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,060
enjoyed all of that,
enjoyed all of that. And uh,

101
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,230
but I mentioned earlier that, uh, check
those out if you can't check them out,

102
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,040
if you can. Anyways,

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,040
so I mentioned earlier that I am in a
much more upbeat mood than I have been in

104
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,800
a while. You know, and I know what you
think of bill. Oh, wait, what'd you,

105
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,630
what'd you get another bottle of
booze? No, not at all. Not at all.

106
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,700
I finally went to a chiropractor.

107
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,823
All right.

108
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,360
I went to a chiropractor. Um, and
I never, I never go to the doctor.

109
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,800
All right? Because that's how I was
brought up. Christ, I'm telling you,

110
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,570
believe Christ,

111
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,570
you're going to get down here and you're
gonna fight going to charge you up the

112
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:53,400
fucking wide zone. Let's take
a God damn aspirin. All right.

113
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:56,640
You hang from a pull up bar,
you'll be fine. All right.

114
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,420
I came from a family and a time where
you didn't go to the fucking doctor.

115
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,430
If you went to the fucking,
you don't go to the doctor.

116
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,910
You don't take your car to a mechanic
cause they're going to fucking find

117
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:12,530
something. So I finally go
to the chiropractor because
at this point I told you,

118
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm literally in the writers room.

119
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,190
I have cushions from this couch
on the floor and I'm, I'm,

120
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,260
I lay on the floor and uh,
I call it floor pitching.

121
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,840
I just pitched jokes laying on the floor.

122
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,740
And then when it gets to some
critical part of the story,

123
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:32,090
I then stand up to see what's going
on and then I laid back down again.

124
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,410
Then I just lay in the ground. What if,
uh, what if Frank said, uh, you know,

125
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:39,320
I'll put you through the fucking
wall. Right? That's what I do.

126
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,790
So I finally couldn't take it anymore
and a buddy of mine who works on the show

127
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,730
said I got a great chiropractor. And I
finally was just like, you know what?

128
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,460
You've got to let that fucking suburban
Boston shit go. Okay. There's no way.

129
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:55,070
If they always fucked up, everybody
would still be going to them.

130
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:59,990
So I ended up going down there
and this guy was a fucking wizard.

131
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,030
Unbelievable. Right?

132
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,210
He literally like put his hand right in
my lower back and was just pushing on my

133
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:13,760
spine. Like on one side of it, it was
going on. It seems like you have a, a,

134
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:17,340
an older injury here from a long
time ago. And I was like, yeah,

135
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,760
how the fuck did you know
that? Because now I can tell,

136
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,560
cause this is bold j like I had a
bulging disc and he goes, hey, I go,

137
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:28,040
yeah fucking I one of my,
when I was in fourth grade,

138
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,631
you know,

139
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:32,840
I was into wrestling and the buddy of
mine knew how to do the figure four leg

140
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:33,170
lock.

141
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,930
And unfortunately the only way to teach
someone how to do it is to put him in

142
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:39,890
it. And he put me in the fucking thing.

143
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,160
And when I sat up to
try to free my leg, I I,

144
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,260
that was the first time I felt a something
go out in my back and then the next

145
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,710
time was playing football freshman
year of high school pickup football.

146
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,120
I didn't play organized,

147
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,240
didn't play organized cause I got a d
in math in fifth grade and that was,

148
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:01,260
that was, that was my retirement.
Like when Jordan retired in 2003,

149
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:05,190
except by now I won one
championship and I never returned.

150
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,343
Um,

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:07,780
okay.

152
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,170
But anyways, he was able
to fix all of that shit.

153
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,820
I immediately felt better the next day
I was sore. And then over the weekend,

154
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,450
like, um, like last night for the
first time in like two months,

155
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,260
I was able to sit down for a significant
period of time and have no pain

156
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:27,220
whatsoever. And uh, I just
been doing all these stretches.

157
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,350
And, uh, the biggest one is
I've been doing, uh, that,

158
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,610
you know, the up dog yoga
stretch for your a was your,

159
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:40,540
so as muscle in the front, I just thought
it connected your top to your bottom,

160
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,780
just where your hips were and it
ran perpendicular to your waist.

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,490
I didn't realize that it came up and
then Kinda made like an s turn right to

162
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,550
like the middle of your body. He was
explaining to me, I forget what it is,

163
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:56,350
but like I've been stretching that thing
and do what my Vietnamese gambler squat

164
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,290
and a couple of runners stretch. And uh,

165
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,070
I think by this time next week I should
be, I should be right as rain. And um,

166
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,570
okay

167
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,270
dude, he fucking crack my back.
I didn't know he was gonna do it.

168
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,150
I was laying on my back and he goes,
all right, bring your knees up.

169
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,790
Bring them over to the side.
Just let it relax. Relax.

170
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,640
Let me have all the weight
and fucking right there, Fred.

171
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,570
And I just started fucking
laughing like, dude, what the fuck?

172
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,660
Cause I always thought it was like
they were cracking your bones.

173
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:27,950
I guess there's gas that they're releasing
in there. I have no fucking idea.

174
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:28,784
But anyways.

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,260
MMM [inaudible]

176
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,401
I dunno, I, I,

177
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,970
that's something I always have to
remember that just because something's a

178
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:39,030
racket doesn't mean that there's not
somebody that's really good at it.

179
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,110
You know what I mean? Like think of
the reputation that comedians have.

180
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,010
We don't have a good reputation. We're
on offstage where attention whores,

181
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:51,360
we got the fucking lamp shades on our
head and we tell fucking awful jokes. Yet,

182
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:54,270
despite that, there's still
your fucking, you know,

183
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:58,680
David Tells Chappelle's Louis C
K's and all of those fucking guys.

184
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,143
Um,

185
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,610
okay.

186
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,920
So that's what I guess what you gotta do.

187
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,310
You got to find the Louis C K of
chiropractice before you fucking go in.

188
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,350
And I think I did. So,

189
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,933
um,

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,520
I dunno, this is so I don't even
know how to get out of this.

191
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,910
It was just something good happened to
me and I told you the story and nothing

192
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,080
bad happened so I don't have any jokes
about it other than I couldn't find the

193
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,650
fucking place. You know, I was
driving over with my phone. Right.

194
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,980
It's directing me over there and
then in the last second, okay.

195
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,230
Um,

196
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,180
right when I needed it, where the
building was, I hit like a whatever,

197
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:36,310
a dead zone and I had nothing.

198
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,553
Um,

199
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,400
and I walked up to the building
was one of those partially

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,180
like rented buildings.

201
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:47,500
So it looked like it was abandoned from
where I was and I'm looking in and up by

202
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,690
now I'm already losing
my shit. I'm like, wait,

203
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,140
this nobody even fucking built
fucking buildings offended.

204
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,740
Then I just see this nurse work by
looking at me with their scrubs on like,

205
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,350
what the fuck is your problem? It's
just an, I had to kind of be like,

206
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,690
play it off and then kind
of follow her around the,

207
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,950
the part of the building
that was actually being used.

208
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,590
I swear to God, man, I need to
learn how to have patience. I just,

209
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,900
uh, I have zero fucking patients.
I have zero fucking tolerance,

210
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,560
all of that shit. And um, I dunno.

211
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,120
It's really going to be the death of me.

212
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,440
I really got to learn to just fucking
relax. It's weird little shit.

213
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:31,700
Little Shit fucking drives me up the wall.
Major shit or major pains in the ass.

214
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,360
I just laugh and I, okay. Yesterday I
was driving my lovely wife back from,

215
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,700
went over to the mall. She
picked up a few things.

216
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,000
We got all the way home by back,

217
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,220
was starting to kill me and she realized
she left one of her shopping bags and

218
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:47,870
I'm in a store and she flipped the fuck
out and it just, and I was like, oh no,

219
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:50,000
it's fine. It's fine. Okay.
I don't give a shit. Right.

220
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,480
I drive all the way back. My back's
killing me. I didn't give a fuck.

221
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,690
Totally relaxed. That was fine, right?

222
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,100
But then like an old lady walks in a
crosswalk and I have to wait an extra six

223
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:05,330
seconds to make a left. And I literally
have a meltdown for the life of me.

224
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,850
I can't figure out why that
is. Um, but anyways, um,

225
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,440
speaking of great standup Comedians, um,

226
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,040
Doug, Stan hope put something up.

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,760
He wrote something,

228
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,010
he's friends with Johnny Depp and he's
going through this brutal fucking divorce

229
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,930
and uh,

230
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,790
I just want to give him props for sticking
up for his friend and everything and

231
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:38,710
saying something. Cause you know,
you know what's really so fucked up.

232
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,313
All right?

233
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,100
It's all this shit that happens to
women that guys do. Women is fucked up.

234
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,600
But there has been a slight
overcorrection now where if somebody's,

235
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,580
a woman just says, you do something
before you're ever tried or convicted,

236
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,350
it just gets put in the paper.

237
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,370
It gets put all over the Internet
and then all you fucking moron.

238
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:05,750
So 90% of you on the fucking
Internet, just take it as truth.

239
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,720
Take it as fun. Why do
you take it as truth?

240
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,290
Because you want it to be true cause
he's doing better than you in life.

241
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:16,880
I mean it's fucking unbelievable.
I really believe this. Okay.

242
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,440
If somebody gets accused,

243
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:19,960
okay,

244
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,100
okay. Of, of, of rape
or domestic violence,

245
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,780
they should not publicize the person's
name until they're convicted of it.

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I think that's more than fair considering
all the fucking dopes out there that

247
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:37,090
the second day read something Trump,

248
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,013
you know,

249
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,380
let it fucking see what happens first.

250
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,070
See what the fuck happens first.
All that, that, that whole thing.

251
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,890
Now that all you gotta do is just say it.

252
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:53,510
The amount of fucking guys who have
been falsely accused of that shit.

253
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,500
It's like you literally fucking
with their ability to get a job,

254
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,170
you fucking with your reputation
and you know the deal dude,

255
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,910
like domestic violence and anything
involving sex, that shit never goes,

256
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,290
that never goes away.

257
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,763
Um,

258
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,630
so I dunno, I just want to, you know,

259
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,030
give Stan hope fucking props are
actually sticking up for the guy.

260
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,260
Cause there's a lot of people, you
know, because of the stigma around that,

261
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:19,580
even if they know it isn't true,

262
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,540
they're afraid to throw their hat
in the fucking ring right now.

263
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,610
I don't know what the fuck
happened or whatever. Okay.

264
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:28,400
I am just saying the fact that
somebody finally just said, hey,

265
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,460
this guy hasn't been tried for
anything yet. He's a friend of mine.

266
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,320
I know he would never do this. It was,

267
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,700
it was refreshing to finally read
that and for somebody to finally say,

268
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,710
you know what I believe is you shouldn't
put somebody's name out there until,

269
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,240
you know, 100% tried and convicted.
They definitely did that shit.

270
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,810
And then if they did tar and feather
them, but to do that to somebody,

271
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,343
um,

272
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,700
and also to give that weapon to somebody
that they can just fucking say that and

273
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:02,430
blackmail you with that and, and
really destroy your reputation.

274
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,813
Um,

275
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,790
I don't know. It's fucking reprehensible.

276
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,600
So this or there's another thing
that isn't really funny, you know,

277
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,720
you know, it's like all those
Duke lacrosse players, this shit,

278
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:21,520
they just fucking faces all
over the fucking, and you know,

279
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:24,820
to this day, despite the fact
that they were totally vindicated,

280
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,800
despite the fact that there was the 30
for 30 talking about how bad they got

281
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:32,650
railroaded despite all of that, you know,

282
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:34,390
that still going to affect
their lives. You know,

283
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:37,330
there's still going to be somebody
going, yeah, but you know,

284
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,650
something happened. You know,

285
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:41,140
somebody when they get mad and
they got nothing else to say,

286
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,150
they're going to call him a
rapist or something like that.

287
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:47,320
You fucking know that they're
gunna. Um, so I dunno.

288
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,860
I know it was, it was good to see. And
of course it was stand up, stand up,

289
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,530
stand ups, good fucking man.
Um, um, as is Johnny Depp,

290
00:16:56,531 --> 00:17:00,400
by the way, a few times, he's a, he's a
big standup fan. He comes out to shows,

291
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,880
he's fucking humble as
hell, you know, gentle.

292
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,790
One of the most gentle fucking people
ever. You know what I mean? Look,

293
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,010
listen to me. Listen how the fuck
I talk. You know what I mean?

294
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,100
You don't understand it. If it came,

295
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,430
you know somebody said that about me that
he fucking snap like posey and fucking

296
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:18,250
dirty dozen. I don't know.
I barely know the guy.

297
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,650
I've only met him a few fucking
times, but like I don't,

298
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I really tend to believe what the Fuck
Stan is saying and I 100% believe that

299
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:31,450
you should not be putting somebody fucking
name out there just because somebody

300
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:36,370
said it. You know? Oh it's fucking
I Billy's fucking state is brutal.

301
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,980
She's going for fucking
spousal support, you know,

302
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,870
going for fucking spouse's support,

303
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,480
which means he's got to pay her for
like the rest of her fucking life.

304
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,510
She married the guy for 15 fucking
months and you're kills me.

305
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:49,650
Bought that person. She's going to
fucking go to the Beyonce concert. Oh,

306
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,010
the day it is independent and she why
you watch your throw a fucking hand up.

307
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,830
Wow. That shit gets me heated.
Alright, here we go. Here we go.

308
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:03,690
Is there any fucking ribbons for guys
falsely accused of rape and domestic

309
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,750
violence? You know, do they
get their month? You know,

310
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,230
w w will the NFL wear a color for
them? Of course they want, they aren't,

311
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:13,140
they don't give a fuck. Um, anyways.

312
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,260
All right, here we go.
Let's talk about, um,

313
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,990
let's talk about that game six.
Holy fucking shit. Game six,

314
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:29,010
OKC, golden state warriors. And when
I say holy fucking Shit, not only do,

315
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,770
I mean it was a great game.
I mean, holy fucking shit.

316
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,890
You guys are gonna have to sit here
and listen to a man who never watches

317
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,930
basketball. Talk about
basketball. Actually,

318
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:41,400
I watched the most I've watched this year
and I watched the Celtics mainly. Um,

319
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,190
fucking brutal, man. I W
I'm not gonna lie to you.

320
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:48,090
I always root for the underdog. So I
was going for OKC, right? And, you know,

321
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,270
Golden State got theirs last
year. I liked, I, you know,

322
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:55,830
I've been to a home game
of, um, of the thunder.

323
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,260
The fans are fucking unreal.
And I love their stadium.

324
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,510
It's like a college stadium, you know,

325
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,000
it's not like fucking triple decker. Um,

326
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,280
luxury boxes like down the staple
center, which every time I go in there,

327
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,850
there's a part of me that gets really
sad for the, for like true Laker fans,

328
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,590
true king fans, true clipper fans that
they got banished that fucking high up.

329
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:21,150
It's fucking ridiculous. They got a
Goddamn nightclub in there, you know,

330
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:24,300
where you can hang out afterwards.
It's the stupidest shit ever. Right.

331
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,430
And meanwhile, all the fucking,

332
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,440
the real fence that had
been hanging out, you know,

333
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:34,430
the only real fan in the lower level
of at the Lakers game, you got two,

334
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:37,460
Diane Cannon and Jack Nicholson.
They'd been there for fucking ever.

335
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,410
And I think it was Jack
First. Um, but anyways,

336
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,680
uh, and I, I, I've seen,

337
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:48,760
I saw Kevin Duran play
when he was still, uh,

338
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,430
senate key arena when he's still with
the sonics. And I was at that game when,

339
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,830
uh, OKC was playing, um, the Miami
Heat and Chris Bosh Gotten in, uh,

340
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,650
one of the, uh, thunders
guys' faces. And, uh,

341
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,280
Duran immediately walked over and
said some shit and broke it up.

342
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:09,000
And then he like was really
fucking, you know, look like,

343
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,670
not yelling but just laying down the lot.

344
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,850
It was teammate and afterwards they
asked him what he said. He said,

345
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:18,070
I just told them there's a lot of phony
tough guys in the league and that guy's

346
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,480
one of them. And right there, I mean,
he was like 2123 when he did it,

347
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,670
I was like, yeah, you got it. You
can't not love that guy. Right?

348
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,670
So I'm rooting for these guys and I'm,

349
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,310
it's the classic fucking thing about a
team that knows how to win another one

350
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:33,170
that didn't, they had
those funds. They actually,

351
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:36,980
they actually won the fucking game. They
had the fuck. I can't say they weren't,

352
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:37,814
they hadn't won.

353
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,330
They were up by seven with four and a
half minutes left and they were playing

354
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,420
like they were down by 15
and fucking the warriors,

355
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,110
they will like, they will
like this patient. Like,

356
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,510
you know when you see like I want a python
grabbed something and it wraps itself

357
00:20:55,511 --> 00:21:00,100
around you and it just chill it.
And every time you s s exhale,

358
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:04,120
it just fucking goes a little tighter
and a little tighter, you know,

359
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,480
and then you're like, you can't fucking
breathe. You pass out and it's over.

360
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,020
That's all they did. If you
won't rewatch that game,

361
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,220
they never increased the tempo
or their game. They just fucking,

362
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,870
they would like Jason and Friday that
13th you know when someone's running away,

363
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,900
oh, Casey was a victim running
away, looking over their shoulder.

364
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:28,420
So they're tripping over logs and shit
and they just fucking walked up on them.

365
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,020
And that was it. Fucking
machete to the back of the neck.

366
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,270
They were playing like they went down by
15 when they were up by seven and then

367
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,890
they just started coming down the court.

368
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,150
They stopped passing the fucking
ball and Josh [inaudible], that was,

369
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,050
that was one of the most
devastating losses I've seen of,

370
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,870
of a home team in a long fucking time.

371
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,660
They just ripped their hearts out,

372
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,560
fucking held it up to their faces
and then threw it into the crowd.

373
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,260
There was dead fucking
silence except for those 20,

374
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,080
unbelievable stereotypical jerk off
California sports fans that hung around.

375
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,580
They are the fucking worst. Not
all of them, but 80% of them.

376
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,770
They are the fucking way.

377
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,100
Maybe there was a touch of the Yolo
Douche that was fucking going on, right.

378
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,020
You know the white guys with the hat to
the side and you know, two of them DJ,

379
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,770
right? Um, they were
standing behind our, uh,

380
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,563
all of the, uh,

381
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,140
all of the fucking announces they're
near killed me when we were watching it.

382
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:38,890
She was fucking making
fun of shack. He said he,

383
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:43,630
she said he's wearing this big
blue suit, this big round head.

384
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,030
She said he looked like
one of those talking mnms.

385
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,590
Um, anyways, but Jesus
Christ, Clay Thompson, my God,

386
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,510
at what point are you
going to cover the guy?

387
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,850
This is what's so fucked up about
the NBA. You know, when, uh,

388
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,100
when, when or whatever
it was, fuck his name.

389
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,610
When Steph curry goes down the lane
for like the 50th fucking time,

390
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,360
he looked cross over here,
a little Dan will pop do,

391
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,750
and he's in the air back in
the day that you would've got,

392
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:16,810
you would've got fucking brought down
to earth on the back of your head.

393
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,673
That would've been it.

394
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,680
And everyone would've stood up and
pushed and shoved and nobody would've got

395
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:23,860
objected. He's fucking
like, that's something,

396
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,520
because I watched very little basketball
for a long time during my standup

397
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:32,140
career and I just cannot believe the
way you can just coast down the fucking

398
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:36,490
lane. You know what I mean? Back in the
day, if you tried to go down the lane,

399
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:40,510
you had to be a fucking man. You know,
you knew you were going to at some,

400
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,200
you know, you could get away with it
once, maybe twice. And then that was it.

401
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,410
It was like when Michael Vick was running
around as a quarterback, you know,

402
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:52,940
eventually one of those linebackers was
going to have an opportunity. And, um,

403
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,800
yeah, it was gonna you know, this, you
know, if you are running quarterback,

404
00:23:56,801 --> 00:24:01,480
you know, eventually, you know,
it's almost like considered like a,

405
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:06,070
I feel it's considered like
a cheap fucking play. Like
we got you guys covered,

406
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,740
you know what I mean? And then you're
just going to fucking, you know,

407
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:13,741
run and then fucking slide on your ass
for a first down that makes people mad on

408
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,890
the defense and eventually you're not
going to have time to go down or they

409
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,650
don't give a fuck that you're going down
and they're going to take the fucking

410
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,670
the fine.

411
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,260
And I'm amazed how that has been
taken out of the fucking game.

412
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,790
These guys just glide watch. 'Em

413
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,530
Okay.

414
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,540
I, I want to say when Mikael hit Rambis,
I don't even know if there was a foul,

415
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,290
there must've been a foul, but nobody
was objected. That would have been like,

416
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,240
what? I don't know. Whatever
the suspensions are nowadays,

417
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:47,130
three to five game suspensions. But
anyways, um, Clay Thompson, Jesus Christ,

418
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:50,100
the fucking guy was unconscious and uh,

419
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,190
I got to tell you, man, I just,

420
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,430
the only reason why I think OKC can win
game seven is nobody thinks they can't.

421
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,000
And that always makes me feel like Vegas
is going to win a ton of fucking money.

422
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:08,001
I actually have a bet I called
in the a I am Rapaport podcast.

423
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,683
Um,

424
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,880
cause we're at a port anytime anything
bad happens to two fucking Boston teams,

425
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,250
he's just got a hard on for
it. You know what I mean?

426
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:20,280
And then he tries to act like he
doesn't give a fuck about baseball.

427
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,470
And then when I bring up how successful
the Yankees are, he flips out.

428
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:30,060
That's right. That's right.
When we fucking prison
rates you, he flips out. It,

429
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,550
it literally ages that man,

430
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,510
what has happened over the
last decade and a half,

431
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,380
what we have accomplished
with only four teams,

432
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,400
even our fucking soccer team, if
you want to throw that in, right?

433
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,080
Even they won a championship. It,

434
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,640
Apple's absolutely fucking
devastates that man, you know?

435
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:54,860
And all these got his, the two giant
Superbowls, which to be honest with you,

436
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,920
Ian Ho, I don't give a fuck if
you told me 15 years ago, Hey,

437
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,070
the patriots are going to
go to six Superbowls and
when four of us do you think

438
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:07,110
I'm going to cry about the
other two? I don't give a fuck

439
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,320
four and two, I'll fucking take
that. You know, else would take that,

440
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
the fucking giants,

441
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,160
if they could have gone to six and one
for, and why wouldn't you? Uh, well,

442
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:21,371
you know,

443
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,040
something they would probably say went
into against the Patriots was better.

444
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,220
And I would actually believe that. I
would actually believe that. So whatever,

445
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,440
you know what I mean? But that's
the kind of sports fan I am.

446
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,240
I don't have this blind hatred, you know,

447
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,610
this is the thing, this
is the thing about me,

448
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,420
as much as I sound like I'm
upper deck, I'm really not.

449
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,980
I am the way I drink. I am way I talk

450
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,870
the way I curse. I am an upper deck
guy, but I am a logical son of a bitch.

451
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,490
I'm not saying I'm box seats.
I'm on the mezzanine level. Okay.

452
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,040
I'm just that much closer to
the fucking, to the field.

453
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,150
Now Rapaport Rapaport
is upper deck all day,

454
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,130
all fucking day, and if he hears this,

455
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:07,110
he's going to say he's
actually proud of it.

456
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,850
Rappaport set guy at the top of the
fucking stadium going, is anybody looking?

457
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:15,030
Is anybody looking at any fucking
takes a piss up in the corner.

458
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,750
You know what I mean?

459
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,250
He actually really is more like
a Philly fan than a New York fan.

460
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,670
He can't help him. He just can't
help it. The man, the man has an,

461
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:30,350
and when I hear is hatred towards Boston
sports and when I hear his excitement

462
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:34,350
every time they reinstate
the Brady suspension,

463
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:36,650
it just makes me [inaudible]. I gay.

464
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,830
I can't even tell you how happy it makes
me that there's a New York sports fan

465
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:45,831
that is experiencing this level of joy
that something bad is finally happening

466
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,840
to a Boston team this century.
It never used to be that way.

467
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,650
You know? You know what New York
sports fans are to Boston fans,

468
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,270
they're like your big brother.

469
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:01,290
That used to be able to could beat
you up until you about 14 and then you

470
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:04,350
finally kicked his ass,
you know, you know,

471
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,480
throw them down the flight
of stairs. You know,

472
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:11,110
you felt them quit and it's
fucking over. You know you need it,

473
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:13,140
but it's never over. Cause
you know, it's some point,

474
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,060
some point in your thirties,

475
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,880
something's going to comment
and something's going to
happen at like a family

476
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,370
reunion and they're gonna come
at your one more time, right?

477
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:24,960
You just give him the old front face
luck right into a back body drop and then

478
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:29,730
it's fucking over. Once you hear their
body hit that linoleum floor, right?

479
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,120
The ankle just clips the
counter. That fucking done.

480
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
I love Rapaport, you know? All right.

481
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,350
He's another pasty fucking human being
is out of his fucking mind. Just like me.

482
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,080
All right, let's read a
little bit of advertising.

483
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,180
Literally advertising here for a,
and when I say little, I mean little.

492
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:30,540
Easy shape. I didn't do this. This is a,

493
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:34,500

lie. I never did this.

497

expensive fucking razorblades that are

498
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:53,491
made out of fucking plastic and recycled
coke cans and they charged you like

502
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,730
percent profit? Right? This

562
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,730
MMM [inaudible]

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,300
alright, so ola, oh,
Billy fucking fat cakes.

564
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,100
I'm in a writer's room and I have up
my, blew out my fucking sciatic nerve.

Right?

566

I've been trying to eat the best I can,

567
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:02,030

on the fucking scale the other day and

568
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:07,031
I was one 83 so my fighting weights
one 72 I went down to one 63 last year.

569
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:11,330
I knew I couldn't sustain that. That
was like my emaciated fucking, you know,

570
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,740
underwear model weight.
But I still, you know, no,

571
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,850
there's never been a redheaded underwear
model. A male one, I don't think,

572
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,560
you know, but there's always a first. Um,

573
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,130
so I really want to be like one
72. So, uh, I just said, you know,

574
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,330
I started yesterday, uh, I got my
birthday coming up on June 10th,

575
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,290
and um,

576
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,770
there cannot be an eight anywhere in
my body weight on my birthday for life.

577
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,890
I've just decided that that's it.
It's not fucking happen. And so, uh,

578
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:45,920
this morning I was one 81.6, you know,

579
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,410
I got my gym right outside
my back's feeling good.

580
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,430
I'm actually doing fucking legs and
eggs today, right? Legs and eggs.

581
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:56,150
The foxy lady. Hey guys, come
on down for legs in eggs, right?

582
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,170
I'm fucking doing some squats and um,

583
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,800
okay.

584
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,940
Oh, do the gym is the shit,
the fucking speed bag.

585
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:06,860
The atomic holds the pegboard.

586
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,333
Um,

587
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,740
I just walked right up.
I want to fucking bench.

588
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:14,290
I don't have to worry
about anything. You know,

589
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,540
I got a wireless fucking
space, right? I actually don't,

590
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,910
I have this, um, I've
got this other thing,

591
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,820
it looks like a Marshall amp looks
like the head of a Marshall amp.

592
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,000
And you just plug your
phone in there and uh,

593
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:33,060
and I just crank like fucking ac DC and
fucking all this shit that I love guns

594
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:37,690
and roses and all that, like
back in the day. And uh,

595
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,740
my goal is one time in my life did I
ever put up to 25 and for four you meet

596
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:48,210
heads left over from the fucking
eighties to 25 was the shit,

597
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,750
cause that was two 45 pound
plates on both sides. Right.

598
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,870
And you just brought it down
here, right back up again.

599
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,190
And I did that back when I
weighed about a buck 65. So, um,

600
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,410
I am an old man now. So, uh, right
now, you know, I just got the 45,

601
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,100
so on either side, you know, whatever,
I'm working my way back and uh,

602
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,250
I also know how to build myself up without
hurting myself. I always make sure I,

603
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,720
if I'm going to go 20 pounds up,
that I can do 20 pounds less,

604
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:19,790
at least six times. And then I
just go up and see, you know,

605
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,000
if I can do 20 pounds up
like two times, maybe three.

606
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,240
And I just worked my way up. So, uh,

607
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,370
I literally started out with just
20 fives on either side, you know,

608
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,570
did that 10 times and I threw the 35
10 times and I put the 40 fives on.

609
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,730
I could only do it like six fucking times.

610
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,560
Etic but now I'm back up to 10
reps on all of those. And uh,

611
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:48,300
I just moved up to a buck 55, which
I put up like four times. So, uh,

612
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:50,730
I should have my eighties
body back soon. You know,

613
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,480
we had just totally overdeveloped up
top and then I have my chicken legs.

614
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,220
Now it's not happening this time,

615
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:59,970
this time I'm actually gonna do the
fucking squad, uh, the squats. So, um,

616
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,680
anyways, um, if anybody
else has those atomic holds,

617
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,440
like what are you, cause they
give you those, those little,

618
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,880
those plastic bands that you then put
like the c clamp on and then you can swing

619
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:16,090
from those things. Like what do
you hook the plastic thing from?

620
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:20,590
I got them on my chin up bar, but, but
the shitness ceiling is like a fish hook,

621
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:23,710
but it's totally closed, so I can't
put the plastic thing in there.

622
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,590
I guess I could just fucking email the a,

623
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:31,210
the company and I could figure out how
to do it. Anyways, let's, let's, uh,

624
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,140
literally babbling here. Oh, who do you
guys like in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

625
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,670
Huh? In the Stanley Cup final. Um,

626
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,070
I gotta tell you after watching
the sharks beat my blues, I have,

627
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,580
uh, nothing but respect
for those guys now. And um,

628
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,430
I actually really liked that team.

629
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,390
Um,

630
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,520
but then I got a ton of
friends in Pittsburgh.

631
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,600
I don't know.

632
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,310
I Dunno. I Dunno what to do. Why
is Sydney Crosby so hateable?

633
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,780
Is it the Pouty Lips?

634
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Was it the crying after every fucking
call for so many fucking years?

635
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,810
The guy's unbelievable. He's unbelievable.

636
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,993
Um,

637
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,240
I dunno, I have no idea
who's going to win that one,

638
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:18,160
but I'm going to watch partner.
He actually invited me over.

639
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:20,350
I gotta get back to them. Maybe I'll be
able to run over there and watch this.

640
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,610
And then if I go over there,

641
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,970
I'm not one of those dishes that even
if I wanted San Jose to when I would go

642
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,790
over there and I definitely root
for the pens. Um, you can't,

643
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,620
when you see how happy Joe Barton is,

644
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,560
anytime the penguins score
of fucking goal, there's,

645
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,590
there's no way to not root
for the penguins. And I'm
not even root the penguins.

646
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:36,160
I'm just rooting

647
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,120
to see Joe Barton or Kathy.
All right, here we go. Um,

648
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,510
s the questions for the
weak, weak, weak, weak,

649
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:48,190
weak online dating from a lady. Hi,

650
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:53,020
bumbling Billy butterballs. Hey, I
like that one. Fumbling, rumbling,

651
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:56,350
bumbling, stumbling. Um,
I actually tweeted a,

652
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,620
you just see that four year old kid fell
into the gorilla and closure and then

653
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:04,410
they killed the gorillas. Um,
I said a, I tweeted about that.

654
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:08,400
I was saying how a four
year old does not fall,

655
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,180
accidentally fall into
a gorilla enclosure.

656
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,760
I wrote that was a fun
Hashtag Chris Berman. Uh,

657
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,560
all right.

658
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,530
I am a 26 year old lady
and I met this guy.

659
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,010
I am really into on an online dating app.

660
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,850
I am not on the app for hookups
and don't think he is either.

661
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,320
We have met,

662
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,550
we have met up in public places three
times in the past week and I can really

663
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:43,530
see potential with them. That's so,

664
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:46,860
I'm so fucking jealous that you guys
have that app where it's like I'm not on

665
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:48,240
there just to hook up with people.

666
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,560
Like you literally can turn yourself
into like a Gigolo or a call girl with

667
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:55,620
regular fucking people.
It's unbelievable. Um,

668
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:59,460
he said we have met up in public places
three times in the past week and I could

669
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:03,360
really see potential with him. I haven't
been to his actual apartment yet,

670
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,690
but met him once in the
parking garage of his complex.

671
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,640
That sounds like a blow job. Uh,
sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Oh,

672
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,820
he wants to hang out and watch a
movie at his place. I'm not approved,

673
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,870
naive or getting any weird
vibes or red flags in him.

674
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:23,130
I just don't want to put myself in any
potentially dangerous situations or give

675
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,420
him any false signs.

676
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,320
How soon is too soon after meeting
someone online to hang out at their

677
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:33,150
apartment? Dude, what the fuck?
I don't know. I have no idea.

678
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,130
You don't sound comfortable. So I
wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. I would,

679
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,660
uh,

680
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,040
I think if you're going to spend time
alone with him for the first time,

681
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,320
I would do it at your place

682
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,350
and have nine one dialed in
the phone in your hand. I mean,

683
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:54,180
I don't know if you're getting
this kind of a creepy vibe.

684
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:58,250
Are you getting a creepy vibe
because, um, you met him online?

685
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,050
Um, I, my advice is a,

686
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:05,500
I would not go over there anytime soon
until that whole fucking vibe goes away.

687
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,013
Um,

688
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,260
and whether you're approved or not
has nothing to do with anything.

689
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:17,400
That's just, it has to
do with being smart. Um,

690
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,270
Jesus Christ. Now you got me thinking
there's something wrong with them.

691
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:25,290
You know what? Stay away
from that guy. Um, all right.

692
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:29,730
Boyfriend doesn't want a dog.
I don't know how to say this.

693
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:34,130
Hey Billy, is that a French
word? B e t with the little hat

694
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,710
on the first e. Now I
got to look it up. Uh,

695
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:41,150
you know what happens when I do this
shit. All right. Oh, you know what,

696
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:45,160
I actually was looking up
the other day, um, cause I'm,

697
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:50,130
I'm a big fan of the, uh,
83 Philadelphia 70 sixers.

698
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,860
I was looking up a, the, uh,

699
00:41:55,370 --> 00:42:00,170
St Louis Spirits, which was a, um,

700
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,490
an ABA team. French to English
translation. There we go.

701
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,790
It's an ABA team. Oh,

702
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:12,650
I mean stupid you fucking asshole. Um,

703
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,200
hey Billy, stupid. Um, what was I gonna
say? Uh, I actually looked it up. The,

704
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,130
uh, the St Louis Spirits and um,

705
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,180
they had some of the cool nicknames,
coolest nixed names ever. They had a guy,

706
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:31,180
bad news, barns, fly Williams
and then Moses, Milan.

707
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:35,580
Moses didn't even need a
fucking nickname. What, uh,

708
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,260
what this that'd been his real
name? Moses. Moses Malone.

709
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,870
Bad News Barns, fly Williams. And uh,
I watched a, I don't know if there's,

710
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:48,400
I think there's a 30 for 30 on it. It
seemed like I saw a trailer for it.

711
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,860
Bob Costas was going like, if you
need to know anything about the ABA,

712
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,130
that team was the fucking ABA.
Everything. That was great about it.

713
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,870
And I believe Bob Costas is a Missouri
guy and a so I think that he was doing

714
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:03,680
all those games. Um, if
I ever meet Bob Costas,

715
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,950
that's the Shit I'm going to ask
him about out of fucking everything.

716
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,420
That's what I would want to talk
to him about is about the a,

717
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:15,270
the a B a where he got
his start and all that.

718
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:19,270
You can't fucking believe that. You
know, he got to see all that stuff. Um,

719
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,220
so anyways, here we go. Billy Billy.
Bet Billy. Stupid. All right. Yeah,

720
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,520
yeah. I'm a longtime lady listener.

721
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,710
I love your stand up specials and F
is for family is amazing. Thank you.

722
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,990
A nice work. Thank you. Thanks again.

723
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:37,020
I'm 29 and I just moved away from Seattle
to San Antonio with my air force pilot

724
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:41,530
boyfriend. Oh, all right. Uh, what,
how does that, does that one go

725
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,070
off?

726
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:48,070
We go into the wild blue Yonder de this
is my first time living away from home

727
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,000
and he's gone a lot for work.

728
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,720
I thought it would be a good idea
for us to get a dog to keep me sane.

729
00:43:55,721 --> 00:44:00,190
I love animals and was a part time dog
walker in Seattle. My boyfriend, however,

730
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,030
has never owned a pet in his life and
isn't hot on the idea of having a dog.

731
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,420
He's from Iowa and he believes
livestock should live,

732
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,050
shouldn't live in doors. Oh Jesus.

733
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,750
I've owned cats and dogs
my entire life. In fact,

734
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,250
I had to leave my 17 year old cat
behind in Seattle and it broke my heart.

735
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:23,610
Can you offer any persuasive words to
help bring him around or should I just

736
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:27,820
drop it? Thanks for the laugh
and go fuck yourself. Um,

737
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,300
how do you bring them? Well,
you can do it. My wife did.

738
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,730
And you foster air, quote a
rescue dog. That's what happens.

739
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:40,680
You foster a rescue
dog, which means, yeah,

740
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:44,730
just have it for the weekend
and as the bit when am I act?

741
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,110
I went from,

742
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,650
there's no fucking way I'm keeping this
dog in an a 48 hour period when all the

743
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,660
way to, oh my God, this
thing's going to die some day.

744
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,850
How am I emotionally going
to be able to handle this?

745
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,113
Um,

746
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,070
you could do that. Um,

747
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,480
I don't listen well this is
what I would do either way,

748
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,830
no matter how this works out,
I would get a small dog. Okay.

749
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,180
Small dogs. Small problems.
Okay. Small expenses,

750
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,820
small shits to pick up as your house
break in the fucking thing. Um,

751
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,870
house training, whatever the
fuck it is. Not a horse bill.

752
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:23,820
You don't ride the thing. Um,

753
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,250
okay.

754
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,520
How would you do this? Well, it
sounds like he doesn't want to do it.

755
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,770
Why would he call it livestock? It's
not livestock. It's a fucking pet.

756
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,170
Um,

757
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,380
I dunno, you know what it is. This
is the thing. If you foster a dog,

758
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,490
this is what's going to happen.

759
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,700
So this guy grew up on a farm where
he grew up in Iowa. This is the thing,

760
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,770
when you fucking come home on a farm,

761
00:45:45,771 --> 00:45:49,640
a cow's not flipping out and excited
to see you. Neither is a horse.

762
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,330
They can do little things, but nobody
gets excited like a fucking dog.

763
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,270
You know what I mean?
It's like a Dick Vibe,

764
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:00,990
right? Every time.

765
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,303
Come on,

766
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:06,420
your dog flips out like you just dunk
the ball on a fast break and the other

767
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:10,110
team called timeout. That's the
way your dog fucking reacts. Now.

768
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:13,680
I know from experiences when I was just
a boy and I would walk to school and I

769
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:17,730
used to feed this horse every day on the
way bill. Was this a Tom Sawyer movie?

770
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,511
No, it isn't.

771
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:21,930
This was my childhood and I remember
one time it wouldn't come over.

772
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,200
So I walked away and I
fuck on, I looked back,

773
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:28,590
it was doing that walk or was not in
its head and flipping out for whatever

774
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:31,320
fucking reason. It was like playing
hard to get. So I know that they can,

775
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,190
I guess on some level show a certain
level of emotion, but like, um,

776
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,690
I think maybe I'm, I
dunno what kind of dog,

777
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,900
if you get a little dog that has
a nice mushed up face, you know,

778
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:45,430
um,

779
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:50,100
maybe like one of those French bulldogs
something that snores and farts and you,

780
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,550
your boyfriend can find it funny. I
have no idea. Um, maybe a dog like that,

781
00:46:54,551 --> 00:46:55,384
but uh,

782
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:56,360
okay.

783
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,600
I, I'd find it hard to fucking believe
unless he grew up on a farm and everybody

784
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:04,000
grew up on a fucking farm on
a certain level, like date,

785
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:07,650
they got this cold bloodedness
to them. You know what I mean?

786
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,210
They've just seen too much. They've
seen fucking animals slaughtered,

787
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,853
you know?

788
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,580
Okay.

789
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,550
You know, like when they
were a kid like did dad goes,

790
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:20,800
you want chicken for dinner? Is that
what you want? [inaudible] crying.

791
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,960
You won't chicken for dinner. All right.
He come out here, you come out of Iraq,

792
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,850
come on out. Which ones is going
to be dad? I don't want chicken.

793
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,960
No. You said you want a
chicken a pick one app.

794
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:34,600
Okay,

795
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,950
boy, if you don't fucking, I'm going to
fucking have you per day interview one.

796
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,600
Then he fucking just grabs it,
puts it on the chopping block.

797
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,110
Then hands that kid the fucking
Klaver go out and do it.

798
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:52,600
I sat down, right. They lived through
that. It'd like the age is six,

799
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,560
so they don't look at animals the way
we do and I gotta be honest with you.

800
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:03,430
I remember one time I saw this guy shoot
a fucking cow cause it was bullying the

801
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:07,150
other fuck it. And it was shot a stear
cause it was bullying the other steer.

802
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:10,740
They couldn't figure out why
the, you know, you know, they,

803
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:13,030
they did come back, you know,

804
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:16,090
the next morning and like two or
three cows look like they fucking,

805
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,810
somebody tried to do a scrap, extrapolate
some fucking information from them.

806
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:24,760
Right. Is that the right word? I don't
know. But they got slapped around,

807
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:24,971
you know,

808
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:27,700
like they walked into a door and they
couldn't figure what the fuck slapping the

809
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:30,880
shit out of these stare and it turned,
they figured out which one it was.

810
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:33,100
So they were like, all right, we
got to kill this fucking thing.

811
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:33,970
But here's the deal.

812
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:37,930
We don't want the thing to be stressed
before it's killed because that'll affect

813
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:38,950
the taste of the meat.

814
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:43,660
So what they do is they just
sort hook do Buddha, Buddha,

815
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,870
they just sort of pan it
in and yeah, you know,

816
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,290
how you doing? Do p two p two and then
they just fucking take out a gun plan.

817
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,420
They fucking kill it, right? And I
was like, oh my God. So then they,

818
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,840
the guy had like this fucking this
tractor and they tied up the back things,

819
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,520
the back of its legs,

820
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:09,640
they tied up its back legs and then
they just lifted it up off the ground.

821
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:14,230
Then they gutted the fucking
thing. All the blood's pouring out,

822
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:17,590
all the fucking end trails. And I'm
just sitting there going, oh my God,

823
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,610
I'm never eaten meat again.
This is fucking horrific. Right?

824
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,470
And then they, once they fucking chop
the head and the legs off and they get,

825
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:31,280
they get the firth the hide off and
they started chopping it up out.

826
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,980
I went from like, Oh my God,

827
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:37,060
I'm never eating meat again to my
mouth watering going, holy fuck.

828
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,100
Look at all those steaks.

829
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,510
And this guy was cutting them
in like four inch fucking slabs,

830
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:46,960
like Fred Flintstone fucking
steaks. And it's just like, dude,

831
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,860
you could literally eat yourself to death
and not get a third of the way through

832
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:55,180
that fucking cow cattle or what a
steer, whatever the fuck it is. Um,

833
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,550
so I think the thing about it
is, is if he grew up in Iowa,

834
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:04,380
anywhere near a farm, that's how they
look at animals. They look at it like,

835
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:04,681
you know,

836
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:09,600
this is a food source and a don't
get too emotionally attached to it.

837
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:10,710
Keep it outside.

838
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,240
Do not give it a fucking name and
when it can't make you any more money,

839
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,070
you give it the old fucking right
there Fred. So he might be a loss cost,

840
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,450
you know what I mean? And as
bad as that might be for you,

841
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,780
I got to tell you like the fact that
he can off those feelings like that is

842
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:33,470
great if he ever have an intruder
because God help him when that guy,

843
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,410
when the intruder gets
those farmhands around them

844
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,370
fucking throwing bales, they
hay since he was four years,

845
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,600
it could farm boys strength,
Jesus Christ, that fucking,

846
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,800
all those fucking,

847
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:53,550
every offensive lineman for Nebraska
just grew up fucking punching,

848
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,770
steer in the Goddamn head,
the fucking maniacs. So, um,

849
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,040
the fact that he grew up in
Iowa might be a lost cause.

850
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,390
So I would just say try fostering
a dog. And try to just get,

851
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:09,010
get one that is cool
in chills. What if you,

852
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,460
if your boyfriend's active,

853
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:13,370
maybe you want something that's a little
more athletic, but like, you know,

854
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,930
so you can have a dog that just wants to
chill while you watch the fucking game.

855
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:21,560
I mean, that's the best. That's why I
love my dog. My dog is fucking shredded.

856
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:24,620
It makes me want to work
out. But then also, you know,

857
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,650
it is down to take a nap
any fucking time you want.

858
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,860
It's not like those sheep herd and
fucking lunatic dogs that have like add.

859
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,660
And if you don't give it a project, it
starts fucking eat in the door, you know?

860
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,100
Uh, but anyways, good luck with
that shit. Alright. Beyoncé's album.

861
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,250
Uh, dear Billy def jam,

862
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,510
my girlfriend was listening to the new
Beyonce album for a couple days straight.

863
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,440
I let her listen because, uh,
we usually listen to my music,

864
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:56,180
which is music she loves. Anyways, I
didn't say it's funny, I let her listen.

865
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,760
You know what? It's okay.
You can listen to that. Um,

866
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,860
I didn't say anything
for the first few days,

867
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:03,710
but then I just started getting
sick of hearing the same songs.

868
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,430
She understood this and did not take
offense because she's a great girl and I

869
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:10,880
don't waste my time with shitty
girlfriends who can't communicate. Dude,

870
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:13,700
I got to admit right now at this
point, you sound like, you know,

871
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,090
a girl's a great girl. As long as she
wants to do everything you wanted to do.

872
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,420
She's a great girl. I'd say
I'm sick of the two days.

873
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:23,480
I'm sick of your music and she's been
listening to your music for fucking ever.

874
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,930
Uh, maybe I'm reading into
this. Anyways, later that night,

875
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,860
we're at a bar with their friends
or with their friend who is really,

876
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,950
who has a really annoying name
that rhymes with small lien.

877
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,610
She brings up the album, the
Beyonce album and how great it is,

878
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:45,470
and my girl laughs and says, yeah, I
burnt this guy out with it pointing to me.

879
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,390
Her friend saw this as an opening to
regurgitate every stupid soundbite she's

880
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,620
read on a blog.

881
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,980
Apparently I'm not comfortable with women
being in a dominant position or if a

882
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:03,110
guy did what she did, I
wouldn't care. Uh, yeah,

883
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:03,861
I know this, this,

884
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:08,450
this happened when that Atlanta's
mortar set album came out and I remember

885
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:11,540
enjoying some of the music and
some woman in a bar was going like,

886
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,640
do you even know what the song is the
bat like? Like I should like, like a,

887
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,371
like I had some,

888
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:19,220
a relationship with the Atlantis and
she was yelling at me like I don't

889
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:23,480
understand it. You know what I mean?
The songs either fucking, you know,

890
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:25,010
either like the musical, you don't,

891
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,940
I don't give a fuck what
she's singing about. Right.

892
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,950
MMM. [inaudible]

893
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,330
at the end of the day. Yeah. If you could
fuck be fucking be singing row, row,

894
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:36,200
row your boat. If it sounds good,
I'm going to listen to it. Like,

895
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm not necessarily a fan of her shit but
that one that she did with Jack White.

896
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:45,350
I liked that song cause cause the song
sounds good and I've heard it like 10

897
00:53:45,351 --> 00:53:50,120
times cause Nia has been playing it and
I cannot tell you one fucking lyric in

898
00:53:50,121 --> 00:53:54,710
it. I don't need, I don't even know
what it's about. Um, but anyways,

899
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:58,640
I finally had to interrupt her and explain
that while I think she's what she's

900
00:53:58,641 --> 00:54:02,160
singing about is annoying.

901
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:03,780
You said it annoying is annoying.

902
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,430
My only complaint was that I was tired
of hearing the same song songs for three

903
00:54:08,431 --> 00:54:09,264
days straight.

904
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,360
She wouldn't even listen ignoring me and
the words coming out of my calm mouth

905
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,840
dismissing logic.

906
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:20,700
I turned to my girlfriend and said how
can a girl is smart as you have such

907
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,080
such one dismissed.

908
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:29,510
Oh such a one diminish
dimensional friend. Yup.

909
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:33,820
She tossed what was left
of her drink on me. Wow.

910
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:38,650
This chick is way out of line. It was
a beer bottle that was almost empty.

911
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,420
I barely got any drops on me.

912
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:45,610
She got mad when I laughed and turned
and stomped off that I say too much.

913
00:54:45,611 --> 00:54:49,690
Did I say too little? Listen, I'm not
saying you're not a dick. I think,

914
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,160
uh, I think you said, I think
what you said was perfect.

915
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:55,670
Yeah.

916
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:56,570
You know what I mean?

917
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:57,480
Yeah.

918
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,790
Like to be honest with you,

919
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,300
yeah.

920
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,840
At some point your girlfriend should
have stepped in and be like, Ben,

921
00:55:04,841 --> 00:55:08,470
like guys got, maybe she was guys, guys,
settle down, settle down, settle down.

922
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,740
Um, but whenever an album like
this comes up, I mean, she,

923
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,770
she realizes that that album is just
like a big fucking, isn't it? Like,

924
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:19,993
you know,

925
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,100
just like a big fucking, uh,
what do they call it? Trolling?

926
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,220
Isn't she just acting like
that happened? I mean,

927
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:31,000
I don't think she let calluses grow on
her feet and do all that shit that she

928
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:31,834
said.

929
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,860
She always looks like she just came from
the spa and I don't give a fuck what

930
00:55:38,861 --> 00:55:42,070
that guy did. I don't think
she's interrupting that. Um,

931
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,800
maybe she made the help go
down and go through that,

932
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,940
that biblical Shit that she was talking
about. But, uh, but whatever, you know,

933
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:52,510
they got to have that fucking, you
know, not everything's for you,

934
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:55,930
but I understand if someone's like
playing an Alvin three days straight,

935
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,230
you'd go fucking nuts. Um, but

936
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,370
I think I, yeah,

937
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:07,371
I think he went too far
because you insulted your
girlfriend's girlfriend by in

938
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:11,490
a roundabout way insulting
your own girlfriend.

939
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,433
Um,

940
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,490
you know, but that you have to
understand like women like that,

941
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:24,070
like in this day and
age, like this is like,

942
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:26,903
um,

943
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,840
this so into that shit that you're not
going to convince them one way or the

944
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:35,640
other. That's like the type of person
that acts like an asshole and just goes,

945
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:39,300
you know, guys are intimidated by me
and no point. Are they ever examining,

946
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:42,660
examining like their own behavior.
It's like, did I tell you what guys,

947
00:56:42,661 --> 00:56:43,500
when I was in Seattle,

948
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:47,550
when that woman came up in fucking
slammed her hands on the stage,

949
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:50,940
cause like the stage was up to her chin
and it scared the shit out of me cause I

950
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,470
couldn't see anything
because the lights were on.

951
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:56,730
I thought someone had jumped on
stage. Um, and I felt like that jolt,

952
00:56:56,731 --> 00:56:58,320
like right before you're
gonna get into a fight.

953
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,630
And I looked down and there
was this woman, you know,

954
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:06,060
screaming at me or
whatever. And I just said,

955
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,870
first of all, she was standing there
forever and no, no security did anything.

956
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,830
And I joked, I said to the guys
in the crowd, be like, Dude,

957
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,490
how many times would we have
been choked out at this point?

958
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,540
And dragged outta here and thrown
into the, thrown into fucking traffic.

959
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,080
This is one of these, uh,

960
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:26,700
women privileged moments where you
can just disrupt a fucking show.

961
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,600
And [inaudible] standing there yelling
at me for like 30 seconds and nobody

962
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:32,400
moved to do anything.

963
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,913
Um,

964
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:39,140
and then finally I just said, man, can
you, can you please take your seat?

965
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,030
And she goes, well, I'll take my seat,

966
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:44,690
but I don't need your permission is
what she said. And it was just like,

967
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,870
it's like, all right, I get it.
You're a feminist. But like, you know,

968
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,120
you're applying it. Like in this instance,

969
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,700
I'm not the bad guy. You're,
you're, you're the asshole.

970
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,160
I know you have a vagina.
So that makes you,

971
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:01,090
this terminal victim in your fucking
world and that you can never be in the

972
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:05,530
wrong, but believe it or not, at some
point you can be the fucking asshole. And

973
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,173
um,

974
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:12,020
what you did was you, you remain calm,

975
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,620
which is the way to beat anybody in a
fucking argument is as they get heated,

976
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:21,100
you just stay calm. And
when she had nothing else,

977
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:23,210
uh,

978
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,810
she threw your, your drink at you and
then, and then fucking stormed off.

979
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:30,410
So it was weird you won
that argument, but uh, your,

980
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:33,170
your girlfriend and apology because uh,

981
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,490
you made shit weird between
her and her girlfriend and

982
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,830
um,

983
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,900
and he kind of insulted your
own girlfriend in a way.

984
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,180
Uh,

985
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:43,871
having said that,

986
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:47,800
I applaud you for saying that cause that's
fucking hilarious and I actually wish

987
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:51,550
I could have seen that. Cause anytime
it's those types of songs come out,

988
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:56,530
there's always set that, that type
of shit of like, uh, you know, oh,

989
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:59,890
you're just saying that because this,
you just saying that because that, and

990
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,230
you know, I,

991
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,110
I don't know it because you know what I
don't like about that shit is then you

992
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,230
just, you just have this built in
fucking excuse. So it's like, oh,

993
00:59:09,231 --> 00:59:14,180
so you're never in the wrong. If I
call you out and say, you know, x,

994
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:17,630
Y, andZ , it's because of my
own issues. It's never you.

995
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,110
Um,

996
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:20,861
Jesus Christ,

997
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:25,360
that takes me back to daisy Buchanan's
in like 1990 whatever when that Atlanta

998
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,880
smores set fucking album came
out. Um, all right, here we go.

999
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:34,490
Bobbie boxing or porn.
Jesus Christ is a, a

1000
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,370
fucking wide variety
on this one. Dear Bill,

1001
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:42,880
I'm facing a dilemma in my life and I
was hoping to gain an outside opinion.

1002
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,570
I'm a 20 year old male and I've
always had aspirations of becoming a

1003
00:59:46,571 --> 00:59:49,390
professional boxer.
However, I have a problem.

1004
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,840
I fear that I'm addicted to sex. What?

1005
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,530
I already don't believe this. This
is such a fucking left turn. I think.

1006
00:59:58,531 --> 01:00:01,890
I believe this is causing problems
in my relationship with my fiance.

1007
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:04,920
I absolutely, I'm absolutely
in love with this woman.

1008
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,610
She goes out of her way to make me
happy. Sacrifice saga, got the hiccups.

1009
01:00:08,611 --> 01:00:11,440
I wolf down my breakfast before this. Um,

1010
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,810
she goes out of her way to make
me happy, sacrifice so much,

1011
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:18,620
just to be with me and
also pleasures me often

1012
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,433
rose.

1013
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:22,573
Okay.

1014
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,030
What could you just say? You have a
nice, you have a wonderful sex life.

1015
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,160
Pleasures me often. Um,

1016
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,740
I got a picture of you with
your head thrown back. Ah,

1017
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,320
why would you do that to
me? You can't. All right.

1018
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:38,380
The only problem is my
sexual frustration with her.

1019
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,620
We have passionate sex
many times during the week,

1020
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:46,270
but I still want it even more eventually
ending up growing angry and resentful

1021
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:48,610
towards her when she doesn't want to.

1022
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,630
Jesus do go rub one out and
later feeling like an asshole.

1023
01:00:52,631 --> 01:00:56,350
This brings me to ask myself,
should I just fuck for a living?

1024
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:03,090
My fiance and past partners have always
complimented me on my performance in bed

1025
01:01:03,091 --> 01:01:06,720
and my stamina. Jesus Christ. This
guy's going hard on memorial day.

1026
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:11,430
Should we have a parade for you
going up to three hours on occasions?

1027
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,013
Okay.

1028
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:20,050
I love the sport of boxing and
I've always worked toward that.

1029
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:23,800
But this problem I have sometimes just
makes me want to drop everything and go

1030
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:27,400
fuck the world. Any, any advice?

1031
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,720
This is real or fake. This is great. Any
advice you have regarding this problem,

1032
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:35,050
my relationship or career path will
be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

1033
01:01:35,051 --> 01:01:38,650
And Go fuck yourself. Well, look, if
you're boxing, you're in great shape.

1034
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:42,190
You know, I don't know if you
got the Porno Dick or not,

1035
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,950
but you definitely got the
stamina. I'm like, dude,

1036
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,500
you don't want to go into that world
if you have other fucking options,

1037
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:50,110
you don't want to go
into that world. And um,

1038
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:54,580
okay. You know that

1039
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:55,291
I really,

1040
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:59,790
there's very few like the people who seem
to make them the zillions of dollars,

1041
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,540
which is still really hard to do at this
point because porno was become free,

1042
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,160
seems to be the women.

1043
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,843
Um,

1044
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,130
they seem to be the ones
that can become, be a star,

1045
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:13,380
just cause guys watch I
guess way more of it. Yeah.

1046
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,713
Um,

1047
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,770
so I would say, uh,

1048
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:20,180
okay,

1049
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:23,330
Jesus Christ, am I going to tell you to
go get your head kicked in or fucking

1050
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:29,720
go join the dark world of
porn? Um, I would say boxing.

1051
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,510
I would say this is what I would do if
I was you. You know, you usually say,

1052
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:36,350
if you looked at, you know, something
with your fucking sex drive,

1053
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,470
they always say, you know,
boxes right before a big fight.

1054
01:02:39,471 --> 01:02:42,320
They abstain from sex for
10 days. Dude, you know,

1055
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:45,140
your only problem you can be coming
in, then your balls are going to be,

1056
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,940
feel like they're fucking
through the, the, the, the,

1057
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:51,410
the tarmac would avail you
call it the squared circle. Um,

1058
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,193
yeah,

1059
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:59,530
I say you keep fucking boxing.
You abstain from sex and uh,

1060
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:04,420
hopefully you're good at, uh,
you're good at boxing. You know,

1061
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:08,800
that is not a, that's not a fucking
good profession to just be okay at,

1062
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:13,150
because you're going to be fucking, you
know, your brain's going to be mush.

1063
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:15,743
Um,

1064
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:20,780
why don't you try, don't you try a
the UFC at least you got a chance.

1065
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,500
If you can tap out, you
can just get fucking get.

1066
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,610
Let's say you don't get knocked out.

1067
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:30,580
You don't take a bunch of head shots
in the UFC, but I mean you can get,

1068
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:31,414
you know, an arm bar.

1069
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,540
I'd rather have an arm bar they'd be
knocked out cause you can tap out before

1070
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:38,380
they pop out. You Fuck dislocate
your elbow, you get choked out,

1071
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,790
which sounds horrific to me,

1072
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:41,890
but every professional fighter
I've ever seen is like, dude,

1073
01:03:41,891 --> 01:03:44,590
I'd much rather get choked
out than knocked out. Um,

1074
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:49,450
you just go to sleep and then the
ref stops it. You fine. Right. Um,

1075
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,200
I got to tell you, that's one of
the oddest questions I've ever had.

1076
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:58,810
Um, I dunno dude,

1077
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:02,790
but God help you. If you become
successful as a, as a boxer,

1078
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:05,390
you're going to become famous and
God help your relationship then.

1079
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,893
Um,

1080
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,003
okay.

1081
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,400
There's no way to jerk it out of yourself.

1082
01:04:13,401 --> 01:04:15,850
Go out and lay on the front lawn
like one of those sprinklers.

1083
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,280
Just fucking, you know,

1084
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:22,480
shoot all your ges out and then
get on with you fucking day.

1085
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:25,740
They go do your roadwork running with
your hoodie and your timberlands on.

1086
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:28,140
I don't know what to tell you,
dude. That's, that's way beyond me.

1087
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:30,320
You sound like you need
a, you need a therapist.

1088
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,713
Um,

1089
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,970
Jesus Christ. I want to
believe that that one was true.

1090
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:39,240
I don't know about that one. But anyways,
that is the podcast for this week.

1091
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:40,260
Happy Memorial Day.

1092
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:45,261
Everybody enjoy your day off and
I'll check on 'em on Thursday.

1093
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,410
Yeah, that's right.
Alright, go fuck yourself.
