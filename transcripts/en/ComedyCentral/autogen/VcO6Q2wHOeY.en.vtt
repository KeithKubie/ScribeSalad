he<00:01:51.869><c> is</c><00:01:52.020><c> running</c><00:01:52.409><c> I</c><00:01:52.619><c> have</c><00:01:53.009><c> a</c><00:01:53.040><c> different</c><00:01:53.399><c> theory</c>

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 align:start position:0%
he is running I have a different theory
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.249 align:start position:0%
he is running I have a different theory
I<00:01:53.700><c> feel</c><00:01:54.000><c> like</c><00:01:54.149><c> because</c><00:01:54.329><c> Tom</c><00:01:54.689><c> Cruise</c><00:01:54.960><c> is</c><00:01:55.110><c> so</c>

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 align:start position:0%
I feel like because Tom Cruise is so
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.810 align:start position:0%
I feel like because Tom Cruise is so
short<00:01:55.759><c> running</c><00:01:56.759><c> makes</c><00:01:57.000><c> him</c><00:01:57.180><c> look</c><00:01:57.360><c> taller</c><00:02:01.790><c> yeah</c>

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
short running makes him look taller yeah
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 align:start position:0%
short running makes him look taller yeah
so<00:02:03.240><c> it's</c><00:02:03.479><c> like</c><00:02:03.630><c> women</c><00:02:03.840><c> are</c><00:02:04.140><c> more</c><00:02:04.380><c> excited</c><00:02:04.829><c> to</c>

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
so it's like women are more excited to
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.469 align:start position:0%
