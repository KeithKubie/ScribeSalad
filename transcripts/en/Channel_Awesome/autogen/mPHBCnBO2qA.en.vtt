of the spiritual world and it's just so
 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.300
of the spiritual world and it's just so
chopped up and I think part of good

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310

storytelling is that you do sort of want

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110
storytelling is that you do sort of want
 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.890
storytelling is that you do sort of want
to be balanced out and and you know

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900
to be balanced out and and you know
 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.450
to be balanced out and and you know
spread throughout the whole thing so

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460
spread throughout the whole thing so
 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.310
spread throughout the whole thing so
it's I mean when we finally get to the

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320
it's I mean when we finally get to the
 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.220
it's I mean when we finally get to the
spirit stuff it's great heck even maybe

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.680
some of the stuff with you know with the
whole crime story and everything could

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690
whole crime story and everything could
 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.510
whole crime story and everything could
have been good if it was paced out there

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520

looking at a lot of the credits it seems

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440
looking at a lot of the credits it seems
 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.380
looking at a lot of the credits it seems
like the original creators did not have

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390
like the original creators did not have
 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.460
like the original creators did not have
writing duties yeah that that's why

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470
writing duties yeah that that's why
 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.080
writing duties yeah that that's why
many episodes I think they had the

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090
many episodes I think they had the
 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.700
many episodes I think they had the
previous episode with the original

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710
previous episode with the original
 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.730
previous episode with the original
