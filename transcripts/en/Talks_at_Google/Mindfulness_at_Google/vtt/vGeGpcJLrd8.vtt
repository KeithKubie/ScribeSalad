00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.699
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.240
It's my pleasure,
privilege and honor

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.530
to welcome to the
Google campus, swami

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.530
Dayamrita Chaitanya, Executive
Director of the M.A. Center.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.640
The M.A. Center is a
nonprofit Institute

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.110
in San Ramon,
California dedicated

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.200
to spreading the message of
love and compassion spread

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.480
by Amma, also popularly
known as the Hugging Saint.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.530
Dayamrita's first name literally
means [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.290
which means "compassion"
and "nectar,"

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.340
or "someone who swims in
nectarian compassion."

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.900
So it's only rather
fitting that he

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.020
has chosen to speak to us
Googlers about how compassion

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.610
can help us become
better humans, personally

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.600
and professionally.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.420
But that's not how
Dayamrita Chaitanya

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.560
thought his life would go.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.500
During undergrad days
he studied physics

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.460
and he was very
interested in film,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.600
so he enrolled or a
master's in film technology

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.226
in the prestigious Film and
Television Institute of India,

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:05.850
and he thought he
would end up becoming

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.020
a documentary
filmmaker, or maybe even

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.950
better, a Hollywood celebrity.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.930
And then in 1983, he met
his spiritual teacher, Mata

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440
Amritanandaymi,
also popularly known

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.050
as Amma, the Hugging Saint, a
simple fisher-woman who went on

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.530
to become a very well renowned
humanitarian around the world.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.400
And he was struck by her simple
message of love and compassion,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.124
and serving others through
love and compassion.

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:36.540
And he was so moved
by her message

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.820
and how she lived
this in practice

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.670
that he gave up his film
career to dedicate himself

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.380
fully to her work, to
her humanitarian projects

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.810
around the world.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.830
And in 1993, he was
ordained as a monk,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.460
and for the last decade,
Dayamrita Chaitanya

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.490
has been the Executive
Director of the M.A. Center

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.400
where this organization,
this nonprofit,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.030
spreads Amma's message
of love and service,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.060
or compassion and action,
throughout the Western world.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.300
And he's done and led a
number of projects here,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.780
including projects in Haiti
during the earthquake,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.400
New Orleans during the
New Orleans disaster.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.810
So therefore to talk about
how to live compassion

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.430
on a day to day basis, and
how it can transform us

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.000
inside out, personally
and professionally, please

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.420
help me welcome to the
Google Campus once again,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.540
Swami Dayamrita Chaitanya.

00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:30.580
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA:
Thank you so much

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.260
and good afternoon, everybody.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.800
I've been watching some of
the online YouTube videos

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.670
about how Googlers have be
doing some compassionate action,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.270
so I might be preaching to the
choir, so please forgive me.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.950
Many of us have
discussed and meditated

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.700
upon the meaning of
life, and life by itself

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.380
is meaningless to some.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.810
Yet, one can make a beautiful
life by living it meaningfully,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.000
and what makes life blossom
is how we live and attribute

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.890
the meaning to it.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.350
We spend most of our lives in
pursuit of material happiness

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.940
and fulfillment of
desires, and yet,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.800
after fulfilling
many of it we still

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.380
feel the void and
lack of contentment.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.520
So as some great people
have defined, or tried

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.640
to define what life is, there's
a famous author W.M. Lewis,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.010
he said, the tragedy of life
is not that it end's so soon,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.950
but that we wait so
long to begin it.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.290
And there's another great
salesman, and he said,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.540
I think everybody should
get rich and famous

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.140
and do everything that they
ever dreamt so that they

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.920
can see that's not the answer.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.430
And the most
beautiful quote comes

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.840
from the famous Indian
poet, Rabindranath Tagore,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.850
and he said, the
most important lesson

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.240
that man can learn
from life is not

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.640
that there is pain
in this world,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.370
but it is possible for him
to transmute it into joy.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.760
So while we ponder
about the solution

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.880
to the modern day
problems, everybody

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.670
agrees that compassion
is the perfect solution.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.750
And what is compassion?

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.560
There's so many definitions
to it, but very simply

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.450
put it's love plus
action is compassion.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.280
And my master, Amma, she
says's that there are two types

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.440
of poverty in the world today.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.820
The poverty due to the
lack of material wealth,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.680
and the poverty due
to the lack of love,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.020
and if we solve the
second one, which

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.570
is the poverty due
to the lack of love,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.380
then naturally the first
one also will be solved.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.360
In one sense, we
have role models

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.670
for everything today, a
great football player,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.510
a great scientist,
a great movie star,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.240
what we lack is a role model for
a great compassionate person.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.160
And when we talk about
love in this world,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.770
most of the love that we
experience in the world today

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.200
is selfish love.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.580
Few people know how
to love selflessly.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.020
We love the cow because
it gives us milk,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.820
and as long as it gives
milk we will love it,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.770
and the moment it
stops giving milk then

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.190
we do not hesitate to
send it the butcher.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.110
And the love also that
we have for one another

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.600
and for the worldly
objects are like this.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.550
It reminds me of a story.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.570
A woman, accompanied
by her husband,

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.600
went to the doctor's office
and after his checkup

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.170
the doctor called a wife
into the office alone,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.130
and he said your
husband is suffering

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:43.010
from a very severe disease
combined with horrible stress,

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.100
and if you don't
do the following

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.820
your husband will surely die.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.190
And each morning, you have to
fix them a healthy breakfast,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.460
be pleasant and make sure
that he's in a good mood.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.620
And for lunch, make
him a nutritious meal,

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.010
and for dinner prepare an
especially nice entree for him.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.770
And don't burden
him with chores,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.450
as he probably had a
hard day, and don't

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.280
discuss your problems
with him, it will only

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.310
make his stress worse.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.490
And most importantly, you
should satisfy his every whim,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.580
and let him unburden
his problems onto you

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.910
and he should have no stress.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:32.480
And also, be especially loving
and affectionate towards him.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.800
And if you can do this for
the next 10 months to a year

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.680
I think you're husband will
completely regain his health.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.690
So as the wife went to
the doctor's office alone,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.590
her husband was curious.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.260
So on the way home the
husband asked his wife,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.830
what did the doctor say?

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.917
So the wife just
replied very coolly,

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:00.625
he said you're going
to die in 10 months.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.300
So what does selfless
love mean then?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.540
[INAUDIBLE] in the
dark about this

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.080
while we have such stark
examples of selflessness right

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.270
in front of our eyes.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.390
Now, we have not become
aware of such examples.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.490
If you look at nature
it's serving us

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.630
without asking
anything in return.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.800
24/7.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.510
And even while
cutting down a tree,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.539
it gives us shade and
protects the person

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.280
who's cutting it down.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.010
And it is thanks to nature
that our lives are sustained

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.870
and we have fresh air to
breathe and pure water to drink

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.110
and the temperatures are
sustained so that it does not

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.240
affect life here on Earth.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.400
And yet, we abuse
and exploit nature

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.030
though nature gives selflessly
without expecting anything

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.980
in return.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.620
And compassion and
selflessness go hand in hand.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.860
Only if we have selflessness
does compassion work.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.850
Compassion is also love
without expectation.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.860
A compassionate person does
not expect even a thank you

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.150
from the person to whom they
have offered their help.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.420
And we have different degrees
of love and compassion

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.560
is the highest and the
purest form of love

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.920
that a human being can
practice in day to day life.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.100
It is recognizing
that the person is

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.580
a part of the sum
of your whole being

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.940
and not looking at them
as separate from you.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.370
So what is the difference
between helping someone

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.310
and being in compassionate
service to them?

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.060
Now while helping
somebody you always

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.670
place yourself in a higher
pedestal and the person whom

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.000
you are helping in a lower one.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.090
And knowing that
they need your help,

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.330
but as in a
compassionate service,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.480
you place this other
person in the same level,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.680
or you place them even at a
higher level and serve them.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.190
So why should we
practice compassion

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.930
in our personal and
professional life?

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.380
Most of you are already aware.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.630
A compassionate person
is more productive.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.912
He brings happiness, not only
to himself, but to others too.

00:10:37.912 --> 00:10:39.370
And mind you, there
is a difference

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.750
between a compassionate
person and a happy person.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.540
A happy person is one
who feels temporarily

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.620
fulfilled and content, whereas
a compassionate person is

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.870
one who does not care about
temporary happiness that

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.540
is brought through the
fulfillment of material

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.870
and emotional desires.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.430
And no amount of material wealth
can bring contentment also.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.330
Just think about you
take the two richest

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.614
people in this world.

00:11:11.614 --> 00:11:12.530
You know who they are.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:22.510
Who are the two richest
people on the Forbes list?

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:30.810
Bill Gates is the first one,
and the second one is Carlos.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.330
And Bill Gates has
an asset, which

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:42.010
is equal to about $160 billion,
and Carlos Slim, from Mexico,

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.030
he has an asset worth
about $150 billion.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:51.130
And last year, actually Carlos
Slim was the most wealthiest

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.630
because he had $170 billion and
Bill Gates had $150 billion,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:01.580
and now he has been promoted
or demoted to the second rank.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.330
So just think how he feels
when he compares himself with

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.290
Bill Gates.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.590
Will he feel rich or poor?

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:14.040
Because he is only $150 billion
instead of $160 billion,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.980
which is what Bill Gates has.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.550
So in one sense,
what makes us rich

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.780
is not the amount
of material wealth,

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.360
but what we have is that, as I
said from the contentment that

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.590
gives from the giving and
not from what we receive.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:41.620
And how do we practice
this in our daily life?

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.760
Just simple things like
thinking about daily that you

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.400
will do one good deed a day.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.970
So when you come into the
office and sit at your desk,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.520
most people think about the work
that is piled on their desk,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.020
right?

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.310
And they rarely stop
and tend to look around

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.430
at the person
sitting next to them

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.830
and ask them how they
are doing or if they

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.310
are having a difficulty.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.640
A big smile makes
a huge difference.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.060
Going back home also, you
can practice compassion

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.790
in your daily lives.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.450
My spiritual master gives
the example of surgeon

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.950
who goes to the hospital
and does so many surgeries

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:32.370
on people, saving many lives,
and then goes back home.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.250
And what if he behaves like
a surgeon at home also?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.460
What if he starts cutting
open his children?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.490
Or doing something to his wife?

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.440
So in our day to
day lives we have

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.270
to take so many different
roles, and choosing

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.900
the role which is most
beneficial to the other person

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.940
is also compassion.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.400
Sometimes you might
ask this question.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.030
I have to be strict, and I
have to be stern to people,

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.570
and what will I do at that time?

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.930
So definitely, we have
to see that is also

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.070
another form of compassion.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:20.990
Like once a person went to
my special master and said,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.350
he's written a book, what
should he do with this book?

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.640
So my master said,
just go and give it

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.520
to this such and such person.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.170
And here she will read the
book and give you suggestions

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.830
as to how the book will be.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.370
Now, after she read
the book-- she was also

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:48.070
a disciple-- she looked at the
person straight on his face

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.330
and said, you know, this
book is of no quality

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.120
and what you have
written is rubbish.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.480
But what happened
was of course the man

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.765
should have had a heart attack,
but instead the man took

00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:07.050
it very humbly and he completely
rewrote the book, which

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.890
became a best seller later on.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.650
So compassion is
also discrimination

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.310
as to what the person
whom you are serving

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.430
needs at that moment to hear.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:26.260
And also, helping nature
is also compassion.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.150
Do something which
is good for nature.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.990
My master often tells
people to just grow

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.630
vegetables in their home
and just getting good food,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.080
and then it's not only good for
the nature, it's good for us

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.580
also.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:51.630
Also, we should think
about why action is always

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.310
a part of compassion.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.790
So we should try to
act and do something.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.910
So when we ask this question,
what is the greatest

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.720
benefit of compassion, and
why should you do this,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.870
why should you practice
this every day?

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:11.680
Because whatever you give,
it comes back to naturally.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.630
There's a beautiful story.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:22.550
Once there was a lady doctor
who was driving on a freeway,

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.910
and it was a dark night.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.160
And it was a very rainy
night, it was very cold,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.250
and suddenly, her car
stalled and she was

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.900
lucky to pull over to the side.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.760
And as she was waiting
there she called AAA,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:47.690
and AAA said that it will
take at least half an hour

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.210
to two hours for them to come.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.720
And it was a very busy
night, and a lot of people

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.730
had requested for so
many calls, so they

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.360
said it probably will be
anywhere close to two hours.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.520
So as she was standing there,
there were so many cars

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.760
zooming by and not
even one car did stop.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.530
And finally after 45
minutes one car stopped,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.940
and as she was looking
at her rear view

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:23.970
mirror she saw a big guy
getting out of the car

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:29.350
and he was walking
towards her car.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.430
And the moment she saw him,
she started getting nervous.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.090
And the first thought
that went into her mind

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:41.260
was does this person know
that I'm alone and I'm a lady

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.360
and then maybe he wants
to rob me and take away

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.550
all my possessions.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:53.800
But as he came nearer, he just
gently knocked on the window.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.255
And as she opened the
window he asked her, ma'am,

00:17:57.255 --> 00:17:58.130
what happened to you?

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.850
Can I help you?

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.990
And she said, oh, I called
AAA, and he said look,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.360
I know what it is,
tonight is a rainy night

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.690
and there's so many demands,
it might take you to two

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.100
to two and a half three hours.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.070
They say two hours, but
it might take three hours.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.910
But I'm a mechanic,
and I will try

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.790
to see what's wrong
with your car.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.240
So reluctantly, the lady
agreed and then he said,

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.380
why don't you do something?

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.610
Your car doesn't even start, why
don't you go and sit in my car

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.770
and you can just sit there
in my car, comfortably.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:43.640
So the next thought that came
into the lady doctor's mind

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.470
was oh, now I know why,
he wants to steal my car

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.800
and go run away with it.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.900
And he wants to give
me his old Toyota.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.340
So then as she was debating
whether to go or not,

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:03.510
finally she conceded and she
went to his car and sat there.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:09.150
And half an hour later
the car began running

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.390
and the man came back and told
her, now your car is running,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.230
but one thing, just make sure
you just goes straight home

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.330
and tomorrow morning you
can take it to the mechanic,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.590
but please don't
drive any further

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.490
because I'm not sure whether
the car will run further.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.520
So as she was going back
home, she started thinking,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.270
why did I doubt this
person unnecessarily?

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.450
He was such a nice person.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.320
And the other thing
that she was doing

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.460
was also, as she was about to
go she started offering him

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.240
some money.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.480
And he said no, no,
there's no need for money.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.440
I didn't do it for that and I
don't want any money from you.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.170
Just don't worry about it.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.130
So as she was driving
home, she started thinking,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.040
why did he do this?

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.600
Why did he do this action?

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:08.430
So what left her pondering for
two weeks as to why he did it,

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.510
and then she could not sit
quiet unless she returned

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.620
that favor to somebody else.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.520
So she was looking
for an opportunity

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.640
to do something
to somebody else,

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:23.810
and it was two weeks later as
she was sitting in a restaurant

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:29.690
and she saw there was a
waitress who was serving there.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.850
She was clutching her stomach
and she was running around

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.720
and doing things.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.410
When she saw her, she
was immediately reminded

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:46.390
of this person and said I should
try to do something to her.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.580
So she went and asked
her what her problem was,

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:55.630
and the waitress said look,
I'm supposed to deliver a baby,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.600
and we don't have
insurance and my husband

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.370
has gone to bring
some money and to pay

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.840
so that I can get
admitted in the hospital,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.140
and I don't have any money.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.060
And so I'm just
waiting for my husband,

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.580
meanwhile I'm having
all these convulsions,

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.510
so I don't know what to do.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.300
So the lady doctor
said, will you

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.730
please come with me immediately.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.870
I will take you to
my hospital, and I

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.660
will deliver the baby myself.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.320
Don't worry about the
money, just come with me.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:33.190
So meanwhile as they were going
the waitress called her husband

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.620
and told her that there's
a kind doctor who took her

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.260
to the hospital and such
and such a hospital,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.750
so he should just come there.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.600
And the doctor
delivered the baby

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.330
and three hours later, the
husband rushed inside the room

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.690
to happily see the
mother and the baby.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:22:00.150
And after having the
moments with his child,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.070
he suddenly started
thinking about how

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:09.030
he was going to pay back for all
the service that was rendered.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:13.880
And he was about
to get up and run,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.860
and then he asked
his wife look, I

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.730
don't know how to pay
for all the services

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.740
that has being given to
us, what should I do?

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.800
So the wife smiled
and said you know,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.130
the doctor said there
was no need to pay,

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.750
and she has paid everything.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:35.390
So the husband was
so surprised and he

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.300
asked her, who's that doctor?

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.462
I want to meet her.

00:22:39.462 --> 00:22:40.420
Let me go and meet her.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.970
Just tell me her name.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:46.950
So it was at this moment the
doctor walked into the room,

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.270
and both of them just
looked at each other

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.360
and just talked for a moment.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.670
And tears were running
out of their eyes.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.380
You know who it was, it
was the same lady doctor

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.100
that he had helped earlier.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:08.890
So when we are young, we
dream of accomplishment.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.890
We want to be innovators.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.700
We want to be champions
of great causes.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.890
It hardly occurs to us to
practice the smaller steps

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.270
of connection along the way.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.330
One kind word, one
considerate action.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.880
A considerate action
on a daily basis

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.340
will broaden our experience, our
understanding, and perhaps even

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.170
our opportunities to reach
our more lofty goals.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.710
And so, what we
have to practice is

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.900
in baby steps, a kind action,
a kind word, a kind deed.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.790
It's like this story of a
man who was walking along

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:58.210
on a deserted beach at sunset.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.690
And as he walked, he could see
a young boy in the distance.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.570
As he drew nearer, he
noticed that the boy

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.825
kept bending down, picking
something up and throwing it

00:24:08.825 --> 00:24:11.740
into the water.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.300
And time and time again, he kept
hurling things into the ocean.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.720
And as the man
approached even closer,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.650
he was able to see that the boy
was picking up starfish that

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.660
had being washed on the beach.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.280
And one at a time, he
was throwing them back

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.910
into the water.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.760
The man asked the boy,
what he was doing.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.690
And the boy replied, I'm
throwing these washed up

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.880
starfish back into
the ocean or else

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.900
they will die through
lack of oxygen.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.060
But the man said, look,
you can't possibly

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.100
save all of them.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.980
There are thousands
on this beach,

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.110
and this must be
happening on hundreds

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.070
of beaches along the coast.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.120
You can't possibly
make a difference.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.360
And the boy looked
down, frowning,

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.830
for a moment then bent down
to pick up another starfish,

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.540
smiling as he threw
it back into the sea.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:16.160
He replied, now, I made a
huge difference to that one.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.260
So I'll just stop with
one of my favorite quotes

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.460
by Ralph Waldo Emerson,
the great poet,

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:32.140
and he said, the purpose
of life is not to be happy.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:36.920
It is to be useful, to be
honorable, to be compassionate,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:43.530
to make some difference that
you have lived and lived well.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.130
Thank you.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.420
AUDIENCE: The story of the
mechanic and the doctor,

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.150
that's not bound to happen.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:02.240
So what is it that comes
around that is bound to happen?

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.100
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA: No,
that's actually a true story.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.683
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
it will not happen

00:26:09.683 --> 00:26:13.540
in a million years again, or
in a thousand years again.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.530
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA: I'll just,
as an example of what I said,

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.500
whatever you give,
it comes back to you

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.900
in one form or the other.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:27.921
So I'm just trying to sell
compassion in one way.

00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:30.170
Like you are all trying to
sell so many products here,

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.970
I'm trying to sell compassion.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:32.800
That's my job.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.430
I was doing that,
and by doing so,

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.090
I'm illustrating
through this story

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.440
that it is bound to happen
to you when you help somebody

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:55.230
or you will definitely get help
from some other person totally

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.560
unknown.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.720
And I've seen this again
and again a thousand times.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.680
So I am sure that
it will come back.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.196
That's what I meant.

00:27:05.196 --> 00:27:07.050
MALE SPEAKER: But then
it's not selfless.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.050
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA: No,
but it becomes selfless

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.680
when you don't expect it to
come back, but what I'm saying

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.180
is that when you do it without
expectation, definitely

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.076
it will come back to you.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.480
AUDIENCE: Certainly
doing good deeds

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.730
on a daily basis,
even small ones,

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.100
is a way to practice compassion.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.010
I'm wondering are
there any other ways

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.160
that you can really
practice it to get

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.899
yourself to have that awareness,
to make it a habit to do that?

00:27:42.899 --> 00:27:45.190
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA: See,
most of the time what happens

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.512
is we are thinking
about ourselves, not

00:27:48.512 --> 00:27:49.220
the other person.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:58.260
I've seen my master, who is
an embodiment of compassion,

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.220
she sits and hugs people
and one time what happened

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:07.570
was as she was hugging one
person he was about to get up

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:12.310
suddenly he just got up
inadvertently, and went and hit

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:16.990
her head and both their head's
went and hit each other.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.830
And usually what happens
when our heads get hit,

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:25.900
the first reaction is our
hand goes and covers our head

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.710
and starts rubbing it.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.120
And what I saw was instead
of covering her own head,

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.130
she went and started
rubbing his head.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.840
She didn't think about herself,
so most of the time that's what

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.840
happens to us, like we
are in a place where

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.400
we think about ourselves and
not about the other person.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.410
So what you can just
start doing as an exercise

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.550
when you are with somebody
else, think about what they want

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.250
or what they would like to be.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.510
How can you help, in one sense,
give them some kind of thing,

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.600
or do something
to them which will

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.224
make their lives a
little more happier.

00:29:07.224 --> 00:29:08.640
AUDIENCE: I was
interested in what

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.140
you said about how if we
solve the poverty of love,

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.560
we solve the poverty of
material goods as well,

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.730
and I believe that,
but I also believe

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.420
that being in a place of
privilege where you have

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.620
enough material goods
maybe that makes it easier

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.349
to be compassionate and to
think about these issues.

00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:28.890
And I'm just wondering
what you think

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.260
about the relationship
between taking care of people

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.900
materially and
taking care of people

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.442
in terms of teaching
them compassion.

00:29:35.442 --> 00:29:36.858
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA:
Of course you

00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:39.380
know we have to take care
of people materially,

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:44.720
I'm not saying that, but from
a wider perspective that's

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:50.190
what I was just saying
that first of all,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.270
we have to have love
for what we are doing

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.940
or for what we are
giving to them,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.190
and it also starts with
compassion to them.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.160
That's why are giving.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.590
Otherwise you would
think, why don't I

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.720
just go and see a
movie, or go to the bar.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.600
Why should I just spend
my time doing something

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.290
for the other person?

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.880
I'm wasting my time.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.020
So unless and until you have
that kind of a compassion

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:21.870
and love then it's not going
to materialize into action,

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.030
so that's what I was saying.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.690
I'm not saying that you should
not do it material-wise,

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:36.620
because of course
there's a famous Indian

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.230
[INAUDIBLE] swami.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:43.890
He said, you cannot talk
about spirituality to a hungry

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.830
person, because the first thing
that you need to do it feed his

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.560
hunger, and you should
not talk to him,

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.860
you should not give him advice
without feeding him first.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.690
So it's like that.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.490
So you have to take care
of their physical needs,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.580
definitely.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.100
AUDIENCE: I just had a question
that even kind of forms

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.350
from under the first question.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.990
A lot of people tend to
be very, very logical,

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.060
and they end up being a
little skeptical of some

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.480
of the stories you tell.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.410
What have you seen in your
own journey that really helps

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.920
connect with people like
that that may just be,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.640
oh that's very, very improbable,
or that won't really happen.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.210
How can you really share
the message with them

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.970
if they take a much more
skeptical view, versus somebody

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.555
who may be more open-minded
to the spirituality

00:31:26.555 --> 00:31:27.180
of mindfulness?

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.000
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA:
It's a good question,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.570
but first of all, we
have to be convinced

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.010
about what we are talking
about, and we have

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.340
to come from the heart
and not from the head,

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.550
and it's not just an
intellectual analysis of what

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.190
I'm telling you today this
is also my experience.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.240
I'm sharing with you my
experienced after having

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.690
being with so many people, after
having served so many people,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:05.360
and these stories come from
experience, my own experience

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.500
and from the heart.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.530
And if it doesn't
come from the heart,

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.980
you cannot convince people
if it's coming from the head.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:20.150
And second thing is,
as I said earlier,

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:24.710
people are always
skeptical, but when

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.452
you tell them with an
open heart and if they

00:32:28.452 --> 00:32:30.620
are ready to hear
with an open heart

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.730
there's always a
small opening there.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.030
And they might think
oh, perhaps there's

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.430
some truth to what
you're saying,

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.740
so you have to
give them a chance.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.140
Definitely you have to give them
a chance to open their heart

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.790
and widened the
horizons of their heart.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:53.110
So you have to
have that fate that

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:58.450
they, one day or the other, they
will have a small opening where

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.670
they will be able
to listen and then

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.650
be able to pour themselves
out and do something.

00:33:05.934 --> 00:33:07.350
AUDIENCE: So if
you're persistent,

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.594
you have a chance of catching
them at the right time?

00:33:09.594 --> 00:33:10.719
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA: Right.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.980
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.030
I'm Igor and I have a
question about expectations.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.360
So you mentioned that it's
important to void expecting

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.320
some outcome, or
something that comes back,

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.920
so I know about myself and
about some other people,

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.455
that a lot of people actually
feel that something is missing.

00:33:33.455 --> 00:33:37.660
We want this,
we're missing that.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.440
Any tips on how to
avoid expectations,

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.450
about how to avoid expecting
a return, something in return.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.370
DAYAMRITA CHAITANYA:
Correct me if I'm not

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.390
answering you properly.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.990
There's beautiful
words in Bhagavad Gita

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:01.770
says you should do
your action and don't

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.850
worry about the result.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.090
So without expecting
the result, you're

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.159
not going to do an action.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:09.658
Correct?

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.580
But the thing is, I'll tell
you an example of this.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.770
For example, you are
going to meet a friend

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.239
and ask him for some
money because you're

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:27.510
in need of money, so
you want like $2,000.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.770
Correct?

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:32.600
So what happens is, I'm
just saying an example,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:38.060
and what happens is he
can give you $2,000,

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.239
or sometimes if he's
in a very happy mood he

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:45.400
says oh, take $4,000 and
don't worry, don't return it.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:50.600
Or the other thing is he
can say, I have only $1,000,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.460
I don't have money, or he could
say I was going to come to you

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.410
and ask money from you.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:58.060
Correct?

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.200
So there are
different scenarios,

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.610
Selfless expectation
means expectation thinking

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.590
about the possible outcomes.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.240
So what happens is
the beauty of that

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:28.190
is because whatever outcome
that comes, you're not depressed

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.870
or you're not
crying, you are not

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.190
worrying about what the
outcome is, because you already

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.740
know that you're
already expecting

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.760
what the expectation would be.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.260
So it's kind of just
trying to understand

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.030
what will be the results
of your expectations.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:52.280
I'm not saying that you should
not have expectations, so just

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:58.290
have an awareness that
whatever expectation,

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.040
there are different
forms of results to that.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:08.710
So I'll just do a very
quick two to three minutes,

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.080
so kindly said straight.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.410
Before you close your eyes,
try to look at the ceiling

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:26.420
or just have a vacant stare
and slowly try and become

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:31.220
aware of your breathing
process inside

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.000
and whatever is happening
inside the body.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.000
Let's try to follow each
and every inhalation

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.100
and exhalation
that occurs within,

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.450
and try to breathe normally.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.890
And as you slowly and
slowly breathe and become

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:07.390
aware and more and more aware
of your breath and the process

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:12.870
your eyes will slowly
close without any effort

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:13.820
from your part.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.235
Then you feel
completely relaxed.

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:42.620
And slowly start
feeling the light--

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.580
area of light
inside your heart--

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.920
Which is the center of the
body, not the physical heart,

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.050
but the spiritual heart.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:10.120
And as the light slowly
starts spreading and filling

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.190
your whole being,
imagine that you're

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:20.489
being filled with love,
with bliss, with peace,

00:38:20.489 --> 00:38:21.155
with compassion.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:32.640
And feel each and
every cell in your body

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.875
being filled with that light.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:51.880
And feel every cell
reverberating with love,

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.300
with peace and with compassion.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:16.730
And imagine your whole
being completely immersed

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:21.716
and just becoming one with
that light, and only the light

00:39:21.716 --> 00:39:22.216
exists.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:34.870
Now visualize the light
going from your heart

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:40.500
towards the whole world, to
all the beings in this world,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.930
to the nature, just like
the rays of the sun.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.140
And imagine this light, just
like the rays of the sun,

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.100
going out to all the beings,
and as the light falls

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.760
on each and every
being, imagine they also

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.447
become more loving,
more peaceful, and more

00:40:02.447 --> 00:40:03.030
compassionate.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.200
And imagine this whole world
and this whole universe

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.960
to be filled with the light of
love, peace, and compassion.

00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:27.830
MALE SPEAKER: And with that
I'll close up this session

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.330
and wanted to once
again thank swami

work and his message

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.700
of compassion, and for taking
the time to come to explore

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.440
