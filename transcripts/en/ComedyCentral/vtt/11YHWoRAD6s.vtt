- [Men Whispering] Dead Kevin

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.441
(vacuum)

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.610
- Guys it's looking great.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.580
- Wanna help me move the couch?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.414
- What?

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.784
- Wanna help me move the couch?

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.119
So I can vacuum?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.155
- Ready?

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.189
- Yeah, ready?

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.657
- One, Two, Three

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.260
(all grunting)

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.544
- Oh, oh yeah!

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.279 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Do you mind if I?
- I think I remember when I

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.247
first moved in.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.449
- I dropped it on the ground.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.283
- A few weeks ago

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.118
- I had a dollar

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.287
- No, here's the thing,
I am usually, honestly,

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:56.656
the one who has the most
dollars, so statistically,

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.092
but I don't need it,
but it is probably

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.195
- Yeah, I mean I was always
kind of more of a cash guy.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.396
- What does that mean?

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.465
- You do use credit,
we use, we're like cash

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.534
- [Guy Green Shirt] I have a
shoe box in my room that I just

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.104 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You know I feel like
you guys need it the most,

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.305
I don't need it the
most, necessarily

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.773
- [Guy Green Shirt]
I don't need it.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:15.275
- [Guy Purple Shirt]
Yeah okay I need it.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.776
I need it.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.078
- [Guy Green Shirt] Yeah but
I don't, I think we've agreed

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.279
that it's not yours.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.814 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Guy Red Shirt] I
agree that you need it,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.582
because of how your life is
going, but I earn it because

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.185 align:start size:84% position:16%
of hard work and
education. And I, so.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.753
- Need it, I'm just
gonna say I need it.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.188
- It's my dollar.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.658
- I don't

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.093
- It's my dollar.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.097 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You can't just say
that. You can't just say

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.598 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Know that honestly, I
don't mean to attack but this

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.566
is typical of you.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.700
- But you do attack.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.102
You do attack, constantly.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start position:0%
- I don't want this to
compromise, to come come between

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.371
- Do you remember last week?

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.006
- No, no because I
don't remember, Jack,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.575 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't remember.
- But you didn't let me say

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.111
- What I remember is that
I'm usually, statistically

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.345
- No, but remember I was like,
we should get some strippers

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.947
- Oh! The strippers thing

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.281
- And I threw up
all the money I had

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.950
- You threw up dollars
and no strippers came.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.618
- Ey! Hey!

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.887
Let's just leave the dollar.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.390
It's not worth it.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.892
- Yeah I mean he's right man.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.494
It's like it's just a dollar.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.529 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Just leave for the next
people who live here?

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.563
- It's like a good deed.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:11.798
- Yeah

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.299
- Do our good deed
and leave my dollar.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.268
- Leave a dollar.
Leave the dollar.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.170
- [Guy Red Shirt]
Yeah, screw it.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.838
- [Purple Shirt Guy]
It's just a dollar.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.274
- [Green Shirt Guy]
Bury the secret.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.876
- It's a dollar.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.377
- What are we, crazy?

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.545
- If I had a dollar for
every time we fought over

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.647
a dollar, I'd have a dollar!

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.915
- We're best friends

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.183
- We're best friends

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.018
- We'll go our separate
ways, and then we'll all

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.453
be fine about it.

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.190
- Hey!

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.960
- Hey you get back here, I
knew he was going to do this.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.795
- It was mine anyways!

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.200
- Alright, you can
have the dollar.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.303 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's Jack's dollar.
It's your dollar.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.682
- Oh P.U, the economy
stink hurts, stinks.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.586
Look at way down at the Dow
Jones and how inflation is

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:07.887
affecting you.

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:09.522
- Oh we'd just like
you to subscribe.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.356
- What's weird things
you do with money?

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.691
- Affecting you.
