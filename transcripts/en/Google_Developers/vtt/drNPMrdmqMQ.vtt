ANDREW BROGDON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.674
I'm Andrew from
the Flutter team.

00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:05.010
And you may have heard
that on December 4,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.590
we're throwing a big party for
the Flutter community called

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.000
Flutter Live.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.959
Whether you're able to
attend in London or not,

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.999
you'll still be able to
see all the presentations

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.475
from the event since it will
be streaming live on YouTube.

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.310
Flutter Live is about
community though,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.470
which means us hearing from
all of you around the globe.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.530
So after the
presentations conclude,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.080
the stream will cut to
me, live from London,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.225
answering your questions during
the Ask Flutter post show.

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:29.850
If you want more
detail about something

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.130
that was just announced,
have a technical question

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.110
about the SDK, or just
want to see someone

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.860
do a bit of hacking
on one of the features

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.400
so you can see how it
works, I'm your Huckleberry.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.650
And if you have a question
I'm not equipped to handle,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.240
I'll find someone
at Flutter Live who

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.010
is, get them in
front of the camera,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.021
and we'll answer it together.

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:48.270
The best part is, you can
get started posing questions

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.230
right now.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.242
Just tweet them with
the #AskFlutter hashtag.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:52.950
We'll take those along
with the questions

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.915
we get during the event and
answer as many as we can.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:56.790
So there you have it.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.460
Big party, the whole Flutter
community's involved.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.444
And if you use the
Ask Flutter hashtag,

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:03.360
you have a chance to see
your question come up

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.360
in one of these little boxes
and then watch us answer it.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.530
So fire away, and
we'll see there.
