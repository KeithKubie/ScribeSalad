00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.700
OK, so today we've got exclusive
access to Nottingham

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.310
Forest football ground here.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.890
Two-time European Cup winners
who have given us the access

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.850
so that we can talk about a
very important number in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.100
football, and a very important
number in probability, which

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.180
is the number 23.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.500
OK, so 23.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.920
So why is 23 an important
number in football?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.430
Some of you may know
this already.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.300
That's the number of people
that you will have on the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.790
pitch during the game.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.630
That's two teams of 11
and the referee.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.730
So there are 23 people
on the pitch.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.770
Now, here's my question today.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.940
What's the probability that two
of those people will share

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.590
a birthday?

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.750
The answer may surprise you.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.120
So we're not talking about the
year, we're just talking about

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.290
the date itself.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.500
Maybe it's the 14th
of January, maybe

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.910
it's the 5th of June.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.680
We're talking about
the date itself.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.010
So let's work this out.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130
I can make this slightly
easier if I ask

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.340
the opposite question.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.950
I'm going to work out the
opposite, which is, what's the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.740
probability that no one on that
pitch shares a birthday.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.330
That's an easier question
to answer.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.290
Let's do this.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.150
OK, so your first player.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.040
OK, it doesn't matter what
birthday he has.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.100
But when your second player gets
on the pitch, what's the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.880
probability that he doesn't
share a birthday?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.950
Well, he will have, out of the
365 days to choose from, he

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.640
can have a birthday on 364
of them out of 365.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.360
So we're not including February
the 29th, no leap

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.780
years here.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.360
And we are assuming that all
days are equally likely.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.310
OK, so your second player has
to have one of these days.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.500
Your third player, when he comes
on to the pitch, will

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.690
have a choice of 363
days out of 365.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.450
And then what next?

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.640
The fourth player.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.930
Out of those remaining days, he
will have 362 out of 365.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.790
And you can keep going.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.900
Eventually, you'll get
to the 23rd player.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.070
Let's call him the referee.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.240
So your 23rd player, how many
choices does he have?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.460
He will eventually get 343
days left out of 365.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.980
So this is the number of days
that you're allowed to have

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.230
for that referee's birthday.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.310
Because we are looking at no
one sharing a birthday.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.650
Now, if you want to find out
the probability that no one

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.610
shares a birthday, you multiply
all these together.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.990
And you'll get a number.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.640
And that number is around
about 0.493.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.650
And if you're not happy with
probabilities like that,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.480
that's 49.3%.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.230
Just slightly under half.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.500
We were interested in the
opposite question.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.570
The opposite question was,
what's the probability that

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.430
someone does share a birthday.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.790
That's the opposite thing of
what we've worked out.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.130
So the probability that someone
does share a birthday

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.320
will be 50.7%.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.030
It's slightly over a half.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.300
You're more likely for two
players to share a birthday

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.845
than if they don't
share a birthday.

00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:17.180
And that's quite surprising.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.020
And people want to think,
well it must be

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.130
something like 100 people.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.080
You must need 100 people
for that to be true.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.510
Or 200 people.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.390
If you think of it this way,
think of all the pairs of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.520
people you could make out of
23 people on the pitch.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.380
All the possible pairs of
people-- in fact there are 253

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.600
pairs of people you
could make.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.840
And, well, think of it that
way-- you start to see why

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.170
it's quite likely, that
two of those people

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.910
will share a birthday.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.790
So next time you're at a
football match, think of it--

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.040
you have a greater than 50%
chance that two of those

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.075
people share a birthday.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.000
OK, so here's another way
to think about it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.960
Imagine you're watching
the game.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.970
And well, if you need to go to
the toilet, you get up and you

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.470
have to move past all
the other people.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.790
By the time you've moved past 23
other spectators, there is

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.360
a greater than 50% chance that
two of those people you walked

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.940
past will have shared
a birthday.
