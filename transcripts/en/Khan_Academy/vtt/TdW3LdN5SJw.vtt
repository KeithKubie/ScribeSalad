00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:04.412
For the owner of a call
option with a $50 strike

00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:08.340
price, then the payoff at
expiration ... we're talking

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.940
about the value of that
position. If the stock

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.578
is below $50 we wouldn't
exercise it, because we

00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:15.863
can buy it for cheaper
than the option that the

00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:19.069
call option is giving us.
If the stock goes above

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:22.688
$50 we would exercise
our option to buy at $50.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:25.613
Say the stock is at $60
the underline stock is

00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:28.328
at $60 on that date at
the expiration date,

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.776
then we would exercise
our option to buy at $50

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:33.028
and sell at $60 and make $10.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:36.195
We would essentially get
this upside above $50

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.866
on the stock. If we think
about ... this is the

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.867
actual value of the
position, if we want to

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:43.133
factor in how much we paid for the option,

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.999
we would shift this down by $10. As the

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.068
holder we would pay $10
for that. It would look

00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:52.133
this this. We would
essentially ... if we don't

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.448
exercise the option we
loose the amount of money

00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:56.359
that was a loss that
we have to pay for the

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.128
option. Then above that
we break even at $60

00:00:59.128 --> 00:01:01.129
dollars, and then we
make money above that.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.466
At $60 the value of our option is $10, but

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.538
we paid $10 for it. That's our break even,

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:09.533
but then we make money after that.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.863
This is from the
perspective of the holder.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.530
This is from the
perspective of the holder of

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.128
the call option. This is
the holder of the call

00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:18.863
option. What would it
look like if you're the

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:20.328
writer of the call option?

00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:24.462
If your the person selling
the right to buy the stock.

00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.998
If this person right
over here, if the holder

00:01:26.998 --> 00:01:30.130
has the right to buy
at $50, someone must be

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.729
selling them that right.
Someone must be agreeing

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.369
to say hey I will
essentially sell that to you

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.797
at that price.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.950
If you're the writer
of the foot ... we have

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.065
the holder in green. The holder in green.

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:46.625
What if you're the
writer? You're essentially

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:49.538
the counter party on
that option. You're the

00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:52.203
person agreeing to uphold that option.

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:55.208
If the option never
gets exercised, then the

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:58.735
writer doesn't have to loose any money.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:01.465
If the option does get
exercise, then all of a

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.932
sudden, the writer starts to loose money.

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:07.065
If the writer doesn't
own the stock, and let's

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:09.958
say the stock is at $60,
this guy, the holder,

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.729
can exercise his option
to buy at $50. The writer

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.373
would then have to go buy
the stock on the market

00:02:15.373 --> 00:02:18.795
for $60 and sell it for
$50. They would loose $10.

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:25.626
The writers payoff would
look something like this.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.466
Once again it's the
mirror image of the payoff

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.959
of the holder. If you
think about the profit of

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.453
the writer, if the option
is never exercised,

00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:39.128
then the holder gets to
keep the $10 that they

00:02:39.128 --> 00:02:42.322
were paid ... that they
sold the right for.

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:45.675
If the option is exercised,
and they start to

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:47.530
loose money, and their
break even once again

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.462
is at $60. Anything below
that, then they start

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.961
to loose more and more
money. Once again these

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.595
are the mirror images of each other.

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:57.662
If you were to add up
these two line it would

00:02:57.662 --> 00:03:00.397
be break even. These
parties are the ones who

00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:02.621
are exchanging money between. If this guys

00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:07.266
makes $10 this guys
loosing $10 or vice versa.
