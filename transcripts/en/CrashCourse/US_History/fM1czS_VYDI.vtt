00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.500
Hi, I’m John Green; this is CrashCourse
U.S. history and today we’re going to talk

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.950
about wonder women.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, finally we get to the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.709
history of the United States as seen through
the lens of Marvel comic superheroes.

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.160
Oh, Me from the Past, you sniveling little
idiot. Wonder Woman is from the DC Universe.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.460
Also this is the study of history, which means
a constant reexamination and redefinition

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.490
of what it means to be a hero, and in the
case of this episode, it’s about taking

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.660
the first steps towards acknowledging that
not all heroes worthy of historical recognition

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.220
are men.
So we’re going to talk about how women transformed

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.480
pre-Civil War America as they fought to improve
prisons, schools, decrease public drunkenness,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.870
and end slavery. And while fighting for change
and justice for others, American women discovered

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.960
that the prisoners, children, and slaves they
were fighting for weren’t the only people

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.960
being oppressed and marginalized in the American
democracy.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.719
Intro
So in the colonial era, most American women

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.680
of European descent lived lives much like
those of their European counterparts: They

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.610
were legally and socially subservient to men
and trapped within a patriarchal structure.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.890
Lower and working class women were actually
more equal to men of their own classes, but

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.080
only because they were, like, equally poor.
As usual, it all comes back to economics.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.900
In general, throughout world history, the
higher the social class, the greater the restrictions

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.619
on women—although high class women have
traditionally had the lowest mortality rates,

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.840
which is one of the benefits of you know doors
and extra lifeboats and whatnot. So at least

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.350
you get to enjoy that oppression for many
years.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.270
As previously noted, American women did participate
in the American Revolution, but they were

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.080
still expected to marry and have kids rather
than, like, pursue a career. Under the legal

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.450
principle of “coverture” actually husbands
held authority over the person, property and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.590
choices of their wives.
Also since women weren’t permitted to own

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.119
property and property ownership was a precondition
for voting, they were totally shut out of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.150
the political process.
Citizens of the new Republic were therefore

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.049
definitionally male, but women did still improve
their status via the ideology of “Republican

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.280
Motherhood.”
Women were important to the new Republic because

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.590
they were raising children—ESPECIALLY MALE
CHILDREN—who would become the future voters,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.180
legislators, and honorary doctors of America.
So women couldn’t themselves participate

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.030
in the political process, but they needed
to be educated some because they were going

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.290
to potty train those who would later participate
in the political process. What’s that? There

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.040
were no potties? Really?
Apparently instead of potties they had typhoid.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.900
Actually it was a result of not having potties.
So even living without rights in a pottyless

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.090
nation, the Republican Mother idea allowed
women access to education, so that they could

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.450
teach their children. Also women—provided
they weren’t slaves--were counted in determining

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.940
the population of a state for representation
purposes, so that was at least an acknowledgement

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.550
that they were at, like, five fifths human.
And then the market revolution had profound

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.849
effects on American women, too, because as
production shifted from homes to factories,

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.910
it shifted away from women doing the producing.
This led to the so-called “cult of domesticity,”

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.540
which like most cults, I am opposed to.
That’s right, Stan, I’m opposed to the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.940
Blue Oyster Cult, The Cult, The Cult of Personality
by In Living Color, and the three remaining

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.769
Shakers.
Sorry, Shakers. But who are we kidding? You’re

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.280
not watching. You’re too busy dancing.
The cult of domesticity decreed that a woman’s

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.340
place was in the home, so rather than making
stuff, the job of women was to enable their

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.340
husbands to make stuff, by providing food
and a clean living space, but also by providing

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.099
what our favorite historian Eric Foner called
“non-market values like love, friendship,

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.599
and mutual obligation,” which is the way
we talk about puppies these days.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.019
And indeed that’s in line with actual story
titles from early 19th century American women’s

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.250
magazines, like “Woman, a Being to Come
Home To” and “Woman: Man’s Best Friend.”

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.909
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?
I hope it’s from “Woman --- Man’s Best

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.819
Friend.”
The rules here are simple. I either get the

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.590
author of the Mystery Document right...oh,
hey there, eagle...or I get shocked.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.989
Let’s see what we’ve got.
“Woman is to win everything by peace and

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.379
love; by making herself so much respected,
esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.159
and to gratify her wishes, will be the free-will
offering of the heart. … But the moment

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.470
woman begins to feel the promptings of ambition,
or the thirst for power, her aegis of defense

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.459
is gone. All the sacred protection of religion,
all the generous promptings of chivalry, all

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.839
the poetry of romantic gallantry, depend upon
woman’s retaining her place as dependent

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:32.199
and defenseless, and making no claims, and
maintaining no right but what are the gifts

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.680
of honor, rectitude and love.”
Well it was definitely a dude and I have no

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.180
idea which dude, so I’m just going to guess
John C. Calhoun because he’s a bad person.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.939
No? Well, what can you do? It wasn’t a dude?
It was apparently Harriet Beecher Stowe’s

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:52.039
sister Catharine who was an education reformer
and yet held all of those opinions, so aaaaAAAAH.

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.469
So I assume Stan brought up Harriet Beecher
Stowe’s sister to point out that it wasn’t

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.860
just men who bought into the Cult of Domesticity.
The idea of true equality between men and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.469
women was so radical that almost no one embraced
it. Like, despite the economic growth associated

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.860
with the market economy, women’s opportunities
for work were very limited.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.300
Only very low paying work was available to
them and in most states they couldn’t control

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.479
their own wages if they were married. But,
still poor women did find work in factories

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.399
or as domestic servants or seamstresses.
Some middle class women found work in that

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:28.080
most disreputable of fields, teaching, but
the cult of domesticity held that a respectable

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.499
middle class woman should stay at home.
The truth is, most American women had no chance

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:37.409
to work for profit outside their houses, so
many women found work outside traditional

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.080
spheres in reform movements.
Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.499
Reform movements were open to women partly
because if women were supposed to be the moral

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.649
center of the home, they could also claim
to be the moral conscience of the nation.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:52.889
Thus it didn’t seem out of the ordinary
for women to become active in the movement

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.999
to build asylums for the mentally ill, for
instance, as Dorothea Dix was, or to take

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:01.800
the lead in sobering the men of America. Many
of the most famous advocates for legally prohibiting

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.689
the sale of alcohol in the US were women,
like Carry Nation attacked bars with a hatchet

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.509
and not because she’d had a few too many.
The somewhat less radical Frances Willard

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.879
founded the Women’s Christian Temperance
Union in 1874, which would be one of the most

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.669
powerful lobbying groups in the United States
by the end of the 19th century. And women

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.369
gave many temperance lectures featuring horror
stories of men who, rather than seeking refuge

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:27.749
from the harsh competition of the market economy
and the loving embrace of their homes, found

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:33.159
solace at the bottom of a glass or at the
end of a beer hose. And by the way, yes, there

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:38.080
were bars that allowed you to drink as much
beer as you could, from a hose, for a nickel.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.770
Today, these establishments are known as frat
houses. These temperance lectures would tell

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.080
of men spending all their hard earned money
on drink, leaving wives and children—there

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.589
were always children—starving and freezing,
because in the world of the temperance lecture,

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:55.789
it was always winter. Now don’t get me wrong:
Prohibition was a disaster, because 1. Freedom,

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.889
and 2. It’s the only time we had to amend
the constitution to be like, “Just kidding

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.839
about that other amendment,” but it’s
worth remembering that back then people drank

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:08.719
WAY more than we do now, and also that alcohol
is probably a greater public health issue

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:13.189
than some recreational drugs that remain illegal.
But regardless, the temperance movement made

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:18.449
a huge difference in American life because
eventually, male and female supporters of

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:23.689
temperance realized that women would be a
more powerful ally against alcohol if they

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:26.869
could vote.
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, in 1928, critic

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:31.189
Gilbert Seldes wrote that if prohibition had
existed in 1800, “the suffragists might

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:35.209
have remained for another century a scattered
group of intellectual cranks.”

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:38.659
And to quote another historian, “the most
urgent reasons for women to want to vote in

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:43.369
the mid-1800s were alcohol related: They wanted
the saloons closed down, or at least regulated.

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:47.169
The wanted the right to own property, and
to shield their families’ financial security

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:51.089
from the profligacy of drunken husbands. They
wanted the right to divorce those men, and

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:55.169
to have them arrested for wife beating, and
to protect children from being terrorized

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:59.919
by them. To do all these things they needed
to change the laws that consigned married

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:04.419
women to the status of chattel. And to change
those laws, they needed the vote.”

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:07.699
Many women were also important contributors
to the anti-slavery movement, although they

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:11.909
tended to have more subordinate roles. Like,
abolitionist Maria Stewart was the first African

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:16.539
American woman to lecture to mixed male and
female audiences. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:21.089
the terrible but very import ant Uncle Tom’s
Cabin. Sarah and Angelina Grimke, daughters

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:25.669
of a South Carolina slaveholder, converted
to Quakerism and became outspoken critics

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:28.159
of slavery.
Sarah Grimke even published the Letters on

00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:32.060
the Equality of the Sexes in 1838, which is
pretty much what the title suggests.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.279
By the way, Stan, you could have made Sarah
Grimke’s letters the Mystery Document. I

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.379
would have gotten that.
But I want to say one more thing about Harriet

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:40.829
Beecher Stowe. There’s a reason we read
Uncle Tom’s Cabin in history classes and

00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:45.720
not in literature ones, but Uncle Tom’s
Cabin introduced millions of Americans to

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.690
the idea that African American people were
people.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.050
At least in 19th century readers, Uncle Tom’s
Cabin humanized slaves to such a degree that

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.120
it was banned throughout most of the south.
So many women involved in the abolitionist

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.089
movement, when studying slavery, noticed that
there was something a little bit familiar.

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:04.360
Now, some male abolitionists, notably Frederick
Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison became

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.910
supporters of women’s rights, but ultimately
the male leaders of the anti-slavery movement

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.290
denied women’s demands for equality, believing
that any calls for women’s rights would

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.699
undermine the cause of abolition.
And they may have had a point because slavery

00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:21.110
only existed in parts of the country whereas
women existed in all of it.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.449
In fact, one of the arguments used by pro-slavery
forces was that equality under the law for

00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:30.420
male slaves might lead to a slippery slope
ending with, like, equality for WOMEN.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.250
And out of this emerging consciousness of
their own subordinate position, the movement

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.100
for women’s rights was born. The most visible
manifestation of it was the issue of woman’s

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:44.170
suffrage, raised most eloquently at the Seneca
Falls Convention of 1848 where Elizabeth Cady

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.139
Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony and
many others wrote and published the Declaration

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:51.180
of Sentiments, modeled very closely on the
Declaration of Independence.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.220
Except, in some ways this declaration was
much more radical than the Declaration of

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.360
Independence because it took on the entire
patriarchal structure.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.519
Okay, so there are three things I want to
quickly point out about the 19th century movement

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:06.000
for women’s rights. First, like abolitionism,
it was an international movement. Often American

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.420
feminists travelled abroad to find allies,
prefiguring the later transatlantic movement

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.639
of other advocates for social justice like
Florence Kelley and W.E.B DuBois.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:18.540
Secondly, for the most part, like other reform
movements, the women’s movement was primarily

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.769
a middle-class or even upper class effort.
Most of the delegates at Seneca Falls, for

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:26.389
instance, were from the middle class. There
were no representatives of, like, cotton mills,

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:30.730
but this didn’t mean that 19th century feminists
didn’t acknowledge the needs of working

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.889
women.
Like, Sojourner Truth, probably the most famous

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:37.970
black woman abolitionist, spoke eloquently
of the plight of working class women, especially

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.149
slaves, since she’d been one until 1827.
And other women recognized that women needed

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:45.939
to be able to participate in the market economy
to gain some economic freedom.

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:50.060
Now, of course all the women who wrote about
the moral evils of 19th century America or

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:55.089
spoke out or took hatchets to saloons were
doing what we would now recognize as work.

00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:58.410
But they were not being paid.
Amelia Bloomer got paid, though, because she

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.060
recognized that it was impossible for women
to easily participate in economic activities

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.430
because of their crazy clothes.
So she popularized a new kind of clothing

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.680
featuring a loose fitting tunic, trousers,
and eponymous undergarments.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.579
But then Bloomer and her pants were ridiculed
in the press and in the streets, and this

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:17.839
brings up the third important thing to remember
about the 19th century women’s movement.

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:22.370
It faced strong resistance.
Patriarchy, like the force, is strong, which

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.199
is why Luke and Yoda and Darth Vader and Obi-Wan
and whoever Samuel Jackson played...all dudes.

00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:32.279
By the way, why did they train Luke up and
not Princess Leia who was cooler and had more

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:36.310
to fight for and was less screwed up? Patriarchy.
Many women’s rights advocates were fighting

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.139
to overturn not just laws, but also attitudes.
Some of those goals, such as claiming greater

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:44.959
control over the right to regulate their own
sexual activity and whether or not to have

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:49.399
children were twisted by critics to claim
that women advocated “free love.”

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:53.269
It’s interesting to note that the United
States ended slavery more than 50 years before

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:57.149
it granted women the right to vote and that
although much of the march towards equality

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:01.269
between the sexes has been slow and steady,
the Equal Rights Amendment, despite being

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:05.379
passed by Congress, was never ratified.
But by taking leading roles in the reform

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:08.779
movements in the 19th century, not just when
it came to temperance and slavery, but also

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:13.370
prisons and asylums, women were able to enter
the public sphere for the first time.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.600
And these great women changed the world for
better and for worse, just as great men do.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.509
And along the way, they made “the woman
question” part of the movement for social

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:27.889
reform in the United States. And in doing
so, American women chipped away at the idea

00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:31.980
that a woman’s place must be in the home.
That might not have been a presidential election

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:37.129
or a war, but it is still bringing real change
to our real lives on a daily basis. Thanks

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:41.110
for watching. I’ll see you next week.
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.100
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer, and myself. And our graphics

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.540
team is Thought Café.
If you want to suggest captions for the libertage,

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.350
please do so in comments where you can also
ask questions about today’s video that will

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.499
be answered by our team of historians.
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
