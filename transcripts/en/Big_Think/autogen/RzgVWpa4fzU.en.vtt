00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.675
 Throughout human history humanity has sought to create a virtuous city or an ideal society. 

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:12.382
 The American dream was based on a kind of utopia. 

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:16.906
 Why do we have a shaker movement? Why do we have Quakers? Why do we have so many different 

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:26.173
 I am a religious movement that left Europe in search of a Utopia in America? 

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:31.948
 Well we know that the Shakers have disappeared and many of these entities have disappeared 

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:37.232
 They can only be found in margins in US textbooks, and the question is why? 

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:44.765
 One of the most important reasons is scarcity, because the industrial revolution was at the beginning of its inception 

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:52.276
 Communities have scarcity, scarcity causes conflict, and conflict is eliminated. 

00:00:52.276 --> 00:01:00.631
 This entity will collapse and disintegrate. How do you distribute resources? Who will have access to food when there is not enough? 

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:07.734
 Who gets shelter when there is a snowstorm if you ate the little corn? These challenges faced Americans in entities 

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:13.513
 This is why we only see the ruins of these utopias 

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:22.940
 In any case, today we have nanotechnology, and with nanotechnology who knows, perhaps in the next 100 years we will have what is known as: 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.557
 In Replication Module: It is the same thing in the Star Trek series and its atomic name 

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:40.823
 It takes normal raw materials and begins to destroy them and even reconstruct them at the atomic level in different ways to form new materials. 

00:01:40.823 --> 00:01:48.206
 If you have those molecular motors you can use them, for example: to turn the glass into wood or vice versa, you will have power 

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.383
 Similar to the power possessed by the magician, in real power resembles the power of God. 

00:01:52.413 --> 00:02:00.229
 Strength in the ability to convert atoms of one material literally to another and this is what we saw in the series Star Turk. 

00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:09.153
 These discoveries may be the most effective method, if Utopia failed due to scarcity, deficiency and scarcity of materials 

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:12.206
 So what happens when you have infinite abundance? 

00:02:12.226 --> 00:02:15.871
 What happens when the application comes to you simply? 

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:23.497
 One of my favorite episodes of Star Trek's series is Facing the Space Capsule of the 20th Century Remnants 

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:31.521
 The bad twentieth century when some people died because of terrible diseases, some have frozen themselves because they know that in the twenty-third century 

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:41.437
 Sethopone and their diseases will be treated. Well, as expected, this is the twenty-third century now and the capsule has been found and begin to treat 

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:47.406
 All these people have cancer, as well as their treatment of certain hereditary genetic diseases 

00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:53.440
 In any case, one of these individuals, a banker was revived and he speaks with himself and says: 

00:02:53.486 --> 00:03:04.280
 I am alive; I am in the twenty-third century. Then he said: Contact the broker of my financial papers .. Contact the banker I am rich I am rich 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.203
 My investment has been dormant in banks for centuries I am supposed to become Quadrillionaire 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:25.240
 And then the project crew looks at this man and says to him: What money? What is the bank? What is a banker? We do not have these in the 23rd century 

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:31.594
 And then they say to him: If you want something, ask him simply to get it .. 

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:36.382
 Now this destroys our concepts and this is a revolutionary change 

00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:48.002
 Because Utopia has failed because of scarcity and shortages of materials, conflict and conflict. What happens when scarcity disappears and when you ask and simply get what you want? 

00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:51.511
 This will have great philosophical consequences. 

00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:59.253
 For example, why does it cost people the trouble of working? Why is he interested in going to work when he asks for things he simply gets? 

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:05.871
 Some sociologists believe today that if restrictions on drug use are completely lifted, for example 

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:10.148
 Maybe three to five percent of the human race will become addicted. 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.647
 This is the price of the results of deregulation and the overall legislation of drugs. I'm not sure about that number for sure, but the figure they talked about. 

00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:21.139
 But what will happen when we have this community based on replicas? 

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.961
 So can we have 3 to 5% of parasitic humans? 

00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:34.447
 All this is contained and is of course based on the human human soul based on the production of things to do something special or to contribute or participate in it 

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:37.307
 What happens if you do not have to do these things? 

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:42.206
 And what happens when you have infinite abundance? What happens if there is indeed a virtuous city? 

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:44.586
 That the critics will say - this nonsense! 

00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:48.362
 No Analog Copier This adapter violates the laws of physics? 

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:52.124
 Well, actually this is not true. 

00:04:52.185 --> 00:05:00.856
 In fact, nanoparticles are being multiplied by disassembling their molecules and restructuring them in new and fascinating ways 

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:04.986
 The nature created by Baal is believed to be called the ribosome 

00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:12.175
 The ribosome can take hamburgers and milk and turn it into a nine-month-old baby. 

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:25.240
 This is a miracle. The ribosome takes hamburgers, french fries, and potato chips, disassembles them and recombines them into DNA 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.483
 Our natural safety has a replication unit 

00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:31.183
 It reproduces the human ?? 

00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:38.824
 But what happens if a person can produce a molecular reagent? To copy everything? This is really a revolutionary idea 

00:05:38.824 --> 99:59:59.999
