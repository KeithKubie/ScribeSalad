00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.630
Although it's not a rule that universally
applies, the general consensus is that the

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.110
best superhero movie adaptations are faithful
to the comic books they're based on - and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.410
that includes in terms of the character costumes.Characters
who look nothing like their comic book counterparts

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.680
tend to be the ones that are most often criticised;
Doctor Doom in the recent Fant4stic reboot,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.910
the awful version of Deadpool in X-Men Origins:
Wolverine, and Galactus in Fantastic Four:

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.921
Rise of the Silver Surfer, for example.In
this video, we'll take a look at some of the

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:33.510
best examples of movie characters whose looks
were taken straight off the pages of their

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.510
source material.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.050
Here are ten superhero movies that nailed
the costumes according to the comics.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.329
Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice really

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.480
wasn't received very well in general, but
one of the aspects of the movie that was deemed

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.290
to be a success was Ben Affleck's Batman - and
one of the main reasons for that was undoubtedly

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.610
the character's look.Batfleck's costumes - both
his regular costume with the grey bodysuit

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.940
and black logo, cape and cowl, and the powered
armour he wore to face the Man of Steel - were

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.289
taken straight off the pages of The Dark Knight
Returns comic book miniseries.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.399
Given that The Dark Knight Returns is generally
seen as one of the best Batman stories of

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.190
all time, it was a smart move on Warner Brothers'
part to take influence from it.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.300
Superman in the Superman: The Movie
Christopher Reeve's Superman is still arguably

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.260
the most iconic movie superhero of all time.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.670
Having first appeared in 1978's Superman:
The Movie, he went onto appear as the Man

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.880
of Steel on three more occasions - and he
always looked as if he was taken straight

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.810
out of the pages of DC Comics.Looking back,
what Reeve's Superman wore was defintely a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.130
little bit cheesy - and the comic book version
of the Kryptonian hero has been updated to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.370
something a little cooler since then - but
the blue suit with red cape and red trunks

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.810
on the outside was undoubtedly totally nailed
when compared to the classic comic book costume.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.210
Supergirl in Supergirl
The Supergirl movie is proof that, just because

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.360
a costume is good, it doesn't necessarily
mean that the character wearing it - or the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.369
movie they're in - is going to be good as
well.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.820
Helen Slater portrayed the titular character
and she looked just like her comic book counterpart

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.690
- much like how her character's cousin did
in the Superman movie - but she was terrible!Her

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.710
costume was essentially the same as Superman's
on the top half, but with a skirt in place

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.399
of Superman's red trunks and blue leggings
on the bottom half - just like in the comics.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.190
However, the movie was awful, her acting was
terrible and, quite frankly, she was just

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.190
irritating.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.510
Deadpool in Deadpool
After the monstrosity that was the X-Men Origins:

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.670
Wolverine version of Deadpool, fans of the
character were eager to see a more faithful

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.760
adaptation on the big screen - and 2016 provided
them with that.Ryan Reynold took on the role

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.150
again, but this time it wasn't a horrible
Frankenstein's monster version of Deadpool

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.380
- it was actually the Merc with a Mouth down
to a T. Reynolds IS Deadpool - and the fact

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.049
that his costume was exactly like the classic
comic book version really helped matters.

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.810
The unmistakable red bodysuit with black trim
was totally on point and we can't wait to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.810
see him in the sequel.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.180
Iron Man in Iron Man
If there's one modern comic book movie character

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.080
who could rival Christopher Reeve's Superman
as the most iconic of all time, it's undoubtedly

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.700
Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.430
The flagship star of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe first appeared in 2008's Iron Man

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.440
and has gone on to appear in a further six
films (including cameos), with several more

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.950
to come.Part of his success as a character
is certainly down to his look.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.900
Everything from the red and gold Iron Man
armour to the suits and goatee of the Tony

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.370
Stark character is lifted straight from the
pages of Marvel Comics - and it obviously

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.470
helps that Downey Jr. has totally made the
role his own as well.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.310
Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War
In fairness to Sony, every movie version of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.890
Spider-Man's costume prior to his debut in
the Marvel Cinematic Universe was pretty damn

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.750
good - especially the black one in Spider-Man
3 - but none were more faithful to the comics

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.720
than the one worn by Tom Holland.Holland made
his debut as the character in Captain America:

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.199
Civil War, wearing a classic bright red and
blue number, complete with the small Spider-Man

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.419
emblem from the character's first appearance
on panel, as well as eyes that expand and

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.900
contract to express emotion.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.670
It really is the best Spidey suit yet and
we can't wait to see what Marvel Studios are

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.200
going to do with it going forward.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.950
Loki in Thor
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is actually

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.760
quite rich in comic-faithful costumes, but
we don't want to saturate this list with them,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.639
so we'll just include a couple of heroes and
one villain - the villain, in this instance,

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.219
being Tom Hiddleston's Loki.Loki first appeared
in 2011's Thor movie and his battle armour

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.260
- the one with the antler-like horns on the
helmet - was beautifully adapted from the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.060
classic comic book version's costume.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.610
It looked awesome and everything about it
screamed "God of Mischief".

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.579
He went on to wear it again in 2012's The
Avengers and will no doubt don it in future

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:06.600
MCU instalments.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.060
Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass
Most superhero outfits are very slick and

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.340
polished - which, in many cases, leaves you
wondering how the people wearing them even

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.750
made them - but the costumes in Kick-Ass were
more grounded and how you'd expect them to

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.940
be in the real world.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.430
That obviously makes them easier to reproduce,
but it was still impressive how well the Kick-Ass

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.840
movies depicted them.That being said, the
most impressive costume in comparison to the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.960
source material in the Kick-Ass movies was
undoubtely Hit-Girl's.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.780
It's exactly as it was in the comic books,
emphasises her limited resources, and manages

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.350
to effortlessly convey her as both a little
girl and a deadly killer - which is quite

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.190
the achievement when you think about it.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.440
Rorschach in Watchmen
2009's Watchmen was actually pretty superb

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.160
in terms of its costumes in general - every
character looked impressive and fairly strongly

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.530
resembled their comic book counterparts - but
none were quite as intricately faithful to

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.900
the source material as that of Rorschach.Granted,
a costume that consists of a brown trench-coat,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.560
a matching fedora and an inkblot mask isn't
exactly difficult to replicate in live action,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.560
but that shouldn't take away from the fact
that it was done so well in this movie - and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.380
it certainly didn't stop Jackie Earle Haley
from looking bad-ass as hell in the role.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.370
Hellboy in Hellboy
Like Rorschach's costume, Hellboy's is pretty

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.340
simple - it's essentially just a coat, a pair
of trousers and, sometimes, a T-shirt or vest

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.470
- but don't let that detract from the fact
that the Hellboy movies that starred Ron Perlman

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.040
got the character's look exactly as it is
in the source material.Then, when you factor

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.660
in the fact that Perlman also had to undergo
an intense make-up and prosthetic makeover

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.720
to get in to "costume" in the first place,
and Hellboy definitely deserves a place on

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720
this list.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.820
He looked awesome and every bit as cool as
the character does in his titular Dark Horse

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.820
comic books.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.150
