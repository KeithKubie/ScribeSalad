companies out there that will provide
 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.940
companies out there that will provide
you with a genetic analysis if you

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950
you with a genetic analysis if you
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.919
you with a genetic analysis if you
provide them with a biological specimen

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929

whether it's a blood sample or a spit
 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.649
whether it's a blood sample or a spit
sample or a hair sample and we're trying

sample or a hair sample and we're trying
 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.510
sample or a hair sample and we're trying
to find out well what a patient's expect

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520
to find out well what a patient's expect
 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.279
to find out well what a patient's expect
when they do this and when they get the

when they do this and when they get the
 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.859
when they do this and when they get the
information that says they have based on

how do they understand that how does

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:44.779
how do they understand that how does
 

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:46.059
how do they understand that how does
that affect the way they think about

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069
that affect the way they think about
 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.489
that affect the way they think about
their health what is it what what do

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499
their health what is it what what do
 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.069
their health what is it what what do
they do with that information what do

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079
they do with that information what do
 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.109
they do with that information what do
the primary care providers that they may

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119
the primary care providers that they may
 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.539
the primary care providers that they may
go to with that information how do they

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549
go to with that information how do they
 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.879
go to with that information how do they
understand it how does this affect their

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889
understand it how does this affect their
 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.309
understand it how does this affect their
ability to modify their lifestyle and

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319
ability to modify their lifestyle and
 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.379
ability to modify their lifestyle and
and so that would be that would be a

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389
and so that would be that would be a
 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.089
and so that would be that would be a
third concrete project that we're

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099
third concrete project that we're
 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.520
third concrete project that we're
wearing
