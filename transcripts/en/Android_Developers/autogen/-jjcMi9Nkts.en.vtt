so we should actually probably answer

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
so we should actually probably answer
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.129
so we should actually probably answer
this question in a little bit more

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:40.139

but on Android it does not actually

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209
but on Android it does not actually
 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.839
but on Android it does not actually
support TCP so what that means is you

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849
support TCP so what that means is you
 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.870
support TCP so what that means is you
cannot create a TCP socket and connect

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
cannot create a TCP socket and connect
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.440

this creates a fundamental and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
this creates a fundamental and
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.330
this creates a fundamental and

that said it does actually work over

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
that said it does actually work over
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.250

we go into a bit more detail let's give

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030
we go into a bit more detail let's give

practice yeah all right now we talked a

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949
practice yeah all right now we talked a
 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.040
practice yeah all right now we talked a
bit earlier about Bluetooth and even

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050
bit earlier about Bluetooth and even
 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.570

there's another answer that we want to

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139
there's another answer that we want to
 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.629
there's another answer that we want to
give you a better answer and that's

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639
give you a better answer and that's
 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.480
give you a better answer and that's

that way your application will have the
best of both worlds and increase the
