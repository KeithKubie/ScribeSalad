00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.100
Now that we have an idea
of what a database is,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.960
in particular, a relational database
that we been looking at, well,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.420
now we want to go back to what
is relevant to securing it.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.480
What are the things that
we have talked about?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.250
Remember, we are going to have users
who want to access the database,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.040
we would have to do authentication so
we know who the request is coming from.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.310
And once you do authentication,
then comes access control.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.970
So, let's talk about how access
control is done in databases.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.565
So actually, the two basic commands and
different variations of SQL.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:39.795
Details may differ but we are basically
talking about the key concepts.

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.595
So you can grant or revoke.

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:45.600
So this is sort of an example
of how access could be granted.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.420
So, this says grant
either set of privileges.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.060
So, for example, selecting some tables.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.210
So, privilege may be to do a select,
for example.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.560
So you can grant
a privilege on a table or

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.520
you can grant a role to a certain user.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.140
That could be in the context
of a given table.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.080
That's the resource we're talking about.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440
This is what you can
do with the resource.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.250
This access has been
granted to a certain user,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.810
it could be granted to a role.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.960
We talked about role
based access control, so

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.340
if you have that it could
be granted the role.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.350
Public is granted to everyone.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.310
So this is the world,
every user that we have in the system.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.820
So some of these things are optional,
for example what's in this parenthesis

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.760
here, so if you don't specify a table,
that's basically saying on all tables.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.470
Okay, so you can either
specify a particular table or

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.410
if you don't then this
is optional part here.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.350
If it's omitted,
then that would mean all the tables.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.290
Similarly there's an optional thing here
that says identified by password, so

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.970
that means if you ever revoke
this access that's being

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.650
granted as a result of this.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.650
You will need the password to do that.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.050
So somebody else can't revoke it
if they don't have the password.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.210
And another thing that you can do
here which is also optional is,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.030
that whoever you
granting this access to.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.840
The user or to the role,
they can actually further propagate, so

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.080
that's the GRANT option,
saying, well, I give you access,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.850
you can give this access to somebody
else, if this is specified.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.630
If you have the access
with the GRANT option.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.979
So an example of this would be for

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:32.460
example a statement that says you grant
the select privilege on any table,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.375
so we are omitting this
choosing a particular table,

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:40.828
because this is optional, to,
the user part here is Alice.

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:44.656
Remember we didn't include
the grant option here,

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:48.571
that means Alice will not be
able to further propagate

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:53.105
this select access that she has
on any table to somebody else.

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.947
We're going to talk about securing data,
of course,

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:58.810
you have to worry about access control.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.055
So access control,

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:05.230
to make good things happen, of course
authorized users need to have access.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.430
So this is how you can
grant access to them.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.340
We talked about both
a mandatory access control and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.800
discretionary access control.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.890
If your company controls centrally who
should have access to what kind of

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.190
things they should be able to do with
various databases and tables and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.030
the databases they have, then of course
it'll be centrally managed access.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.840
So that would be
mandatory access control.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.590
Discretionary means if
you created a table,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.050
then of course you are the owner and
you can decide who else can access it.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.420
But this is how access is granted.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.920
So we saw the example of a privilege,
but

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.630
privileges can also be operations
such as you can insert, update,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.080
delete tables and insert new tables and
things like that.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.960
All the different things we
said we can do under the basis.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.670
These are operations you can perform and
basically access control says

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.500
a certain user role is allowed to
perform that operation or not.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.270
So the other side is, the side of grant
is of course you may want to revoke.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.360
So revoking is again privilege
we were talking about.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.220
The example we had was select, but
it could be one of the other ones or

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.770
you being able to take on a certain
role optionally on a table.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.260
And you take it from a user or
a role or from everybody.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.600
Granting is giving someone access,
revoking is taking that access back, and

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.850
an example would be, revoke
the select privilege on any table,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.400
so we omit this from user Alice.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.110
Granting access rights to perform
various operations you can do on

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.110
a table, and revoking those, this is how
we manage access control in databases.
