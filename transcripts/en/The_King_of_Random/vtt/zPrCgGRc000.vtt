[Captions by Y Translator]
Hey everyone, we've got a lot going on
behind the scenes here

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.300
at the King of Random and we
want to keep you in the loop.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.800
So, if you are interested
in being the first to know

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.400
about exclusive news and offers, go ahead
and click the link in the description

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.742
and sign up for our mailing list.

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:16.400
A while ago, we used some kinetic sand
and some molten gallium to cast

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.640
a small version of Grants face.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.800
Today, we wanted to scale that up
and we're going to be trying

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.900
to make a life-size cast
of my face in metal.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.600
This kinetic sand stuff is really cool
and it compresses down holding

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.200
a surprising amount of detail,
which is why before, we

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.580
took this little 3D print of Grants face,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.840
used it to make a mold and then
cast some gallium into that sand.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.380
That worked out really well.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.900
And today, we want
to try scaling that up.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.420
We've got quite a bit more kinetic sand,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.600
and we're going to see

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.740
if we can do a full size
casting of my face.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.900
What we're going
for here is pretty simple.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.542
We're going to take
a bunch of kinetic sand,

00:00:58.652 --> 00:00:59.400
put it into a box,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.760
and then try smushing my face
into the sand to make a mold,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.900
filling it with molten gallium,
which should cool off

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.140
into a solid metal face.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.400
So we've got kinetic sand here,
here, here, and here.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.580
And then we've got a bunch of gallium
and this stuff is super cool,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.300
by which I mean, it's molten
while it's quite cool.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.200
I can easily put my hand in it
without any worry of burning

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.700
because it's just not that hot.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.900
Our thermometer's actually
currently registering the surface

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.920
as below the freezing point of gallium,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.700
which means it should be solidifying
and it is a little bit we've got sort

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.840
of a skin on here.

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:34.300
This gallium is currently just
barely warm enough to stay liquid.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.200
It's cooling down fairly quickly
and we start getting solid parts

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.300
and this can easily
remelt including just...

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.300
By putting it down
at the bottom of this

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.020
but it is cooling
off quite a bit.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.200
When it's hot, it stays bright
and silvery a lot quicker,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.000
but this is cool,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.200
so as I clear a space away
it just starts freezing,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.700
and you can see it stopped being
quite so silvery very quickly.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.800
So, the goal is going to be to take
our kinetic sand, put that into a box,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.660
and try and smush my face
into it well enough

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.400
that we can cast it in gallium.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.600
But I do have a couple
other things I want to try.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
I have a bunch of colored sand

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.400
and I actually just want
to see what it looks like

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.700
pouring the molten gallium
into that colored sand,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.600
so I'm going to do
a few experiments with that too.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:39.080
[Music]

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.460
The sand is so much lighter weight
that it's actually just floating on top.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.560
[Music]

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.900
Gallium pours into sand
fairly interestingly,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.700
the sand sort of floats on top of it.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.362
We've seen that it does not behave
the same way with kinetic sand,

00:02:57.362 --> 00:02:58.600
especially if we smash it down.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.492
So let's take all
of our kinetic sand,

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:04.592
put it in this box and see
if I can make a mold of my face.

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:26.460
[Music]

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.740
I've got two methods that
we're going to try.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.100
First, I'm going to see what happens
if I actually just smush my face down

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.882
into this sand.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.800
I'll hold my breath,
keep my eyes closed,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.200
and press my face down in,
see what sort of indentation I can get.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.300
Now, the sand
has some good give to it

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.700
but so does my face,
so do all faces.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.300
So, I'm afraid that may
or may not work out too well,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.912
but I do have a plan B.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.900
But let's try this,
take off my glasses,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.800
got a towel for when I pull my face out

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.002
so I can just wipe it all off.

00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:55.402
Things I do for you guys.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:04:10.840
[Music]

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.200
It's like if I were turned
into Voldemort...

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.300
And Voldemort had a beard.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.260
You can see all my facial hair,
it picked up all the details-- Like,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.960
my whole face is so smashed flat.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.200
So, smushing my face down
into this sand gave an impression

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.492
of an extremely smushed face.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.972
That's not quite what we're going for,
entertaining as that is to look at.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.320
Uh, so we do have a plan B.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.700
Several years ago,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.660
helping out in a friend's makeup class,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.300
I had this made.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.100
This is actually a copy of my face,
if my face had no hair on top,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.500
no eyebrows, no facial hair, nothing.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.762
But that's me right there.

00:04:49.762 --> 00:04:54.880
[Music]

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.060
This is made of...

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.000
What I believe is called Ultracal,
it's sort of a cross

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.900
between plaster and cement.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.600
It's really really hard,
much harder than my face

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.900
and much harder than the kinetic sand.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.740
And so, if we press this down
into the kinetic sand,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.920
we should just get a nice imprint
without any deformation.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.700
We're going to do that now.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.700
We're going to get the sand
back to being fluffy

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.500
and then we're going
to set this up

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.100
so we can tip it down and just
smush it down into the sand

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.392
and hopefully get a nice,
clean, unsmashed version

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.662
of my face in the kinetic sand.

00:05:24.662 --> 00:05:30.380
[Music]

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.040
We've got the face
smushed in pretty good,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.640
and I'm just trying to smush down
all the rest of the sand,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.132
so it's properly reinforced
and will hold its shape.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.620
That's all right.

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:40.382
I'm just gonna kind of...

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.380
Grab me by my ears here and...

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.680
[Music]

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.100
We have my face smushed
into the sand, and in theory,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.300
my current actual face should
fit nicely down into that,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.542
and I'm going to see if it does.

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:59.340
[Music]

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.380
That fits quite nicely.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.640
I guess I shouldn't really be surprised,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.900
it's my face after all,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.100
but like it-- It
goes down in and...

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.700
I can just feel it lightly touching
all parts of my face and maybe

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.432
getting pink sand on it,
I don't know about that.

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:15.100
But now, we're going to round up all
of the gallium that we have

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.300
and slowly carefully
pour it in there.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.860
That way we'll have
a metal cast of my face.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:40.160
[Music]

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.900
Random fact, kinetic sand is made
out of 98 percent regular sand

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.440
and 2% Polydimethylsiloxane,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.060
an important component of silly putty.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.500
That is as full
as we can get it.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.700
Okay guys, my face has now
been poured in gallium,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.700
and we need to let this cool down,
and that actually takes quite a while.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.000
The gallium, when it's
in a liquid state likes

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.600
to hold on to it for a while.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.400
And so, it's going to take some time
for this to all freeze back into a solid block.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.900
Once it is, we can pull it
out of the sand and see

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.282
if we have a metal cast of my face.

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.100
Okay, I think it's time
for the main event.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.020
Let's try pulling
this face out.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.400
[Music]

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.260
Our sand's sticking to it,
but I think we've got something

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.000
face-like showing up.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:38.220
[Music]

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.940
Well, I... Think that
worked out pretty nicely.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.400
Now, it's a little bit hard to see
the similarities when you're just looking

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.700
at an all one color face
that doesn't have the rest

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.300
of the head or hair on it.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.640
But, I think that did
a really good job

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.280
and you can see pretty
much just the same shape.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.380
[Music]

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.600
Now I have my lovely
metal face to go along

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.172
with my lovely concrete face,
and my okay skin made face.

00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:11.800
I want to see if I can't polish
this up just a little bit

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.220
so we can have like
a shiny metal look.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:45.120
[Music]

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.160
Casting my face in kinetic sand,
that actually worked really well.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.300
Of course, we had to use
my stone-like face to really get the mold

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.000
because I was getting a very smushed look
when I just press my face down

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.662
into the kinetic sand.

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:58.000
Although, that was
pretty fun too.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.680
But overall, I think
we had a great result.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.100
I don't know what I'm going to do
with a metal face of myself,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.400
but it's pretty neat.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.100
This kinetic sand works really
well for casting gallium.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.800
Gallium melts at such a low temperature
like 85 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.200
that it doesn't burn
the kinetic sand the way

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.800
like molten aluminum does.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.100
There may be some other things
that will cast really well

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.062
in kinetic sand too.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.220
We'd love to hear your ideas
of what you'd like to see us try.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.400
It is still a granule sand,
so we don't want to do things

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.700
that are too liquid.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.900
I suspect most types of resin
would just seep right down

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.600
through the sand,
but maybe if we

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.200
compact it enough that wouldn't happen.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.600
We also made some time aside
to show you how to make one

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.800
of these things for yourself.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.100
We've already got
a stone cast Nate.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.952
Maybe we'll make
a stone cast Grant.

00:09:43.612 --> 00:09:44.200
Guys, thanks for watching.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.600

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.400
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.200
you should be watching next.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.032
And if you aren't a subscriber yet,
