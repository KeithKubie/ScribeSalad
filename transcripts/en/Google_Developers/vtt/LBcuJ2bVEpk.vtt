TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.661
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:02.661 --> 00:00:05.792
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:07.500
And for those paying
attention, last week

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.170
was Google I/O. So here's
a roundup of everything

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.690
that went down at the
developer festival,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.030
starting with everything
that happened at the festival

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.890
outside the session rooms.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.840
Check out this playlist
to come along with me

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.570
as we explore the venue,
play with all the cool stuff,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.200
and get the inside
scoop from the experts.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.420
Android is officially supporting
the Kotlin programming language

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.500
in addition to the
Java language and C++.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.290
Kotlin is a brilliantly
designed, mature,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.970
production-ready
language that we

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.400
believe will make Android
development faster and more

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.420
fun.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.540
Details, code, and links
are on the post linked

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.300
in the description below.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.070
Android Instant
Apps is a new way

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.040
to run Android apps without
requiring installation.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.970
Now anyone can build and
publish an instant app.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.760
Android Studio 3.0
Canary is our new preview

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.040
that includes three major
features to accelerate

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.270
development flow--

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.490
a new suite of app
performance profiling tools

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.820
to quickly diagnose performance
issues, support for the Kotlin

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.490
programming language,
and increased Gradle

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.510
build speeds for
large-sized app projects.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.370
There are several
powerful new features

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.310
and reports in the Play Console
to help you improve your app's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.860
performance, manage
releases with confidence,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.520
reach a global audience,
and grow your business.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.070
We're excited to announce that
our second generation Tensor

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.670
Processing Units are coming to
Google Compute Engine as Cloud

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.450
TPUs, where you can connect
them to virtual machines

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.880
of all shapes and sizes,
and mix and match them

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.830
with other types of
hardware, including

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.280
Skylake CPUs and Nvidia GPUs.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.190
You can program these
Cloud TPUs with TensorFlow,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.900
the most popular
open source machine

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.850
learning framework on GitHub.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.925
And we're introducing
high-level APIs,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:52.050
which will make it easier
to train machine learning

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:00.060
models on CPUs, GPUs, or Cloud
TPUs with minimal code changes.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.920
Many top researchers
don't have access

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.400
to anywhere near as much
compute power as they need.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.990
To help as many
of them as we can

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.360
and further accelerate the
pace of open machine learning

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.180
research, we'll make
1,000 Cloud TPUs

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.630
available at no cost to ML
researchers via the TensorFlow

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.790
research cloud.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.680
With Firebase, we're
providing more insights

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.170
to understand app performance
through a new product--

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.300
Firebase Performance Monitoring.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.760
We're also introducing
integration between hosting

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.190
and cloud functions, adding
support for phone number

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.190
authentication, and
improving analytics.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.390
Oh, and we've also started
open sourcing our SDKs.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.210
Through Google Assistant, we
launched the Actions Console,

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.690
a new developer console that
helps developers work as a team

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.560
and collect data on app usage,
performance, and user discovery

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.770
patterns.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.520
This new console is integrated
with the Firebase and Google

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.476
Cloud consoles.

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:54.850
To help you take advantage of
the new features of Android

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.680
Wear 2.0, we have released a
suite of complication API tools

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.870
to make it easier for
you to add complication

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.340
support to your watch faces
and a new Wear UI library

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.240
to help you build
watch-friendly user interfaces.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.030
We released Developer
Preview 4 Android Things,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.640
which brings new supported
hardware, features,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.580
and bug fixes to the platform.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.290
We've introduced new
innovations for you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.870
to make it easy for your
users to pay for services

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.290
with the Google Payment API,
to build profitable businesses

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.540
with the completely
redesigned AdMob,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.470
and to grow a user base with
Universal App campaigns.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.466
Screenshots and links are on
the post in the description

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:37.090
below, which is where
you'll find links

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.700
to all of the updates
we just reviewed.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.180
Please like and share.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.600
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.740
Thank you for tuning in
for this week's round

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.670
up of Google I/O. If
you'd like to catch

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.820
some of our previous dev show
episodes, they're right here.
