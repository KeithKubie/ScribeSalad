PETE LEPAGE: Well
hello, everyone.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.690
My name is Pete LePage.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.200
And I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.910
And today we're going to be
talking more about using great

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.710
tools for building mobile
web applications.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.810
Last week, some of you may have
joined me for a special

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.260
Chrome Developer Tools session,
Mobile Developer

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.450
Tools session, where we talked
about some of the really neat

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590
tools that you can use,
like libraries and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.310
other stuff like that.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.950
This week, we're going to talk
about testing and emulation

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.100
and other great tools that
you'll find will help you to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.570
build great mobile
applications.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.210
So like I said, welcome.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.120
So last week--

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.870
the link to the slides
is there.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.960
There's the Development
Environments stuff that we

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.360
talked about, the Authoring
Framework stuff, as well as

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.040
some of the libraries.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.350
This week, it's the Testing and
Iteration Flow and some

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.020
Performance Tooling.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.910
If you're looking for some other
great tools, Paul Irish

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.860
has a great session on the
Tooling and Web App

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.470
Development stack that
you can check out.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050
And these slides will
be available

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.850
after the fact as well.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.430
If you want to go and follow
along or ask questions as

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
we're going, the link is there
at the bottom, right here.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.250
Well, I guess it is not quite
highlighting for me right now.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.430
But you can see the link
at the very bottom.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.110
If you have questions, you
want to post those.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.020
Feel free to go post your
questions as we move along.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.260
And I'll take your questions
as we go and at

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.400
the end of the session.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
So let's jump in and talk about
some testing tools and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.020
ways that you can better test
and see how your environment

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.870
works when you're building
mobile web applications.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.000
So one of the first things I
want to talk about is the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.760
network link conditioners and
really sort of understanding

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.170
how you can better understand
and better test the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.630
experiences that you're getting,
when your users are

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.820
experiencing their websites
on a mobile device.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.250
Because on a mobile device,
you can't always count on

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.870
having a 3G connection.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.330
Sometimes it may be Edge.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.880
Sometimes, it may be Wi-Fi.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.770
Sometimes that Wi-Fi may be
worse than a 3G connection.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.850
Sometimes it may be
really spotty.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.810
Sometimes it may not
exist at all.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.120
So there are some great tools
that are available for testing

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.050
on your mobile device.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.240
There's two that I think are
really interesting--

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.230
Charles Proxy, which
is available there.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.250
It's available for the PC, for
the Mac, and for Linux.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.050
So you can install
it on whatever

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.260
platform you're using.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.550
And it will go and basically
proxy all the network

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.080
connections.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.500
So all the requests that
are going through go

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.350
through that proxy.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.290
And you can specify how
you want it to behave.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.050
The other one that's pretty
interesting is the Network

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.120
Link Conditioner.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.350
And this is a Mac tool.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.210
This is something that you need
to get through the Apple

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.010
developer tools.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.620
So when you install Xcode,
you can get it there.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.740
And the Network Link Conditioner
is installed in

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.400
your system settings.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.710
Let me bring it up here.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.950
So I'll bring up my tools,
my System Preferences.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.600
And down here at the bottom, you
can see this Network Link

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.520
Conditioner.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.250
So when I start the Network
Link Conditioner, I have a

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.450
couple of options that
I can choose from.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.460
I can choose the profile
and whether I want to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.940
turn it on or off.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.610
So first off, let's
go and turn it on.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.970
But let's turn it on for an
Edge Good Connectivity.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.020
So if I do this, you
can see a couple of

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.390
things get set by default.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.750
It limits the bandwidth that my
device can connect to the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.730
network with.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.810
So I no longer have the full
network bandwidth available.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.130
I only have a 256K
kilobit stream.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.790
Also, I'm not going to
drop any packets.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.060
But it's going at 350
millisecond delay to all of my

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.590
requests on the downlink.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.300
On the uplink, it's going to put
in 200K connection speed

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.200
and a delay of about
370 milliseconds.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.390
So by turning that stuff on,
it's going to slow your

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.320
network connection down.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.570
It's going to cause some
pretty slow things.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.120
So I'm going to bring up my
website because I know my

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.310
website is probably not exactly
designed for a slow

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.500
connection-- so petelepage.com.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.030
And you'll notice it takes
a little while for

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.360
stuff to come in.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.940
And it takes that extra time.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.180
So basically, what it's doing
is pruning down my network.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.640
It's making my pipe smaller,
so to speak.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.200
So that way you can get a
better idea of how your

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.600
network is going to behave
under low bandwidth

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.270
connections.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.370
It's a really good way of
testing and understanding.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.770
Through here, you could
also go in.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.300
And you can set things like hey,
I want to see what a LASI

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.330
network is going to look like.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.630
So notice here, we've got 1%
packet dropped and a 440

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.780
millisecond delay.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.920
I guess it really helps
to turn this guy on.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.560
So I'm going to go ahead
and turn this on.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.190
I have to enter in
my password, so

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.680
turn my password on.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.860
Let's just make sure I
got turned on here--

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.990
on.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.100
So now, petelepage.com--

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.890
I guess I didn't get
it on earlier.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.270
So now, let's see how long
this takes to load.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.490
Again, much slower, so
before, we saw it

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.240
load reasonably fast.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.330
Now, we're still waiting
for content come down.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.350
We don't have that section
on the right.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.370
So I can see that the important
content on my

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.530
personal website comes
up pretty quickly.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.460
The thing that I want people to
be able to see here, on the

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.870
Thinking About, comes
up pretty quick.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.570
But the other content is going
to take a while to load.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.260
When the Network Conditioner
is running, you've got this

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.340
little guy up here telling you,
hey, it's up and running.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.170
And so you can bring it up
really easily, if you

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.960
want to change it.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.860
If you want to go and say, hey,
I'm on 3G or whatever,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.440
you can turn that on and off
pretty quickly-- really

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.350
easily, without having to go
fight through lots of stuff.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.200
It's a good tool to be able
to use and understand.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.910
Charles Proxy is a really
powerful as well.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.370
Charles Proxy-- one of the great
things about it is it'll

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.880
do all of your network
connections.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.600
And it gives you a lot more
inspection ability.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.010
So you can go in and see
what's going on with a

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.920
particular request.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.870
You could take one specific
request and

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.970
make it take forever.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.860
So you drop one specific
request, if you're doing a lot

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.610
of XHR requests or something
to that effect.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.840
It's a good way to be able
to specify some of

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.550
those things in there.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.220
On Android, if you want
to do this on a

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.970
phone or on a tablet.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.780
You can do it on a phone
or tablet as well.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.640
On Android, you can set up
the proxy to go through a

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.030
particular device.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.465
So it's kind of buried
in there.

00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:50.580
I'll get a blog post out or
something up on the Chrome

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.450
developers page in the next day
or so, to talk about that.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.010
But you can go in, and you can
turn that proxy on, so that

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.020
you can actually use that.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:05.040
Under iOS 6, if you have the
developer tools turned on, you

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.200
can turn on the Network Link
Conditioner in there as well.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.250
So that you can see how the
network conditioner works on

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.360
that particular device.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.950
You can test it, again, in
a specific scenario, to

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.870
understand how things are going
to work, how they're

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.930
going to behave.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.370
So let's go ahead and close
that and go back

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.930
to our slides here.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.770
So faking it with the Network
Link Conditioner is just one

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:37.730
way that you can understand how
your app is going to work

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.700
for your users, who may not be
connecting with the same great

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.600
bandwidth that you're
connecting with.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.470
One of the next things I want
to talk about is some of the

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.460
developer tools within Chrome.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.460
Because Chrome offers a lot of
great tools to help you test

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.530
your web application.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.530
And I call it faking it
because it provides an

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.450
emulation experience.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.250
It's not going to be a true
experience because you're not

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.020
running on the same hardware.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.610
The processor on my Chrome OS
machine or on my Mac or

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.530
anything like that is obviously
much faster than it

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.690
is on my phone or tablet.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.600
But at least I can be able
to go, understand

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.670
what's going on.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.580
And I can get a pretty
good sense of how

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.030
these things are working.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.290
So there's a couple of things
that you can do in the Chrome

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.010
Developer Tools.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.880
So I'm going to bring up the
Chrome Developer Tools now, so

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.230
that we can see what's
going on here.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.900
So I've got the developer
tools up.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.415
And I'm going to click on this
little guy here in the bottom,

00:09:38.415 --> 00:09:41.510
the little gears icon
for the settings.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.880
When I bring up the settings,
if I go to Overrides, I can

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.430
change a number of
Chrome settings.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.530
So first off, I can change
my user agent.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:57.300
So I can fake out to my server
what browser I'm running as.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.210
So I could say, hey, I'm running
as an iPhone iOS 4.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.820
And so sure enough, it shows
here what my user agent is.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.280
You can see it showing
up there.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.410
But it also automatically turns
on the device metrics.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.430
Now this is one of those things
that I think is really

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.860
powerful and really, really
useful to web developers.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.290
Because what it does is sets the
screen resolution to the

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.920
same screen resolution
that I would get if

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.000
I was on that device.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.340
So in this particular case,
it's got 640 by 960.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.150
So it's setting my screen
resolution to the right size.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.990
It turns on a font-scale factor,
whether it's going to

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.730
scale my fonts or not.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.350
So you've got the
device metrics.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.580
So you can see what
your experience is

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.750
going to look like--

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.780
much easier to do this than it
is to resize your browser.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.760
I'm sure everybody has done it
here before, where you try and

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.850
resize your browser down to
exactly the right size.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.230
And getting it to that
particular size you want is

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.890
just a pain in the butt.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.730
So this is a good way to be able
to go in and say, hey, I

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.320
need a particular screen size.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.830
So sure enough, there's
the screen size.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.780
You can see these things are
rendering as I expected it.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.645
One of the next things that you
can do is overriding the

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:14.090
geolocation position.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.990
So you can fake out to the
browser where you are.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.910
If you want to say, hey
look, I'm in New York.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.740
Or I'm in Mountain View.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.320
Or I want to go test
something.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.860
You can go in, and you can
specify the latitude here and

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.070
the longitude here.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.500
So that you can say, hey, this
is where I am right now.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.400
I want to just take my word for
it that this is where I

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.730
am, in case you're doing any
kind of geolocation testing.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.810
And you can also say, in
particular, I want to emulate

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.110
a particular position.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.400
So I want to say emulate
position unavailable, which

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.550
may happen, maybe, if you're
in a nice cement room where

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.910
you can get a location.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.930
Or maybe just the user chooses
not to provide a device

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.600
location, going in and being
able to specify exactly the

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.290
location or whether the location
is not available--

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.240
another one.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:07.890
You can go in.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.760
And you could also do device
orientation, how the device is

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.990
with the alpha, beta,
and gamma channel.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.580
And there's a great article up
on HTML5 Rocks, if you want to

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.570
understand how those
guys work.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:29.030
One thing to keep in mind when
you think about that is all of

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.960
the alpha, beta, gamma
is how you would

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.230
normally hold the device.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.180
So in some cases, I'd hold
my device like this.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.050
But on a different device,
you might hold it like

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.520
this or like this.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.520
So both of those are all things
that you need to take

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.970
into account for the device
orientation and

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.640
device motion stuff.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.110
Finally, on here, you can see
the Emulate Touch Events.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.220
So that's going to simulate
touch events and fire the

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.400
touch events at the same,
when I click on things.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.930
So those are all available.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:04.460
I think Device Orientation
is available in beta.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.030
It's not available in the
stable channel yet.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.700
So if you need to go
in and check, you

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.940
want try one of those.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.980
Go have a quick peek in the in
the beta or even in the Dev or

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.320
Canary or even in the
Chromium Channel.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.370
There's a couple of new ones
that are coming soon.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:24.630
Let me pull up Chromium for a
sec because I think this one's

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.226
kind of neat.

00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:28.440
So I'll bring up
Chromium here.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.400
And I'll just go to google.com,
bring up the

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.830
developer tools.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.470
Again, same thing, go click
on the little guy here.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:42.870
And under overrides, I now also
have Emulate CSS Media.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.390
So that I can go in and say,
hey, in this particular case,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.720
I want you to pretend that
I'm a print device.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.360
And I want you to show me what
the page is going to look

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.830
like, if you're applying
the print style.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.850
Rather than having to go hit
print every single time to see

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.890
what it looks like and look in
the print preview, you can

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.740
just go apply that
print style.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.860
Maybe you want to go to use a
different one, like screen or

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.210
projection or something
like that.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.900
You can go see how all
of those look.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.060
So easy way to go do this--
and if you're ever curious

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.950
about what's coming and what's
down the pike, always check

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.110
out Chromium.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.480
My general recommendation, if
you're sort of looking to stay

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.840
on the edge, but you want
something pretty stable.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.250
And you want to be
able to test some

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.630
of the newer features.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:37.270
It's to install Chrome Beta or
Chrome Stable as your primary

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.300
browser experience and then
install either Chrome Canary

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.200
or Chromium itself.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.940
And that way, you'll always
have the latest.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.970
You'll always have
the greatest.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.710
You can see what's going on
in the fun new stuff.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.170
And you can see what's
going on in the

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.270
stable, regular thing--

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.950
how most of your users are
going to see things.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.620
I personally like
to go with beta.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.900
So that way, I'm a little
bit ahead of the curve.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.310
And if the bug gets introduced
on something or maybe

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.350
something changes, I'm going to
see it before my users are.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.810
And that, to me, is
really important.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.130
I want to know about these
things before my users do

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.660
because I want to make sure
that I've got a great

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.680
experience.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.860
So a bunch of great
Chrome dev tools--

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.840
there's a bunch of great
sessions available on Google

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.510
Developer Live that go into much
more depth on how to use

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.540
some of these dev tools.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.440
I just sort of wanted to give
you a good introduction to do

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.210
a couple of these things.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.460
So let's move on to the
next one and talk

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.190
about some of the emulators.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.500
Emulators are a great way to
get an idea of how things

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.040
might work.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.230
Is it going to behave how you
expect it to behave in the

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.740
native environment?

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.210
Now again, you're not going to
get the exact performance

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.120
characteristics.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.000
And there are some things
that may or may

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.630
not work in the emulator.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.210
For example, the camera doesn't
work in the emulator

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.430
for most of these devices.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.010
But it does work in
other places.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.510
So it does work on the device.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.000
But most other things work.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.880
So there's a few places where
this is a good way

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.560
to go and do this.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.570
So there's a couple of good
emulators available.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.180
There's the Android emulator,
which I've got linked there.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.520
It's a quick, easy
thing to install.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.790
It's not exactly the
fastest thing.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.970
But it's pretty decent.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.090
And it does give a fair
representation.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.740
If you install Xcode, you can go
and get the iOS simulators,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.300
which will give you the iPhone
and iPad, the iPhone

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.640
5, the iPhone 4.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.310
In fact, it'll give
you quite a few.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.380
Let me bring up one of
the iOS simulators.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.820
So when I bring up the
iOS simulator, sure

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.780
enough, here we go.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.250
We've got Safari running
right now.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.450
Let me make this a little
bit smaller, so that

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.980
it's nice and small.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.780
Here we go.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.940
So you can see that I've
got Safari on here.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.970
I can start Safari.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.380
It starts up pretty quick.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.109
If I go to type in here, I can
go click on this and type

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.099
HTML5rocks.com.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.260
It just uses my network
connection to go pull this

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.710
stuff down, shows me
exactly as I would

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.270
expect things to be.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.180
So in this particular case--

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.829
and it also responds
to touch events.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:27.109
So in order to scroll, what I
have to do is go click on the

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.590
page and then scroll up.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.680
So I've got that sort of real
experience, as I'd expect it

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.780
to behave on a true device.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.940
If I go back up to the top and
I want to go search here, I

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.510
can click on in here.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.850
And if I wanted to type-- so
I said device orientation.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:55.530
You can see this would take me
forever-- device orientation.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.090
So sure enough, I go
click on that.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.340
I should get some
results here.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.140
And sure enough, here's that
device orientation article

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.900
that I was talking
about earlier.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.300
So we can go through, scroll,
and see all the stuff that

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.090
we're looking for.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.150
So there's a good, easy
way to be able to

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.690
go in and test this.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.370
You can switch between
different hardware.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.100
So you can change from the iPad
to the iPad Retina to an

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.350
iPhone, whatever you're
looking to test.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.850
That same is true for
Android as well.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.480
You can try different devices.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.390
You could try different
characteristics on those

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.230
devices, whether they have a
keyboard, whether they don't

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.530
have a hardware keyboard--

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:35.160
so quick easy way to be able
to go in and do these guys.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.740
So let's go back to our
slides here and

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.880
continue on from here.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.560
The other one that's worth
checking out is Browser Stack.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.970
Browser Stack is a great tool
that you give it a link to

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.630
your site, and it'll go render
it in several different

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.610
browsers and give you
the screen shots.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.980
And in fact, I believe on this
one even gives you access to

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.740
the DOM, which is
pretty slick.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.280
Because you can go in, and you
can try seeing how things

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.520
behave in the DOM.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.130
But emulators are
only so good.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.530
We want to be able to test
these on real devices,

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.800
understand how these are going
to behave in a real scenario.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.130
So let's have a look at
how you'd use one

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.190
of the remote debuggers.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.240
And actually, we'll have
a look at a couple

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.030
of the remote debuggers.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.780
You can do remote debugging with
Chrome for Android on an

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.930
Android device.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:31.820
You can do with us Safari
on iOS 5 and Safari 6.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.270
And you can actually do
it on Firefox as well.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.090
And I've got all the slides
that walk you through the

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.830
instructions on how
to do this.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.530
And you can follow
the instructions

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.340
along on your own.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.620
So for Android, the first thing
you've got to do is--

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.400
on all of these, there's a
one-time set-up experience.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.960
You have to go set a few things
up, turn debugging on,

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.040
that kind of thing.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.190
So for Android, we need
to install the

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.970
debugger for the SDK first.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.150
Once we've done that on our
mobile device, we need to

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.580
enable USB debugging
at the OS level.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.380
If you've got a phone that has
not ever gone into developer

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.060
mode before, you're going to
have to go through clicking--

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.570
I think it's you click on the
About Phone Settings like

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.280
seven times.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.650
And that brings it up.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:24.060
If you can find the developer
USB Developer Options in the

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.950
Settings menu, just
a quick search.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.480
You'll find it pretty quickly.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.880
Once you've got that done, we
need to open up Chrome and we

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:40.870
need to enabled the web debugger
within Chrome.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.750
So once you've done all
that basic stuff--

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.130
I've already done all that
stuff on my device.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.370
Let me bring up the
device down here.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.050
So I've got my device.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.800
And I'm going to
unlock it here.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.550
So let's bring up Chrome.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.510
And so we'll go to
HTML5 Rocks.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.760
I'm just going to
grab my phone--

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.170
so HTML5 Rocks.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.370
And this will take a
second and load.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.760
Let me zoom this in just a
little bit, so you can see

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.720
this a little bit better.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.080
All right.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.970
So now that we've got this,
there's a couple of things

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.790
that we need to do.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.890
On our desktop, I'm
going to come out.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:26.370
And we need to run
ADB forward.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.310
Now, I have this set
up as a script.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:32.720
So I'll just show you
what my script says.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:39.160
So you can see here it's adb
forward tcp 9222 and then

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.650
local abstract.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.800
I recommend just having a
little script to do this

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.870
because it's a heck of a lot
easier than it is to go and

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.380
remember that all the time.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.680
But what this does is it
connects through my USB port

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.850
to my device and allows me
to do remote debugging.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.090
So I'll do Clank Debug.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.320
It's gone and run.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.210
So now, when we go back
to Chrome, let's

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.670
go open a new tab.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:12.210
And we'll go to local
host colon 9222.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.160
So at this point, we get two
windows that pop up.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.350
So we've got the Mobile Web
Developer Toolkit and the

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.340
HTML5 Rocks.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.020
So when I click on this, it
opens up the dev tools, just

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.660
like I'm used to seeing
on my computer.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.600
But this is now showing
everything

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.280
on the mobile device.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.540
Now, I've got the standard
resources, so I can go see all

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.580
the files that have
been pulled down.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.260
I can go.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:42.050
And if we reload this page-- so
let me go hit reload here--

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.500
you can see all of the network
requests coming in.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.090
So we could see how everything
is going.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.440
We can see all the scripts
that got pulled down.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.350
So if I go and click and say,
OK well, let's see what this

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.080
script looks like.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.770
OK, lots of great
stuff in here.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.130
The timeline to understand
what's going on--

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.000
again, all the stuff that you're
used to being able to

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.370
use and see within the Chrome
Developer Tools are all

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.730
available here for
you, right now.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.590
So in particular, what I want to
go do is show you a couple

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.300
of things in here.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:18.740
Because it behaves just like
it does on your desktop.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.570
I can go in.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:25.400
And sure enough, notice how
in the actual device, as I

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.950
highlight through different
portions, if I go and expand

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.260
my header, so there is
that hyperlink there.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.660
I can go through.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.530
And I want to actually go, and
let's find where the main

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.180
content is here.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:47.340
So I think my main content is--
where are we going here--

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.590
content.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:53.820
There we go.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.900
I think that's our content.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.730
OK, so div--

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.870
I'm going to expand this out.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.490
And so there's that.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.490
So now, we could start going
through and finding all of the

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.390
different pieces that we want.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.440
And we can go through and
change these things.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.980
So I'm having a hard
time finding this.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.330
I always love going for these
kinds of things--

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.600
live sessions.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.660
Let's go up to Nav, Unordered
List, expand this.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:28.270
And instead of it saying Home,
let's say Pete was here.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.720
And sure enough, if we go have
a look at our page--

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.150
well, we're replacing
those with images.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.770
So of course it's not
going to show that

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.480
particular right now.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.830
But let me try.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.780
Let me see if I can get
a different one.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.910
I'm pretty sure it won't work.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.055
But Pete was here.

00:24:45.055 --> 00:24:45.850
Yeah, there we go.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.550
All right, so we've
got Pete was here.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.420
So you can go through.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.010
You can change all the things
that you'd expect to normally

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.960
be able to change, within the
Chrome Developer Tools.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.870
Nice, easy way to be able to go
in, understand what's going

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.230
on, and build your website, your
web application, without

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.130
too many things.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.670
You can apply styles.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.680
Now, the one thing to keep in
mind, this is being served

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.220
from the developer tools
on the device.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.590
So you are getting the Device
Developer Tools.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.610
So currently, this is Chrome
that's available in the

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.160
marketplace.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.050
It's Chrome 18.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.210
So you're only going
to have the

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.800
standard Chrome 18 features.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.500
So if I go down here and I bring
up my settings, I don't

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.640
have the ability to be able
to change my UA string.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.170
Actually, yes I do have
the ability to

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.870
change my User Agent.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.320
But I don't have the ability to
be able to go and change my

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.430
device metrics or anything
like that.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.500
Now, obviously, it would be a
little weird change the device

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.380
metrics on something that's
already a little tiny, but one

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.000
of those things you may or may
not want to do at some point

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.880
in the future.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.420
Certainly, setting geolocation
is something that's

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.150
interesting and that you might
want to be able to do.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.590
So with that, let's
get out of here.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.600
So that's the Chrome
remote debugging.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.580
It give you easy access to be
able to go through and debug

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.670
Chrome, remotely.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.880
Let's take a look at how
you'd do Safari, on iOS

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.670
6 and on the iPad.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:21.280
So again, very similar, there's
an initial set of set

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.480
up that you're going to
need to go through.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.570
And I'm going to just switch
out some devices here.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.120
So that I can plug-in
an iPad in.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.710
And we can get this connected.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.350
Now, again, one of the key
things that you need to be

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.660
aware of is that it does that
same thing where it needs to

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.460
be connected directly
to your device.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.290
So you need to plug-in
via USB.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.470
And your device is connected.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.550
So now, let me bring
up our device.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.240
So we can see what's
going on here.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.640
So here we go.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.250
We've got we've got my device.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.490
And the set up settings are
pretty much the same.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:02.880
We need to go through, and in
Safari, on our iPad or on our

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.780
iPhone, we need to enable the
Advanced Settings, so that we

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.420
can go in and actually
see what's going on.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.600
But we also need to, on our
computer, go and to turn those

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.630
things on as well.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.460
So that we've got them
set up there as well.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.380
So sure enough, I've got my
iPad up and working here.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:30.040
So you can see that we've
got everything running.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.840
And so now, very similarly,
we're going

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.790
to do the same thing.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.170
So I'll start up Safari.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.620
And we'll come out
of the slides--

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.540
and Safari.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.820
Great, so Safari comes up just
as we would normally expect.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.550
I'll make this full screen,
so that we can see

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.692
everything going on.

00:27:50.692 --> 00:27:53.610
Here we go.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.960
And what I'm going to do is
go to the Develop Menu.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.900
And you'll notice that your
device shows up, in the

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.030
Develop Menu.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.800
So I go and click Pete's iPad.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.790
And it shows me all of the tabs
that are currently open.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.780
So I can go and click
on HTML5 Rocks.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.250
And sure enough,
there it goes.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.880
We've got my page up,
open, and ready

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.690
for me to start debugging.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.560
Now, these are the Safari
developer tools.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.770
So if you're used to using
those, you've got the ability

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.520
to be able to do all of the
things that you'd expect to be

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.290
able to do.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.500
And notice, as you start going
through these things, you get

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.310
that same experience.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:38.470
So let me just bring this down,
so that we can see this

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.870
a little bit better.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.580
And I'm going to zoom in just a
little bit more, so that we

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.800
can see this.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.480
So again, same thing,
I'll open up the

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.040
header, open up my Nav.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.580
And again, here's my
unordered list.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.410
And Posts and Tutorials--

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.360
I'll change this.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.520
Pete was here.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.200
And sure enough, can
we see that there?

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.880
There you go.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.200
So it says Pete was here.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.500
So you've got that same set of
tools, same set of abilities,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.660
to be able to go in and do
remote debugging as you'd

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.650
expect to be able to do.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:24.260
So this is a really great way to
understand what's going on

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.590
with the experience.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.460
How are things working?

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.420
Is something going a
little bit weird?

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.680
Is something maybe not acting
like it you'd expect it to?

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.540
Is it pulling down
different data?

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.190
On this device as well, you do
have the ability to be able to

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.660
get in and turn on the Network
Link Conditioner.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:48.210
Let me see if I can find that
real quick and show you guys.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:54.795
But it's under Settings and
under the Developer Tools.

00:29:54.795 --> 00:29:57.110
I'll see if I can find
this here real quick.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.950
Of course, I'm not going
to be able to find it.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.090
Well, I didn't plan
on showing this.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.720
I was thinking about it after
the fact and thought it might

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.970
be kind of cool to show.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.300
But I don't see it.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.570
So I won't show it today.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.870
It is a way that you can be able
to go and set the things

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.120
that you want.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.690
All right.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.810
Well, you can trust me that
it is in here somewhere--

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.840
a quick, easy way to be able to
go in, set up the network

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.950
settings, and turn on the
particular things that you

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.400
might be looking to do.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.140
So Firefox has the same set
up, or a similar set up.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.860
One of the key differences on
the Firefox set up, that I

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.710
really appreciate in their
particular set up, is that you

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:01.790
don't necessarily need to
connect the device via USB.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.620
You can actually do it
over the network.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.990
So as long as both devices are
connected to the same network

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.490
and on the same subnet,
you can connect in.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.910
Again, there's a bunch of set
up that you need to go to.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.710
On the desktop, you're
going to need to

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.320
enable remote debugging.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.570
And on the remote device
on your mobile--

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.740
either your phone, your tablet,

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.880
whatever you need to do--

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.880
you need to go and turn
on the debugger.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.930
You need to turn on the local
debugger, set that to false,

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.470
so that it sends all
the connection out.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.530
In fact, let's see if
we've got it set up.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.530
Actually, I tried it
earlier today.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.090
It didn't work.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.540
I don't want to go
and try it again.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.640
I think the reason it didn't
work is I just didn't have the

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.770
same subnet set up.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.460
Or there's some kind of firewall
rules within our

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.210
subnet that prevents that
from happening.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.690
Again, you can go check at the
link there, where you can see

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.050
how to get more instructions
on getting that set up.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.540
But it's a pretty easy way to be
able to go through and see

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.020
how your experience
is going to work.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.390
One of the other really
important ways that you can

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.290
test your devices and this is
something that is, I think,

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.280
super important.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.990
And I really want to encourage
the community to go out and

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.910
participate and help with
these Open Device Labs.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.730
But the concept behind an Open
Device Lab is to have a space

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:31.880
where anybody can come in, test
their web application on

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.460
the variety of devices
that are out there.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.280
When you think about the cost
of maintaining multiple

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.550
devices between all the
different versions, the

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.910
different operating systems, the
different sized screens,

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:48.400
the different processors, all
of a sudden that becomes a

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.300
pretty complex and almost
nightmarish experience to do.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.020
And so to be able to go through
and use something like

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.430
an open device lab where there's
just tons of devices

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.540
available, and not just the
latest and greatest devices,

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.640
but also older devices that have
been around for a little

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:12.010
while or devices that are newer
but have the original

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.090
version of their operating
system on them.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.190
So having those open
device labs are a

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:19.700
really fantastic thing.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.400
If you have spare devices you're
not using anymore,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.310
donate them to your
local device lab.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.120
Or if you're in an area where
there's not an open device

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.370
lab, start one.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.540
Find some folks.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.420
Find a location where you can
help start your own open

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.470
device labs.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:42.620
There's a great blog post here
that talks about all of the

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:47.780
open device labs, as well as
where you can go to find them,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.020
as well as how to
start your own.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.540
There's a couple here.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.120
There's one that's just
starting in Brooklyn.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.520
We're trying to get one
started in Manhattan.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.990
There's one in San Francisco,
I believe,

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.020
just getting started.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.200
There's one in Oakland.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.760
We need these all
over the place.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.570
We need these are all around the
world, so that developers

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.760
have a place where they can go
and test their applications,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.610
where you can go,
where I can go.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.909
Because I don't have
every device.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.079
And I'm sure you don't either.

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:19.090
And you probably don't
want to maintain all

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.179
those devices either--

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:26.230
crazy, crazy amounts of
work to go do that.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.610
So with that, I've got a couple
of favors to ask before

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.739
I start taking some
of your questions.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:38.900
I will just bring up slides so
that you can have a look.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.090
If you've got questions, you
can post them there to that

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.270
Google short link.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.179
And I'll take your questions
here in a minute.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.610
But we need your help.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.489
We can't accept the status
quo with web development.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.440
It just simply doesn't
work anymore.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.660
And we need developers to really
push the limits of

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.150
what's cool, of what's
available, and

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.210
just do cool stuff.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.280
If you're building something,
don't accept

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.340
that, oh, it's mobile.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.735
So it's kind of going
to be slower.

00:35:10.735 --> 00:35:12.370
It's going to suck.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.350
Don't accept that.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.950
That's not a good answer.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.000
Go build awesome for the web.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.940
If you find bugs, if you find
things that don't work as you

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.950
expect them in Chrome for
Android, tell us about them.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.310
We want to hear about them.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.880
You can go File bugs
at new.mcrbug.com.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:30.670
Also, go there.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.980
Have a look to see what bugs
are already filed, and star

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.020
the things that you think
are important.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.550
Do you think it's important that
there's an ability to be

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.800
able to hide the address bar?

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.830
There's a bug for that.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.080
Go star that if you think
that's important.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.220
Reliable viewport control,
there's a bug for that.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.400
We've got lots of bugs
filed already.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.570
And we want your help to make
sure that we're making Chrome

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.620
for Android the best browser
that it can be.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.580
If you're building cool stuff,
tell us about it.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.690
When we launched Chrome a number
of years ago, one of

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.060
the things that we did was
launch Chrome Experiments,

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.440
which was sort of this
playground for people showing

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.680
off the cool stuff that
they built on the web.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.590
Well, when we launched Chrome
for Android back in June, we

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.160
wanted to say to developers,
show us the cool stuff you're

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.670
doing on the mobile web.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.080
Show us cool.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.110
And it's a great place where you
can show the rest of the

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.170
world all the cool stuff
that you're doing

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.370
with the mobile web.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:28.190
So build some cool mobile
experiments that work great on

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.000
mobile devices, that take
advantage of the unique

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.670
capabilities of a mobile
device-- maybe touch, maybe

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.580
device orientation, maybe
multi-touch--

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:41.500
but works beautifully on that
small screen and just is an

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.080
awesome experience.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.150
Show us those things.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.350
Show off your skills.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.580
Show it off to your friends.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.960
Do neat stuff.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.600
Start an open device lab in
your area, if you haven't

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.290
started one.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.130
Or you haven't seen
one in your area.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.360
Or you think it's important.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:57.950
Go do it.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.050
We'd love to have
more of these.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:05.080
It's really important to get
these out, to get access to

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.060
these devices.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.330
So that we can build more cool
stuff and make sure it works

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.170
on the plethora of devices
that are out there.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:17.040
But really, the mobile web is
what you and I make it.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.860
We have an opportunity to
build absolutely cool.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.970
We have the ability to
do amazing stuff.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:27.765
And it's up to as web developers
to go do it.

00:37:27.765 --> 00:37:29.630
So don't accept the
status quo.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.920
Go build cool.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.320
So with that, I'll open it
up to your questions.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:40.650
I've seen already one question
in our moderator, as well as a

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.810
bunch of other places.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.810
These slides are available
if you want.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.260
Let me get rid of this guy here
for a sec so that you can

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.050
see the slides.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.070
But the slides are available.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.440
It's always kind of
fun to do this.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.480
I do this a little backward.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.580
See the slide link
is right there.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.150
Yes, so the slide link
is right there.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.410
You can go check out these
slides yourself, as well you

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.230
can watch last week's session,
where we talked about some of

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:07.830
the libraries and other stuff
that is important for mobile

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.100
web developers.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:14.690
I'm going to be back in the new
year, doing more stuff for

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.600
mobile, talking about High DPI,
multi-touch, all sorts of

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.840
stuff that really is relevant
to the mobile web developer.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.910
If you're building for the
mobile web, you want to tune

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:24.940
into these sessions.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.670
We'll try and do them at least
monthly, if not more.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:31.900
Because there's a lot of really
great stuff out there.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.870
So with that, I'll take
your questions.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.860
Pop this guy up, and let's
just go to me.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.170
So you get a nice, big
picture of me.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.710
So one of the first questions
that I've got--

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.370
during my session last week,
I'm just reading it off the

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.210
screen here.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.400
"During session one, you
mentioned to avoid relative

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.800
and absolute positioning.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.100
Why?

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.080
Can you explain a little
bit about that?"

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.710
Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.060
Relative and absolute
positioning on a mobile device

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.690
can be used.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.330
But you need to use
them with caution.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.620
Because when you start thinking
about, I want to move

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:15.960
this div, for example, over 600
pixels, on a mobile device

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.030
that's maybe only
320 pixels wide.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.620
You're going to move
it off screen.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.260
So as you think about using
absolute and relative

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.430
positioning, you need to be very
careful that you're not

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:32.910
using pixels, but instead of
using either percents or--

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.910
there's a new unit that
you can use--

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.490
I don't think it's landed
everywhere.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.600
I think it's only landed
in a couple of places.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.050
But Viewport width--

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.180
so you can actually say, 1% of
the Viewport width, I want to

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.200
move it over.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.800
So you can move a
div or element

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.720
over a specific amount.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.860
So as you think about using
absolute and relative

00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:03.710
positioning, just think in
terms of the size of the

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.340
screen that you're working on.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.620
So I guess I should have
been a little bit

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.500
more clear last week.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.730
It's really about being careful
and not moving stuff

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.120
over that will show
up off screen.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.280
Because it may just show up in
the wrong place, may not even

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.160
show up on the device anymore.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.320
So the next question
that we've got is--

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.780
what's going on with Chrome
for Android for--

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.440
"What's going on for
Chrome for Android?

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.850
Are we going to see another
release this year?

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.210
Are we going to get more
developer tools, like some of

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:37.810
the stuff you showed
us earlier?"

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.870
So that's a great question.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:46.070
The end team is working on
trying to get sort of feature

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:50.120
parity between the mobile and
desktop version, get us to the

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.050
same version.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:55.860
On desktop right now, I think
we're running 24 or 25.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.690
On mobile, we're only at 18.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.570
When they started working
on Chrome for Android.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:05.050
They had to do a fork to the
code, to be able to make some

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.090
changes and all that.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.480
They're almost done, if they
haven't already finished

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.340
integrating all those
changes back to the

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.080
main Chromium tree.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.430
Now that's done, they're going
to be able to go through.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:19.020
And we'll be able to see,
hopefully, more frequent

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.120
releases soon.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.850
I don't have a date for you on
when we're going to see the

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:24.470
next release.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.310
I've got my fingers crossed
that we're going to see it

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:27.860
really soon.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:32.470
But I'm not going to hold my
breath on the specific date or

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.090
tell you a specific
date because I'm

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.590
not really 100% sure.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.930
We want to make sure
we get this right.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:39.810
We want to make sure that we're
giving you the right set

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:44.720
of tools and the right set of
resources that you need.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.410
So that looks like that's the
end of the questions.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.450
I want to say thank you guys
so much for joining us, or

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.550
joining me.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.740
It was a great session,
I think, today.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.220
I hope you learned a lot.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:59.000
Be sure to check out session
number one, so that you see

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.290
some of the stuff
that's going on.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.170
My name's Pete LePage and
thanks for joining me.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.640
I hope you have a really
great holiday.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.350
And we'll see you next year.
