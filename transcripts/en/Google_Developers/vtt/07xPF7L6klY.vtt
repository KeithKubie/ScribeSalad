DAVE CLEMENTS: Hi, I'm
Dave Clements, Head

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.029
of Design at Novoda.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.945
DAVID GONZALEZ: Hi, My
name is David Gonzalez,

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.140
and I'm Technical
Product Owner at Novoda.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.110
And Novoda is a software
development house,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.205
specialized on Android.

00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:18.270
And we're based
in London, Berlin,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.550
and very, very soon in New York.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.850
So we are going to show today
how we use paper wireframing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.935
to build native
prototypes of our apps.

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:28.643
DAVE CLEMENTS: So
initially, we start off

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:31.680
with an idea, which we will
discuss with the client.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.020
Go through persona,
stories, et cetera,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.790
break down the feature
list, and begin drawing.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.395
We work in sketch books, keeping
it really simple, really fast,

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:46.840
so that you can iterate through
those quickly and build up

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.710
user journeys with those
images, which we can then

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.900
send to the client and have
discussions over those.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.400
OK.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.990
So I start with just
drawing a simple screen.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.990
Let's say I'm doing
a phone layout.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.880
And there's a system
bar and a navbar here.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.610
And yeah, just start
literally scribbling down

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640
basic information.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.560
Put some tabs here.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.410
And we've got an area
here with an image in.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.480
And maybe that's a card
with some bits here,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.460
It's literally as
simple as this,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.380
really rough, not time wasting.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.630
And I might just add the
occasional bit here and there

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.160
of sort of this brush pens
to give a bit of depth

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.860
so the client know
what's going where

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.740
in terms of the hierarchy layer.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.240
OK.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.300
From there, we take the
drawings that we've created,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.140
cut them out, and
pop them on a table.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.950
And we as a group sit down
with designers, developers,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.220
et cetera, and just move things
around, move screens around,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.730
overlay parts of
screens to basically

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.140
come up with user
journeys that we feel

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.830
are good enough to
show to the client.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.710
From there, we send them
along and wait for feedback.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.440
So we've got these
slices we've cut out,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.940
these pages, these
screens, whatever

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.600
you're going to call them.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.042
And we didn't
think, all right, we

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:16.250
need to create user journeys.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.922
So the first screen--

00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:19.380
DAVID GONZALEZ: We
have the first--

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.900
that was the first
screen, right?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.560
DAVE CLEMENTS: We might
have a navigation draw.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.986
We know that's going
to slide in and out.

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:25.560
So if you don't mind,
we'd hold that back.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.268
DAVID GONZALEZ: Yes,
see that looks nice.

00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:28.385
Yeah, it looks nice, huh?

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:29.080
Yeah.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.380
DAVE CLEMENTS: Yeah.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.963
It looks good.

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:31.300
DAVID GONZALEZ: I like.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.805
DAVE CLEMENTS: And next
page, we scroll it unto here.

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:32.995
DAVID GONZALEZ: Where
are we going from here?

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:33.680
We have this.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920
DAVE CLEMENTS: This is
showing that we can swipe up

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.810
and the title disappears.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.100
The tabs lock.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.874
Moving on, we'll click into--
let's just say that one.

00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:47.290
This is actually not important
for the moment where we go.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.430
But the point is we're
showing this user journey.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.740
So then we may say,
should we tap this area?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.200
We get this pop up.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.075
Once we've laid these
out, and we've decided,

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.350
OK we don't need this,
but this all user journey.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.900
We just simply photograph that.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.590
And then we'll upload that
to say Basecamp or JIRA,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.800
and the client can
take it from there.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.960
And then from there,
we may develop further,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.520
create more user logic
flows, et cetera.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.807
But this is the basic.

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:13.390
DAVID GONZALEZ: So
the third phase, we

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.370
got to build a prototype.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.530
So we get all the designs
and all these asset

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.780
that we've been cutting out.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.550
We'll put them on a native app.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.950
So we would build an actual
app that the client will use.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.110
And he will use them.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.070
They will play with it.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.361
And they will decide internally
if they like it or not.

00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:29.504
And then if they don't,
we just do it again.

00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:30.920
Yeah, now what we
would do is when

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.580
we have these images
based Basecamp or on JIRA,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.450
we'll put these on a
very simple layout.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.860
Here we have a frame layout.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.220
And the other thing we
do is just inflate it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.720
and get some stuff
like the images

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.410
and the pictures and the
text from the headline.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.090
And very easily displayed
just put it here.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.620
As you can see, you can
have a very quick image

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.720
of how it's going to
look like on the app.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.890
So now this is--
what we're see here

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.650
is the first screen of
the app in this case.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.670
And this is a very simple
logging and [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.280
activity.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.920
And in this case as
you can see, it's

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.800
just very simple
layout, which is

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.070
showing frame layout of buttons.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.680
Everyone single one
has the listener set.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.320
And then it is a very
simple sketch UI.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.960
So in this case, when we
click on the login screen--

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.500
on the login button, we will
go to the list of articles

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.649
that we just saw before.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.180
And what we're
trying to do is here

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.350
is when the user takes one
of the items on the list,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.050
it will go to the article.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.977
And the article is just
a very single fragment

00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:28.810
with a very simple
layout when they can just

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.469
see images and text.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.010
And as you can see
in this case, it's

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.690
just a scroll view
with a linear layout.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.830
And two items, which
are frame layout, which

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.910
is the image and the text.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.584
And with this, we pretty much
build the whole UI for now.

00:04:41.584 --> 00:04:44.000
So the only thing we need to
do is just build the project,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.850
compile it, and use the APK.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.030
So what this allows us is to
have a very fast interaction

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.620
with the client and very fast
iterations on the process.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.790
And this will make
us save a lot of time

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.320
of developing and
drawing things.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.860
And that will be a much better
outcome for the project.
