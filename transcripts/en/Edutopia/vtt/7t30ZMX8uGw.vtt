00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:03.756
&gt;&gt;Tom: When we're producing
food, there's that purpose

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.056
and that brings relevance.

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:09.216
It's all about student
engagement and by engagement,

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:11.216
I'm not talking about
just paying attention.

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:13.246
I'm talking about
like an emotional,

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.386
psychological commitment
to their learning.

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:22.576
&gt;&gt;Anne: We're always studying
these things in the context

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:24.566
of this classroom
or in a textbook,

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.576
and that's not necessarily
authentic.

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:31.016
Service learning is any
kind of project or unit

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:33.536
that takes the required
curriculum

00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:36.086
and finds applications
in the community.

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:40.076
So it's going to end up having
a real life product or meaning.

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:42.806
You have a third party
right in front of you.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.036
The school definitely has needs.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.856
How can your class meet them?

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:51.226
The greenhouse is a really
great example of a way

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.926
that service learning can
actually benefit the same group

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:56.286
that is doing studying.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.046
&gt;&gt;Tom: Every kid is
part of the food system,

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:01.666
so the relevance is there.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:03.946
The original vision
for the greenhouse was

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:05.996
that biology students were
going to grow salad greens.

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:08.896
Using biology students
guaranteed that every kid

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:11.226
in the school was
going to get exposure.

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:18.156
The daily operations of salad
green production involves them

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:20.276
tending their plants
on a daily basis.

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:23.376
Each student has
two of those trays.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:27.876
They plant them, they water
them, they monitor them

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:29.796
for pests, they thin them out.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.446
&gt;&gt;William: We learned all
about soil, fertilization,

00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:36.126
what the plants need and
taking care of the plants

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:37.886
in general, which was great.

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:40.506
&gt;&gt;Sam: We harvest them
Mondays and Wednesday mornings.

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:42.306
Those are taken to the cafeteria

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.516
and distributed throughout
the entire district.

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:47.366
The greens are not only
eaten here within the school,

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:49.256
but they're also eaten
at the middle school

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.216
and the elementary school.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:53.496
&gt;&gt;Betty: We can use
everything that they grow.

00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:58.216
I pay for the greens,
that's why we document it.

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:01.816
They are more apt to take
greens from the salad bar

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:04.216
if it's something that
they've seen and grown.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:06.586
They're a little
bit proud of that.

00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:09.866
&gt;&gt;William: Having so much
effect on what we're eating

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.416
in school, it feels really nice.

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:12.586
It feels like you've
accomplished something.

00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:15.716
&gt;&gt;Tom: We don't necessarily want

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.766
to get things planted
as soon as they can.

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:21.526
We want to kind of work
backwards from the school year

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:24.556
in the fall so that what you're
planting, what you're growing,

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:26.346
will be ready when the
kids are back in school.

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:28.476
&gt;&gt;In my environmental
applications class,

00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:30.346
service learning is a key piece.

00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:33.386
They get the outdoor
gardens started.

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:35.396
They'll set up management
and harvest plans

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.556
for the next year's
class to come in.

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:40.806
Within that structure of the
service learning projects,

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:43.446
these different initiatives
and projects come about.

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:48.186
For example, we add different
crops, the hoop house,

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:52.676
the irrigation system,
and aquaponics.

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:56.406
&gt;&gt;William: The fishes'
waste is toxic to us,

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.426
but when the plants get a hold
of it, they take the nitrogen

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:04.416
and other helpful things in it
and turn it into food for us.

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:06.576
&gt;&gt;Tom: They have action plans
that they have to develop.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.686
They have different rubrics
that they assess themselves,

00:03:09.686 --> 00:03:11.346
and I assess them
every other week to see

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:13.136
if they're sticking
to those plans.

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:15.236
They blog about it at
least every other week.

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:17.166
&gt;&gt;William: There's
lots of opportunities

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:20.536
to apply our learning and make
it relevant to the real world,

00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:23.626
because why learn it if
it doesn't mean anything?

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:25.986
&gt;&gt;Anne: When I think
about how I'm going

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:29.176
to incorporate service
learning into my curriculum,

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.306
I first look at, what
are my objectives?

00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:33.206
What do I want kids to walk away

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:34.736
with by the time
this unit is over?

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:37.986
How are the kids going to
get from not knowing anything

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:41.616
to a final product that
is useful and helpful?

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:44.386
As part of teaching
physics, one of the ways

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:48.376
that heat transfer can be talked
about is through the process

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:52.426
of making bio char, which is
charcoal used like fertilizer.

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:54.626
&gt;&gt;We're looking at
the efficiency of--

00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:56.636
&gt;&gt;Student: How fast
it will burn water.

00:03:56.796 --> 00:03:59.626
&gt;&gt;Anne: How fast it
will heat up water.

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:05.616
We need the mass of the wood
beforehand and we need the mass

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:09.366
of the unburned wood afterwards.

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:11.566
&gt;&gt;Kids are designing
their own systems

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.186
that will create this bio char.

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:15.936
We'll inoculate it
with some bacteria

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.956
and probably see how much
does it increase crop yields

00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:20.306
and do some experiments
with that.

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:24.686
Service learning projects take
ballpark three or four weeks,

00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:26.606
which is a substantial
commitment,

00:04:26.836 --> 00:04:29.126
but it's going to be relevant.

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.046
The kids are going to
remember it forever,

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:34.606
so it's totally worth it because
engagement is so much higher.

00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:36.276
&gt;&gt;What do you think, is it
going to change it a lot?

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:36.716
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:37.416
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, I think so.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:37.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:40.246
&gt;&gt;Tom: There really is also
this work component to it.

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:42.756
It's tied into their
grades in different ways,

00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:47.046
but the level responsibility,
salad greens in the greenhouse.

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:50.796
You skip it for a day
and they could die.

00:04:51.316 --> 00:04:52.416
That level of responsibility,

00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:54.756
we didn't realize how
big that was going to be.

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:57.466
&gt;&gt;Anne: They have an external
reason to care; it's not just

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:58.606
about the grades for them.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:02.426
I've often seen kids who
are not really that engaged

00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:06.436
in school come alive when they
get to project that's going

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.246
to mean something
to someone else.

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:11.146
&gt;&gt;Tom: Former students come
back and talk about how that,

00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:12.826
you know, really
transformed them.
