Where does discipline come from?

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.833
<v 1>Pretty Sad.</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.120
Discipline comes from within.

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
It's an internal force now. Sure,

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.120
of course you can have discipline posed on new by some person,

6
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.290
like like a drill instructor or like that self-help come on TV.

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.920
But the reality is that type of discipline isn't the way for your type of

8
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:44.730
discipline that we're talking about. That discipline isn't as strong survive.

9
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.590
<v 0>What you need is self defense,</v>

10
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.480
<v 1>self discipline. It comes from the self. It comes from you.</v>

11
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.270
It comes from when you make a decision

12
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.350
to be disciplined, when you make a decision to be better,

13
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.540
when you make a decision to do more and to be more

14
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.300
self calls.

15
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.340
When you decide that you're gonna make a mark on the world,

16
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.410
and if you think

17
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.640
that you're not disciplined or you can't do this,

18
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.860
it's because you haven't yet decided to be disciplined.

19
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.120
It's because you haven't created that discipline

20
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.593
yet.

21
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.110
[inaudible] so make the decision,

22
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.720
make the discipline the root quality that will improve every aspect of your life

23
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.050
better, stronger, smarter, and faster.

24
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.563
And boost

25
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.850
[inaudible]. It'll make.
