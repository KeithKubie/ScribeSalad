00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.620
In the last level, we set up our
player and added the arrow key and

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.480
accelerometer controls.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.530
Then we added the icicles.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.040
I hope you've been having fun
with the game already, but

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.800
you kind of have to use the honor system
to keep track of when you've been hit.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.170
In this level,
we'll add collision detection, so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.560
you know when the player's
been hit by an icicle.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.440
And we'll add a head-up display to keep
track of how many icicles you've dodged.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.140
Finally, we'll add multiple
difficulty levels, and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.390
a whole new screen, to allow the user to
change the difficulty level on the fly.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.890
Let's dig in.
