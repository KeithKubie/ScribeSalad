00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.420
We now know a little bit
about inflation and deflation.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.430
And now I want to introduce
you to hyperinflation.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.040
And as the word implies,
it's inflation gone wild.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.020
How hyperinflation,
or at least the cases

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.250
that we've seen in modern times,
how they've happened is you

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.091
have some type of a
government just going wild

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.090
with the printing press.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.510
They're just printing
a ton of money.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.870
So the general cycle
is they print money,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.880
they print like mad,
usually because they

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.510
don't have any other
way of getting revenue.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.050
They print like mad.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.140
That leads to prices going up.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.180
And then because
prices go up, they

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.120
have to print more
in order for them

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.860
to be able to get the
same goods and services

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.930
or pay the government
workers what they wanted

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.221
to pay the government workers,
or pay the soldiers what

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.260
they wanted to pay the soldiers.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.270
This by itself would probably
drive the hyperinflation

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.150
in and of itself.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.960
But on top of this, we're used
to thinking high inflation is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050
5% or 10%, but you
could imagine what

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.690
happens when inflation
is 5% or 10% per hour.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.630
Because then
there's no incentive

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.400
to be actually holding currency.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.690
Every second that
you hold currency it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.200
becomes worth less
and less and less.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.450
And so what happens in a
scenario like this is people

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.740
want to hoard hard assets.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.080
So if the price of bread
is going up by the minute

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260
or by the hour, or
the price of shoes

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.240
are going up by the
minute or by the hour,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.130
the increase in prices is going
to make people hoard things.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.700
Hoarding goes through the roof.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.950
And you can imagine if
hoarding goes through the roof,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.594
if the shoe seller doesn't
want to sell his shoes anymore,

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.510
or he wants the hold
them a little bit longer,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.490
then the supply of shoes
are going to go down,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.710
and the prices are going
to go up even higher.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.080
So hoarding leads
even to higher prices.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.650
When people go to
the bread market,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.030
and there's five loaves of
bread, they buy all of them.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.520
And then the next
person can't buy any

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.970
because they know that
the price of bread

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.180
is going through the roof.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.100
So it just keeps
getting worse and worse.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.990
And it's all started
by the government just

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.430
going nuts with
the printing press.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.430
Now, the three most
famous examples

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.940
of this happening--
probably the most famous one

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.640
is what happened
in Weimar Germany

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.640
after World War I. They had
huge reparations to pay.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.430
That's what the
Weimar government

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.600
would have argued
was their main cause.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.967
But they just printed
money like crazy.

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.550
Some people said
that they were almost

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.883
trying to destroy the economy
so that they wouldn't have

00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:40.540
to pay reparations for what
they did in World War I.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.270
But this just gives you a
sense of how crazy it was.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.560
Here's the end of World
War I. And they just

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.710
printed money like mad.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.520
And isn't the rate of inflation.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.330
This is how much it was
relative to a gold mark.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.160
So this is one gold
mark over here.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.660
So only after about 2 and a
half years it was over tenfold.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.240
And this is a logarithmic scale.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.170
Each slash year, this
is a factor of 10.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.297
So after by the
end of 1923, you're

00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:10.380
looking at-- This is what?

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.280
Not 100,000, not a
million, not a billion.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.260
This is a trillion.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.200
It had gone up a trillion fold
in the span of one, two, three,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.620
four, five, six years.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.000
The other famous
examples of this,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.230
Zimbabwe from 1980 until 2009.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.470
Once again, printing
money like mad.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.140
And some of their productive
capacity went away.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.760
This right here is a 100
trillion Zimbabwe dollar.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.020
And this shows you
the Zimbabwean dollar

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.250
relative to the US dollar.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.070
And once again, is
a logarithmic scale.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.430
This is 10 to the 30th power.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.000
And then the largest or the
most extreme hyperinflation

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.170
ever was Hungary
after World War II.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.170
And this right here
is a 10 million

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.850
pengo note, just to give
you an idea of what people

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.500
were carrying around
in their pockets.
