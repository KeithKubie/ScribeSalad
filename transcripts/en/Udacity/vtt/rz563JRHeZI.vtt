What if X were 20?

00:00:00.978 --> 00:00:04.019
I want you to tell me first
would what the Y value be?

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.840
But then I want you to also write
an ordered pair for me here.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.050
And this time I'm not going to give
you the comma or the parentheses.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.360
You have do it all yourself.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.860
Good luck.
