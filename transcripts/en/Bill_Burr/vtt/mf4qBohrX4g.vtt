00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.660
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Birr.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.880
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.560
February 22nd,
2016 what's going on?
How,

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.860
how's it going?
Happy Monday to air each and every one of you.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.820
I was going to say to every one of you,
then I decided to throw in each.

6
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.590
So that's why the each sounded weird there.
Just to let you know.
Um,

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.610
it's another beautiful day out here in Los Angeles,
uh,

8
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:33.540
getting ready to go out to fox woods.
Um,
this,
uh,

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.640
this weekend,
right?
Yeah.

10
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:40.641
Friday I'll be in New York City and then a Saturday and Sunday I'm going to be

11
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.540
at Foxwoods and um,
it's going to be hopefully going to be a good time.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.690
I'm going to do a bunch of stand up this week so I'm not rusty old freckles.

13
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.460
Can't be walking in there rusty.

14
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.900
And I'm definitely looking forward to getting back there,

15
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.890
although I heard it's fucking freezing.
Um,
but whatever,
you know,

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.690
I can visit winter.

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.370
I'm a big fucking southern California softy now.

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.213
It get there,

19
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.760
my teeth chatter and when it gets in the forties it's actually not true.

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.670
And that shit to where they go,
all your blood thins out,
you know,

21
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.630
you blood thins out,
then you go back.
You can't,
it'll the cold.
It's like,
no,

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.040
that's not what happens.
You,
you're,

23
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:25.041
you have access to information in a beautiful life that you could be living

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.820
still within the parameters of this great country.
You know,

25
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.260
all you people back this shovel in that wet snob,
just letting you need,

26
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.690
you don't have to do it.
You know,

27
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.100
I took my dog out this morning battle about who do you know what I had on,

28
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.600
I had on a wind break

29
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.040
just walking down the street.
I could sit on my back porch in the sun right now.

30
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.410
Okay.
And burn another couple of cancer causing freckles into the top of my head.

31
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.600
Will,
I had a little bit of corn flakes,
you know,

32
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:01.200
sitting out there like the Douche in the goal.
Great nut commercials.

33
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.910
Zoe's some guy,
right?
He come out.
It was like he was a man's man,

34
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:09.900
but a pretty boy.
You know,
like Tom Brady,
except he couldn't throw a football,

35
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.710
that guy.
Right.
And he'd come out with the,
the impossible,

36
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:15.480
impossibly white robe

37
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.990
brand new white robe.
They even fucking bleached it.
Right?
The widest shit ever.

38
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.710
And He,
you know,
he's got a little fucking bullet grape nuts.

39
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.650
Always had some fruit in there cause he had that kind of time.

40
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.200
This guy was so successful.

41
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.900
He had the time to cut up fruit and do is fucking great Nazi.

42
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.510
He'd go out on his back porch and just chill.
I remember as a,
as a little boy,

43
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.510
as a little orange headed fucking freckled pussy.

44
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.630
I remember watching that just going like that guys hit guys live in the life.

45
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.310
Look at him.
Look,
I got wiped out.
Robust.

46
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.710
It's got fruit in his fucking grape nuts.
Guy's crushing it.

47
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.730
Who is he?
Fuck it.
Come on.
I want to see the rest of his life.

48
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.900
Let me see as less.

49
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.040
And that was the genius of that commercial.
They never showed his bro.

50
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.600
I don't think they did.
Maybe she came out afterwards.
You know,
I don't think so.

51
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.720
But that's the genius of it.

52
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.470
Had left you wanting more and you started thinking about his life and you

53
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:14.470
started thinking,
you know what,
you know what if I start eating great months,

54
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.320
maybe I'll have an impossibly white robe and I'll come out and I'll actually

55
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.940
have pigment in my skin,
you know,

56
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.260
nice full head of hair and I'll walk out on my deck barefoot,
you know,

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.200
look,
I like,
I got all the money in the world,
I got all the answers,
confidence,

58
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:33.640
hell and I even have time to cut up fruit in my cereal.
I want that life.

59
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.750
You know?
Here it is,
years later to this day,
you know,

60
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.740
I'm still eating great myths.
Sure.
I never got the pigment.

61
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.200
Yay.
I lost the hair.

62
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.700
<v 0>I had some structural damage to my house,
you know,</v>

64
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.910
but I have tried to cut up some fruit.

65
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.130
<v 0>Spot.
I'm sorry.
Anyways,</v>

67
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.190
yes.
So your blood doesn't thin out.
It doesn't thin out.

68
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:10.540
You just know what it's like to experience in 85 degree day and fucking

69
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.340
February.
And then you'd go back.
You just like what the,
you know,
and it's like,

70
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.100
it's like you ever see a rich person to have to stand in line.

71
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.220
It's the combination of frustration and confusion.

72
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.390
It's more confusion than frustration.
It's more like,
wait,
I don't wait.

73
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.020
I got money.
Like who came here?
Who wants this?

74
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.320
Who do I give this to so I can go around this?

75
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.900
I don't want to be with these animals.

76
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.840
<v 1>Okay,</v>

77
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.770
<v 0>these are the people that make my dreams come true.
They show up at my factory.</v>

78
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.600
All right.
They put the fucking,
that nut and bolt and the widget

79
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.310
that I bought off of somebody else,
they came in with the design.

80
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.810
They didn't have any money.

81
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.530
I made him sign a piece of paper where I own the patent to their idea.

82
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.250
I go around all this,
right,
rich guy,

83
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:06.540
thoughts in the ditches and confusion.
It's like,
why am I,

84
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.650
I don't do this anymore.

85
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.350
That's what West Coast people who've lived on the east coast.

86
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:12.460
Then when they go back east,

87
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.100
you know when we paratroop into fucking winner,
that's,

88
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:19.270
that's what would take like,
I don't do this anymore.

89
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.530
These chap faced fucking animals back here.

90
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:27.760
I'm a fucking doing the shoveling wet snow,
stretching out your back,

91
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.340
you know,
all excited cause you got a new snowblower,

92
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.830
you know that's your winner.
That's for you.
I,
I go around that man.

93
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:39.810
I don't do that shit.
I'm out of my back porch.

94
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.630
No bathrobe beat some great months.

95
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.000
So I'm doing it to my fucking dog is laying on his bed right now.
Okay.

96
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.440
It's like from the neck down.

97
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:54.441
It's on the bed and then like it's head is hanging off of the bed onto the

98
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:56.310
hardwood floor.

99
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.140
I mean it looks literally like a got hit by a tranquilizer.

100
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.940
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

101
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.980
<v 0>All right.
And you know what I did with what?
The dog today.</v>

102
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.090
This is why she's so exhausted after at least 11 hours sleep last night.

103
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.470
The fucking thing goes to bed at like seven at night.
It's hilarious.

104
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.260
Like whenever I'm watching the game and I'm just sitting there,

105
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.120
she's like over in the corner,
just curled up in a ball,

106
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.910
sound asleep.
Okay.
Which is why now for,
so I can't get her off this clock here.

107
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.710
She keeps,
I don't know how to keep her up,
you know,

108
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.280
cause she keeps waking me up at like five 30 quarter to six in the morning.

109
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:36.090
It's driving me nuts.
So anyways,
so now after 11 hours of sleeping,
I,

110
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.430
all I did was I took it around the block.
That's it.
Easy.

111
00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:40.870
She looks like she ran a marathon.

112
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.593
I don't fucking know.

113
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.750
I don't understand why they're so goddamn sleepy all the time.
I've never,

114
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:49.280
I mean I've had dogs my whole life.

115
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.040
I've never seen a dog sleep the way this fucking thing sleeps.

116
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.610
Then it gets up at five 30 in the morning like a God damned drill sergeant.

117
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.810
The only thing it's missing is,
you know,

118
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.250
remember in full metal jacket when the guy came walking in and he was beaten a

119
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.170
Billy club against the empty trashcan.

120
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:07.370
That's basically what she does to me every morning except it's way more
adorable.

121
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.790
I'll be like sound asleep and then I'll,

122
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.020
I'm woken up to a cold nose doing that.
That fucking

123
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.160
psycho way.
They sniff it does,

124
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:23.810
that shit is fucking her paintbrush.

125
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.040
Tunc then I'm like,
ah.

126
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.920
That's how I wake up every morning and I'm one of those people.

127
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:30.830
Once you wake me up,
it's fucking over.
All right.
Just just to let you know,

128
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.130
in case you ever sleeping next to me,
you know,
keep it quiet.

129
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.750
Um,
all right,
let's move on.
Um,

130
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.880
as I mentioned on the Thursday,
uh,

131
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.190
after afternoon podcast just before Friday,
um,

132
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.280
that I was going to the,
uh,
the warriors game.
Um,

133
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.290
I was going to the warriors a clipper game and I was taking the lovely Nia and

134
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.690
uh,
cause I wanted to go see Steph curry in his prime.
You know,

135
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.390
you got to see them when they're young for they get the first major injury ever

136
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.100
before they just get old and reminds you that you're going to die someday.

137
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.330
You know,
you don't need to see that.
But during that,
you know,

138
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:18.440
I saw Michael Jordan back when he had hair.
I see them early.
All right.

139
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:22.320
When he was still skinny and the Pistons were beating the shit out of him and he

140
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.490
was dropping 60 on the Celtics,
I saw him then.
He's probably,

141
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:27.470
I saw him when he was staying with probably,

142
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.100
I think it was right before the Jordan threes came up.

143
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.780
I was probably the second pair,
by the way,
for the record,

144
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:37.120
when the first air of Air Jordans came out,

145
00:08:37.121 --> 00:08:39.820
I thought they were the ugliest fucking things I'd ever seen in the,

146
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:42.700
in the red and black a bulls colors.

147
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:46.240
I thought they were the ugliest fucking things I'd ever seen it by the way.

148
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:49.750
Celtics fans,
how much more likable is Pau Gasol now that he's not on the Lakers.

149
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:50.584
I don't know what it is.

150
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.290
My hatred of the Lakers really just maybe hate that guy way more than I needed

151
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:59.880
to.
Um,
anyways,
so we go down to the game and um,
um,

152
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.190
yeah,
I'm like ridiculous,
excited.

153
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.630
Like I'm seeing one of the great NBA teams of all time and I'm seeing arguably

154
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.360
the greatest shooter this early in his career.

155
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:10.890
You can actually make that argument.
This is,

156
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:15.660
this guy's the greatest shooter in NBA history.
And in my lifetime,

157
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:20.600
I've watched Andrew,
Tony,
Larry Legend,
Reggie Miller,
and I,

158
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.500
I even throw Coby Brian in that,

159
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.210
I never saw a guy have two people hanging on him up by the three point line and

160
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:30.630
just with his back to the fucking hope and he's still somehow gets it in,

161
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:31.464
you know,

162
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.530
God knows he's not looking for the open man trying to beat the double team.

163
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:39.330
Why would you do that?
Anyways,

164
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.430
so I go there,
I get on stub hub,
right?

165
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.690
I fucking paid through the nose.
You know what I mean?
Fuck it.

166
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.420
Paid through the nose.
I get a six row behind,
uh,

167
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.450
not behind the bench but almost behind the warriors bench,

168
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:00.360
but whatever the fucking table where all the announcers are and shit,

169
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.780
I'm like somewhere in there,
six rows back.

170
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.760
And one of the great things is when you go to an NBA game is like if you're six

171
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:13.530
rows deep,
you can like literally hear them calling for the ball.
You know,

172
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.200
if like if the coach is Steve Kerr,
if he fucking cursed at the ref,
like,
oh,

173
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.830
what the fuck?
And he gets teed up.
I know what he said.
All right.

174
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.630
That's what I paid for.
That's why I went on stub hub and I said,

175
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:31.500
fuck it.
Huh?
You want a wheel bar?

176
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.180
Barrel full of cash.
Here you go.
I'm not fucking sitting all the way.

177
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.810
The staple center is the fucking worse.

178
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.300
You got to sit down low or else it's like they got this,

179
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.820
this brownstone of a corporate boxes,

180
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.420
three deckers,
three,
three fucking levels of them all the way around.

181
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.940
It's like a moat between the fucking haves and the have nots.

182
00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:57.780
And then all the real fans,
they're up by the fucking air condition ducts.

183
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.230
So it's like that's what's the option as either way the fuck up their pay

184
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:04.770
through the nose.
So I said fuck it.
I'm going to pay through the nose.
Right.
So,

185
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.960
and I'm going to get there.
I'm going to hear him talking.

186
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.240
I'm going to watch some,
one of the great shooters of all fucking time.

187
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.720
And I get there,
dude.
And I know during all of this,

188
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:17.390
I'm going to sound like a grumpy old man,
but what the fuck happened to,
to,

189
00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:20.870
to go into an NBA game?
Do they?
They didn't.

190
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.970
There wasn't one moment of silence.

191
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.350
The entire fucking gave to even play music when the fucking games going on.

192
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.940
I didn't hear one sneaker squeak.
I heard a couple of yo call for the ball.

193
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:37.260
That was it.
I heard nothing cause the entire fucking time that game's going on.

194
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.760
Some fucking do.
She's playing everybody clap your hands.
Tick,
tick,

195
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.660
tick to the whole.
They played that fucking 50 fucking times.

196
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.670
First of all,
I walked into the fucking building,
right?
And I'm all excited.

197
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.650
Where's my seats?
I paid through the nose.
Here we go.
Right?

198
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.470
It's like when you go on vacation and use all your fucking miles was sitting up

199
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.400
in the front of the play.
You can't fucking wait to get on a plane.

200
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.200
Where's my big comfy fucking shake that I fucking paid for,
right?

201
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.720
That's the level of excitement I had.

202
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.730
And I go in there and I'm coming down to the seats.
And first of all,

203
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.900
there's some Dj guy,
there's always a fucking DJ.

204
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.260
You can't even buy a pair of fucking pants.
Now you walk into a store,

205
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.630
there's a fucking some sad look at Dj.
They're just shit now,

206
00:12:23.631 --> 00:12:25.090
you know with his bad posture,

207
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.020
you know some hacky Jay just fucking play in music.

208
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.910
I love to with like curse words in it too.

209
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:33.910
Like you were in like a place of business,
you know,

210
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.810
because I'm fucking you to not right as

211
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:45.580
the plane like biggie and shit.
Right.
So,
um,
anyways,

212
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.620
this is fucking Dj.

213
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

214
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.410
<v 0>And he's,
I don't know what the fuck he's doing every five seconds.</v>

215
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:54.340
Make so no

216
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.400
people at section three.
I'd ready to do good every back.
So

217
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.750
game hasn't even started.
What the fuck are we it?
Huh?

218
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.520
Are you getting this hype for the game?
You fucking dope.

219
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.360
We're about ready to see the clippers and the warriors towards got five losses.

220
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.320
This is like watching the 96 bulls,
that tear that they're on.

221
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.360
I don't need you and your Richie Cunningham Varsity fucking clippers jacket out

222
00:13:24.361 --> 00:13:28.590
there screaming and fucking yelling.
Oh,
it gets worse.

223
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.250
I might blow a fucking buy,
have an aneurysm on this one.

224
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.560
So I'm walking down going,
oh my God,

225
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.920
how long is this guy going to be yelling at us?
And meanwhile,
meanwhile,

226
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:39.940
by the way,
meanwhile,

227
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.840
you know the clippers are out shooting around in the worries about ready to take

228
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:44.230
to court.

229
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.590
I'm going to get to watch Steph curry fucking hit like 18 three pointers in a

230
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.000
row,
you know,
that's what I want to see.
That's what I want to hear.
Okay.

231
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.650
I don't eat back.
So no,
I don't need that shit.
Right.
But you know,
it's a new day.

232
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.520
It's a new generation stair time.
I'm just a grumpy old man,
right?

233
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.570
So I get down on my sheet that I paid through the fucking nose for right on the

234
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:09.700
fucking aisle and the what looks to be,

235
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:13.360
it looks like Steph Curry's mouth guard that he's constantly fucking chewing on,

236
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:17.890
right?
And it's like this bracelet.
And I didn't know what it was.

237
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.340
It looked like a fucking,
it looked like a one of those things.

238
00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:24.880
They stick in the Bonneville,
a men's urinal,
right?
Or urinal cake,

239
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.490
except he gets stick your fucking,
you could put it on your wrist.

240
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.220
So it's taped to the back of my seat.

241
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.480
So I immediately just flip the fuck a thing over the other side of my seat.
Okay.

242
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.160
Immediately I'm not participating.
All right.
Total contrarian,

243
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.410
Conti fucking standup loaner comic.
I'm not being part of the group immediately.

244
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.970
Right.
And I'll take that.

245
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.380
I'll take 40% of the blame of the rest of this fucking wine and shit.

246
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.690
All right,
but the other 60% I'm fucking right.

247
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.120
So I fucking flipped that thing over.

248
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.470
And the fucking Dj guy with the Richie Cunningham varsity clippers jacket is

249
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:02.660
down there and he's,
he's like,

250
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:07.640
everybody hold up you fucking urinal cakes and when you hold it up,

251
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:12.620
don't forget.
Dot
everybody clap your hands.
Tech Tech,

252
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:16.580
tech tech to do this is all going on,
right?
And Sanity call.
And by the way,

253
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.350
there's a bunch of fucking,
you know,

254
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.770
like I swear to God what said,

255
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.740
who's that fucking guy who does the,

256
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.650
he shows the nice comfortable tee shirts,

257
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:31.580
but for some reason he shoots like 12 year old girls in like sexual positions.

258
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.010
The fuck is the name of that company.
It's not amber congress and Fitch.

259
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:40.650
They were into like fucking,
what was it like a white supremacists,

260
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.640
Kennedy children.
I can't,
I,
you know,
they,
it all blends together.

261
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:47.000
It begins with an egg.
That's all I know.
So they got these fucking like preteens,

262
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:48.890
it looks like calming down,

263
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.453
<v 1>you know,</v>

264
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.690
<v 0>dress like prostitutes and fucking like a be Hollywood movie.
Right.</v>

265
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.800
You know,
like the ones in a pretty woman.
Yeah.

266
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.730
The only exciting part of that was when he was looking for a hooker and then he

267
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:09.410
runs into that fucking,
you know,
molar show in fucking champ there.
Right.

268
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.900
I always hated when he fucking closed shut.
She goes,
fuck it.

269
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.290
Laugh at all those fucking teeth.
Jesus Christ.
Uh,

270
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.900
I swear to God,
that clip right there is why I never dropped acid.

271
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.020
Cause if I ever ran into a woman like that and she did the,
I swear to God,

272
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.060
I don't know why,
what happened,
my fucking head would explode.
So anyways,

273
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.150
she's scribing and got to the start of the fucking game yet so much just fucking

274
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.190
bugged me.
So did doing dance routines all the shits.
So in the meantime,

275
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.430
the fucking warriors take the court and everybody bows him and everything and

276
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:49.160
I'm just literally going like,
oh my God.
There we go.
Stereos.

277
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.540
Here he goes and he starts hitting fucking threes and the second he does every

278
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:57.290
fucking jerk off and the fucking building.
Right.

279
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.460
Who was it making so long?
It's came running down the fucking,

280
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.680
I'll everybody with their cell phone cameras out taken fucking video standing up

281
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:08.930
in front of me.
Here I am paying through the nose to my seats.

282
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.080
I have done in the six row.
I got to stand up to watch a shoot around.

283
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.750
What do you film in it for the fuck are you filming?

284
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.840
Can't you just fucking just sit there and watch it?

285
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.580
I saw Larry Bird do a shoot around 1986 I still remember I got the video right?

286
00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:30.210
My fucking head.
Just fucking dopes.

287
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.580
All these fucking Yolo do.
She's come down right with their fucking phones.

288
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.650
So I'm just going,
Oh God,
here we go.
You know bill pay,

289
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.070
you know you're the old guy now this is,
this is how the youngster do it.

290
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:43.630
This is how they fucking do it,
right?

291
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.930
So mercifully people finally ended up sitting down.

292
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.280
It's the end of the goddamn shoot around and we're ready to start the game,

293
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:55.250
right?
And I'm thinking like,
okay,
finally this fucking this,
this,

294
00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.260
this seizure of shit of tumblers and who cheese it fucking screaming and yelling

295
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.560
and making noise and,
and bracelets.

296
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.310
Fucking Blinken is going to end and I can watch the fucking game,
right?

297
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.630
There's no way this horse shit goes on during the game.

298
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.860
There's no fucking way.
And evidently it's okay that they,

299
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.520
they play music through the whole fucking thing.

300
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.840
I'm watching Steph curry bringing the ball up and m listening to Drake,

301
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.130
you'll use doe call all myself,
all yogurt or yogurt photo.

302
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.030
Everybody clap your hands back so fucking

303
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.560
can barely get a sneaker squeaking.
Dude,

304
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.720
the NBA used to be the greatest fucking game.

305
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.430
If you sat down low to see the game live,
there's,
there's no,

306
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.090
it's not like hockey where you behind the fucking glass,
you know,

307
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:48.180
it's almost like it's soundproof and even that's still amazing to be down that

308
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:50.130
close.
But still this like this barrier.

309
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.930
You fucking sit right down on the court and they're right there.

310
00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.580
The fucking ball could bounce into your lap was insane and you know,
look,

311
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.500
like I said,
I'll take 40% of this,
that this is just me being a grumpy old man.

312
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.100
Okay?
You got to keep,
the game has to keep evolving.

313
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.620
These kids are growing up with Dj's.

314
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.100
People are asking them to make noise and they like to make noise.

315
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.780
This is what they're fucking generation does.
Fine,
fine,
but can,

316
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:22.750
can you just dial it back a little bit?
Every time there was a time out,

317
00:19:22.751 --> 00:19:27.010
all of a sudden there was all these fucking people run out it.
By the way,

318
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.070
the kids out there to have a kid dance team.

319
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.760
Can you have him do a fucking kid dance?
You know what I mean?

320
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.520
Jesus fucking Christ

321
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.260
have those fucking moves I've seen in a titty bar and I'm a fucking looking at

322
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:44.094
an eight year old dude.

323
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.020
<v 0>Everybody clap your head goes to the whole fucking thing was insane.
And um,</v>

325
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.760
so anyways,
in what was one of the funny things was I'm sitting there with Nia,

326
00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:59.720
right?
And you know,
she's a great person.
She's not a grumpy person,

327
00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:02.810
so she's just enjoying all of it.
She's taken it and she's enjoying the game,

328
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.480
you know?
And when all of a sudden they started like,

329
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.760
I swear to God in like little parachutes,
these dropdown,
um,

330
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.570
gift certificates to something that evidently we couldn't afford.

331
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.640
I don't know what it was like,
I can't even,
what the fuck it was.

332
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.180
Everybody's jumping up,
like leaping up trying to catch these things.
Like it's,

333
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:22.620
you know,

334
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.180
the end of the Vietnam War and this is a ticket to get on the last chopper out

335
00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:29.720
of there.
Right.
Oh enough.
The fucking tee shirts.
All of this shit.

336
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.130
I hate when they sit there and they got one t shirt left and they start looking

337
00:20:34.131 --> 00:20:36.890
at the section,
whatever section can make the most noise.

338
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.100
And just watching people like a fucking dog begging for a treat for a free

339
00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:45.820
fucking clippers,
a clippers teach.
This isn't even a Lakers teacher.

340
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.900
This is the clippers tee.

341
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.500
Just watching all of those people taking all of this self esteem,
all every,

342
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.770
any shred of integrity and jumping up and down over a fucking eight year old to

343
00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:03.150
get a free tee shirt.
I don't know.
So anyways,
so nia points out,

344
00:21:03.151 --> 00:21:07.770
there's some guy sitting in the front row that she follows on a

345
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.650
snapchat,
I believe it's called.
I keep calling Instagram snapchat and he says,

346
00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:16.560
dude,
who just goes,
Yo,
they don't want you to fucking blah,
blah blah blah,

347
00:21:16.561 --> 00:21:19.020
blah blah.
And he's always doing whatever they say can't do.
And she goes,

348
00:21:19.021 --> 00:21:22.530
look at him.
He's down there,
he's right there.
Oh look,

349
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.750
he's making a snapchat video.

350
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.710
She's watching the guy make the snapchat video and then she takes out her cell

351
00:21:28.711 --> 00:21:29.850
phone in two seconds later.

352
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.560
She watches the thing and I'm watching the guy down there and and doing a

353
00:21:34.561 --> 00:21:37.160
snapchat.
I just watched the guy filming.
Now I'm watching her,

354
00:21:37.161 --> 00:21:39.480
her phone and by the way,
in the meantime,

355
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.530
Steph curry is going up and down the fire.
Everybody clap your hands,
right?

356
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.400
I got add.
I don't need all of that shit.
Oh,
so anyways,

357
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:53.300
as if that isn't bad enough,
as if I haven't been going on and on,

358
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.460
you know,
needing a,

359
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.270
an entire fucking box of tampons at this point.

360
00:21:59.271 --> 00:22:03.110
How much I'm bitching at least like,
even though I can't hear it,

361
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.600
even though there's going to be somebody standing up in front of me,

362
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.930
even though there's shooting tee shirts at me and telling me to make some noise

363
00:22:08.931 --> 00:22:12.680
and clap my fucking hands,
like I don't know where I'm at.

364
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.293
<v 2>Okay.</v>

365
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.430
<v 0>Helen Keller should get like this level of fucking direction.
If she goes out,</v>

366
00:22:20.431 --> 00:22:25.410
she's dead.
Whatever.
Anyways,
Steph curry,

367
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.850
Steph curry goes out there immediately,
gets a foul.
I'll give it to you.

368
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.380
It was a foul.
All right,

369
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.820
three minutes later they call some ticky tack Horse Shit on the Guy.

370
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.500
He's got two files in the first quarter that I sit him down

371
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.090
and oh,
fucking Freddy stub up is sitting there going,
dude,
what the fuck?

372
00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:49.870
This is the guy that paid everybody.
Yo Yo Yo yo,

373
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.460
after I'm fucking beside myself fucking beside myself going,

374
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:57.603
this is why.

375
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.200
<v 2>Okay,</v>

376
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.440
<v 0>I fucking hate it.
This is why.
This is why these games get fixed.</v>

377
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.540
This is why the NBA is fucking fixed because this is the only sport of the four

378
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:11.830
major sports that the Goddamn fucking referee can take.

379
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:14.920
The best guy out of the gate.
Just give them two quick ones in the first quarter.

380
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.150
Can you imagine if you went to go to a football game,
right?
Oh,

381
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.340
Freddy Stubhub.
Bob Going to see fucking,

382
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.940
I'm going to see Tom Brady versus Peyton manning the last time and go to that

383
00:23:26.941 --> 00:23:30.030
fucking Broncos.
Fucking patriots play off game and whatever.

384
00:23:30.031 --> 00:23:34.260
Tom Brady gets two quick ones for intentional grounding or some shit and next

385
00:23:34.261 --> 00:23:38.550
thing you know he's standing on the sideline and the fucking backup quarterbacks

386
00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:41.130
in there.
You're just standing there like,
dude,
are you fucking serious?

387
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.770
The guy spent like the whole first half of fucking bench.

388
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.370
It was brutal and the refs were calling fucking everything teen everybody up.

389
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:52.191
And I actually,

390
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:55.820
the only cool part about sitting down low that I saw was at one point,

391
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.460
is it Steve Carr said his first name,

392
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.570
he fuck it looks over at Doc rivers and they,
he gives doc rivers.
I like,
dude,

393
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:05.660
you fucking believe this shit.
And dark looks back.
And I'm like,
yeah,

394
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:09.440
what the fuck?
Like sharing this moment just as coaches,

395
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.050
like what the fuck are these refs doing?

396
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.450
So I don't know what happened at halftime.
If somebody called up and said,

397
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:19.250
hey man,
this is like one of the best games of the weekend,

398
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.990
you're fucking this up.
All right,

399
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.980
put your goddamn whistle away in the second half.
They let him play.
And it was,

400
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.070
it was,
it was beautiful.
So fucking amazing game.

401
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.300
Despite the fact all of that shit was going on.
Um,

402
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.940
I know,
I know I went on and on,
I probably went on too long.
I understand.

403
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:41.330
But like,
you know,
it's,
it's such a great game and,
uh,

404
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.420
you know,
I kept thinking about neo is watches all like those fucking,
uh,

405
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.420
you know,
reality shows and stylish shows and all that shit.

406
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.840
And uh,
you know,
when they trash people for what they're wearing,

407
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.860
if somebody comes out and they'd be like,
oh,
honey to any accessories,

408
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:05.300
you need to take a couple of things off and just go out like La,
you know,

409
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.550
they have like,
like too many fucking bracelets and then the fucking,
I dunno,

410
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.310
a hat and a scarf.
Just too many accessories that go.

411
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:17.510
You just take a couple of things off before you go out into the world,
you know,

412
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.340
be more Parisian,
dopey.
Tampa,
Florida.
Okay.
I Dunno why I said Tampa.

413
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.390
I just want to think of no class.
I just think of northern Florida.
Yeah,

414
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.670
I just said that you offended.
Well,

415
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.560
why don't you look out your fucking window past the crocodile,

416
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:36.350
over your truck with the steel balls hanging off the back of it.

417
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.663
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

418
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.830
<v 0>I'm fucking with you,
Florida.
C'Mon man.</v>

419
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:47.240
You can't be all bad if Walt Disney decided to put his world there.
Um,

420
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.940
that's what I feel like at those basketball games.

421
00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:54.040
They just dial it back a little bit.
Okay.
Could the booty dancers be maybe,

422
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.280
you know,
could they at least be a junior high kids?
Could that happen?
That,

423
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.120
that could be nice,
you know?
Um,

424
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.530
could you play everybody claps their hands maybe just 18 fucking times during

425
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:05.150
the game.
You know,

426
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:08.480
if somebody pays through the fucking nose to get six to fucking row,
could I,

427
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:12.410
could I at least hear the sneakers squeaking?
They don't give a shit.

428
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.680
You don't give a shit what they should've done at the end of the game.
You know,

429
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:15.861
like,

430
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:18.950
you know that when you go to the joke shop and you just opened the thing up and

431
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:20.300
all the snakes would come flying out.

432
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.610
This where they should have done as a whole crowd.

433
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:26.420
Just give him a fucking facial fucking tee shirts and,
you know,

434
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:30.020
I gotta be honest with you,
even from me,
that was extra conti.
Um,

435
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.530
but once again,
dude,
I always stay to the end of the game.

436
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.240
I don't know why people leave.
And um,
the warriors were up.

437
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:40.640
I like fucking 1215 points or something.

438
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.400
I think it was no way they would see 90.
They want by 11,
they be like 15 points.

439
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.790
Then I think they kinda two 11 and people are leaving because there's only like

440
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.120
a minute and a half left.
And he was like,
well fuck this gotta beat the traffic,

441
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:55.590
which is understandable in La.

442
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.370
And everybody starts leaving and I'm psyched because it's getting quiet and I

443
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:04.350
can finally hear these guys out on the court.
Right.
And um,

444
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.020
so the clip is bring the ball up and this isn't like they've taken,

445
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:11.520
all the stars are run of the game at this point.

446
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:14.030
They just got the bench and football teams.
So what the fuck?
Even this saying,

447
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.910
this game,
silver clippers bring it up.
They hit a three,
right?

448
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.830
So now it's like a fucking eight point game warriors,

449
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.770
whatever they inbound the ball,
clippers stealing,
run to the three point line.

450
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:30.600
I love fucking Reggie Miller.
Boom.
Hit another three.
Now it's a five point game.

451
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.900
Now the people left for like,
Oh shit,
the fuck the war.
He's like,
okay,

452
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.440
settle down.
Shut down,
get a pass half court.
They get it.
Pass half court,

453
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.140
fucking clippers,
steal it again.

454
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.180
<v 4>Go to the three point line,
boom,
hit another one.
It's a tool</v>

455
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.480
<v 0>point game.
The people who are left to go and fucking crazy,</v>

456
00:27:49.481 --> 00:27:53.860
this is what I wanted.
Now all of a sudden they're fucking putting,

457
00:27:53.861 --> 00:27:57.010
all the a listers are coming back in to save the fucking day.

458
00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.300
Chris Paul's back out there fucking Steph curry,
the whole fucking thing.

459
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.020
The warriors bring the ball back up again.

460
00:28:05.021 --> 00:28:09.970
They somehow lose the ball three to the clipper guys bringing it down.

461
00:28:09.971 --> 00:28:14.080
He jumps up in the air looking for somebody to pass it to and then sees like,

462
00:28:14.081 --> 00:28:15.670
oh fuck,
there's not enough time yet.

463
00:28:15.671 --> 00:28:20.671
And then launches and attempt that look like they brought me out on the fucking

464
00:28:20.711 --> 00:28:23.950
court and it felt like way short.

465
00:28:23.951 --> 00:28:27.130
It was just the wrong guy with the ball at the end of the fight.

466
00:28:27.131 --> 00:28:29.860
I don't know who the fuck it was,
but uh,
even the,
it looked at me,

467
00:28:29.861 --> 00:28:34.000
she just goes like,
what,
what,
what was that as I yeah,
I don't fucking know.

468
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.580
I don't know.
And then that was the end of the game and then they were like,

469
00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:37.540
thanks for coming out man.

470
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.423
<v 4>So,</v>

471
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.770
<v 0>um,
but anyways,</v>

472
00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:45.940
at the end of the day I feel like I saw Steph curry.

473
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.630
I got to give it up to the warriors though,
man.
Like just watching the,

474
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.600
watching them,
the way they move with the ball around and all of that.

475
00:28:55.601 --> 00:29:00.370
And even with,
you know,
the Star on the bench,
man,
there was a Thompson,

476
00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:03.040
I don't,
I don't know shit about hope as you can tell Thompson,

477
00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.830
that guy was fucking killing them and then they got this other dude,

478
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.120
they'd like backup center or something.
This guy is a fucking house.

479
00:29:10.121 --> 00:29:12.580
He looks like a defensive lineman if,
you know,

480
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.350
you put six inches on him and he had one dunk during the game.

481
00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:19.690
I can't believe he didn't fucking Yank the whole rundown.

482
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.490
It was fucking hilarious.

483
00:29:21.491 --> 00:29:25.960
He got ahead of steam and everybody just got the fuck out of the way.
Um,

484
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.330
and if only they weren't playing Drake during the time when it happened,
man,

485
00:29:31.331 --> 00:29:35.440
I could actually could have heard that fucking earth shattering dunk was

486
00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:40.030
literally 30 feet away.
I couldn't even hear it.
All right,

487
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:44.830
I'm done.
Okay.
I just had to vent.
I'm sorry guys.
I just,
you know,

488
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:49.780
just had a rough time.
All right.
Let me fucking,
I've been talking so much.

489
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:54.640
I've gone into screensaver.
I can never remember the fucking password.

490
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.690
Yeah.
You know what it is.
I can't talk and do this at the same time.

491
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.770
These stupid fucking capital letters come on one time.
One time.

492
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.110
Then the 52 fucking numbers that come at the end.
And of course it's wrong.

493
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.800
Why would it be right?
Do I literally have to hit pause?

494
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:19.090
Hang on,
hang in there with me.
Ah,
when it gets it.
All right,
let's get to,
uh,

495
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.970
let's get to some of the,
uh,
the advertising here for this week two,

496
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.650
that was literally like a 30 minute fucking bitch fest.

497
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.660
I literally should pay for brunch right now.
Thanks for listening guys.

498
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:34.320
I feel so much better.
All right,

499
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.600
You need to know how to cook.

500

501
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:44.440
but cooking at home means eating healthier and saving money instead of ordering

502
00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:48.270
expensive takeout again.
But where do you sat?
Ah,

Each meal can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.

507
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.260
Everybody clap your hands and say,

508
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.590
should do have some people come up shooting fucking asparagus that you,
uh,

509
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.790
Maxa approachable.
No overwhelming tips to the grocery store.

510
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:17.500
No more sad takeout and haul no matter your dietary preferences.

511
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:20.980
Blue Apron makes it a breeze to discover and prepare dishes.
Like,

512

They were trying to teach you the how tio and says Shawn.

518
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:56.210
Sorry.
Alright,

525
00:32:21.241 --> 00:32:23.490
radishes and purple potatoes.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:43.670
ber.
Ah,
thank God that's over.
Thank God it's over.

563
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:48.390
I don't like it.
I don't like reading out loud.
I'll admit it.
Um,

564
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.671
all right,

565
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:53.030
let's continue on here with the fucking bitch fest at the is that this podcast

566
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:56.660
has become this week.
Um,
by the way,

567
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.840
the fucking Boston Bruins,
you know,
Adam,

568
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.720
boring game against the predators lost two to nothing.
And then we,
uh,

569
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.030
we went down three to one against the Great Dallas Stars team.

570
00:35:09.031 --> 00:35:10.770
One of my favorite fucking teams to watch.

571
00:35:10.771 --> 00:35:12.390
That's the team I'm rooting for out in the West,

572
00:35:12.391 --> 00:35:14.250
even though I still love the Blackhawks in the kings.

573
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.020
And I know what you think in hockey fans.

574
00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:19.290
How the fuck can you like the Blackhawks in the kinks they're rivals as cause

575
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:22.020
I'm,
I'm an eastern conference.
I don't give a shit.

576
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.240
I don't give a shit that you guys hate each other or I respect both of your

577
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.910
franchises.
All right.
Excuse me for liking what you're doing in both teams.

578
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:36.150
Um,
but I like the Dallas Stars because,
uh,
I dunno,
I just,

579
00:35:36.151 --> 00:35:39.420
I just,
um,
you know,
they're the upstarts.

580
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.620
It's always been kings in black cock,
so you got to go for the underdog,
right.

581
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.440
And uh,

582
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.193
<v 1>okay.</v>

583
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.640
<v 0>I don't know.
I just like watching a play.
So anyways,</v>

584
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.230
why don't feel so defensive right now?
I just enjoy watching him play.

585
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:55.460
So they go up three to one and my car just sucks.
I'm going to swatch.

586
00:35:55.461 --> 00:35:59.260
My team got their ass kicked,
but at least I get to watch.
Uh,
I get you,

587
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.240
I get to watch this Daz,
but uh,
that was it.

588
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.600
And I bet all you fucking cowboy fans watching the hockey.

589
00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:07.570
I'm getting into this man out fighting the wall.

590
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.240
That's four goals in one fucking period.
It's called a period,
right?
Yeah.

591
00:36:11.241 --> 00:36:14.540
I'm enjoying this man.
I'm really enjoying this.
And then that was it.

592
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.720
They got the old right there.
Fred right there.

593
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.450
Fred from fucking the pro and little cold lotion.

594
00:36:20.451 --> 00:36:25.250
Few fucking cowboys Bruins went on and scored six unanswered goals.

595
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.420
Brad Mars,
Shannon Marchand,
however the fuck you supposed to pronounce it,

596
00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:32.030
they switched it halfway through.
Um,

597
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:36.890
scored goal number 29 and 30.
I thought he had 29 goals the other day,

598
00:36:36.891 --> 00:36:41.660
but he's got,
he's scored 29 and 30 sees never scored 30 goals.
Uh,

599
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.840
let's go,
man,
we haven't had like a big goal score in a long fucking time.

600
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.740
I'm opening scores 50.
Obviously it's not good.

601
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.030
I don't think it's gonna make it to that,
but he's king.
He could get 40.

602
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:55.400
I'm trying to think the last time.
Who was the last Bruin to score 40 goals

603
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.350
since I been getting the,
uh,
you know,
I'm gonna look that up right now.

604
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.980
My,
my only guests that I could make would be cam nearly because there was like a

605
00:37:06.981 --> 00:37:10.310
five year period.
I barely watched a Bruins game because I was just,

606
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.880
I barely watch any sports because I was sleeping on a futon and I was rapidly

607
00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:19.610
approaching my mid thirties and I had to get some shit going in my career here.

608
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.640
All right.
Uh,
last Bruin

609
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:29.330
to score 40 goals.
It's,

610
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:29.871
you know,
something,

611
00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:34.871
it just came up before even take that out is this fucking thing listening to me

612
00:37:35.001 --> 00:37:39.140
now
he thinks it's so creepy.
All right.

613
00:37:39.141 --> 00:37:43.340
Who's the last born just prone to score 40 goals in a season?
I'm gonna say Cam.

614
00:37:43.341 --> 00:37:44.660
Neely.
That's the last one.
I remember.

615
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.480
When was the last time that ruins one of the cup?
2011.

616
00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:51.440
We know that who scored the most don't goes.
Why are the Bruins name the Bruins?

617
00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.980
The named after a beer?
I'll fuck you.

618
00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:58.340
They don't even know.
Sorry.

619
00:37:58.341 --> 00:38:00.470
But the Audi audio that they don't even have the fucking

620
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:08.000
general McGill now the next 40 now list of players have 50 goals.
Boston Bruins.

621
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:09.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

622
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.880
<v 0>Yeah.
It's not even here.
All right.
Some fucking NHL Nerd.</v>

623
00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

624
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.540
<v 0>If you could fucking answer that one for me.
Um,
Joe Thornton,</v>

625
00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.180
I don't fucking know.
Anyways.
Uh,
all right,
let's get on with the,

626
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.400
what's going on with the questions here?
Oh,
by the way,
fucking Donald Trump.

627
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.540
It's this guy's crushing it.

628
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:33.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

629
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.890
<v 0>He just said that he,
he feels it's going to be him and Hillary Clinton.</v>

630
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.210
Bernie Sanders doesn't have a chance and Hillary will make it unless she gets

631
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:44.770
indicted.
Dude,
he,
that guy is so fucking brilliant.

632
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.280
He just told everybody that this is what's going to happen.

633
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.890
And the amount of dopes after watching people dive in over each other for free

634
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:51.490
tee shirts,

635
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.530
they just gonna listen to them and then that's what's going to happen.

636
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.750
And then he fucking throws a little fucking,
uh,
you know,

637
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.800
a little fucking whatever pipe to the knee of Hillary go unless she gets

638
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:06.170
indicted,
which gets that shit storm going again.
Well,

639
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.533
Hillary Clinton get invited.

640
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.300
I have to tell you if those are going to be our two choices,
this is,

641
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.620
it has to be a low point in this country.
You know what I mean?

642
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.071
Well,

643
00:39:18.071 --> 00:39:23.071
we have the star of a reality show on one side and then the filthy fucking

644
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:29.310
Clintons.
Oh my God.
And it's not even Bill Clinton.
You know what I mean?

645
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.250
It's just,
it's just fucking unbelievable.
It's like you're literally,
like I said,

646
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:32.610
[inaudible],

647
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.610
why would you hire the plumber's wife to come over and fix your sink?

648
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.410
I don't understand politics.

649
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.910
I don't get how you can just start at such a high fucking level with no god damn

650
00:39:41.911 --> 00:39:45.390
experience.
Like how did you start as a senator,
you know?

651
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:49.290
Or that fucking the mayor in New York,
they are Bloomberg.
I got $1 billion.
Yeah,

652
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.320
we're gonna run this city now.
Yeah.
Get those cards out of there.

653
00:39:52.321 --> 00:39:55.110
I'm going to put some chairs down.
It's like,
who the fuck is this guy?

654
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.200
How come you don't have to start in the mail room?
You know,

655
00:39:58.201 --> 00:40:01.440
you don't have to start off as like an open micro,
like a comedian.
Well,

656
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.170
I was married.
You,
I pray,
I get antsy.

657
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.170
Shut up.
Oh God.
Listen to that fucking voice.

658
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.480
Listen to that voice.
Who looks at that?

659
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

660
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:18.330
<v 0>Oh,
Donald Trump had fucking wigwam be a manager.
Shave your head,
you know.</v>

661
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:22.210
Alright,
two reads for this week.
Oh No,
I already got past this.

662
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:26.170
Let's get into the,
uh,
let's get into the questions here for this week.

663
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:28.840
Let's try to fucking calm me down.
Um,

664
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.090
you know what's funny is to listen to this podcast.

665
00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:35.800
You wouldn't realize what a fucking great mood I'm in.
Uh,
I'm actually in a,

666
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:39.070
I'm in a great mode.
This is what I sound like when I'm in a great mood,

667
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.810
believe it or not.
And I still had a great time at the fucking game.
All right?

668
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.770
Just so you know that.
Okay.

Unless you're listening to this in the future and then you missed it.
Um,

678
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.440
this is not happening.
All right.
All right.
Now this is happening.

679
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:27.010
I'm reading a question here.
All right,
this guy,
will you know this,

680
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.210
this guy don't bunch of shits.
So I edited the whole thing.
Here's his question.

681
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:35.510
He says,
I'm 35 years old and still living with my father.

682
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.040
Pathetic.
I know.
Believe me,
it's not by choice.
I've,

683
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.420
I'm finally recovering from lymes disease,

684
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.280
which sucked away 10 years of my life and I will have my student loans paid off

685
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.060
in a couple of months,
months,
which also sucked away 10 years of my life,

686
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:54.920
Jesus Christ,
to
come in with the misery here in a couple of months.

687
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:58.430
My father is selling the house that we currently live in and moving into a

688
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:01.970
cheaper fixer upper so that he can be mortgage free.
I love that.

689
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.840
It's a great idea.
It provided you know how to fix it up.
Um,

690
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.450
speaking of which I got all,

691
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:11.090
all the doors in the last two interior door locks are going to work.

692
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:12.680
I got a skeleton key for all of them.

693
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.090
I'm so ridiculously excited and for the life of me,

694
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:19.430
I can't find anyone else who gives a shit.

695
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.820
I've had people over the house and I go,
look at this.
Isn't this great?

696
00:42:22.821 --> 00:42:27.260
And they're like,
yeah,
why would you want to lock doors in your house?

697
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:36.160
You know,
loved it.
My mother in law,
she came over and she,

698
00:42:36.161 --> 00:42:39.770
she freaked.
She was just like,
oh my gosh.
She goes,
that is so cool.

699
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:44.210
She totally got it.
Did that,
that made it worth it right there.
So anyways,
let me,

700
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.240
uh,
let me continue on.
Um,
he goes,
so anyways,
you know,

701
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.300
he paid off his student loans.
He goes,

702
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.130
I can send my hair is a choice I have to make.

703
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:57.131
I can either live with my dad even longer than I already have and be rent free

704
00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:02.000
in this upper so that I can save up money and get my own place.

705
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.020
Or I can rent a shitty apartment and burn and grand a month,

706
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.900
which would clearly be better spent on a new house.

707
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.310
If I was in my twenties or early thirties I might be a little more open to the

708
00:43:13.311 --> 00:43:15.740
idea of renting one,
which I did in college.

709
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.460
The upside of renting an apartment is having a little more confidence and

710
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:21.080
integrity when I'm out on a date,

711
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.830
knowing that we can retreat back to my own place,
a set of my parents' house.

712
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:31.220
We'll do why he just hit him with the Lyme disease fucking story,
you know,

713
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.570
and just telling me I'm living at home cause I'm not dropping a grant.

714
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:38.330
I'm going to be buying a house as long as long as you have a game plan,

715
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.930
women will fucking,
they'll,
they'll,
they'll ride it,

716
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.390
they'll write it out with you for a little bit.
Feel the stainless.
Yeah.

717
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.790
I had Lyme disease for 10 fucking years and uh,

718
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.330
I finally got over it and I had to move back in with my dad and that's brutal

719
00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:55.340
right there.
And moving back in with my dad.

720
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.310
You almost want to have that part of a whole nother set of,
you know,

721
00:43:58.311 --> 00:44:02.630
run on sentence.
You just got to plow right through that and move back home.

722
00:44:02.631 --> 00:44:04.700
My Dad.
But um,
I'm on,
uh,

723
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:09.590
how the fuck do you gotta see you gotta see a move back home with my dad,
but I,

724
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:11.990
I almost have enough money for a down payment on a house,

725
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.590
so I'm not throwing a thousand off.
Jesus Christ.
That's it out.

726
00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.550
I'll tell you it's a riff on,
you know,
um,
and you know what?

727
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:23.730
Fuck these fucking fuck them.
Fuck them.
Just tell them what you're doing.
Yeah.

728
00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.780
Living at home because I'm saving up to buy a house.
Yeah.
I am 35.
Just own it.

729
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.190
Yeah.
Listen,
I have my own back entrance into the house.

730
00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:36.300
My Dad wants to
anyways,
just plow ahead.

731
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.190
If I was in my 20s or early thirties,

732
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:41.040
I might be a little more open to the idea of renting,
which I did college.
Sorry,

733
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:41.820
I already read that.

734
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.450
The upside of renting an apartment is having a little more Jesus Christ built.

735
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.083
<v 1>MMM.</v>

736
00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:48.930
<v 0>All right.</v>

737
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.320
It's also the freedom of coming home to a quiet house and knowing that my

738
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.380
goddamn food will still be in the refrigerator when I get home.

739
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:59.550
My brother is also still living at home.
He suffers from migraines.

740
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.820
Um,
dude,
what the fuck?
Where do you,

741
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.710
where do you live near what's sort of fucking,

742
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.730
this sounds like one of those fucking movies where they,

743
00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.540
you know that you guys eat the lead paint in your house.

744
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:13.380
Like what's going on here?

745
00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:19.680
So you get Lyme disease or do you go on a fucking hike not wearing any shoes and

746
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:23.160
get bit by a tick?
I can't remember.
There's too many fucking diseases.
Anyways,

747
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:23.401
he goes,

748
00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:27.690
so should I get on with my life and start pissing money away on rent or should I

749
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:29.940
stick it out a little longer and continue to live with,

750
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.780
with father so I can get my own fixer upper?
I love the podcast.
Thanks.

751
00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:38.560
And Go fuck yourself in the a with a d Jay.
Kay.
Um,

752
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.470
all right.
I would,
uh,
look,
if you just have to stick it out a little longer,

753
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:46.200
who gives a fuck at this point?
You already did 10 years,

754
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.400
<v 1>you know,
if,
if,</v>

755
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.770
<v 0>if you can get yourself in a situation where you can actually own the place</v>

756
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.633
where you're living.

757
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.653
<v 1>MMM.</v>

758
00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:59.450
<v 0>When,
I swear I should say that you're basically,
you,</v>

759
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.840
instead of having a landlord,
the banks,
you landlord,

760
00:46:01.841 --> 00:46:06.340
you have a mortgage and people say that you ran a d ohm.
I own,

761
00:46:06.341 --> 00:46:09.940
I own a house.
We bought a house.
Oh yeah.
Outright.
No,
no,

762
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.650
we're making mortgage payments.
All right?
Then you don't own it.

763
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.640
Somebody owns you,
right?
That's what happened.

764
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.890
You used to be,
you'll use to use,

765
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:23.140
to be in a situation where somebody owns you month to month,

766
00:46:23.141 --> 00:46:27.760
but any point you could just take off,
you could leave the plantation.
Okay.

767
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.710
Now you just signed up for 30 years with somebody fucking putting it in you

768
00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.090
every fucking month.

769
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:40.060
So what I would say is I would stick it out a little bit longer with my dad and,

770
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:44.560
uh,
I would buy a house where,
you know,

771
00:46:44.561 --> 00:46:46.900
it's not one of those deals where you can just make the mortgage payment.

772
00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.160
You got to get into a situation where not only do you,

773
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.300
you're making the mortgage payment,
but you can throw something at the principal.

774
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:53.943
You know,

775
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:57.010
you got beat the fuck out of that and you got to beat the fuck out of it quick

776
00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.950
because they front end load all the interests,
which to this day,

777
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.920
I don't know why it's legal.
Oh yeah,
that's right.
That's right.

778
00:47:02.921 --> 00:47:05.980
The president only makes 400 grand a year that,
oh,
I forgot.
That's right.

779
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.080
That's right.
Yeah,

780
00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.590
and bankers go out and have like $400,000 fucking,

781
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.000
you know,
like,
I wouldn't even say Christmas parties.
I mean,

782
00:47:16.001 --> 00:47:19.150
that's what they probably play the outfield to come and play their daughter's

783
00:47:19.151 --> 00:47:24.151
16th birthday and there's no way they pay for them for in a grant green day,

784
00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.080
you could get green day for 400 grand,
right.
Play a half hour in your backyard.

785
00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.210
That's a,
that's a tree.

786
00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.140
It's 120 $533,000 each.

787
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.420
134 for the lead singer because he sees playing all the guitar parts and
singing.

788
00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:40.873
All right.

789
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:43.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.530
<v 0>I'm going to do a startup.
I Want Green Day to pay my play.
My 48th birthday.</v>

791
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.950
All right.
UK,
United Kingdom.
Dear Bill,

792
00:47:51.951 --> 00:47:55.610
when are you coming back to the UK and are you watching any football,

793
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:58.910
parentheses,
soccer in between Bruins games now?
I've been just,

794
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:02.830
I've been really fucking busy,
so I haven't gotten to watch any of that.
Uh,

795
00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.380
I saw a little bit the other day.
I don't always in sub pub.
I always watch it,

796
00:48:06.381 --> 00:48:08.630
man,
when I see,
you know,
if I got,

797
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.470
if I stumble upon it I will watch it.
But,
um,

798
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.030
I'm hoping to do a European tour,
um,

799
00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:21.620
towards the end of the summer.
Maybe like in August.

800
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.760
It'd be really interesting to go through Scandinavia,
you know,

801
00:48:25.761 --> 00:48:28.430
when the sun's not going down to three and three in the afternoon,

802
00:48:28.431 --> 00:48:32.210
which to be honest with you,
I actually think is pretty fucking cool.
You know?

803
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.273
Um,

804
00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.700
I gotta admit when I went to Iceland and December,

805
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.010
that's the fucking time to go.

806
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.320
Don't go in the summertime when every jerk off is there.

807
00:48:43.321 --> 00:48:47.190
You go in the summertime when nobody wants to go and then you go to that blue

808
00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:50.100
lagoon fucking spa,
it's just,

809
00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:54.930
that's naturally heated by the fucking volcanoes or whatever the fuck it is.

810
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.680
It's an incredible fucking incredible,
one of the,
uh,

811
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:05.220
one of the coolest places I've ever been to.
Um,
but yeah,

812
00:49:05.221 --> 00:49:09.120
I'm definitely going to be coming back doing a big standup tour and I'm going to

813
00:49:09.121 --> 00:49:12.570
be adding some,
uh,
eastern European countries.

814
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:17.810
Um,
and I'm really excited about that.
A buddy of mine just went to Germany,

815
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.980
was saying what a great time they had and he was actually in a bar and,
uh,

816
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.120
met somebody that knew what my stuff was or something.

817
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.180
He would do some of my standup jokes or something.
So I'm mostly German,

818
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.200
so I would be excited to,
uh,
to go back to the,
uh,

819
00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:35.520
to the motherland there I'm speaking of,
which actually watched this documentary.

820
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.280
My wife tape was talked to that,

821
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:42.030
the charisma of Adolf Hitler on PBS.

822
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:47.310
And it was this fascinating thing how they talked about just what is charisma.

823
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

824
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.833
<v 0>You know,</v>

825
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.840
and they had this whole thing was saying how like Hitler could not had just no

826
00:49:56.201 --> 00:50:00.190
functioning relationships with anybody one on one,

827
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:05.320
but he just crushed it in front of a crowd and how he would make them wait and

828
00:50:05.321 --> 00:50:08.620
all of that shit is fucking hilarious.
Like he's waiting to start a speech.

829
00:50:08.621 --> 00:50:11.920
Everyone's cheering and he's just standing there until they're dead silent.

830
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:15.100
You know,
it reminded me one time,
Nia took,

831
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.660
I took near to go see Erica Badu and she comes out and everyone wants you to

832
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:19.961
sing,

833
00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:23.140
and she spends the first five minutes just walking around late in the incense.

834
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:27.800
So I'm watching Hitler,
Gosh,
she got this from Hitler to the fuck fucking thing.

835
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.960
Everybody's like,
oh,
we need to behave ourselves.

836
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:32.870
And then the performance will begin.

837
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.570
But they had all these creepy fucking speeches that he was getting.

838
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:43.400
He was doing this thing where he was going,
there's a group of people among us

839
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.013
<v 1>who</v>

840
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.240
<v 0>can basically live anywhere.
They do business anywhere.</v>

841
00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.040
It doesn't matter them to them.
They live in Paris next month,
they'll live,

842
00:50:56.070 --> 00:51:00.090
they'll live in fucking Vienna.
Then they'll live here and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

843
00:51:00.091 --> 00:51:04.590
blah with no ties to their whole,
and he just keeps spoon feeding them.

844
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.890
You know,
he won't come out and say it,
this group of people,

845
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:14.390
because they have no attachment to Germany,

846
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.350
you know,
but blah,
blah,
blah blah.
Then finally somebody that crowd goes,

847
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.960
Joe yelled out,

848
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.940
Jews and Hitler never addressed it and then just kept going.

849
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:30.410
It was are you have to see this to it is the creepiest,

850
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.340
absolutely,
absolutely creepiest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.

851
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.410
And then,
uh,
but I would,

852
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.440
I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you that I learned some things as far

853
00:51:43.531 --> 00:51:47.850
as performance in front of a crowd.
I mean,
you got to give it up.

854
00:51:47.851 --> 00:51:52.770
The guy was a beast.
I don't,
I don't even remotely agree with the guys message.

855
00:51:52.771 --> 00:51:53.970
But Jesus Christ,

856
00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.190
the guys going out in front of a crowd,
you know,

857
00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.860
a Kevin Hart size fucking crowd,

858
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.330
and it doesn't say a fucking word he doesn't get to do is the exact opposite of

859
00:52:06.331 --> 00:52:10.110
the clippers.
Gay makes all noise,
right?
Jesus Christ.

860
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:12.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

861
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.900
<v 0>Hitler's got to come back and start running the NBA there.
I said it,
I said,</v>

862
00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:21.880
if he can just get past the fact that 99% of the players are African American,

863
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.990
I think he could do some great things for the league.
I think he quieted down.

864
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.610
Alright,
sorry.
Anyways,
so I will be going to eastern Europe.

865
00:52:30.611 --> 00:52:33.430
That's what I was trying to say.
Or,
or Europe in general.
The UK.
There we go.

866
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.470
All right.
Apple fives.
The FBI,
Dia,
big brother Billy,

867
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:42.250
what are your thoughts on the battle between apple and the FBI regarding hacking

868
00:52:42.251 --> 00:52:46.600
into the,
the phones of the San Bernardino terrorist?
Also,

869
00:52:46.601 --> 00:52:51.370
just the fact that the FBI has the phones for two months and can't get into
them,

870
00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:55.780
put a dent into any government overreach conspiracy theories.

871
00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.380
Uh,
no.

872
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.400
And he says the situation with the apple is FBI wants to apple to create an

873
00:53:00.401 --> 00:53:05.401
operating system that would allow for them to hack encryption on the phone.

874
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:12.220
Uh,
they would upload the system to the terrorist's phone to allow them to unlock

875
00:53:12.221 --> 00:53:13.240
it.
However,

876
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:19.130
what they would upload this system to the terrorist's phone to allow them to

877
00:53:19.131 --> 00:53:24.060
unlock it.
However,
if apple does this,

878
00:53:24.061 --> 00:53:28.140
the operating system be used by the FBI and others to totally compromise any

879
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:32.550
security on any iPhone in the future,
uh,
the solution is simple.
It's just like,

880
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:34.860
just bring the phones to us and we'll hack into it.

881
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.550
And whatever information need on the phones will do that for you.
Yeah.

882
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:41.440
Once again,
because of these terrorists con,

883
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.300
what you're gonna do is you're gonna allow all the,
you know,

884
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:50.760
these fucking lunatics at the top to take even more power and privacy away from

885
00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:52.030
you.
And I can just

886
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:58.770
simplest way to tell you this is just like,
you know,
the,

887
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:03.390
the amount of people out there that can actually handle power,
uh,
is,

888
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:06.630
it's very rare.
I mean,
look in my business,
okay?
You see what happens?
You know,

889
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.550
everybody's down to earth,
everybody's cool,

890
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:10.890
and all of a sudden you get your own Sitcom and next thing you know,

891
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:13.470
you're banning people from the set your tip and shit over.

892
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.410
And nobody's saying shit because you make it all this fucking money.

893
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.740
You don't handle it well,
right?
Being like

894
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.950
being like in the top levels of government and security,

895
00:54:23.951 --> 00:54:26.890
it's the same fucking thing.
I don't think they handle it well.

896
00:54:26.891 --> 00:54:31.360
I think it's way too much freedom and I'm sick of people saying shit like,
well,

897
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:34.030
hey man,
if you're not doing anything then what are you worried about?

898
00:54:34.031 --> 00:54:37.030
I'm worried about the fact that,
you know,
just,
you know,

899
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.370
well,
human being stupid,
we're awful.
We're fucking terrible.

900
00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:44.160
People were terrible with the amount of access that we have now.

901
00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:48.960
You don't need to give people more access and I don't feel like,
you know,

902
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:53.430
they keep just hiding behind this whole fucking thing of like,
you know what?

903
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:56.130
We're just going to use it for the bad people.
It's like,
yeah,

904
00:54:56.131 --> 00:55:00.030
but you get to decide who the fuck's bed.
That Snowden guy,

905
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:02.640
he had to walk away what they were building.

906
00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.900
It was like the fucking Batman movie.
They spire on their own fucking people.

907
00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:09.240
They're lunatics.
I don't know what they do.

908
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:12.340
I always picture him just sitting there fucking,
I don't know.

909
00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.360
Do do you know,
like that Snowden Guy,

910
00:55:15.361 --> 00:55:17.580
he says when he stays in a fucking hotel room,

911
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.400
he unplugs the phone because they had that speaker phone.

912
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:24.930
Do you know that down at the front desk they can turn it on and just listen to

913
00:55:24.931 --> 00:55:28.650
whatever you're doing in there.
If you know,
fucking Yelei talking to yourself,

914
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.660
rubbing one out,
whatever the fuck you doing in the privacy,

915
00:55:34.661 --> 00:55:37.660
your own fucking hotel.
And they can just listen in on that shit.
It's fucking,

916
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:41.110
it's just the whole thing is creepy and um,

917
00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.850
yeah,
no,
it's,
I can't imagine,

918
00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.430
you know what,
by the time,
you know,
if I live,
you know,

919
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:55.170
to be like 9,100 years old,
like I would like to,
um,

920
00:55:55.710 --> 00:56:00.010
I want to see the fucking,
I want to live in every fucking decade.
You,

921
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.780
I want to get to the 60s again.
I was born in 1968.
I want to make it,
you know,

922
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.020
I just keep thinking shit like that.
I want to make it right.
So,

923
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:09.480
um,

924
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.080
I can't imagine like the lack of privacy that there'll be if you live that long

925
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.910
just with like people with like drones and shit like that,

926
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.110
like the cameras and just how like I think in the future,
right,

927
00:56:22.111 --> 00:56:24.340
they're going to do that and have like these,
uh,

928
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:29.220
like microchips link Mres,
you know,

929
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.870
and like somebody walks by and somebody just hit you with a little mist in all

930
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:37.270
these little microchips.
Go on.
Yeah.
And when you shower,

931
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:38.350
like most of them come off,

932
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:41.560
but like a few still stick on you and then your next door neighbor can just

933
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:45.610
watch your whole fucking life.
There'll be no more TV shows.

934
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:50.380
We'll just be spying on each other.
I don't know.

935
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:53.590
I think it's all fucking creepy and I think that's way too much.

936
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.810
I don't think the FBI needs to fucking do that.

937
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.460
I think apple should work with the FBI and uh,

938
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.770
if there's ever like somebody that they want to fucking check in on,
you know,

939
00:57:02.771 --> 00:57:07.720
let them do it.
Sam Columbine.
Um,
hang on one second.

940
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:09.120
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

941
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.090
<v 0>Hey,
I'm finishing up my podcast.
Let me call you back in five minutes.
All right?</v>

942
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.593
<v 1>Yup.
Cool.</v>

943
00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.410
<v 0>Um,
all right.
Let's get onto the next one.
All right.
Gay Friend.
Hey Bill.</v>

944
00:57:18.411 --> 00:57:20.540
First off,
thanks for the lungs.
Well,
you're welcome.

945
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:24.470
I'm 30 years old and decided to go back to school two years ago to study

946
00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:28.790
chemistry.
I'm an idiot like you,
but with enough effort,

947
00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:32.420
anything is possible.
Yeah.
I believe Kevin Garnett said that.

948
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.940
<v 6>Thank
[inaudible].</v>

949
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:41.410
<v 0>Um,
during my first semester back,
I befriended a gay guy.
I am not gay myself,</v>

950
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:44.620
nor am I homophobic.
I've also never had a gay friend.

951
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:49.240
We have a lot in common except for the fact that he likes to give and take it up

952
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:51.310
the ass.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

953
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.630
you can set except that he likes gay section.
All right.
I don't proofread these.

954
00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.970
I just stumbled on the sentences.
Here we go.
During that first semester,

955
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.580
I started to get the feeling that he liked me.
Uh,

956
00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:10.300
I started to get uncomfortable studying with him and stopped answering his phone

957
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:14.260
calls for a few days.
After those two days,
I decided to call them,

958
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:17.710
explain my concerns.
I told him that I've never had a gay friend before.

959
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:18.850
I think he's a cool guy,

960
00:58:18.851 --> 00:58:21.790
but I also explained that I'm getting the feeling that he thinks he might have a

961
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:26.500
chance to.
That's you handled it perfectly.
He goes,

962
00:58:26.501 --> 00:58:30.550
he laughed and he assured me that he wasn't hitting on me and knew I wasn't gay.

963
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:33.940
He also told me that if he feel he cry,
if he,

964
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:38.740
if I feel he crosses a line to tell him,
tell him.
Okay,

965
00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:41.830
great.
I said,
I don't know dude.

966
00:58:41.831 --> 00:58:43.810
He said he wasn't hitting on you and then he's kind of like,
yeah,

967
00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:48.770
but if I cross the line
I,
the way I look at the end of the day,

968
00:58:48.771 --> 00:58:53.630
it's a guy.
All right.
And guys think,
you know,
if you're talking to them,

969
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.930
you want to hook up,
right.
That's why women,

970
00:58:56.931 --> 00:58:59.750
you know when they walk down the street,
guys who like smiles say hello.

971
00:58:59.751 --> 00:59:02.600
It's like I can't,
or else you think I want to fuck you.

972
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.820
And then I gotta deal with that level of interaction.

973
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:08.150
That's why I got to walk down the street with this Donald Trump.
Look on my face.

974
00:59:08.151 --> 00:59:11.480
Right.
The same thing.
I always feel,
I feel that with like gay guy,
she can't be,

975
00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:14.990
can't.
We can only be so fucking nice or are they going to think they got a shot

976
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:20.180
because they were born with a deck.
That's what I taught.
I did a bit about that.

977
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.510
Your Dick's a dreamer.
You're dick believes,
man.

978
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:27.080
It's fucking wave and everybody around the third base.
All right.

979
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.630
Now I'm in my second year of school,

980
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:33.620
fourth semester and we have more of the same classes but not together over the

981
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:34.101
winter break.

982
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:37.400
He called me and asked if I wanted to go to the bar with him and some other

983
00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:40.100
friends from school.
I happily said yes and drove to the bar.

984
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:44.270
After about two hours,
he asked me if I have any weed and if I'd smoke,

985
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:49.330
smoke him down.
Are we still talking about weed here?

986
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:54.310
What are we doing here?
I said,
sure,
let's go to my truck and smoke a bowl.

987
00:59:54.311 --> 00:59:58.440
During this drunken stoners session,
he proceeds to get well.
Yeah,

988
00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:00.783
yeah,

989
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.780
<v 1>yeah,</v>

990
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.350
<v 0>yeah.
Can you gotta hear that?
So yeah.
Listen,
dude,</v>

991
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.980
you know what you got was right.

992
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.070
You called them on the shit and he said that he wasn't,

993
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.940
and I knew it with that fucking line,
but if I ever crossed the line,
let me know.

994
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.280
Dude.
He was trying to wear you down.

995
01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.150
He was trying to hang in there long enough that you finally just said,

996
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:22.660
you know what?
Fuck it up.

997
01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.200
<v 1>Okay,</v>

998
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.050
<v 0>so basically,
okay.
He proceeds to get worried.
He goes,</v>

999
01:00:30.051 --> 01:00:32.180
basically tell you that he knows I'm not gay,

1000
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:35.600
but I'm the kind of guy he likes and I'm one of his best friends and I was,

1001
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:39.760
life sucks because he's gay.
I just started laughing and saying,

1002
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:40.670
what the fuck?

1003
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:41.773
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1004
01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:47.020
<v 0>I'm too nice of a guy to say,
get the fuck away from me.</v>

1005
01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:50.680
So I let him finish his thoughts.
He was drunk and being emotional too,

1006
01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:53.350
which was annoying.
He reminded me of my ex girlfriend.

1007
01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:58.510
I'm just glad he didn't start crying.
Anyway,
after way after he was done,
I said,

1008
01:00:58.511 --> 01:01:01.960
that's great,
but I'm not wired that way.
Sorry.

1009
01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:06.940
He kept going on and on asking me if I'm sure there isn't any secret hidden,

1010
01:01:06.941 --> 01:01:10.840
desired buried deep within me.
Oh yeah,
dude,
it's late night.

1011
01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:15.190
It's late at night.
This guy,
he's going all in.
Uh,

1012
01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.750
I explained to him that if I was doing the same thing to a girl that I had a

1013
01:01:19.751 --> 01:01:20.470
crush on,

1014
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:23.890
I would be considered a creep and that the girl wouldn't want to hang out with

1015
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.980
big anymore.
Dude,
why are you writing me,
man?
You've got all the,

1016
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.310
you're handling all of this perfectly.
Um,

1017
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:33.780
I already failed because the second he got weird and my truck,
I would be like,

1018
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.270
<v 1>yeah,
yeah.</v>

1019
01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.730
<v 0>Um,
this was about two months ago and I've ignored him since.</v>

1020
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.710
He called me three times and I ignored them.

1021
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.420
Two of the calls were in the middle of the night.
Oh,
Jesus.
One 30 to 2:30 AM,

1022
01:01:47.421 --> 01:01:51.950
which leads me to believe he was being drunk and emotional.
Exactly.
He goes,

1023
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:54.680
just like a 23 year old girl.
He goes,

1024
01:01:54.681 --> 01:01:57.650
I don't see him at school anymore because I avoid him on purpose.

1025
01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:00.920
My question to you is,
am I doing the right thing?
Yes,

1026
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:02.150
you're totally doing the right thing.

1027
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:09.770
It's just cause you get both guys and that because he's gay and he's all like

1028
01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:12.930
basically in the media,
they're always considered victims.

1029
01:02:12.931 --> 01:02:15.480
If there's any sort of solid,
like you gotta be more accepting.
You know,

1030
01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:18.630
at some point if somebody is making you fucking uncomfortable and you fucking

1031
01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:20.790
address and they still cross the line,

1032
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.520
if that's something you're not comfortable with it.
Yeah,
fuck off.
It's over.

1033
01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:30.710
Beat it.
You fucking creeping me out,
you know?

1034
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:34.530
Anyways,
he goes,
my question to you is,
am I doing the right thing?

1035
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:37.650
I've never gone out of my way to avoid someone like this except for a girl.

1036
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:40.830
After I break up with them,
I have no desire to hang out with them anymore.

1037
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:44.550
It's not that big of a deal.
It's not like a work friend you hang out with,

1038
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:48.330
but then one of you gets a different job and the two of you stop hanging out.

1039
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.590
I do feel bad though because he has had a hard life.
He's the classic Gay Guy.

1040
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:56.550
I grew up in Texas and was harassed and is hated by his dad.
It sucks,

1041
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:57.660
but it's not my problem.

1042
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.960
I used to listen to his problems and try to give them advice on life and

1043
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:04.290
happiness and be a good friend.
But after that whole truck and his incident,

1044
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.830
I don't want to do that anymore.
Thanks for the help.
Hope you and the lovely Nia.

1045
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.690
Have a great day.
Yeah,
no dude,
you're fucking,
you handled it perfectly.

1046
01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:13.980
You never a jerk to the guy.

1047
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.560
You told them exactly how you were feeling at the end of the day.

1048
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:20.730
You had respect for yourself in your own boundaries,
which he didn't.
So fuck off,

1049
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.820
you know?
Yeah.
Teach.
You May,
uh,
you know,

1050
01:03:24.821 --> 01:03:28.010
teach them a lesson next time he has a straight friend,
you know,
just be,

1051
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:32.820
be a friend.
They'll get high.
Go into his truck and try to fuck them.
Yeah.

1052
01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:38.910
It's pretty straight forward.
Alright.
Germaphobe bill though.

1053
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:43.030
I can't,
I don't know.
Lucas site.
What the fuck does that word?

1054
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:46.710
I gotta look that word up.
He said some fucking spaceship.

1055
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:51.600
Is that a,
uh,
I don't know what that means.

1056
01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:54.830
I feel like half the podcast is laughing at me and the other half is pretending,

1057
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.850
pretending like they know what the fuck it means.
Leukocytes,

1058
01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.520
a colorless cells

1059
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:09.610
that circulates in the blood and bodily fluids and is involved in counteracting

1060
01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:14.410
foreign substances and diseases and so I'm a white self.
That stat,

1061
01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:18.320
you never realize how fucking original that is.
I hope I said the word right.

1062
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:20.030
Jesus Christ.
That was fucking brilliant.

1063
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:26.080
My Hat's off to you and also ties in with Germaphobe.
You know,

1064
01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.750
whenever you get sick,
your white cell count goes up.

1065
01:04:28.751 --> 01:04:33.530
Do you realize how many fucking levels that installed is working?
Okay.

1066
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:36.800
Jesus Christ.
Tip of the hat to you.
All right.

1067
01:04:36.801 --> 01:04:40.220
A few days ago I was stretching in the gym with the girl I was dating.

1068
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:44.810
She picked up her phone from a bench,
looked at the screen and said,
God,

1069
01:04:44.811 --> 01:04:46.160
my screen is so dirty.

1070
01:04:46.161 --> 01:04:51.161
And then proceeded to use her tongue to lick the phone screen and wipe it off

1071
01:04:51.561 --> 01:04:52.760
with their sleeve.

1072
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:59.010
What the fuck?

1073
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1074
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.940
<v 0>Jay,
just when you thought getting high with your gay friend and he goes for your</v>

1075
01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:08.280
Dick in your truck was the fucking weirdest,

1076
01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.800
almost uncomfortable thing you were going to Jesus.

1077
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:13.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1078
01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:13.481
<v 0>He goes,</v>

1079
01:05:13.481 --> 01:05:18.481
I dry heaved and she got mad at me claiming that she was a medical student and

1080
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:23.460
done things like that.
Doing things like that was good for,

1081
01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.390
for my immune system.

1082
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:26.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1083
01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.190
<v 0>Fucking Med students always got to tell you they are med students.</v>

1084
01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.060
He goes,
I couldn't get over it.
I had to get away from her.

1085
01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:38.550
Now it's in my psyche that maybe I am a German folk.

1086
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:41.390
When I use an ATM or Debit Card,
Pin pad,

1087
01:05:41.391 --> 01:05:45.470
I always have to wash my hand touching those things.
Grosses me out.

1088
01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:49.700
Am I a Germaphobe p.
S how many hands do you shake a day?

1089
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:56.000
Um,
no dude,
you're girlfriend is a med student,
but she's also gross.

1090
01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:57.710
That's fucking disgusting.

1091
01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.700
This fucking disgusting period.
Okay.

1092
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:07.570
There's so many other ways where you can just go into the fucking gym is enough

1093
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:11.920
to keep your immune system up.
You don't need to lick your phone.
You fucking pig.

1094
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:16.450
Disgusting.
That's fucking gross.
All right.
End of story.
No,

1095
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:19.750
you're not a Germaphobia and intelligent human being.
That's an,
you know,

1096
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:20.501
you just aware.
Yeah.

1097
01:06:20.501 --> 01:06:24.190
I don't like touching those fucking things when I go to the airport.

1098
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:24.710
I got to let you,

1099
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:27.790
I've got to get on that little shuttle busting and they're like,
hold on.

1100
01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:29.050
Before the fucking thing starts.

1101
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:33.100
I always pulled down the sleeve of my jacket and I hold onto it like dead.
Yeah.

1102
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.900
I don't need fecal matter in mucus and Tj's and God knows what else is fucking

1103
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:42.070
on that day.
All right,
gross.

1104
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:48.220
You're not a Germaphobe.
Alright.
How many hands do I shake a day?
Uh,

1105
01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:51.900
I don't know.
Sometimes zero.

1106
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:56.240
Sometimes a if I do wish.
I don't,
I don't fucking know.
I know,
but I,

1107
01:06:56.241 --> 01:07:00.450
I go and I wash my hands afterwards and I don't touch my face after I do it

1108
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.000
because I'm afraid I'm going to get pink guy.
But,
uh,

1109
01:07:03.001 --> 01:07:04.350
I don't shake a lot of hands.

1110
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.473
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1111
01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.640
<v 0>But I will say people love coming out of the bathroom and they'd be like,
hey,</v>

1112
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.670
Belle.
And then shaking your hands.
I,
I really got an in the moment,

1113
01:07:13.671 --> 01:07:16.760
get better and be like,
dude,
not you just came on your mind.
Give me the elbow,

1114
01:07:16.761 --> 01:07:19.250
dude.
You just came out of the bathroom.
I don't know you.

1115
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.760
I don't know if you're good at washing your hands.
I want to know you like that.

1116
01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.200
Alright.
Dilemma.
Hey Bill.
Oh,
that reminds me a long time ago.

1117
01:07:27.201 --> 01:07:31.930
I worked at the Improv in Dallas and I pissed off this fucking old,

1118
01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:33.920
I think I pissed off this older texts and guy,

1119
01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.560
or maybe this was this weird idea of humor.

1120
01:07:36.561 --> 01:07:39.830
He came up and shook my hand right at the end of the show.
I say,
hey man,

1121
01:07:39.831 --> 01:07:42.890
thanks for coming out.
And he just goes,
I just paid.

1122
01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.120
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1123
01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.920
<v 0>That was like,
all right,
well,
you know,
I'm not gonna do anything with my hand.</v>

1124
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:52.510
My hand is,
you could have your urine on it.
It's fine.
I'm not going to eat.

1125
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.440
I'm just going to shake a bunch of other hands now and they're going to have

1126
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.560
your pee on it and then I'm going to wash my hands and it's going to be over.

1127
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:02.740
You know what?
I mean,
you don't think you got,
you just went into the bathroom.

1128
01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:06.430
You don't have any idea what's on your fucking heads.
Um,

1129
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.030
that's now on my heads.
Yeah,
we're all filthy.
Alright.
Dilemma.

1130
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.680
Hey Bill.
Uh,
so I'm in a bit of a tight situation.

1131
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:18.560
Me and buddies were playing to take on taking a weekend trip down to Austin to

1132
01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:19.880
attend a music festival.

1133
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.990
My leg grandma is getting married the same week,

1134
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.290
the same weekend as the concert.
Obviously I have to pick

1135
01:08:29.190 --> 01:08:32.280
bye ladies.
Grandma's getting married the same weekend as the concert.

1136
01:08:32.281 --> 01:08:34.830
Obviously I have to pick which event I'm going to attend.

1137
01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.970
Your girlfriend's grandma's getting married.

1138
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:46.650
Well,
when the fuck did grandma have her mother when she was like 12?

1139
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.390
My girl,
there's no choice here.
This isn't a dilemma.

1140
01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.360
This is like an obvious,
he goes,

1141
01:08:55.361 --> 01:08:58.750
my girl left it completely up to me with no hard feelings attached,

1142
01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.130
at least from her.

1143
01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:04.510
I'm afraid of upsetting her family by not going to the wedding.
Fuck that.

1144
01:09:04.511 --> 01:09:08.250
Go to the fucking wedding.
Look,
if you're going to marry this girl,

1145
01:09:08.251 --> 01:09:11.910
you have to establish early that you're not going to every stupid fucking

1146
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.630
function you have to do that.
He goes,

1147
01:09:15.631 --> 01:09:18.240
but I should mention that my,
uh,
my girls,

1148
01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:22.290
grandma doesn't really care much for me or so it seems she tells my girlfriend

1149
01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:26.910
that she should explore her options a bit while she's still young also.

1150
01:09:27.150 --> 01:09:31.290
And I also have not been formally slashed,
officially invited.

1151
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:33.510
My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years,

1152
01:09:33.511 --> 01:09:36.540
so it's not like I'm a new boyfriend or anything.
What should I do?

1153
01:09:36.541 --> 01:09:39.480
I'd love to hear the lovely Nias take as well.
If she's around,

1154
01:09:39.481 --> 01:09:44.270
unfortunately she's not around.
Um,
dude,
fuck that.

1155
01:09:44.271 --> 01:09:46.480
You go down with your friends and you go to the concert.

1156
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:50.300
You have a great fucking time.
Okay.
And if this woman doesn't like you,

1157
01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:54.950
at the end of the day,
she's going to die soon.
So who gives a fuck?
Okay.

1158
01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.250
It gives a shit,
Sally.
Her mom doesn't like it,

1159
01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:02.580
then that's a problem because she's going to be around and you're going to have

1160
01:10:02.581 --> 01:10:05.640
kids and she's going to fucking show up and it's going to be a big fucking pain

1161
01:10:05.641 --> 01:10:08.670
in the ass.
Grandma gives a fuck.
Right.

1162
01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:11.460
Should explore her options.

1163
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:15.150
Is she still running around single and her fucking eighties you know,

1164
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.910
she's just projecting our own regret of that fucking

1165
01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:23.970
oxen driver.
She married back in the 1920s whatever the fuck she did.
Yeah,

1166
01:10:23.971 --> 01:10:27.120
go to the concert.
It's not a dilemma to go to the concert.

1167
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.290
Just tell your girlfriend so you know what I just said,

1168
01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:31.160
I'm going to go to the concert.

1169
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:33.830
I have a good time at the wedding and just fucking leave it at that and if she

1170
01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:35.120
gives you a rough time about it,

1171
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:39.200
don't bring up the fact that your grant or grandma doesn't like you and blah,

1172
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:41.540
blah blah,
because then she's going to try and fix it.
Now.

1173
01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:45.980
You guys need to spend more time together.
Just tell her.
I would just,

1174
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:47.180
I would rather go to the concert.

1175
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.203
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1176
01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:56.970
<v 0>Yes.
And just leave it at that.
If she gives you a ton of shit,
just be like,</v>

1177
01:10:56.971 --> 01:10:59.990
listen,
you know,
if I invited you to somebody,
you,

1178
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.730
you also had plans to go to a concert and he chose to do that.
I,

1179
01:11:02.731 --> 01:11:04.170
I wouldn't give you a rough time about it.

1180
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.810
I would want you to do what was going to make you happy.

1181
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.170
I would appreciate if you extend me the same courtesy.

1182
01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.870
Yeah,
I see it now.
I was going to say you fucking self so and so don't,
don't,

1183
01:11:16.871 --> 01:11:19.420
don't,
don't do the last part.
All right,
so that's what I would do.
All right.
Okay.

1184
01:11:19.421 --> 01:11:21.310
There you go.
All right.
That's a podcast for this week.

1185
01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:26.150
Everybody beat by de facto heads.
Um,
thank you for listening.
Um,

1186
01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.350
it's,
they get everybody that's uh,
you know,

1187
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:32.230
coming out to the shows this weekend at Foxwoods,

1188
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:35.363
<v 2>you know,</v>

1189
01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.930
<v 0>I have some people were talking about,
you know,
the ticket prices and everything.</v>

1190
01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:42.630
I can't control that people go on and buy some of these fucking yeah.

1191
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:47.580
Scalping ticket things.
You know,
the stub hub peoples are the fucking world,

1192
01:11:47.581 --> 01:11:49.620
so I got to figure something out with that.

1193
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:53.370
I Know Louis C K does something where he sells tickets,
you know,

1194
01:11:53.371 --> 01:11:56.250
on his own website.
But my thing is like,

1195
01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:59.190
well then how do you stop them from just going to your website and buying up a

1196
01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:03.180
bunch of tickets and incenting the fucking price through the roof?

1197
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:07.620
Like how do you do that?
Cause I don't want you guys getting fucked over,
um,
by,

1198
01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:10.560
I can't tell you this.
If you do go and you do pay through the nose,

1199
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.620
there won't be anybody screaming and yelling and shooting fucking tee shirts at

1200
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:17.490
you while I'm doing my Dick and shit jokes.
All right?
Okay,
that's a podcast.

1201
01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:20.670
Go fuck yourselves.
And I'll check in on Thursday.
