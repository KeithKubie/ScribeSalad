00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120
Hey there!

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.120
I’m Mike Rugnetta.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.100
This is Crash Course Theater, and today we’re
headed back to France.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.280
Hang onto your culturally appropriate headwear
because today there’s gonna be murder.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.690
There’s gonna be sexy times.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.349
There’s gonna be tuberculosis.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.910
Rebels are gonna pee in the aisles.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.910
Au revoir, neoclassicism.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.910
Don’t let the minimal scene changes hit
you on the way out.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.669
We’ll be taking a quick look at French Romanticism
before moving on to Realism and then Naturalism,

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:34.079
which is a lot like Realism, only more realer.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.100
Allons-y!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.579
INTRO
Let’s start with Victor Hugo, who you may

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.620
know as the author of “Les Miserables.”

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.360
The novel “Les Miserables.”

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.879
But Hugo also wrote plays.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.010
And in 1827, he wrote “Cromwell,” which
we now mostly know because of its awesome

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.020
preface, in which Hugo argues that if you
really wanna show how grotesque, sublime,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.620
and weird life is, you can’t play by the
neoclassical rules.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.370
“Let us tear down that old plasterwork that
hides the façade of art,” he writes.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.240
“There are no rules, no models; rather,
there are no rules other than the general

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.780
laws of Nature…

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.030
Nature then!

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.610
Nature and truth!”

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.040
But maybe not too much nature?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.210
“Everyone knows that color and light are
lost in a simple reflection,” Hugo writes.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.720
“The drama, therefore, must be a concentrating
mirror, which, instead of weakening, concentrates

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.340
and condenses the colored rays, which makes
of a mere gleam a light, and of a light a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.340
flame.”

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.960
It’s sort like the old documentarian nugget
about wanting to tell the truth, but don’t

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.640
get bogged down in all the facts.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.910
He tried out these natural-but-not-too-natural
ideas in his play “Hernani,” which premiered

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.490
in 1830.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.390
Kind of like “Le Cid” with a sad ending,
“Hernani” is the story of a noble outlaw

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.930
and his noble non-outlaw girlfriend.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.670
It ends in a double suicide.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.379
But remember how Corneille was toeing the
Neoclassical/Academie Francaise line?

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.310
Hugo was not into it.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.790
He mixed comedy and tragedy and flipped the
bird to the unities of place and time.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.940
He was cool with the unity of action though.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.760
And he was like, I’mma mess with your twelve-syllable
alexandrine and use words that have been considered

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.000
beneath the dignity of tragedy, so how do
ya like me now?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.659
Still going to write in verse, because…

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.499
c’mon I’M NOT A HEATHEN.

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:37.499
Hugo!

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:38.499
So rebellious!

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.560
But within reason.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.010
The play premiered in late February after
weeks of editorials and counter-editorials

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.489
about what a shock it would be.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.430
One paper announced there would be riots and
death and a small civil war if Hernani went

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.430
on.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.430
It went on.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.030
And there was a riot—a small and slightly
gross one.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.439
Four hours before the performance, a large
group of Hugo-supporting bohemians snuck into

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.370
the theater, occupying the pit and the gallery.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.200
They snacked and drank and peed in the aisles.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.469
And when the upper class patrons arrived for
the show, they were not thrilled.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.950
The two groups spent most of the performance
fighting each other.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.040
But then in the last act, when everything
became very sad, the two groups settled down

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.650
and wept together, and the play was a hit.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.900
Hugo hired a hundred people to come and applaud
it every night though, so that probably helped.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.840
Following Hugo, a few people half-heartedly
attempted to make the theater a little more

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.290
like life.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.300
Mostly they did this by moving popular theater
away from grandiose, avalanche-heavy melodrama

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.519
... towards intimate, sofa-heavy melodrama.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.189
This form was perfected by Eugene Scribe in
the piece bien fait, or the well-made play—a

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.900
five-act prose drama that hooks the audience
with a series of discoveries, reversals, and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.180
recognitions before ultimately reaffirming
nice, conservative bourgeois values.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.620
Scribe, who wrote nearly four hundred plays,
definitely wasn’t interested in making the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.620
theater all that life like.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:21.169
He wrote: “You go to theater, not for instruction
or correction, but for relaxation and amusement.

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.080
Now what amuses you most is not truth, but
fiction… the extraordinary, the romantic,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.070
that is what charms you, that is what one
is eager to offer you.”

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.870
Scribe was incredibly popular, and so were
his dramaturgical roll crew, Georges Feydeau

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.810
and Victorien Sardou.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.610
Playwright George Bernard Shaw despised Sardou
so much that he coined...

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.479
...the term “Sardoodledom” to describe
his plays.

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.400
But other writers were starting to wonder
if the well-made play could be made even better

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.470
by being brought more in line with observable
reality.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.740
And this is basically where we got theatrical
realism!

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.940
The term “realism” started popping up
in France in the 1850s.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.550
And there was even a journal called Realisme.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.039
Theorists called for realistic situations,
realistic characters, and realistic dialogue.

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.569
Even grammatically incorrect dialogue!

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:19.379
A development which I am aghast … about
Alexandre Dumas fils, the son of Alexandre

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.300
Dumas of “Three Musketeers” fame, was
one of the first writers to shift the well-made

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.530
play into an even more realistic social problem
play.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.220
As Dumas wrote, “invention does not exist
for us.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.090
We have nothing to invent.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.250
We have only to look and remember, to feel,
to co-ordinate and give back, under a special

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.960
form, that which all the spectators should
immediately remember to have felt or witnessed.”

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.590
But that special form thing is important.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.000
A true artist can’t just reproduce life;
“he has to discover and to reveal to us

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.800
that which we do not see in things we look
at every day,” Dumas wrote.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
Which all sounds great.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.639
But if you read Dumas’s most famous play,
“La Dame Aux Camilles,” with its courtesan

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.699
-with-a-heart-of-gold-reforms-her-life-and-then-dies-of-
culosis-because-it’s-easier-to-forgive-a-fallen-women-when-they’re-dead

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.430
plot, you’ll see that there is definitely
some invention and some tear-jerking going

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.430
on.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.290
I mean, I guess you can rip only so much from
the headlines, y’know?

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.430
And even though realism was supposed to be
a move away from the sensationalism and moralism

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.729
of melodrama—well, there’s still a lot
of sensation.

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.030
As we’ll see in upcoming episodes, the problem
with a lot of new artistic movements is that

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.050
it’s hard to be faithful to your theories
and write plays people wanna see.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.919
The realistic movement coincides with a whole
bunch of scientific discoveries and publications,

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.590
notably Charles Darwin’s “Origin of Species.”

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.789
Artists were fascinated by this text and by
what Darwin suggests about how heredity and

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.870
environment come together to create character.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.419
In theater, the big-time early adopter of
evolution was Emile Zola, who was described

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:03.419
as a fat, pot-bellied whiner by one of his
colleagues.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:09.419
Instead of the well-made play formula, Zola
said that theater should use other formulas:

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.020
scientific formulas!

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.250
This was naturalism.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.770
Theater, Zola thought, should be a laboratory
of human life, with its experiments based

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:25.169
not on the demands of plot, but on the inner
conflicts of a group of characters.

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:31.419
Each play should test a hypothesis, investigating
what happens if you put these characters,

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:35.050
with these hereditary traits, into this environment.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.810
Spoiler alert: Nothing good!

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.610
Naturalism doesn’t include a lot of happy
endings.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.590
Zola’s plays were so intense that they were
considered too radical for some former radicals.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.009
Victor Hugo’s supporters came to boo them.

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:53.680
You know how those earlier realists were like,
We want the theater to be like life but maybe

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.389
not too much?

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:58.909
Zola was all, Make it all the way like life.

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.570
More life!

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.930
LIFE TO THE MAX
In his preface to “Therese Raquin,” the

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.069
1873 study of an adulterous couple that he
adapted from his own novel, Zola wrote...

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:14.610
“I am waiting for the time to come when
they will tell us no more incredible stories,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:20.690
when they will no longer spoil the effects
of just observations by romantic incidents…

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:26.199
I am waiting for them to abandon the cut and
dried rules, the worked-out formulas, the

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:28.190
tears and cheap laughs…

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:34.450
I am waiting, finally… until they return
to the source of science and modern arts,

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:40.640
to the study of nature, to the anatomy of
man, to the painting of life, in an exact

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:47.120
reproduction, more original and powerful than
anyone has so far.”

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.959
Let’s test some of these ideas out with
“Therese Raquin.”

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:54.240
Hope you brought your life jacket, ThoughtBubble:
Therese is a poor girl who lives with her

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.170
aunt and her aunt’s hypochondriac son, Camille.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.250
Therese is semi-forced to marry Camille, and
the family moves to Paris.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.590
Then one day, Camille brings home a work friend,
and artist Laurent.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.630
And before you can say heredity and environment,
Laurent and Therese start a torrid affair

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.690
But… sneaking around is tough.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.650
So eventually they’re like, Hey, Camille,
let’s all go for a boat ride.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.110
Their plan is to drown Camille and then live
happily ever after.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:31.050
But the drowning doesn’t go so well: Camille
bites Laurent, and no one can find the body.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.730
And then the happily-ever-after doesn’t
go so well, because after they get married,

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.950
Laurent and Therese are tortured by guilt.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:45.000
They keep hallucinating that zombie-Camille
is actually in their bedroom, which really

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.600
interferes with sexy time.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.829
Therese can’t sleep.

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:49.089
Laurent can’t paint.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.850
They both go a little crazy.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.470
Therese’s aunt finds out about the murder,
but she’s had a couple of strokes and can

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.740
only communicate with her eyes and one finger.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.839
So she does a lot of ominous staring.

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:04.470
She tries to expose them, but fails.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.639
The pressure is so great that Therese decides
to kill Laurent, and Laurent decides to kill

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.639
Therese.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:15.840
Then they figure out that each is trying to
kill the other, so they hug and cry and drink

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.810
poison while the aunt watches, and probably
some pointing?

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.350
TOO REAL, ThoughtBubble.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.690
Or I guess, not REAL but … NATURAL?

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.570
In some ways “Therese Raquin” proves Zola’s
ideas pretty well.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:33.529
The murder occurs because of the kind of temperaments
each character has and the opportunities that

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:35.300
their environment provides.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.610
And there aren’t a lot of cut and dried
rules or cheap laughs.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.220
But ok - how real or natural is this play?

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.300
Eh.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.529
Even Zola acknowledged that it had problems.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:49.310
It’s an incredible story.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.690
It’s full of romantic incidents.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:57.970
It doesn’t feel like an exact reproduction
of my life or probably your life … hopefully.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.220
Unless you have thrown yourself into a passionate
affair and then drowned your husband.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.820
If this is a slice of life, it’s a very
lurid slice, and it actually looks a lot like

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.320
a sad version of bourgeois melodrama.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.670
Realism, like melodrama, is one of those genres
that’s still very much with us today.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.029
In plays, in movies, on TV shows.

00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:23.510
Realism and naturalism promise us art that
looks a lot like life, but it turns out that

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.670
life isn’t always so easy to stage.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:31.120
It’s long; a lot of it is boring; and people
normally get really miffed when you call INTERMISSION

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.720
in the middle of it.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.910
Also don’t get me started on the costumes.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.300
K actually, that's pretty good.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:43.890
This means that realistic art adopts its own
less-than-exactingly-realistic conventions.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.800
Maybe they’re not as strict as neoclassicism,
but they’re definitely there.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.860
Like the way that opening scenes have to establish
who all the characters are, or the way that

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.890
a crisis has to be instigated and then resolved.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.220
And speaking of resolution: we’ll be staying
in France for one more episode, to take a

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:22.220
look at a sea change in acting and the rise

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.290
of the director.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.759
Until then… curtain!
