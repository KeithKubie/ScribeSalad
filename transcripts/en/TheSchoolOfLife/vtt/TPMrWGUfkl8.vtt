00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.640
Hello

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.660
Hi

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.900
I miss you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.180
How are you?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.420
actually, my mom was saying you should come over next time and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.860
For a visit that I think it'd be really fun.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.940
Yes
they just want to meet you this time. Mm-hmm

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.980
You okay?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.420
Yeah, I'm just tired

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.340
okay

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.340
um

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.530
Remember I said we were going to get the ferry over

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.680
But we went over all the days. yeah.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.160
I think I'm gonna have a nap actually

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.560
why don't we do this afterwards?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Are you not feeling well? No, I'm just tired.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.640
Okay, yeah, all right. Yeah.
Yeah, sure if you have a sleep and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.340
Mommy, where did I put my card for daddy?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.920
Don't be silly. I told you before you've already put it on top of the TV.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.860
They're going round

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.920
another "A"

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.880
What do you think ?
already good but we could put dots all around.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.700
He  must have got the wrong train into Charing Cross

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.640
And this one at 45 past

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.580
I guess

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
if you left your aunt's house at

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.060
three you would have been here by may be half...

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.520
Why does Johanna have such weird earrings?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.200
Does she?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.030
What's weird about them?

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.000
Why does Daddy want to live so far from us?
Oh.. We've talked about this one, please don't start again

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700
Here give me your plate,
You must be starving.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.640
No! Don't!

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.420
I don't want to start anything before he comes.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.560
Ryan! No! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! 
come back here please don't speak to me like that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.080
Ryan!

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200
Ryan?

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.100
And shortly after that
dad and Joanna,  moved to America, so

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720
I'm sorry you went through that

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.120
But I can totally see why you're not so keen about people leaving.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.700
I'm sorry I didn't make you like a welcome home sign.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.980
I think I could probably do without one maybe

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.780
So..

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.520
do you want to see my photographs from my holiday?
Oh..?

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.700
How about this idea,  right?

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.420
How about you go and run yourself a nice warm bath

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.310
and in the meantime I'll

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.609
cook us some red delicious foods and welcome home dinner

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.340
and then after it, we can uh

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.940
look at the photos together on the sofa.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.880
That sounds perfect.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400
Can we have cheesecake?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.400
