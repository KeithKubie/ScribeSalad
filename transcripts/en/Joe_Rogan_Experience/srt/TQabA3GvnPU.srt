1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,630
Boom, and we're live.
John Jock, Joe Hogan.

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,300
I'll pull this up. Pull this up
quite some time, but we made it.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,870
Yeah, we've made it. We made it
happen. People still to this day,

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,220
all my friends call me Joe Hogan because
you a, I don't know man. Joe Hogan.

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,020
That's a funny Brazilian thing.

6
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:26,830
You know the Portuguese
translation of ours to H's I think.

7
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:28,240
I think when we speak English,

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,800
you have to use your tongue in a way
that in Portuguese we had just flat out.

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,290
But you use Rio, you don't say
heal, right. Do you say heal real?

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,210
How that work? Somehow? The,

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,530
it's in Portuguese there first to let
us add the strongest one in the word,

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,900
but, but Hixon and hoists
and say on, right, it's,

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,410
but it's not Rickson but it's
Rio. Yes. How's that work?

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,670
I don't know when it becomes,

15
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:58,920
the name is different than when you
say a city name. Oh really? Yes. Oh,

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,600
it's funny. Real. It's
more something for them.

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,760
And when you say personal, it becomes
a little, I don't know, Hickson.

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,710
So Holly people,

19
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:13,711
it's an h but it can be an r like a
earth sound with objects and things.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
Yes. Or just places I'm
thinking more places in in.

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,930
It's funny because in each region in
Brazil is a different accent really.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Well that makes sense.
Kind of like America. Yes.

23
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:29,530
Each place like by countries that,
because it's the sounds very different,

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,140
but it's a beautiful language.

25
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:36,280
Portuguese has like especially Brazilian
Portuguese. I was like a sing song,

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,770
you know, like a flow to
the bus or of a carnivores,

27
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,770
but it's that the way you guys
talk, it's cool. It sounds good.

28
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,130
You know it's one almost
like singing. Yeah.

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,410
How many Americans have like put on a
fake Brazilian accent once they started

30
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:57,250
really getting into Jujitsu.
Must be when I think,

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,280
I think in a way when Gigi to
stablish their flag outside Brazil,

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,840
it make funny. It's fun
in a way that people,

33
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,400
our goal is to make that area become
more resilient than any other place.

34
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,610
It's not that we're trying
to speak more English,

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,080
but we'll make the English become more
Portuguese and almost every student that

36
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,720
I have, maybe probably
because of my accent,

37
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,850
they still listen and speak in very
similar the way we do in every Jujitsu

38
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:31,660
school. Yeah, well that's a u.
We used to see that in taekwondo.

39
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,490
Two guys would have like fake Korean
accents and in each school the instructor

40
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,220
has a different accent
and different vocabulary,

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,590
which even extended more,

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,100
it becomes like another
language in digital community.

43
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,110
So Jujitsu is huge in Rio,

44
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:51,940
but what other parts of Brazil that is
very strange if you stop button and think

45
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:53,350
about the history of martial arts,

46
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,690
which is something that's always
been very fascinating to me.

47
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,810
Jujitsu's the most fascinating because
until 1993 it very few people understood

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,650
how potent Brazilian Jujitsu was.

49
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,550
When when I start understand Jujitsu
and became on the teenager time,

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,910
Jujitsu is basically in Brazil has that
amazing Arrow off my uncle Helio and

51
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,570
Carson, the whole first generation of
their family, which Brazil was all over,

52
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,500
[inaudible] was all over
Brazil as a teenager.

53
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,520
Remember the sheets was
basically establish in a very,

54
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,380
um, wealth area in Rio de Janeiro only.

55
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,090
It's basically have all these schools
is to call Gracie schools by the

56
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,780
neighborhood. You have a Gracie, my
tie. You have a Gracie coppa cabin.

57
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,150
I have a than future Gracie Baha.

58
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,570
But everything was almost Gracie school
everywhere and it was wealthy people

59
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,610
only in their welfare of
real wow. Then slowly,

60
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,400
because keep in mind these two have one,

61
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,260
maybe two tournaments. Sports
have you shoots a year. That's it.

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,050
We always practice sheets who mainly
at that time for self defense,

63
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,650
we want to get ready for protect ourself
would never had much chances to try in

64
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,400
a tournament cause there's no tournament.

65
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,020
Every training we do was
based in defend yourself.

66
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,970
What year did tournament
start coming about?

67
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,240
By the beginning of the nineties.

68
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,800
I think there's usually two tournaments.

69
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,610
Start catching up more as a
crazy video of your brother.

70
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,020
He gun and uh, Hickson
competing at a tournament once.

71
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,000
I was the biggest tournament of the
year. Three, 300, 300 competitors.

72
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,340
Oh, that's crazy. That was, that was
the biggest, that's the biggest one.

73
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,440
300 thousands and thousand hours.

74
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,900
The big ones is like 5,000 people.
Yeah. Now when this happened,

75
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,910
what year was this with your brother?

76
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,560
I think was in the 80s not
sure which year with something.

77
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,370
I don't think today looking
back is something that um,

78
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,330
I didn't like personally cause
it was no need for that. We,

79
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,840
everybody's to train together and let,

80
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,260
I don't want to find out there was behind
the scenes people involved with the

81
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,071
organization.

82
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:21,670
They want to something more
of the tournament and they
end up making something

83
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,200
like that happen. Oh,

84
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:27,220
so you mean because he gun and Hicks in
a trained together having them compete

85
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,960
against each other was
not a good at all? No.

86
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,300
Hickson was teaching us
cause our instructor,

87
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,990
why do you think they wanted to
have him compete against Seguin?

88
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,000
It wasn't even,

89
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,470
this happened on the day of the event
was no planning of having that fight or

90
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,220
anything.

91
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,220
They just made that happen there and
they realize that the promoter of the

92
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:52,930
tournament, they sponsor a, was talking
to someone involved the promotion.

93
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:53,351
Hey Man,

94
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:58,040
I'll give you more money
if it makes something like
that happen in an hour time.

95
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,140
If my instructor tells me I want you to
go and do that, I don't even question,

96
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,910
I just go and do it. Right.
That's the way we were in, in,

97
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,130
in the whole family and uh, all instructs.

98
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,490
And I've got to go and do this even
though I don't like it. It's wrong.

99
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,590
I should not do it. We'll do it.

100
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,140
So what would be wrong about it would be
that you were all training partners and

101
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:24,210
in fact Hickson was your instructor. So
for one of you to go up against Hixon,

102
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,960
it's just

103
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,410
w I will give you a, the Indian
nineties, early nineties,

104
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:32,920
we have a cymbal wrestling
tournament in uh, San Diego.

105
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,880
And when we moved to America
was nosy sheets, events at all.

106
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,510
And we are in search of something
similar that we can do to keep the edge.

107
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,460
And we went to some judo tournaments.

108
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:48,190
We went to wrestling tournaments and
not knowing the rules of anything.

109
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,440
And we ended up in assemble
wrestling tournament.

110
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,950
Sambo for people don't know is a
Russian martial art that wear their judo

111
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,320
jacket, but they were
wrestling shoes and shorts.

112
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,680
It's kind of a mix of
both different rules.

113
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,660
I still don't know exactly the rules,

114
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,610
but here we are and myself and now we
go there and I saw Hickson in that event

115
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,610
and when it comes started,

116
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:14,611
the final match was me and him on the
final and I back that time where we have

117
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:20,720
some conflicting side, the
family things that are,

118
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,190
I'll keep that in four, four
walls, but a, we were not,

119
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:29,810
the relationship wasn't as well as
should be. Then when the referee call me,

120
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,610
it's like, well, I'm not going to
fight my instruct on my, my coach, my,

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,410
my hero, my idol. No. Um, and I
told the ref, no, not fighting Nev.

122
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,141
Hexion was like, look at me.

123
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:43,850
And I think in a good way he knew
of not ever compete against him,

124
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,380
but at the same time he,
he realized that, um,

125
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,660
I would never have done
myself. You can see him, right?

126
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,170
I will fight for him for the
rest of my life. And, and period.

127
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,330
And I think it was the point that, um,

128
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I was able to engage back our family
things together after these days and

129
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,740
showing him that it's all my respect
and our fight for him never against him.

130
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,130
Well there was a time where people were
trying to use the Gracie name and um,

131
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,970
many people were opening up schools
that weren't necessarily really that,

132
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:18,920
that wasn't their birth name, Gracie,

133
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,220
whereas you guys went a different
direction and use the Machado name and the

134
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,190
Machado name became enormous
too. So there was like,

135
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
from what I remember in the 90s when
I first started training with you,

136
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,330
there was a, I started out at
Hickson's place and I only, uh,

137
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,520
trained there one time and then I went
from Hickson's place to Carlston's place

138
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,720
just cause it was closer. I didn't know
any better. I thought Gracie is Gracie.

139
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,010
Oh Carlson, Gracie Hicks. Grades.

140
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:46,430
I didn't know anything and I was white
belts and I was like, oh another Gracie.

141
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,900
Oh this is like 10 minutes closer
to my house. I'll just go ahead.

142
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,640
That's how it used to be in Brazil and
there on the 80s all gracious schools,

143
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:57,180
but then when that place went under,
lost that plate, it was on Hawthorne.

144
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,690
That was when v Toward Belfort man,

145
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:03,420
his UFC debut in 1997 and
that place went under,

146
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,080
I started training with you and when I
started training with you it was like 97

147
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,370
ish. Right? Somewhere around there.
98 somewhere around there. One was,

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,610
I think it was right before fear factor.
No though. Seems few years before.

149
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,960
Yeah, a few years before cause fear
factor was 2001 newsradio style. Yes.

150
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,640
I was still on news radio
when I was training with you,

151
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,300
but our member there was like a
co year Machado. Now I'm like,

152
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,380
what are you talking about? I was like,

153
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,370
I didn't understand like oh there's
like Machado's and then there's like two

154
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,210
different, like

155
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,060
the the, the functions. The thing
that happened in that time was this,

156
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,600
my mother older sister,

157
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,530
she's married to Carlos
Gracie senior than me.

158
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,860
He had seven lives color.

159
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,820
His last wife was my mom's sister and
that's, we grew up with the family.

160
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,350
We don't have the same last name, but
I feel like I am and all my brothers,

161
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:56,891
the same thing.

162
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:01,770
We represent the grist family the best
way we can forever and now and every then

163
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:05,590
have a big family. I have cousins
that you relate better than others,

164
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,630
but it's still a family than
no. And back at that time,

165
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,680
two of my brothers were teaching
at the Gracie school in Carson.

166
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,130
Was He going in Carlos? And um,

167
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,770
I think by that time Chuck Norris was
no longer training with Horian at the

168
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,470
Gracie school. They're not sure what
happened and he stopped training.

169
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,330
Then one day, um, some of the,

170
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,530
some technologies noise show
up at our house, at our garage.

171
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:42,770
We used to teach in our garage in Redondo
beach and we opened the doors and the

172
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,160
look is like, man, that guy
looks like Chuck Norris.

173
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,490
Then this was a him up or this is
Chuck Norris. And we look like what?

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,410
And he brought him to train.

175
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:56,680
He did training a few years back at the
Gracie school. And Blah, blah, blah,

176
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:57,960
and it's a long store shot.

177
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:01,360
Then he start training for us
and when he start 24 hours,

178
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,080
we become very good friends. It was
amazing. Like something Brian Away.

179
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,730
He invited us to his house and he's
a great guy, man, amazing person.

180
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,760
It's the hanging out and by the time
I remember he used to make a movie,

181
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,350
one movie a year. He worked
for six months, make a movie
and has six months off.

182
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,810
When we met him, he was six months
off. Literally he trains every day,

183
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,370
but when he trained, he doesn't go
home. We'll have lunch. He hangs out,

184
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,500
go to a movie, then sell it, become
good friends. Then one day he,

185
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,910
after a few months after the train of was,

186
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,200
he invited us to the valley where he
used to live in, in soon and say, look,

187
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:39,610
I have surprise for you guys.

188
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,870
Then he took us to a shopping center
right off into the believer in,

189
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,350
um, he shows a, have a gift for
you guys and he shows a, uh,

190
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,140
one of the unity's mats,
right? He's like a school.

191
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,370
Then he said, look, this is for
you guys at your school. Wow.

192
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,020
Then we'll look into him like [inaudible]
run on the street and said, check,

193
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,760
we don't think we can afford that is
an underwater, that's my building.

194
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:07,930
You guys don't have to pay anything.

195
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,000
I just want to make sure I don't have to
drive them one on one at four or five.

196
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,840
You guys, that's a hell of
a drive to Redondo drive.

197
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,480
And he gave the school tours. Wow.

198
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,520
Then it's like what can I tell him more
about this guy that's on the knows and

199
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,720
that's why we have this school in the
valley because he used to live any sooner.

200
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,990
The school was in a scene and then we
start coming here. Then here we are.

201
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,590
You Hogan Tarzana to our
school. Yeah. That's amazing.

202
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,540
Wow. What a great guy. But the point
on that, our conversation was that, um,

203
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,680
our school when we opened our
school, still called college.

204
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,290
Gracie's you too because of our uncle.

205
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,800
Cause when we came in we have the
Gracie school and I remember, uh,

206
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,370
the family's big and everybody
has your sign of story.

207
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:56,740
Everybody's saying
something about your uncle,

208
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:59,550
your cousin and we wanna
make sure that this side,

209
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,740
the fem that we were representing
away was Carlos side.

210
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,080
Then um,

211
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,920
a lot of people when the with d the grand
opening check noise were with us doing

212
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,030
this self defense and demonstration and
the grand opened up the school and that

213
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,340
was on Sunday. On Monday.

214
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,360
We're not even ready for the amount
of people that show up at our school.

215
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,800
And we have um, a small place
with the amount of people,

216
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,720
but a lot of people start calling the
other school asking where our schoolwork

217
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,460
cause we're not even on the the
book, the Yellow Book. Yeah,

218
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,310
we are not even on that and people
are calling the other schools,

219
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:42,260
hey do you know where the
other school is in there?

220
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,530
Create a little situation
back then and we got some uh,

221
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,540
calls from other cousins and they say,
Hey, you guys cannot use the name.

222
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,680
Then for the first time leaving
using the name of our family,

223
00:13:56,681 --> 00:14:00,940
we realized like what? Why not? Cause
you don't have less name, you can use it.

224
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,411
Then for us,

225
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,410
we grew up fighting or the family
doing everything for their family.

226
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,870
We still do nothing change,

227
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,020
but then their suggestion was, yeah,

228
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:14,530
you can call my child
like all the Gracie name.

229
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:17,470
My family was this because of Horian? Yes.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,460
Was Beck who was a lawyer and so he was
the one who kind of copyrighted it and

231
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,430
wanted to make it. He was like trying
to sue Carlson at one point. Right,

232
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,470
but do you know the crazy thing was this,

233
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,430
we have one of the students in
and as we learned your shoe too,

234
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,820
the most important thing for me as an
instructor was everybody can learn how to

235
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,200
fight, right?

236
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,410
How can you translate what you learned
in the Mat to implement in your personal

237
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:43,630
life? That's how we learned your shoes.

238
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,260
The impact as you two has on you
to succeed outside the academy.

239
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,573
I know you can fight,

240
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,280
but can you fight on your life
outside then is a different ball game.

241
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,140
It's a lot bigger and a lot harder and
we have a lot of students that came to us

242
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,170
when we have our garage time that
changed their life in Queens gently.

243
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,230
One of these students happens to be sent
off the biggest lawyer in California

244
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,750
and we have no idea because we ended up
getting sued by one side of the family.

245
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,770
They don't have no money. We turn
to this and say, guys, I'm sorry.

246
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,820
We want to have to leave.

247
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,460
So you thought you were going to
close down the school? Oh yeah.

248
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,410
Then we have this guy, which his
father was very grateful to us show up.

249
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,130
Say, look, I'm these hot shot
lawyer. I can represent you guys.

250
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,680
Like what am I going to pay
now? You guys are ready.

251
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:38,360
I owe you because my son was saved
by you guys and who's your son?

252
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,030
That his son was 21st for quite some time.

253
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,260
Became very [inaudible] to change his
life around. He was a drug addict.

254
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,330
Now he's one of the best yoga instructors
out there. Jujitsu addict. Yeah.

255
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:55,250
We go and tell his life and that lawyer
protectors made sure that we stay here.

256
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:59,930
Fine. What's back then? There was on
the past today, Paul, our families,

257
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,080
we have our difference back
then and it's less now. Oh,

258
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,670
it's nothing. Well, there's
enough for everybody now.

259
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:07,530
I think everybody
realizes in the beginning,

260
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:11,460
Jujitsu was so new and so powerful
and that Gracie name was so huge.

261
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,090
Do you remember when Vituro tour? They
used to call Him v [inaudible] Gracie?

262
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,590
Yes. They would call him victor for
some reason it was victor vi, k, t, O,

263
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:23,160
r, and then it became v tour, like I
was there when they were calling them

264
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:24,990
Victor Gracie Manda. No,

265
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,400
the amazing thing in the eyes of
fighter and in my generation, Brazil,

266
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,940
everybody wants to be part
of their family. Of course,

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,930
everybody wants to feel that you and
that big circle because there's so much

268
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,910
history and it's the name.

269
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,260
August 12 at your birthday, right?

270
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,730
11th August 11th they're going to have
a statue of a Carson Gracie beach in

271
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,930
Copacabana and ribbon me. A
lot of recognitions happen now,

272
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,040
which is you two in special degrees.

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,240
Usually it's because anyone that does
usually today you're doing great Sushi

274
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,990
somehow, maybe second generation,

275
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,160
that generation student off this guy who
his instructor was the student and off

276
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:04,741
they may,

277
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:09,080
I think everybody should be in and
they're grateful for what their family's

278
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:09,914
done.

279
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,940
Yes. The fee,

280
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,360
it's the most important family in the
history of martial arts by a long shot

281
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,500
man. It's, it changed. The world,
changed the world, changed the world,

282
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,573
changed my world.

283
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,230
I remember when UFC came out and I watched
it and I had been a Stryker my whole

284
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:28,620
life and um, I had done a
little wrestling in high school,

285
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,470
but no Jujitsu, no
submissions, don't nothing.

286
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,620
And I watch boys crazy just run
through everybody. And I felt,

287
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,550
I felt so vulnerable. I was like,
oh no, I don't know anything.

288
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,770
I don't know any of this. What the fuck.

289
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:44,430
This is how I was watching him take guys
down and just strangle him like shit.

290
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,050
And these guys were killers.

291
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:49,830
They were standup killers and
hoists was just everybody.

292
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,770
[inaudible] when I was in Arizona,

293
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,460
I remember the first one they
show in the paper view. And, uh,

294
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,390
I was in Denver right the first year.

295
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,290
[inaudible] and I was teach a seminar
and I think back those days they got

296
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,570
payment thousand dollars
for the weekend. And,

297
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,830
and I was watching a group of guys and
they were not even sure and I put them on

298
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,810
that. David said, hey,

299
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,860
who wants to make a bet that the skinny
little guy like looked like a dark color

300
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,150
is going to win everything? And
everybody I know. No, that guy. Okay,

301
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,580
put good money in them. Nobody
put the money though. And He,

302
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:25,380
we are because we knew what you should
do too is we knew that Jujutsu youtube

303
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,400
works and the things usually it's brought
a lot of reality into the martial arts

304
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:32,640
world. Oh yeah.

305
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,760
We made a lot of enemies that today are
our friends because we showed something

306
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:42,240
that people refuse to learn
until they have no other choice.

307
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,270
They have no other choice
and no man, we have UFC,

308
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:49,110
the biggest fighting show in the world.
What they come from came from Horian.

309
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,970
There we go. Came from the streets in
Brazil to the world and Horian Gracie,

310
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,330
who we all owe a huge debt to.

311
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,960
He wanted to prove the
effectiveness of Gracie Jujitsu.

312
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,290
So he established the ultimate fighting
championship and that's where it came

313
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:04,501
from.

314
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:09,450
It came from that guy's imagination and
his desire to spread the word of his

315
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:13,440
family. That's why I choose you to do
for people. Make you believe. Yeah.

316
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,880
Imagine if he did not believe in what he
has and what he learned. Yeah. Will be.

317
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,690
None of us will be a talking today,

318
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,870
probably still doing something else and
maybe not as happy as we actually know.

319
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,480
It's amazing. And the whole stories,

320
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,290
it's hard for people to understand
too that have never practiced it.

321
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,090
How Fun it is. You know, it's, it's an
a so, and it makes your mind the better.

322
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,630
Oh wait,

323
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,630
I was telling some of the students use
Jitsu is a health way for you to be

324
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,883
bullied by someone.

325
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,050
You in a school environment and you
have the high belts playing with their

326
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,890
weapons. Yes. They even, they
out the white belts come in.

327
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,490
It's literally been bullying in a
health way because it's an hour safe

328
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:59,460
environment. Well it's not bullying
where you're not getting picked on,

329
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:04,020
but you're getting manhandled. Then
the thing is they get smashed daily.

330
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,600
They come back for next
class. Yes. Next class.

331
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,520
Until soon they're going to start
be able to do the same thing. Yes.

332
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,250
And that little step they
do, they realize like,

333
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:19,251
well I'm being picked by someone now
I stand by myself and I'm able to,

334
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,730
and he turned the table around.

335
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,360
It's a very healthy way to be picked up
smash every day that if you stay there,

336
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:30,270
stick there, you're going to use
that. You're going to reverse that.

337
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,780
You get choked pretty soon going to be
choking someone in the round bar going on

338
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:38,781
by somebody and as I walking up in
the stairs and that's how we grew up.

339
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,830
We go to the schools, we get beat up
like by the older cousins and um, man,

340
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:47,210
I don't think that's for me. But then
we come back one more time. Yeah,

341
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,580
we'll come back one more
time. Then 40 years later,

342
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,070
you still coming back from one more time.
We'll teaches you not just resilience,

343
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,020
but how important it is to just
keep showing up and it's a,

344
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,730
it's fun. Yeah. That whole thing.
You get choked to go home with a,

345
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,470
how'd that guy choked me? Yeah. I
thought I knew how to defend that.

346
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,240
How did he make me turn in their way that
he gets the choke? Then it intrigued.

347
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,880
Then you keep in in back in
the 80s we had no videos.

348
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,430
We would have to try to memorize and
see how this actually happened. Right.

349
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,710
Is it was a lot more challenging because
you have to try to remake it and not

350
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:30,640
sure if that's what actually happened
to you. But the amazing thing in,

351
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,970
I remember a lot of times
they're looking around the mats.

352
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,320
I have all my brothers, all my cousins.

353
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:44,310
It's no way someone in this room with
them will not have the answer for the

354
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:46,930
question that you have. Right.

355
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,260
And you have so many different views
that is impossible for you not to learn.

356
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,460
And I'll get good in Jujitsu. Yeah.

357
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,550
You have so many amazing fighters
out there knowing more than you know,

358
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,040
then every member, every time I
ask something to the technique,

359
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,670
I get five different answers. Yeah.
And I use the one that works for me.

360
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,270
Well that's what's interesting, right?

361
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:11,950
I said everyone has a different
approach that Jujitsu is almost like a,

362
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,740
the way people talk, it's
like having conversations.

363
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:19,350
People use different words and
different styles and, and, and, and,

364
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,790
and the amazing thing is, let's see,

365
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,990
we train and I do well with you
then the train with that guy.

366
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:30,310
You do well if the guy in
deteriorate, I should be doing well.

367
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:34,540
If the guy know maybe his game
does not fit with my game,

368
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:38,800
I might have a lot of difficult
against him, which I shouldn't.

369
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,860
What is the matchup game is
very interesting is nothing
that is guarantee all

370
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:46,630
that guy's gonna. No it's not right.

371
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,660
And maybe my game is used
yours but not to his,

372
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,450
well that was the most amazing
thing about Hickson, right?

373
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Cause Hickson was the one guy that
everyone said was the best when I grew up.

374
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,550
And I have to say, um, the
privilege watch for me.

375
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:06,580
I have some guys from Carson school,

376
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,350
there was amazing fighters used to
watch them and I remember one of them.

377
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,800
Our Casio Cardozo for me was phenomenal.

378
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,360
We have definitely heuler
for his size, his weight,

379
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,290
most accomplished, Phil nominal,
all the greatest numbers, man.

380
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,050
What this guy did with for his size
against opponents. People look like that.

381
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,800
No Way. And yes, it is a way. Yeah,

382
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,340
and definitely as you going
heavier, I have my brother Hagen,

383
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,870
which was an amazing fighter.
Choo. And if evidently for me,

384
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:42,970
my time was Hickson.

385
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,590
It's like you have the era
of Hixon. Yeah, I love them.

386
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:50,840
They live both fighters, but you,

387
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,000
you in the room decade and Nixon and now
could be you, but he was right there.

388
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,590
Right. You could've been
number number 200 Hickson.

389
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,540
You could've been number one.

390
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,500
Are there anybody else in the amazing
thing you feel like a chameleon? He can,

391
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,410
he can kind of make any
game. You train him.

392
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,620
He can pretend to be you
fighting me or anybody.

393
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,940
It's amazing that aspect,
especially in the teaching process.

394
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,930
What was so good about him.
He used to go to our school,

395
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:22,190
we have third of the best
guys, all higher belts,

396
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,610
and he tells you, okay, choose how I
want to start. And you choose. Okay.

397
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,930
He is not going to get out. He gets
out and he gets you in the position.

398
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:33,080
You ask him to start with everyone.

399
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,150
I think the most,

400
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,530
the best thing that he has on his game
that I'm on my view and today understand

401
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:43,310
that was his defense.
Hmm. No way to get him.

402
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,900
You let your mom take his back, do
whatever you want. You can get him.

403
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,860
He used to start, let guys take
his back with a rear naked choke,

404
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:56,040
fully locked in black belts. Go
ahead, start from here, stuffing,

405
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,260
defend, get out and get you there. Crazy.

406
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,410
Then messes your mind up like,
Hey, wait a minute. Yeah,

407
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,300
how can he get out? And he gets
me here. Can't get out. You know?

408
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,070
And I think the amazing thing was
his confidence and belief on that.

409
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,780
It makes amazing. Well,

410
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,620
he was unusual in that he was really
into physical fitness as well.

411
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:23,621
Like Yoga really in the yoga
become incredibly flexible
and strong and really in

412
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,500
the breathing. He,

413
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,560
he had an amazing control of his body
as well as the knowledge of Jujitsu man.

414
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,560
He brought a lot of
elements to shoot that.

415
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,150
I don't think people realize how important
it was as people, so I knew that.

416
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,440
No you did not. He brought
in the breathing aspen, the,

417
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:47,441
there's your nice guy that makes you
come closer to the nature habitats.

418
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,240
Yeah. Gymnastica naturals
what we're talking about.

419
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:54,470
It's a style of who invented that
was the man who invented Orlando,

420
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,230
Connie and there was a Brazilian
thing as well. Brazilian guy.

421
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:01,640
He's still alive in his eighties and you
look at him like how can he do or still

422
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:06,641
do that and the whole idea is move your
body like the animals to bring back to

423
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:12,740
us, the animal instinct that we
end up losing by the generations.

424
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,060
You see some of that now
with a Edo port towel.

425
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,220
And a lot of these guys are training
martial artists in these movement,

426
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,280
like movement classes and movement styles.

427
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:26,900
And a lot of that is very
similar to gymnastic or natural.

428
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,101
Amazing.

429
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:32,720
But the biggest difference I think
was the concept that he used,

430
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,750
the approach that he used wasn't as just
mechanical the way it is with something

431
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,620
that's sometimes on the exercise you
change the direction of your movements is

432
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:48,780
not certain Catia, you have to do one,
two, three, four. Now he goes one, two,

433
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,770
[inaudible] four 10 go
back to six. You flow.

434
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,510
And Hexion brought that into Jujitsu.
And I remember a train, he goes, Hey,

435
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,070
get there. Keep, keep moving, keep
moving. Don't stop moving. Keep,

436
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:05,160
keep the flow of the
technique, you're gonna get it.

437
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,790
And he brought that
movement into the sheets,

438
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:12,420
which for me made a huge
difference in the way I fight.

439
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,590
How did you fight before that?
Um, we learned the technique.

440
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,850
We do the drills and uh,

441
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,680
it's more like you pause and wait for
somebody to pause in his position when he

442
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,360
came in. Understand that he's,

443
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,480
you learn how to start guiding people
to where you want them to go. Mm.

444
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,513
I'm 20 few.

445
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,030
I want you to go to my left is no
other way for it to go to my right.

446
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,290
I learned how to mold my Biden away.

447
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,300
The only direction you will have
to go is on my left. I know that,

448
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:46,920
but you don't. Right. Then we go on one
step ahead. Then when you go to my left,

449
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,560
you're gonna put your left hand on
the grounds. That felt right hand.

450
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,460
I know that too. Then I'm two
steps ahead of you. I mean,

451
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:54,930
when you're trying to defend something,

452
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,310
you already two steps behind because
the defense is I was shorter than the

453
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:03,330
offense. Your stretch arm.
For me to get your arm,

454
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,540
I have to put my hands and swing my
leg for it. Just bring going back.

455
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,270
It's always short. It's quicker.

456
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,330
That's why when you have
one or two steps ahead,

457
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:17,100
you don't have the time to defend.
You're blocking off the defense.

458
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,190
I'm already too far
ahead for it to defense.

459
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,240
And that's what I learned with those
movements that he brought into Jujitsu.

460
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,620
You start learning how to guide and
mold yourself to make you go to that

461
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:31,110
direction. Who was a challenge
to him in the early days?

462
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,440
Cause there was a lot
of great guys, right?

463
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,270
We have a lot of great guys and it's
funny sometimes I soon go to the Internet

464
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:43,700
and see some of the fights and you
notice that a lot of guys, they,

465
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,270
they can kinda hang out for until
five minutes after five minutes.

466
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:52,470
And great athletes, they just
done because of that movement.

467
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:54,930
He keep going constantly keep that rhythm.

468
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,900
People were not able to
keep up with him. Right?

469
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,350
And he's not lifting weights
and a body builder now he's,

470
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,130
and we learn how important for human
needs to be in contact with nature.

471
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,570
Would you imagine yourself not going
for hiking some days in the morning?

472
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,630
Let me, we need that. We
need that energy. You know,

473
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:16,140
we need to walk without shoes. We need
to be near the mountains, the water.

474
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,270
That's something that make us healthy
and stronger. And that's why you see,

475
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:26,070
we used to go a lot up in the mountains
and waterfalls and out of the city to

476
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,540
try to get that in a healthy
animal instinct that we had. Yeah.

477
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,610
Where they listen to the birds,

478
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,000
listen to in the middle
La maybe some chaotic,

479
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,510
there are people that are in the
city, they'll go on the mountain,

480
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,160
they're going to get
eaten, eaten by a mountain

481
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,670
lion. It's not even here, the mountain
lion. But if you're walking there,

482
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,630
quite often you understand that you'll,
you'll develop any, still have that, oh,

483
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:54,400
I heard something there. We're
losing more of that as you Jitsu.

484
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,340
We're trying to bring people
into that environment,

485
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,000
which is something they make
you better off regardless.

486
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,530
Be more aware of yourself.
Exactly. Yeah. More primal.

487
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,660
And um,

488
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,470
then also that's the struggle of Jujitsu
is so much different than what most

489
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:15,730
people experience on a daily basis where
you're literally trying to stop someone

490
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,810
from choking you. And it's a
friend, like a good friend, like

491
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:21,920
[inaudible],

492
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,240
but they're trying to choke the shit out
of you and you're trying to stop them

493
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,120
and the amazing thing you're trying
to stop and you don't get mad at him.

494
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,750
Not at all. You don't say thank you
man. You slap hands. And then I say,

495
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:35,920
how'd you get me? Like, oh you
forgot this. Like Oh God, here we go.

496
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:39,640
His daddy is the amazing thing.
One student said something like,

497
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,120
do you know why?

498
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,880
If you see two people show friendly
cause they hug each other at the time.

499
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,580
And I don't know for sure. Right? Yeah.

500
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,500
Well there's so much physical
contact that that is true.

501
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,900
There's something to that.
But I think it's the, they,

502
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,620
I contacted talking to Jordan.

503
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,820
I'm in that exchange of
information. It's also humbling,

504
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,290
which I think people need.

505
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,060
I think people have a distorted perception
of what they can do in his life.

506
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,840
And I think sometimes you
need to understand this is
where you are. And when,

507
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,750
one of the beautiful things about
the ranking system of Jujitsu is,

508
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,430
you know when you give someone a purple
belt, you say, hey, this is real.

509
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,070
Y'All ready for this? I've
seen you. I watch you.

510
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:25,030
I know you know 100% where they are,
they're ready to get a purple belt,

511
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,760
and then it's this feeling like, okay,

512
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,760
the all this showing up
day after day drilling,

513
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,830
after drilling coming
in when I don't want to,

514
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:35,320
is this paying off and
I've reached a new place.

515
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,130
It sounds like when you promote someone's
a flashback, they'll go back like,

516
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:44,110
whoa. Yeah, they realize all this time
that are bringing in a very good way.

517
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:49,111
Suffering going through these it worth
when he ran now feeling much better.

518
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,060
When you gave me my purple belt,

519
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,720
I remember thinking that was probably
one of the happiest moments of my life

520
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,060
because to me purple belt was like a
blue belt was like you just kept showing

521
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:04,840
up. You kept showing up. You kept
showing up. Now you've got a blue belt,

522
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,540
but a purple belt was like
you could get a black belt.

523
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,110
You just have to keep going. You in the
top of the mountain as a purple belt,

524
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,120
you're right there with the we all
the top guys. There's no way down.

525
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,970
There's just up. You're
right there with all of them.

526
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,740
That was during the fear factor game days.

527
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:24,700
I was more happy about getting that purple
belt than I was about getting factor

528
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,140
donation some because a, I get a lot
of messages from people like, Oh man,

529
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:32,080
it's your hook and good than
jogger and you need to go to man.

530
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,940
Come to my school anytime.
Joe Hogan shows up and he's,

531
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,980
he's back now. Training is not about his

532
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,690
power man. He doesn't care.
He wrestles everybody,

533
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,710
anybody and I see him twist the people
around there and the school in east one

534
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,760
and this is, this is real.

535
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:55,060
Here's one of the hardest
students training partners
that I have and I think one

536
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:58,520
of the last time I wrestle
him and my Malibu School,

537
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:01,310
I think we trained maybe for half
an hour or something like that.

538
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,140
I was there for, I don't know,

539
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:07,070
20 minutes just trying to sweep
Joe and Joe was right there.

540
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,940
I finished the trainers and man,
my legs are sore and I don't,

541
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,780
I don't remember if I did slip him or
not to just stop training after half an

542
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,780
hour and I want people to understand
that it's anybody that I want to trend.

543
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,100
I would never in a refuse,

544
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,260
I never give a bell to anybody unless
they deserve the belt and want to say

545
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:31,130
deserve is. I don't defer
people from more famous,

546
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:35,330
less families taught. Now it's
everybody's usually to word is the same.

547
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,250
You have to walk in the same role as
everybody because that's the only way you

548
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,070
actually going to learn
Jujitsu. For Real. Yes,

549
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:48,290
you're and I don't remember you say no
20 body training get hurt a lot of times.

550
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,780
Don't care. Show up and my neck is here,

551
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,380
my knees there and trainee and
you out there that you listen.

552
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,740
Here's one the strongest,
excuse my language.

553
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:02,570
Motherfuckers I have in my school training
Jujitsu with and that's why I'm here.

554
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm pushing him to get
back and when to show up.

555
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,260
And now that I know where he is, I'm
going to show up here. What's up Joe,

556
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,610
is that as soon as I healed
this, fuck it. It is amazing.

557
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,910
And I want people to know
that a is the real deal.

558
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,440
Another thing that people don't know
is when he was back in the fear factor

559
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,990
time, he had one idea to,

560
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,390
one of the challenge for the
people would be training,

561
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:33,320
fighting a cage with me and decades, don't
you too? And then they realized that,

562
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,950
Joe, you don't need me. You go
there and do it. Well you're wrong.

563
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,310
You're going to mango. Everybody there.
You don't need anybody to do that.

564
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,660
You went up not happening. And
uh, they decided [inaudible]

565
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,030
that it was too dangerous to
do a person versus a person.

566
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,300
They thought that there was too many
legal implications. Actually. Meanwhile,

567
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:55,830
they have people ride a fucking
bull. Any sentence? But so the, the,

568
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,850
the challenge was they were going to
have to start with you on the ground,

569
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:02,460
like in your guard or
with you mounting them.

570
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:06,960
We had to figure out what it was and
whoever survived the longest, you know,

571
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:07,860
like the, the,

572
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,370
I told that guy, I said, man, you
don't need me. You can use Joe.

573
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,230
Joe's going to do this same thing and
gonna twist whatever needs to do it has

574
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:20,500
all the tools for that. That was
funny you say that the point was you,

575
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:22,920
you can do it. There was
no need for me to do it.

576
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,570
How do you, how,

577
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:29,220
how you still fairly injury free
after all these years because what's

578
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:32,340
interesting about you is, you know,
you've been doing jujitsu forever,

579
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:35,010
but you can still roll
and train with people.

580
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:38,010
A lot of other guys after
a certain of time, they

581
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,220
really can't roll anymore. They
develop all these back problems,

582
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,270
back problems in particular,
um, neck problems.

583
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,770
I learned Emmy Meulens you too.
Last chance to have to get hurt.

584
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,460
And my point is I'm always under control.

585
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,110
I'm always controlling my opponent and
I know how to avoid certain situations

586
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:00,390
before the situation actually happened.

587
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:05,400
Cause a lot of times people go for the
kill but not concerned about them getting

588
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:05,880
killed.

589
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,590
Sometimes they expose themselves to be
in a bad position and they have to learn.

590
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:13,920
Sometimes you'll do an onboarding somebody
and somebody put all the weight on

591
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,580
your neck and I see peeping
system in getting there. No,

592
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:20,640
you go back and give up. Keep the
control. Then you do it again,

593
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,350
but nodding systems, some bad
positions and if then has to do,

594
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,620
how well do you eat?
How well do you sleep?

595
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,810
Do you exercise?

596
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,290
Let me a lot of the things that involve
exercise to be like with weights,

597
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,860
lift weights and run the needle and swing.

598
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,010
You have so many things that
you can do and people say,

599
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:44,250
oh no debit buys going at the
holidays. Sure we can die tomorrow,

600
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:48,540
but I want to make sure that time of my
life I'm healthy and I don't see myself

601
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,060
going to Jujitsu school
teaching and not training,

602
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,910
but even Hickson can't train
anymore. Oh no, he's back training.

603
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,640
He's rowing ass. He's really
know when to start rolling again.

604
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,200
I saw one of his students, they
train last week, just one hour. Wow.

605
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,410
I had the injury and again understand
a lot of real bad back problems. Yeah.

606
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,720
As the back and the hip.

607
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:10,320
A lot of things in a lot of those things
happen more not with [inaudible] with

608
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:13,860
some of the MMA fights and got
understand back those days.

609
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,890
There's no no protection at all and
throw the child out of the ring and I was

610
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,700
sipping. Yeah, very, very
challenging. No weight class.

611
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,300
I mean he show up as a young age
fighting. Some monsters are dead and said,

612
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,430
man, I don't know how he did
it, but he did it and you know,

613
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:37,431
showing up and Zulu when he was 18
is a losing sane but still strong.

614
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,190
It was more from that time. Didn't
actually shoot soon. You should.

615
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,700
Should never go a as you
Justin [inaudible] nothing.

616
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,460
[inaudible] then his back training man.
I would love it. It is amazing man.

617
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,410
I don't see myself with years
old not be able to train the new.

618
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,510
You've got a cortisone
shot recently. I, yeah,

619
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm not sure what happened and my knee
bugs me and I go there have a little

620
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,730
meniscal tear. I'm still training.
Have a certain position that are,

621
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,580
it's not comfortable, uh,

622
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,510
have the cortisone shot and so far
so good. Not bothering anymore,

623
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,790
not bothering me. You have
a central position that,

624
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,730
but the physical therapy that
I'm doing is being very helpful.

625
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,540
What kinds of stuff are you doing in
lift the weights and I'm every day in a

626
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:26,280
bike doing things that make your
legs stronger or bike is amazing.

627
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,800
It's so good for the knees.
Knowing packed them in. Yeah.

628
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,180
I think we have everything we
need. Then if I, if I don't have,

629
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:37,270
I can learn how to do by
end up man sheets is a,

630
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,650
is a lifestyle in general.

631
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,030
Yes. Yeah, it is. And the P,
it's, it's almost like, um,

632
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,080
it's not just a lie.

633
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,340
It's like a philosophy too because there's
a lot of people that they learn how

634
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:51,370
to deal with life through the struggle
of Jujitsu because the struggle of

635
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:55,270
training is so much harder than most
of the struggles that you face in your

636
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:59,540
daily life. It makes you more accustomed
to dealing with uncomfortable position.

637
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,530
I will tell a funny story that why
she's you to this for you? I, my,

638
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,430
my older daughter had some health issues.
I get chew o'clock in the morning,

639
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:12,000
something like that and uh,
called the doctor and said, look,

640
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,260
you've got to go and get these inhalers.
Something that the pharmacy man,

641
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:21,230
I was wearing my pajamas driving crazy
to the pharmacy and as I'm walking in and

642
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:24,690
have a guy walking out and bumped
him, he showed her mind and hey,

643
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:28,740
son of a ds F-you and I said,
man, shoot turning them one.

644
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,060
When I find them go home, go
chill. Why? Then they got no,

645
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,060
I'm going wait for you. Then he's
outside. I go get the medication.

646
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,930
I put this stuff in and say, man, get
the guy outside. He's no longer there.

647
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,970
Several months later the
same guy show up in my school

648
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,340
and I did not recognize him, but he
keeps staring at me and I approach, hey,

649
00:39:50,341 --> 00:39:53,490
how are you? I betrayed shoots
before. He's like, do you remember me?

650
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,110
Did you train here before? No, I
bumped into you in the pharmacy.

651
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,000
It goes like tank you for now hurting me.

652
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,020
And that goes like, man,

653
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:11,640
what happened to you that all my father
passed away a day before I was so

654
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:16,500
depressed. So the point
for me was with Jujitsu,

655
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,770
I can walk away for something like
that. Then I feel sorry for the guy.

656
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,100
You know, I'm not concern. All my
friends are him. No, I'm not afraid.

657
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,360
It's just the fact that I'm
saving him to get hurt today.

658
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:31,920
He's one of my best friends.
He's my lawyer, my idea friend.

659
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:36,390
He's been trained as youtube for,
since that time, almost as 20 years.

660
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,320
But I remember that they walk in and the
guy bumped into me. He want to fight.

661
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,980
Wow. And it's like, man, I walk away.
Nah, I just drunk from you, man. Go home.

662
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,830
And less.

663
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,150
That's the difference too, between Jujitsu
and kickboxing. Cause the kickboxing,

664
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,400
you can only hurt somebody. You can't
really like hold onto him and go, hey,

665
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:59,290
hey, you ever see the [inaudible]?
Do you ever see the video? Yeah.

666
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,280
He was already ocean when you, right.
Ever see the video of Matt Serra,

667
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,500
Matt Serra, uh, was in, uh, an
altercation with some drunk guy in a,

668
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:12,300
in a bar or a restaurant or something
like that. And Matt matches.

669
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,750
Took the guy down, mounted them,

670
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:17,800
and was just holding onto his wrist
and he was like, calm down, calm down.

671
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,410
And the employers are like trying to
figure out what to do. He was like,

672
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:25,330
he's fine, he's fine, calm down.
But you know, Matt didn't hurt him.

673
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,650
He just held onto them and basically just
mounted them and grabbed a hold of his

674
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:34,040
wrist and was controlling them.
And then when we, she, she too is

675
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,940
a gentle word. Yeah. We
mean that yes. Usually it's,

676
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:43,110
we'll give you the choice to
choose to hurt someone or not.

677
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,383
Yeah.

678
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,650
And I think why a trainee realize that
that person has something already going

679
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:51,890
on in their life. Right.
And we choose not to. Yeah.

680
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,440
I mean we grew up in our time and it's
funny with teenagers in those years you

681
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,500
to tournaments and then we go like how
are we gonna test ourself and back into

682
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,790
the 80s in Brazil we have some fun time.

683
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,550
We go to a nightclub and fight breaks
through and here we are practicing our

684
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:10,160
Jujitsu but not hurting anybody.

685
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,340
And not because we choose
or somebody provoke. No,

686
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:16,310
we get people coming towards
us cause we always little guys,

687
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,170
we'll never be the biggest
guys in the police.

688
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,700
Then we just make sure like man we
take them down, hold joke somebody out,

689
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:27,200
but no scratch. And on the end those
people become students of our school.

690
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,100
Right. Because all those little
kids can do that to us. Right.

691
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,380
And that's one way. That's funny.

692
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:37,760
In the 80s that usually two became even
bigger with some of the altercation on

693
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:40,970
the street. We convinced the
person that we just fought,

694
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,830
we just choked to come and become our
student cause you didn't hurt them.

695
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,310
Then they're like mad they and they end
up coming and learned that they feel

696
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:53,120
humiliated, but at least they, they feel
thankful that you didn't injure them.

697
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,970
Uh, for sure. Yeah. And
you know, in a five minute,

698
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,580
I think you should to give it that
sense of control that you have.

699
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,400
You have that,

700
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,990
well, this is the way I
always explained to people.

701
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:08,290
I say if I'm in a street fight
with someone and they're swinging,

702
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,930
if it's strong person of a strong person,

703
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:14,110
they're good athlete and they have strong
arms and they're throwing punches at

704
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:17,710
me. If I get hit, I'm in trouble. No
matter who you are. If you get hit,

705
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:21,310
you're in trouble. Most likely I won't
get hit if I know how to, how to fight.

706
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:25,210
And I keep my hands up and I move.
Right. But if I get a hold of you,

707
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,160
you're not doing anything to me.

708
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,180
Like there's a difference between like
someone who's untrained and someone's

709
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,970
trained. Like if a Jujitsu black
belt grabs a person and gets off,

710
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,820
actually gets control of
them. There is no lucky.

711
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,870
You're not gonna luckily submit me,
you know, it's not going to happen,

712
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:44,770
but you can. Luckily you could hit
someone. It can happen in a street fight.

713
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:48,130
If someone has a little bit of speed
and they have power and there's a strong

714
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:52,750
person they can hit you. It's much
more dangerous. That's the only,

715
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,190
and we also want to train,

716
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,320
it was the only opportunity or upon
enhances before we close the distance,

717
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,910
right? That's the danger zone.
And if you think for a second,

718
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,210
a lot of things that we do
on the ground in Jujitsu,

719
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,700
you'd just bring those two
people up in the close.

720
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:12,930
The distance is the same thing.
And a lot of people today,

721
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:13,830
they don't do the same.

722
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,340
They tried to fight standing when they
hold different than when you're on the

723
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:20,130
ground, the way you move your
legs, they way play guard.

724
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,410
It's the same thing when you're standing.
Work on the people's body as a whole,

725
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:26,550
cause a sweep to make
somebody fall. And, uh,

726
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,220
and we learned that when
we get close to someone,

727
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,400
we make this size not affected as much
eyes could if you have a distance,

728
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:36,740
do you,

729
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,760
I think that there was a transitionary
period where a lot of Jujitsu guys were

730
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,580
having a hard time cause they were, they
didn't know how to take people down.

731
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,900
And then the wrestlers were learning
how to keep them at distance.

732
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:48,410
They were learning take down defense

733
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,590
in, in uh, yes and, and that's
the very challenging thing.

734
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,810
But if I'm fighting wrestler,

735
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:58,060
what are the chances that
he's going to take me down?

736
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,770
It's higher than me actually
taking him down. Right?

737
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,160
And most of the things that
we do in the Jujitsu on the,

738
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:10,120
what we see in the sports issues today,
we're not gonna use in a real fight,

739
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,630
most as you should to see in a tournament.

740
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,010
We're not going to use that in a fight.

741
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:21,070
That's the difference from that generation
of the 80s to the generations from

742
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:23,050
the 90s until today.

743
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,230
It's two different kinds of a Jujitsu.

744
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,930
One is a sport which is very beautiful.

745
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,120
A lot of people did do amazing techniques,

746
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,020
but the rules of the sport had the tenders
to take to another direction and when

747
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:42,391
you have [inaudible] as the 80s with
practice using a lot of leverage with the

748
00:45:42,971 --> 00:45:47,971
arms patients and when we play Gardendale
eighties is different than we played

749
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:52,480
today too. They have a lot of
gears wrapping around everything.

750
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:56,110
They key became a weapon right in our
time. They give us never a weapon.

751
00:45:56,111 --> 00:46:00,190
They give us like almost like a paper
we use a lot. The neck a lot. The elbow.

752
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,680
Well that's what helped you when
you transitioned to No-gi, right?

753
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,790
Well definitely it also because you were
born with no fingers on your left hand.

754
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,580
Man was no d from me until two
days. No difference. Right.

755
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,000
I play exactly the same in both,
right. No difference at all.

756
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:19,150
But you are all over hooks and under
hooks and and grips around the body and

757
00:46:19,311 --> 00:46:24,140
whereas the guys who transitioned to MMA
and they're all game relied on grabbing

758
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:28,970
collars and sleeves, those guys
had the harder time for sure. Yeah.

759
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:31,730
A lot of guys. That's why a lot of
guys that are trying to come in,

760
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,380
they might be good in their top games,
but when they go in their back, yes,

761
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,440
they are kind of a little lost until
I see this guys how to play the game.

762
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah. That's why it's so
important. Impressive.

763
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,970
When you see a big guy
who also has a great back,

764
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,550
great office back like
Fabrizio over knew him.

765
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:55,120
I think if you'll notice it, if I'm
on the bar of someone and I'm flat,

766
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,430
I'm a target, right? I have to change
the angle. If I don't change the angle,

767
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:03,970
I'm going to get ground and pound
like we've being seen a lot. Yes,

768
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,970
you're gonna see some more this a black
boundary sheets and then they go like,

769
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,700
oh, it just gets flat on his back.

770
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,850
That means all my weight now is
affecting you. I'm dropping you.

771
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,550
You have to learn that your
leg should be an angle.

772
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,240
This way I'm not able to hit
you there. Your legs on the way.

773
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,230
And that's one thing that very few guys
do it or close the distance or change

774
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:30,520
the angle, but it can be looking at
him trying to, we'll hold his neck.

775
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:31,660
He's gonna hit you hard.

776
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,890
Well Eddie figured out a brilliant thing
with rubber guard when with a brilliant

777
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:39,350
thing with mission control and how
to control from the back of the neck.

778
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:42,460
He loves the distance
closer to the distance.

779
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,680
He changed a lot of people's games. What?

780
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,760
What that some people
don't want to recognize,

781
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,880
but they have chu is the idea that he
had and I remember him coming up and try

782
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:59,500
some of the techniques and people, oh
this is crazy. I said, no man, keep going.

783
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,830
This is, you're going to get
some, well I don't think,

784
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,000
not every body can do that because
you have to be a little bit flexible.

785
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,510
But once you learn how to do
it, you save your life. Yeah.

786
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,800
How many guys that when they get a hold
of their foot and keep that close is no

787
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:17,590
gap or room for the
person on top to hit you.

788
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,860
And as you're trying to move too
much arm suddenly stuck. Yup,

789
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,050
and there we go. Yeah.
Closes the distance.

790
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,830
You can be playing when my arms are
free because I'm going to ground them

791
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,040
pounds. Especially the heavy guys man.
Right. Hit once or twice. That's it.

792
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:34,301
Yeah.

793
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:38,080
He figured out some very unique ways
to use his legs and you notice that he

794
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,860
closed the distance or he changed
the angle. Close the distance,

795
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,020
change the angle. Whoever's on top,

796
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,120
you don't have space or
you don't have the angle.

797
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,830
You always in a weird position when they
get a hold of your head and the leg the

798
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:51,664
way he does.

799
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:56,790
It's interesting to see the evolution
of Jujitsu from 1993 UFC style to 2019

800
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,380
too. There's so many new techniques.
There's so many new approaches,

801
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:05,950
but there's some guys like
[inaudible] Gracie for instance,

802
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,480
who just use the basics honed
to raise her sharp edge.

803
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,570
You don't see a lot of crazy baron Bolo,

804
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,060
chokes or wild things from those.

805
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:21,410
A lot of the like real rock
solid traditional techniques,

806
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:26,140
guys, he does simple
works all the time. Yes,

807
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,370
whichever simple works.

808
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:32,260
Are there any things you used to that
require more than three steps you need to

809
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:36,460
train a lot, but even Hickson, right?
Like Hickson style was the just,

810
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,430
it wasn't anything that
no one knew how to do,

811
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,390
which just he knew how to do it
better than anyone. There we go. He's,

812
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:48,250
he's the way he moved. Yes, you can
find him. Right and once you find him,

813
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,860
he gets out and get you. He
goes around your back. It's,

814
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,600
it was a middle man triangles. Armbars,
rear naked chokes, normal stuff.

815
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,810
Normal things that everybody knows
how to do. You'll get to his god,

816
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,400
you know you're going to find a back.
Yes. Simple as that. I'm his guy,

817
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:06,010
I'm gonna fall, follow his back.
He's going to sweep me all.

818
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,500
I'm not going to sweep all he's
going down by me. They may,

819
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,110
it's not much way can feel
safe and today you see a lot of

820
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,160
these usually to have, they
need some pickled transition.

821
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:22,360
You go phone number one beginning
of the position transition.

822
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,450
Then you have the submission today.

823
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:30,630
They jump from number one beginning
to the submission is no transition.

824
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:36,821
The transition now is become muscle
amped over by never seen so many injuries

825
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,560
today in this Jujitsu competition.
Really so many injuries,

826
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,950
shoulder neath, foot, elbow like my
God, what do you think it's from?

827
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,220
Because it's no, you're
missing a lot of that.

828
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:53,460
Sometimes they finesse to get there.
They have to muscle. Well that's

829
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,950
one of the reasons why I wanted to talk
to you about your longevity because you

830
00:50:56,951 --> 00:51:01,060
are the best guy that I know of
in terms of like you, you are,

831
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,910
I mean if you have a little knee
injury, little meniscus, but that's it.

832
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:07,000
I've known you forever. You've
never had like a major surgery.

833
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:11,770
It never had like a major problem and
everybody I know gets hurt. Everybody,

834
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,080
man. I again is the way you train,

835
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,320
the way you control the fight and I think
people can understand is I rather get

836
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:24,320
you once but I get you. Well
then trying to get it 20 times.

837
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:29,321
Sometimes people try to go after each
other and the injury will happen.

838
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,730
Right? Cause the clashing. Exactly. If
you have somebody come very tense to me,

839
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:39,380
I don't play tests back. I tried
to relax more. You relax more,

840
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:41,000
I'm going to be able
to achieve against you.

841
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:44,870
I remember when you competed against
Dean lister and he was about 250,000

842
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:48,500
pounds. Tt was so fucking big.

843
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,710
He was so big. And then,
but you were able to,

844
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,950
there was one of the very big frustration
for me on that event because I

845
00:51:57,351 --> 00:52:02,351
remember was I'm training to be my
weight class below one 70 and that year I

846
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,150
will have a with Marcella Garcia, we'll
have some good names, good gas to fight.

847
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:12,230
And I was training a lot
for that. And I think, um,

848
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,040
we can a half before the event, um,

849
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,940
Aronia was supposed to fight
the LR, but back in those days,

850
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,310
I think he's called tracked with pride,

851
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:27,440
did not allow him to fight cause their
concern is an injury happened. Right.

852
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:30,050
And he's gonna meet me, be
missing the pride fight.

853
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,420
Then they come a week and a half
to offer me death fight and um,

854
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,600
and ended up taking their
fight. But I don't think I,

855
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,650
I train is specific and
focused to fight dean.

856
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:46,280
And I think that fight
was a process for me.

857
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,450
Dina was a monster but it wasn't a good
fight was not much happening on the

858
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:54,950
fight. It was mostly he was
concern it to move and I was,

859
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,260
I felt the difference in
the, I was so light and I,

860
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,000
I did not train anybody heavy
cause I was fine on the one seven.

861
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,720
I was just trying to, if people that
way class in lower to get this speech,

862
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,050
be ready for those guys, then
here we are week and a half.

863
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:13,100
I don't think I was feeling ready
for fight. Somebody this big,

864
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:17,720
my strategy, I have no strategy back
down. Okay, let's, let's try to move.

865
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,570
But he was very smart, not moving much.

866
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,100
I have evidenced to be worried about
him, grab a hold, get a hold of my foot.

867
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,390
And I think it was 20 minutes, not
much happened on their fight. And um,

868
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:31,850
and for me it was,

869
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:37,370
was frustrated not be ready for five
like that as I was training to fight in a

870
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:38,221
lower class.

871
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:43,221
I was so ready and I regret not
doing that would be amazing.

872
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,620
But for the other reason,
that movie Aben no problem.

873
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,180
Well, when you did do
Abudabi the first time,

874
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:54,740
I think it was a wake up call for a
lot of people that you know because of,

875
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,071
you know,

876
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:59,660
being born with no fingers in your hand
and your approach to Jujitsu being so

877
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:02,450
over Hook and underhook
powered, you know, you,

878
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,480
you transitioned so smoothly into No-gi
whereas a lot of guys from your era,

879
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:12,650
they would go and transition
into Nogi and they really,

880
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,710
they were missing so many tools because
they're so used to grabbing the game.

881
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,140
No, what I remember when I got a
call to go at nine and nine and um,

882
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,810
they said they rules would be 10
minutes, five minutes, first five,

883
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:30,670
nothing counts, right? Then after
five, whatever the rules were,

884
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:34,900
I don't even know today what the rules
were anyways, what counts on the account,

885
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:40,450
but then realize, man, the first
five minutes not counts at, let's go.

886
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,190
Right? So if people don't know
what we're saying here, I would,

887
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,460
Dhabi is a very strange rule
set. So for the 10 minute round,

888
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,860
the first five minutes
of it, there's no points.

889
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,220
It doesn't matter what happens if someone
takes him back. If you get mounted,

890
00:54:52,221 --> 00:54:55,190
you get into a triangle, but
you escape. There is no points.

891
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,270
Yeah. And I just go bring
that guy to the ground,

892
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,820
pulled guard right away
and let's go right.

893
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:04,840
And I think was suppressed for a lot of
people because right from the bat I keep

894
00:55:04,841 --> 00:55:07,900
going all the way. And um, again,

895
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:11,530
with the transition that I,
for me, I have no transitions.

896
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:15,390
The same game no-gi right.
And I felt at home, yes.

897
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:20,380
That's what I do every day. And I felt
a lot of guys not sure how to behave,

898
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,730
but in my mind, the first five
minutes, nothing counts. That's,

899
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,830
it doesn't matter if he mounts
me, take my back or do anything.

900
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,870
Nothing is realistic.

901
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,260
Their whole idea is to make people
actually go after charter. Right.

902
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,480
But when I get there,
I see people waiting,

903
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,630
standing five minutes walking
around, waiting for the five minutes

904
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,730
[inaudible] and then went on one
point opposite. But usually, yeah.

905
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,720
And I said, hell no.
Let's go to the ground,

906
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:50,760
see if he's better grappling than
me. Good if it's not good as them.

907
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,870
But it was a wake up call for a lot of
people cause they got to see you. Who Do,

908
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,190
who did you fight in that first year?
He fought sock awry, right? Aye. Yeah.

909
00:55:57,191 --> 00:56:01,740
Fought who was a big time MMA
fighter at the time. But I can,

910
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,170
I think they were well known and very
well known and May, may world of it.

911
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:09,130
They're also known as being really good
grapplers so it was very eyeopening for

912
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:10,050
people to see you run through,

913
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,650
if I'm not wrong with the first
loss for Sockeye is first loss.

914
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,530
What was fine? I think for me it was,

915
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,720
it's my world and let's see if you're
better grappler good if you're not. Yeah,

916
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:27,450
we go. Good Fun. Yeah. Yeah.
It was fun and I think was,

917
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,410
it was very good for me too. All Day.

918
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,910
ADCC I was able to be among the
best three guys and that was,

919
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:39,100
um, for me was a great
accomplishment. Being able to,

920
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,870
to stay up in the top of their game and
fighting the lighter guys that have your

921
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,480
guys and was in special Nokia,

922
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:50,050
which was something that it
takes for a lot of people,

923
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,960
some kind of adjustment cause they,

924
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:58,020
they born in the gay world base in their
game on the g and they have actually

925
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,620
some hard time too. And a lot of them
even gave up. Like, I forget it now.

926
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,350
In the early days of Jujitsu, there was a,

927
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,130
a lot of No-gi guys on
the Luta Levi side, right?

928
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:17,220
There was a v for people don't understand
there's a big rivalry in Rio between

929
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:22,300
Jujitsu and Luca Libris. Um, a lot of,

930
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:27,360
a lot of times you have people that come
to our school and they don't fit in,

931
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,820
they and they walk away.

932
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,880
And if find the stood back those days,

933
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:37,060
those guys were some of
these people that didn't,

934
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,290
did not fit into their Jujitsu schools
and then that creating their own,

935
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,170
no geese school. But
again, understand that.

936
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:48,820
And in the 80s our generation in
Rio de Janeiro, summertime, man,

937
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,130
it's a 110, 115,

938
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:56,250
extremely humid and we did
a lot of trainings with
trinity g and after the guest

939
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:00,700
session, like the top of
the guilt and here we go,

940
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,300
we train ogee since we are white belts,

941
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,390
we've been doing that because the intent,

942
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,400
we're learn how to get
out of our head lock,

943
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,510
how to be in the barn and somebody
trying to slap you. What do you do?

944
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,150
And that was our
training, that generation.

945
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:21,151
That's why almost everyone from the 80s
is still up to date teaching and making

946
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:24,604
a great school.

947
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:30,450
All the jet dead generation still the
longevity on them being do Jujitsu still

948
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:34,960
out there. A lot of guys that I see
now, especially if their social media,

949
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:40,000
they all teaching, they all doing
very well. A lot of them too big.

950
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,660
Some of them still in
good shape and teaching.

951
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,310
But at that generation I think is uh,

952
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,890
for me was a golden gold generation
cause he's still out there and the people

953
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:53,350
that come from that
generation, their students,

954
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:58,180
they developed such a good Jujitsu
roots is they're still looted liver,

955
00:58:58,181 --> 00:58:59,014
anything anywhere.

956
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:04,300
I think they still have there but
there's not a rivalry anymore right now.

957
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:06,040
I don't think today past that time.

958
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,250
And I think that their rivalry was a
need for our generation to stablish.

959
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,730
She,

960
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:17,730
it was a very effective art and I think
some of the MMA events that happened was

961
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,830
the fight to should,
should they happen on the,

962
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,000
then we're able to bring
that into make into an arena.

963
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,120
And this way only the two guys would be
finding not innocent people get hurt on

964
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:31,950
the street. And I think ways
of what people don't realize,

965
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,750
there's a lot of those fights could be
happened right on the nightclub or some

966
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:40,751
people even get killed now lets bring
their fighting to their arena on youtube

967
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:42,890
guys. Nobody else going to get hurt.

968
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,660
And that's why a lot of those events
happen. No money, no prize money,

969
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:52,270
not just for pride. There's some videos
of some of them that still exist.

970
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,080
You know, just for pride,

971
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:56,840
there's no money involved in
any of those fight on the beach.

972
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,890
Who was that on fight? Ugo
Duarte. That's right. He'd go,

973
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:03,830
Duarte went on to fight and pride.
He fought tank Abbott, right?

974
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,360
Man fought some different
people. And I remember,

975
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,440
I remember that they were so funny because
I'm have a point on the beach in Rio

976
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:12,884
that is,

977
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:17,240
it's where most of the shit
where the pretty girls were.

978
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,860
Then all the guys go in there session
the beach, very famous people,

979
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:25,790
and then everybody goes in that
session and I would keep it here.

980
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:29,420
The rugal challenge Hexion Luca challenge
Hexion Hooga challenge here is right

981
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:34,220
here. Every go smack them in
the face then, and he goes like,

982
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:36,810
no, he didn't say anything.
And I'm right there.

983
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,830
I'm walking right there
and a light shorts there.

984
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,030
My mission where Hixon look
up, look at me and say, hey,

985
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,650
watch my back. Where were
you? I'm the one. Okay,

986
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,560
I'm off the screen now.
Right on, on my left.

987
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:56,100
You're gonna see me
standing there then. Oh,

988
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:59,800
he came right. If, if I get up, I can
show you what this fear is. What year?

989
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,830
This man, sometime in the 80s and
didn't know who's filming that.

990
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,390
We have a um, high and Gracie,

991
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:12,800
he was sitting at someone's shoulders
with our camera. Crazy to try to see.

992
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:16,610
Oh no man. I was getting so
many bodies. I was getting,

993
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:21,770
I was getting punched in the head and
back just cause as watching Hickson's but

994
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:24,530
everybody didn't jump in? No, no, no.

995
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:29,531
What we did was we made a
circle harms two arms and uh,

996
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,800
and Hickson's the one with the green
shorts, right? Greenstreet yes.

997
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:37,100
And he had the long hair that they,
which they got grabbed his hair.

998
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:41,450
It doesn't look like it's hers that well.
Oh No, he is a ponytail there. Really?

999
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,610
Yeah, I have, I knew he had a
ponytail from a advantage of,

1000
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,040
see now you see Hickson
mounting him. Oh no, he, he,

1001
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,920
he got tired of punching the guy we felt.

1002
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,300
And so my mission, him punching
him. Yeah. There we go.

1003
01:01:56,301 --> 01:01:58,930
And the guy tap and stop.
Please stop and didn't have it.

1004
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,500
He has a group of guys with him.

1005
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:05,070
We want to make sure that
nobody jumped on his back. And,

1006
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:09,050
but the thing is, we have
this in, don't get me wrong,

1007
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:13,580
I'm not telling people to go and do that.
But in that time and that generation,

1008
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:18,290
a lot of those fights that happen in the
street with the need for Jujitsu to be

1009
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:24,040
established the way should be and was
better than two guys finding there.

1010
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,870
Then that fight end up in a bind and
that Glenn mucking five people shooting

1011
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:31,130
each other in the, remember
Hexion said that we,

1012
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:35,130
we get together now our first
original Gracie by high school,

1013
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,220
then some members of other Jujutsu
to schools and say, look guys,

1014
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:43,290
a Hicks is gonna go, they're gonna make
a circle. Only him and the guy fight.

1015
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,690
Nobody else fight. You understand that?

1016
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:49,600
Cause if everybody fights then somebody's
going to get really hurt cause you're

1017
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:53,850
not going to be able to control
anything. We just made a big circle.

1018
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:58,080
We'll hold hands regardless of what
happened. We will not interfere.

1019
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,210
It's Hickson and the guy and that's it.

1020
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:04,140
But want to make sure nobody
jumps in then never may say,

1021
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:07,140
you got to watch my back.
And I go like, oh, okay.

1022
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,550
Said don't do nothing. I
watched my back and he, we arm,

1023
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:15,750
I was behind him and I'm getting punched,
getting kicked from other people.

1024
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:20,430
But the crazy thing was they happen
and Hexion on his mind said, look,

1025
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:22,890
I'm going to go there, slap him
on the face and he's going to run.

1026
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,450
Then we're like, okay. So he goes there,
slept that guy and the guy did not run.

1027
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,640
Then we go, Whoa, shit game
on. Then we hold the chart and,

1028
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:36,990
and I think it was, uh,
this happened on Saturday.

1029
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:42,360
Um, Tuesday night ugo went
to Hixson school with,

1030
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,870
uh, a lot of people. They're
all carrying weapons.

1031
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,980
Hexion wasn't there and they call his
shows up in shorts and he quickly just

1032
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:53,790
slept booboo around.

1033
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,040
Somebody called the police later on
and they even should the ceiling, um,

1034
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:02,280
ar 15, whatever, just
boom. And they laughed.

1035
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:06,840
But then was Hickson just smash him
quick cause it was on the cement,

1036
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:09,390
not on the sand. Um,

1037
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:15,410
but then again happened in a way for us
as a pride to prove the point is you to

1038
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,910
ease the best staff martial arts. Uh,

1039
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,580
we keep going strong and
Ula was alluded lever,

1040
01:04:21,581 --> 01:04:24,900
a guy who was a looter liver
respected, real strong,

1041
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:28,440
one of the best guys do today
and they had a grappling style.

1042
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,960
It just wasn't as
comprehensive back there.

1043
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:33,910
They were doing a lot of
foot locks already here.

1044
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,930
The ones that are doing a lot of foot
locks and they'll get a lot of Hugh hooks

1045
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,260
and they have some quality
fighters among of them.

1046
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,460
Definitely Eugenio to Dale
or Janita deal and they have,

1047
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:47,850
I ended up fighting one of the guys from
there and now I want to double dom is

1048
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:51,840
there. But as the time goes
by, I think people get older,

1049
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:57,130
can understand and I don't think today
has any conflict or any bad feelings and

1050
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:02,230
they must've adopted a lot of the
Jujitsu techniques to everything was you,

1051
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,680
you take the guilt right
today, all training. Grappling.

1052
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:12,540
Okay. What is the definition of grappling
you on the ground fighting then?

1053
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:16,020
It's usually it's what do you think
about this new trend that you're seeing,

1054
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,180
like you saw it particularly
coming out of John, Donna,

1055
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:24,181
her and dean lister with the leg
locks like leg locks are so big in,

1056
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:25,930
in Jujitsu competition.

1057
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,040
Now when when we learn
Jujitsu in stu today,

1058
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:36,030
we will not learn anything related
to lags until we get our blue belt.

1059
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:42,220
The main reason that behind these were
to be able to let you the help guard

1060
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:47,620
without concern anything just to learn
how to move your hips in sweeps and

1061
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:50,950
hooks. Foot lock is
something very effective,

1062
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,260
but if I show you right away,

1063
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:58,290
I might be stopping some of the evolution
of your game or the other person that

1064
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:03,250
you train with that he can learn, which
will make even better. His Foot luck,

1065
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:08,040
right? That's why we hold back
until people get up one year,

1066
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:12,010
two into Jujitsu to learn leg locks,

1067
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:15,850
but today you have the no-gi
everybody such in a hurry.

1068
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,540
Then a lot of No-gi schools, the first
thing people wants to learn, hey,

1069
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,210
I want to learn hill hook. It's usually
it's with, gee, I want to learn ombre.

1070
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:26,050
They know g wants to
go straight to the leg,

1071
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,820
they get people want
to go straight to them.

1072
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:32,470
But I think particularly because of the
success of these leg lockers against

1073
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:36,400
high level competition or know
it's effective is amazing.

1074
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:38,830
I think it's a portion of the game

1075
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,320
[inaudible] and you will see
the development of people
that will have defending

1076
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:49,380
that which also will force guys
to pass also beyond the legs only.

1077
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,960
But definitely their
work is a very danger.

1078
01:06:52,961 --> 01:06:56,830
Let people wrap their legs
around your leg hook you there.

1079
01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:01,840
I mean not everybody can get out
of that and if you don't tap,

1080
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:04,480
you're going to get your
knee ripped apart. For sure.

1081
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:08,380
And that's the real problem with leg
locks is that so many guys wind up with

1082
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,920
pretty devastating knee
injuries in the 80s the the,

1083
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:16,921
the decision not to have heel
hooks in Jujitsu was for safety.

1084
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:22,060
We do, we did practice, but
the competition does not allow,

1085
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,720
you gotta understand that in the
80s if you have a knee problem,

1086
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:27,670
your career is over, right?

1087
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,780
There's no surgery that really
would fix it correctly. Right.

1088
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,980
Today is different. Yeah.

1089
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,750
You understand it's the devolution of
the medical side make possible for you to

1090
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:40,810
put a brand new knee over there.
Yeah. But still to this day,

1091
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,870
meniscus tears and cartilage
tears, those are still huge.

1092
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:45,970
I mean without stem cells it's very,

1093
01:07:45,971 --> 01:07:48,550
very difficult to fix those
unless you get the wineskin.

1094
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:53,140
Like I had part of my meniscus removed
on my left knee and then you see them in,

1095
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:57,030
you want to train fall Engevity
and your gun understand two is a,

1096
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:01,660
I think some of those things
should be kind of farmers cranium,

1097
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,780
a pro league into the Jujitsu world.

1098
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:10,980
Cause a lot of people they get hurt
before even they learn what Jujitsu is.

1099
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:16,340
That's why my only concern is the
danger of all those heel hooks.

1100
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,630
[inaudible] leg locks.

1101
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:23,080
Cause if you get somebody who knows he
might have or he might roll to the right

1102
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:26,390
side, even though a lot
of guys do get hurt. Yeah.

1103
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,800
But if you hold somebody who doesn't have
much experience in one of those traps,

1104
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,330
it's for sure injury. They brought the
wrong way and rip it apart themselves.

1105
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:39,750
Even if you don't squeeze, it's because
they don't know what to do. Right? Yeah,

1106
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,540
and my, that's my view off as an
instructor today on my school center.

1107
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:47,980
You're not ready for legs yet,
right? Oh, I go to the nugget.

1108
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,970
Don't go to the Nogi Tournament yet.

1109
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,350
You have to learn first in
the stand for your own safety.

1110
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,840
And also I want them to develop guard.
Cause when we get hired with pool guard,

1111
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:05,000
when you get tired, you lie down to sleep.
You don't sleep standing. You sleep.

1112
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:07,940
When you lie down, when Jujitsu
is the same thing, you get tired,

1113
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,380
you're going to pull guard.

1114
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,770
And that's one of the ways I see
some of my students in a tournament.

1115
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:16,610
They get tired. He's a top guy.
Send his that pulling guard.

1116
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,660
Does that mean he's tired?
He's already once in.

1117
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:25,661
That's why you have to have a good guard
just to survive and rest to be able to

1118
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:26,720
continue.

1119
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,910
We surprised though that this no-gi leg
block games are taken off the way it

1120
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:31,963
did.

1121
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,240
I think because of the success of have
so many guys doing extremely well in some

1122
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:43,601
of the guys that come from the new ogee
originally doing so well now some of the

1123
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:46,190
guys that come from the
gear world doing No-gi,

1124
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:50,720
they've been finding some
challenges to adjust to that leg.

1125
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,270
I think he, in a way,

1126
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,010
you have two ways that simplify because
if you get somebody in a footlocker leg

1127
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,680
lock there, we go in at the same time.

1128
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:05,680
You complicate cause you see a lot of
scramble now and a lot of injuries as

1129
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:11,150
evidenced the same. People don't want
attack. Then it's a position that you,

1130
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,860
some is going to get hurt. Yeah, but I'm,

1131
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:18,310
I'm [inaudible] that development
and devolution of the,

1132
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,850
the grappling world and
I think it's amazing.

1133
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,610
It's sooner or later somebody is going
to find ways to protect better and better

1134
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:29,180
and better and better that
will force people to move on.

1135
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,050
But you seen that I think now with a
lot of the leg lock guys against each

1136
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:33,351
other.

1137
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:37,450
They kind of stalemate and he seen them
winning by rear naked choke or Armbar.

1138
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,440
Again, they're not using the leg locks
against each other. They realize like,

1139
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:46,190
man, he knows as much as I do
now. I need more than that. Yeah,

1140
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:49,550
they're using them to sweep or they
use them to set up other things.

1141
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:53,390
They're trying to exploit other holes
like maybe they concentrate too much on

1142
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:56,690
leg block so then they, they're
open to armbars or chokes.

1143
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:01,550
I remember when when I learned in the
beginning and we have foot lock as the

1144
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:03,740
last resource,

1145
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,090
let's see him fighting the guy
and I man not able to submit him.

1146
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,460
I'm going to foot lock him.

1147
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,130
That's how we used to have in the 80s
where your Hail Mary lock is, okay,

1148
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:17,730
this is my deadly weapon. If
everything that I do is not working,

1149
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,350
I'm going to foot lock him. Today's
the opposite. My first shot his foot,

1150
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:25,730
lock him all the way. It's not
working. I'm going to choke him. Yeah.

1151
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,830
You see so few foot locks in
MMA. It's interesting, right?

1152
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,860
You see like so few figure four foot
locks because the danger also for you to

1153
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:39,060
get hit yeah. That sometimes when
you do the foot lock your face,

1154
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,110
your arms are both around the land.

1155
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:44,610
You can get a not defending exactly.

1156
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:47,520
What do you think about combat
Jujitsu at his new invention?

1157
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:53,540
Men I think is a way for people to step
up to reality and then this thin and

1158
01:11:53,911 --> 01:11:57,750
some guys make a decision to know what
I might be able to go and do MMA too.

1159
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:01,680
But that's the real world.
Yeah. If you find somebody,

1160
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:03,750
that's exactly what's
going to happen. Right.

1161
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,590
And making people more aware of, okay,

1162
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:11,220
my Jujitsu for Jujitsu sport only,

1163
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:15,240
this is not gonna work there. Well
for this kind of, as you sheets,

1164
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,630
I have now to be aware of
more of my real fight. Yeah.

1165
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:25,070
And I think it will help more devolution
of that sport of Jujitsu to transition

1166
01:12:26,251 --> 01:12:28,740
to MMA for people to show
what combat Jujitsu is.

1167
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:33,741
Eddie Bravo invented a way where you do
Jujitsu with slaps on the ground and uh,

1168
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:38,220
you, you would think it's just, Oh, it's
a slap. But no, a palm strike really.

1169
01:12:38,221 --> 01:12:41,410
I mean you really can hit someone very,
very hard with your palms. I mean,

1170
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,730
I can do that with my hand on a table
and it doesn't hurt my hand at all.

1171
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:47,940
But if I did that with my knuckles it
would really hurt. So they're there.

1172
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:50,270
They can smack the shit
out of each other. We,

1173
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:55,460
we still do that after we train Jujitsu
is to call in Portuguese that top area

1174
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,820
second slap each other after
the train. No shirts. Yes.

1175
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:04,620
And we used to train like that in Brazil.
Oh really? Yes. To be ready again.

1176
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:08,310
We have no tournaments. I me
after the train, let's see.

1177
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:10,830
And we stand in front of each
other and open hands and,

1178
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:16,160
and we go slap each other, make sure I
get slapped in the face. But on the end,

1179
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:16,610
the train,

1180
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:21,330
you have marks all over your body and
it still shake your brother's hand.

1181
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:25,600
I love you, but y'all
over mess. Are you still,

1182
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,510
you still lift weights? Yes, I do. How
often do you do that? Two days a week.

1183
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:35,100
Two days a week. But I, but I like
to run a lie like outdoors. Yeah.

1184
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:38,310
I run three, four days a week and
usually when you run in trails,

1185
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,910
I did try my how now it's
too hot. I don't know.

1186
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:45,270
Unless you go early in the
mornings. I go early in the morning,

1187
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:47,790
very early in the morning. It was,
it was hot this morning when I went.

1188
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,820
It's very hot right now,
but I like it there.

1189
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:56,210
I think I want to challenge my body hours
to bring the best off the resistance

1190
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:57,180
cause I,

1191
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:02,180
I think I don't like to go and run
the same street over and over again.

1192
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,940
Somehow. Your body rate
again just to that right.

1193
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:09,840
I'm always trying to find
different, the trays. Yes.

1194
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:14,800
This ways I gonna fight you on changes
up and down the whole time. Yeah.

1195
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,450
And, but it's something
to [inaudible] dish,

1196
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:21,070
which is my excuse to do all of this.

1197
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:25,030
I want to go and do better or
my students are getting harder.

1198
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,450
How can I switch that to
make not their heart, right.

1199
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,960
I gotta do a little bit
more than I was doing now.

1200
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:35,920
How do you mix up your weightlifting
training with your Jujitsu training?

1201
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:39,160
Do you do it in the morning and then
train at night or do you do it after you

1202
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:39,994
train?

1203
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,310
Right now I'm doing before
teaching to the train.

1204
01:14:45,311 --> 01:14:47,820
My intension is when I
show up to the academy,

1205
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:52,950
I'm already tired physically so that
when you do train you can be relaxed.

1206
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:58,360
And just this way, my challenge
is because I'm physically tired,

1207
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:03,790
I make the level of my students higher
cause they have a lot of energy and

1208
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:04,624
they're good too.

1209
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:10,060
It makes more challenge for myself to
train with them cause I don't have,

1210
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,590
okay I manage now I have to purely use
the techniques. There's usually two.

1211
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:18,370
The techniques has, must be
on time. I intend to do that,

1212
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:23,371
get their tired to make a good training
for me and that's what I've been doing.

1213
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:28,150
I show up and they don't know and
hey, let's go and train. Then. Uh,

1214
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,740
I can tell them, man, I should
rest before train this guy today.

1215
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:35,510
I don't know if he's
getting there good until ty,

1216
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,520
everything's at the same time next
week. I'm not going to do that again.

1217
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:43,020
So when you do it, uh, twice a week,
how do you mix it up? Like what,

1218
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,140
what kind of training you're doing?

1219
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:49,090
I work on one one day legs and lower
poverty. And that's not the day.

1220
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:53,110
Upper body of hours. Yes. Yeah.
So it's just to make it stronger,

1221
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:58,140
just to keep the joints healthy and
evidently fuel the muscles I think is

1222
01:15:58,271 --> 01:16:03,250
important for its like
preventing injuries. Yeah,
that's the main thing. Yeah.

1223
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,760
And I'd be using a lot the, I don't
EC stuff. Remember the guy from the,

1224
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:08,050
I don't ag, he sent it to me.

1225
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:11,470
The equipment I'm using that
it's amazing they using that.

1226
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:15,370
It is a recommended issue shoe.
Two guys for Jujitsu regards, it's,

1227
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:20,160
some are going get it man.
It's incredible. Or You
said something to me once,

1228
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,470
I'll never forget it. Go.
Never Trust. You're nice to do.

1229
01:16:23,471 --> 01:16:28,471
Not Fall out as strong as to get to the,

1230
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:31,440
to the neck. You have to
be very aware of stuff.

1231
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:36,320
Seeing little flashes after
that gets dark. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1232
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,930
We go, oh, I'm DC. No, you're
about to go out. My friends

1233
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:45,000
trust your neck. Never
Trust your neck. Yeah.

1234
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,980
But at least you could train it safely.

1235
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:50,470
Now with the iron neck there was always
a bunch of different ways where people

1236
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:52,960
trained that were questionable.

1237
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:55,270
Like there's a lot of people that
don't believe in neck bridges.

1238
01:16:55,271 --> 01:16:58,150
They said it's actually kind
of dangerous and our neck is,

1239
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:03,160
if you see the spine is so sensitive
you got gotta be careful and work.

1240
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:07,450
Your neck issues you treat on, you
use our heads on the ground base.

1241
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:08,350
Our bottle never.

1242
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:13,520
I think that our neck is again is the
maintenance of having your neck or well

1243
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:17,150
around because that spin,
anything that you do man,

1244
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:21,350
you work every angle of your neck.
Yeah. And I do a very simple exercise.

1245
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:26,330
I have ds attaching to a bar and
go forward and turn sideways there.

1246
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:30,020
She knew the movement. Do
you do the Ray Charles very,

1247
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,360
very slowly have that bungee that
keeps more or less nation? Yes.

1248
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:40,130
Yeah, that's right side where man I love
that machine or that piece of training.

1249
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,250
It was a a great addition
to all the exercise.

1250
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:47,030
Thanks to the guys cause it's
really, really helpful. Yeah.

1251
01:17:47,031 --> 01:17:48,990
I recommend it to everybody. It's just,

1252
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,170
and for fighters that get hit in the head,

1253
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:54,890
it's so important to have a
strong neck to resist the impact.

1254
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:58,640
Your socks will be the
muscles around this way.

1255
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:00,230
The muscles take the first hit.

1256
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,830
Just like you're talking about building
strength around your joints by lifting

1257
01:18:03,831 --> 01:18:06,530
weights and protect actually
the same thing. Exactly.

1258
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:11,410
So are you doing like basic stuff like
curls and dips and very busy going in

1259
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,300
difference different than the time
that you're training for competition,

1260
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:18,300
which is inhabited a lot.
Explosions in this way.

1261
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:21,290
Just trying to maintain and everything
else I do. And she's used to,

1262
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:24,800
some days I train pushing
more Sundays or pushing less.

1263
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,870
Some days I just train in defense
and they say training. Okay,

1264
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:31,840
I gotta finish everybody today or I got
amount of bar today. You kind of found,

1265
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:36,710
make your training, um, a goal
for your training this way.

1266
01:18:36,711 --> 01:18:39,140
Always excited to do it right. You know,

1267
01:18:39,141 --> 01:18:41,510
and not having the same thing every day.

1268
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,940
Now I select OK to them
when sweep everybody.

1269
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,860
Then I pull guard and keep playing guys
my go sweep and some guys I'm very hard

1270
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:51,440
to sweep another day I just went amount.

1271
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:56,150
I can only finish people from the mount
and that mean you kind of make different

1272
01:18:56,151 --> 01:19:00,110
goals and I think that
keeps you and again,

1273
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:04,970
my students there, it's usually
just fun. Come on. Sure. It's fun.

1274
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,490
You never know what's going
to happen, right? It sells.

1275
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:09,080
I challenge you goes like, oh man.

1276
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,870
Then you realize I should sleep two
hours extra. I'm tired now for sure.

1277
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,660
If you really want to find out where
your body's at, go train home man.

1278
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:22,580
Why I'm so sore. I don't know. And it's
usually to test you in every level.

1279
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:27,380
Now what about nutrition? I grew up um,

1280
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,180
did you follow crazy diet?

1281
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:33,860
I grew up doing the grace of diet with
my uncle Carlos. Could you explain that?

1282
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:39,170
Basically men, the dye to be the
foods that you combined, right?

1283
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:42,920
Some foods. When you make that
combination you're not going to get what?

1284
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:47,480
Expecting from the food and that's
how we learn. I eat a lot of fruits,

1285
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,010
lots. I don't drink juices
in where I make my own juice.

1286
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:57,740
That's the only way you can have
a proof that is actual fresh,

1287
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:02,450
fresh and juice. Right. And if
you then very rarely I eat meat,

1288
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:09,050
fish and chicken and a Turkey more
often than red meats. I remember,

1289
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,830
I don't remember last time. It's been
awhile, but it's basically fruits.

1290
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:17,070
He's my, I love it.
But Pie in the morning,

1291
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:21,630
cream cheese and honey and late at night,

1292
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:24,000
sometimes watermelon juice in Tapioca.

1293
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,370
I don't know if people know what Tapioca
is. Sure, yeah. Tapioca pudding. Yeah.

1294
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,450
Not the pudding. You make.
Looks like a Tortilla.

1295
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:34,610
You make that in a pan and it's really
healthy. Yeah, I was show you how to do.

1296
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,660
Yeah, it's, it's like a powder.

1297
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:40,920
It's like a brute and they
shredded the roots in 'em and you,

1298
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,240
you put in a,

1299
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,840
in a pan and as the paint gets hit
it looks like a Tortilla and Dan's,

1300
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,180
then you put a cream cheese and it's
thousands times health in any kind of

1301
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:53,520
breads. You've eaten a life. Hmm.

1302
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,850
I mean things that are good for your body,

1303
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,650
but basically fruits are
my, my main thing. Well,

1304
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:03,900
you're always burning off so
much energy. Let's do the things.

1305
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,790
Jujitsu burns off so much energy and if
it ended the lifestyle you have, you,

1306
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,700
you burn more than you eat, you're
gonna keep your weight. Four,

1307
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,430
I weight the same painful in the
past 10 years, the same weight.

1308
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:19,440
Go up two pounds, go down two pounds,
three pounds, go down five pounds.

1309
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:24,270
You take any supplements
I take. Uh, I take Maca,

1310
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:29,330
tumeric pounder and mixing all those juice
that I make as a more like preventive

1311
01:21:29,861 --> 01:21:33,090
things. And if it denti learn,

1312
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:37,200
sometimes I'm going to train
harder tomorrow, I'm going
to eat some carbs today.

1313
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,230
The carbs will become a
lot of energy tomorrow.

1314
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:44,130
My training and you basically little
things that you learn. But for me,

1315
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:47,790
the main thing is to stay
healthy. Right? There we go.

1316
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:52,590
I don't remember last time we sick. No,
really? I don't remember this time. Wow.

1317
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:56,310
People have headaches. Why have a
headache many ways or have a headache?

1318
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,810
You're not drinking enough water or
you need too much sugar on that mean

1319
01:21:59,811 --> 01:22:02,430
something that you're consuming
right now gives you headache.

1320
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,850
And what about a post workout recovery?

1321
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:09,630
Do you use sauna or ice bath or
anything, anything like that? Man,

1322
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:14,630
the sound is a must. Yeah, I mean I love
it. I see you put a lot of [inaudible].

1323
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:19,350
It's a must so eliminates so much and
your body's always pure and clean.

1324
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,800
I love my apps on South Jacuzzi.

1325
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:27,690
Therefore I dunno an hour and
just forget about life. Yeah,

1326
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:33,000
she was brand new after then you have a
lot of things that you should do as to

1327
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:38,001
keep the longevity of us to be able
to do what we want to do and that stay

1328
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,140
healthy. It's a main thing. You
stay hiking, stay close to nature,

1329
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:47,100
brief trying to breathe good
air. It's pretty hot in la, but

1330
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,900
yeah, you go up in the mountains,
man. You feel like, Whoa,

1331
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,760
it's even in your mind.

1332
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:58,910
You already changed the whole thing of
a then that's basically stay healthy.

1333
01:22:59,371 --> 01:23:02,070
I, how can I teach what?
Tell my students to do.

1334
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:06,280
Some people I'm not doing right.
It's like you go to the gym,

1335
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:09,940
have two different coaches, one that
looks healthy and the one that is,

1336
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,460
it's pretty big. Which
one are you going to pick?

1337
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,270
The one that knows how to
get the way he is. Yeah.

1338
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:20,520
When you see guys that start letting
themselves go and getting big and fat and

1339
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:24,130
it's like, it's very
disappointing. Yes, it is.

1340
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:29,050
I give a hard time to a lot of people
that I know, friends that that goes a man.

1341
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,570
It's not what you say is what you've
been doing. Yeah. And now, Oh,

1342
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:38,590
don't do this. Then you're doing what
kind of a tomorrow by an example.

1343
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:43,720
Yeah. People get tired. They
get lazy. Uh, yes, but man,

1344
01:23:43,721 --> 01:23:44,440
you,

1345
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:49,000
you chose the wrong job to be lazy
and now you're martial artist.

1346
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,720
You can be lazy as a
martial artist right now,

1347
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:56,320
do something to seen in the desk and
don't do nothing then that's I understand.

1348
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,370
But uh, you're doing the martial
arts and you get lazy. Now he can't.

1349
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,240
You become in a way, an
example for a lot of people.

1350
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:09,430
And that's why I make people do
what you do. Yeah, there's no,

1351
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:12,280
it's not an option. It's not an
option to become [inaudible] at all.

1352
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,650
And as soon as I see
someone who is doing that,

1353
01:24:14,651 --> 01:24:19,040
who becomes lazy and becomes
fat, I just don't, it's,

1354
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,600
it's unfortunate. You know,
it's unfortunate you're
making a mistake. I try,

1355
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:26,680
I try to understand and sometimes
I don't. I said, look man, again,

1356
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,180
you chose the wrong line
of work. Yeah, they, me,

1357
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:33,070
you're telling me that you don't like
what you do cause you feel like what you

1358
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:35,560
do, you're not going to be
the way you are right now.

1359
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:39,070
And it's a Juju to working for you now,

1360
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,590
which should be working
right now more than ever.

1361
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:44,590
Well that's one of the great
things about you and my brothers.

1362
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:49,420
You've always been a great example and
you've always been a person who leads by

1363
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:51,700
example by the way, the things you say,

1364
01:24:51,701 --> 01:24:54,940
but more importantly by
the things you do for sure.

1365
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,140
And I know that a lot of in a,

1366
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:02,250
I think we learned through the years
that what you say and what you do will

1367
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:06,840
affect a lot of people out there and
especially now in the social media,

1368
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:11,800
get so many great inputs for people that
I have no idea who they are. Like, oh,

1369
01:25:11,801 --> 01:25:13,750
thank you for this. Thank you for that.

1370
01:25:13,751 --> 01:25:16,960
Thank you for you to put a good quote
out there. I think those little things,

1371
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,233
uh,

1372
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:22,510
have an impact in hours
in a lot of people and a,

1373
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:25,900
I can't forget that and
man, I love what I do.

1374
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,850
I never had that job.

1375
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:33,280
They have a works and now I train
Jujitsu and the amazing things,

1376
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:38,080
they give me money to lose you
shit. They pay me to do this.

1377
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,810
Like I can't be. Thank you. Then
they know never had it. You,

1378
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:46,830
you have a great life. You
make friends everyday. Yeah.

1379
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,380
And now you make friends
every day and you kind of,

1380
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:54,910
I able now to help people just
with something that you say.

1381
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:56,710
Um,

1382
01:25:56,710 --> 01:26:00,760
sometimes I have a higher belt students
or even lower belt students that show up

1383
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:05,750
for training. And I learned that
with one store. My uncle told me

1384
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:12,170
he, Uncle Carl is he and he
used to leave it there. And uh,

1385
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:17,330
and uh, back in those days he observed
a lot of things in uh, he has, uh,

1386
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:22,640
it was a time that in braze you have
a lot of cock fighters and he has his

1387
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:25,940
regular rooster. Then he said, man,

1388
01:26:25,941 --> 01:26:29,580
I'm going to make him money
if he's rooster. I said, okay,

1389
01:26:29,581 --> 01:26:34,490
and I'm going to see how long
the rooster actually fights.

1390
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:39,290
And when I noticed the time, how long
he fights, every time he's fighting,

1391
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:41,020
I'm going to get the
real, the cock fight it,

1392
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:44,030
stop moving him out and the
rooster think he's winning.

1393
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,770
He's been doing that for awhile.

1394
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:50,450
Then he realized the rooster can only
stay in the fight for two minutes.

1395
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,190
After two minutes he run.

1396
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,040
Then he goes to arena and challenge
anybody there with his rooster.

1397
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:00,620
It was not made for fight to fight in one,

1398
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:03,530
therefore one minutes
and they bet the money.

1399
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,230
And for one minute the
rooster get beat up,

1400
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:10,790
but fought for one minutes did not run.
Then one minute up he got his rooster.

1401
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,830
Give me them. Oh let it fights and
now I said one minute, the point was,

1402
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:20,600
I have guys that come to my school and
they're not having a good day and I can't

1403
01:27:20,601 --> 01:27:25,601
tell that by looking to their face and
I'm start training them and I let them

1404
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:30,890
give me a hard time and I go like,
man, what's wrong with you today?

1405
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:35,920
You kicked my butt today and I can see
the change that made than that person.

1406
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:43,070
And I use that to train a lot of
my students. I'll give one example.

1407
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:47,450
Our friend Eddie, when he was, before
he fired Tyler, when he called me in,

1408
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:52,480
he wasn't in the best of his game and
I know his could be an amazing on the

1409
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:57,230
beginning, prohibits anybody to
give him a hard time or anything.

1410
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:01,730
As he started building up. Then towards
the end the say man kick his butt.

1411
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:05,720
He was so good and
confident. After few months,

1412
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:10,310
nobody could even get close to the
nothing to him. Said, man, you ready?

1413
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,930
You ready for a fight?
But on the beginning,

1414
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:17,210
this was my way to work out his
psychological to build him up.

1415
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,930
He wasn't in the best shape.
He was in training, said no,

1416
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:24,140
you can't train to fish tune
as everybody does what you do.

1417
01:28:24,141 --> 01:28:26,090
You're going to find somebody
who doesn't do what you do.

1418
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,550
When a train of people that
do what the other guy do.

1419
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:31,370
And here we are in three months,

1420
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,540
we've made him a monster and he
did what he did in his fight.

1421
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:41,020
We're using the same idea of my uncle
telling me his story to make you start

1422
01:28:41,451 --> 01:28:44,720
believing and towards the end
that other guys, man get him.

1423
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:49,840
Nobody could get even close. Isn't that
funny? How much of it is psychological?

1424
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,520
Cause when you're are tired
but you start doing well,

1425
01:28:52,521 --> 01:28:56,900
all of a sudden you have energy. It's
all in your mind. And one of the things,

1426
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,960
uh, I tried to remember
who said that in uh,

1427
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,270
we grew up in the fighting world.

1428
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:09,060
Lauer's seeing summarized will she do in
the war and have a lot of good quotes.

1429
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:14,680
And one of them was, um, whenever we
think you're tired, your opponent is debt.

1430
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,170
I was remember that until
today. I remember a yellow belt.

1431
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,290
One of my cousins told me
that, man, when you're tired,

1432
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,940
you're pointing these dead that keeps
you going. Your opponent is dead,

1433
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,550
he's dead and he's, he's
way more tired than you are.

1434
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:33,540
That's the time you have to push
instead of trying to conserve. No.

1435
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:38,250
Now push for what? If you're tired and
he's not. This is, this is the mindset.

1436
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:42,570
Then Jujitsu gives you the tools
but makes you never give up.

1437
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:47,040
You can be tired and we all going to
be tying the fight, that's for sure,

1438
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,540
but you not going to give up.

1439
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:52,320
How important do you think it is to do
additional conditioning other than just

1440
01:29:52,321 --> 01:29:53,250
taking classes?

1441
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,700
If you want to go and participate in a,

1442
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:02,190
in an event that tournament
training, dishes you to train today,

1443
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:06,510
you're going to do well. If
you want to win the tournament,

1444
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:10,620
then you have to do more.
You have to work out.

1445
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:14,550
You have to do your physical because
that hour involves if your mindset,

1446
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,450
a lot of people they get nervous
because they feel that already.

1447
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:23,900
Do you ever think that you'll have a
Jujitsu school that also has weights and

1448
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:29,090
cardio equipment and things like that
and maybe even classes to help supplement

1449
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,390
Jujitsu training?

1450
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:36,140
I think I'll be a dream school for sure
because a lot of people do not realize

1451
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:40,380
how beneficial that would be
for them in general. Right?

1452
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,510
Not only for Jujitsu because

1453
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:48,960
I keep telling people now is put them in
their minds for them to get better and

1454
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:53,250
believe in themselves, but when they do,
those things are challenged themselves.

1455
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,810
If you challenge yourself every day,

1456
01:30:54,811 --> 01:30:57,210
you're going to bring the
best of you every day.

1457
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,820
You should do the same thing every day.
You already know what's going to happen.

1458
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,560
I never challenge a shelf. You're going
to bring something better and better.

1459
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,890
You're going to grow more inciting
and stop believing so much more.

1460
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:11,520
That capability that you have, that
would be a dream school. I don't know.

1461
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:15,480
Any school that has like
a real comprehensive gym
strength and conditioning gym

1462
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:18,060
attached to a Jujitsu school to school.

1463
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:22,410
I don't know any martial art MMA
places do and they may places. Yeah,

1464
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:24,260
like all those big gyms. Yeah,

1465
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:29,750
but a lot of things like sometimes someone
may ask me and my thought above was

1466
01:31:31,261 --> 01:31:31,531
this,

1467
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:36,531
when you go to MMA gym and I
think today the specific for MMA,

1468
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:41,910
I mean they train enough grappling for
MMA. They train enough punching for MMA,

1469
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:46,350
which is amazing, but it's like
you're going to a hospital,

1470
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,960
you go, they have a general doctor,

1471
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:54,470
but if you need a specialist and got to
go to the school that is specific for

1472
01:31:55,470 --> 01:32:00,470
that purpose striking or she she to
even though now the biggest ones,

1473
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:06,370
Jim's out there, they have
the best instructors of
anything all together. Right,

1474
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:10,710
like American top team, right?
They have, yeah. Ricardo Laborio,

1475
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,770
they had the best grappling
culture could have the wrestling,

1476
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,680
but not all the schools are like
that. Right. That's a rare one.

1477
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,920
It's very challenging because of sometimes
the ego among the instructors shore

1478
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,570
who the fight is going
to listen to, right?

1479
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,990
You get a lot of Jujitsu fighters and
start training with strike and coach and

1480
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:31,390
the striking coach has them
convinced that they're a Stryker.

1481
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:36,550
And I think the biggest challenge for the
MMA guys is when is the right time for

1482
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,510
me to transition from standing to
the ground or the ground to standing.

1483
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:45,310
And that's the ones that find
the right momentum to do that.

1484
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,500
They're the ones that are winning.
And I know my uncle Hila said,

1485
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:54,160
man, sooner or later they're going
to get your number. I mean that's,

1486
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:59,310
they made me world very hard for it to
retire it without and when is the right

1487
01:32:59,591 --> 01:33:03,700
time to retire? Right? Yeah.
It's hard to figure out for many,

1488
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:05,890
many fighters now, it's
a lot of the things,

1489
01:33:05,891 --> 01:33:10,470
maybe money issues or maybe I
didn't want to give up being famous.

1490
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:15,430
A lot of things involve when I
should retire. Like now. Well,

1491
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:20,110
we've been around for a long time and
we've seen a lot of fighters fight long

1492
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:24,280
past where they should have retired.
That's when they can get hurt really bad.

1493
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:28,180
Yeah. And see that's when
the, the injury can be

1494
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:33,060
resting, be with him for a
very long time. Yeah. It's,

1495
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,450
does it bother you when you see that?

1496
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:38,980
Like particularly like older fighters
getting knocked out? Man, for me,

1497
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:42,100
I think the people surround
them should be say, hey, yeah,

1498
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:46,720
enough is enough to know.
And um, I hope all of them,

1499
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:48,970
and I think the way these two days,

1500
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:53,680
everyone is able to make good for their
lives with say enough money that they

1501
01:33:53,681 --> 01:33:56,760
can live well. Not all
of them are fortunate.

1502
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:59,920
That's why they have to keep
fighting as much as they can.

1503
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,530
But it's a very challenging, I think he's,

1504
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:06,790
I'll have to understand his a short
career. You don't have 20 years fighting.

1505
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:10,360
You have to understand is
my body can take this much,

1506
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,700
but after a certain point, many in
you can get hurt really bad. Um,

1507
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:17,680
just so everybody knows on the wall,

1508
01:34:17,681 --> 01:34:22,681
the studio right there does John Jack
Machado's coral belt right there on that

1509
01:34:23,051 --> 01:34:27,730
wall in the studio. It's prominently,
man, you gave me that. I only made,

1510
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:32,080
I only made 10 of those. One of them
was right there. And my brother and I,

1511
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:35,680
all four, I gotta be for a
special person. Joe Hogan. Man,

1512
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:39,610
it's awesome. Well thank
you for everything man.

1513
01:34:39,611 --> 01:34:41,290
Thank you for teaching me Jujitsu.

1514
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:45,700
Thank you for being such a great leader
and a role model and just thanks for

1515
01:34:45,701 --> 01:34:48,100
being here brother. I really
appreciate you. So Pedro,

1516
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:52,330
thank you for having me here and now
I can. People don't keep asking, hey,

1517
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:55,930
why don't you go to seed, you're
holding your tongue SCG Haggadah time.

1518
01:34:55,931 --> 01:34:58,280
And I think it a great
pleasure for me to be here.

1519
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,030
Amazing to see the transformation.

1520
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:05,870
And I think in the mixed martial arts
world, in the martial arts world,

1521
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:11,240
how important was to have someone like
you that knows what you're talking about.

1522
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,680
Cause I remember the
first few days of UFC, uh,

1523
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:20,710
please UFC understand Joe Hogan was much
bigger than UFC and I think you've see

1524
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:25,730
reach out to a point like that to have
someone like you pushing and you have so

1525
01:35:25,731 --> 01:35:30,080
many people that loves you, that
follows you. And the UFC was,

1526
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:34,250
is your device of UFC and now, and don't
get me wrong, those guys out there,

1527
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:35,000
but uh,

1528
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,870
when you are talking and you have all
those may fights there is very different

1529
01:35:38,871 --> 01:35:41,180
than when you see the
other guys talking about,

1530
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:45,230
because I know the involvement that you
have in a martial arts and the knowledge

1531
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:48,020
that you have. And it's
way too good to be here.

1532
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:52,640
Men in all this specimen years
see the amazing journey to follow.

1533
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:55,250
You see you're getting
bigger and bigger and uh,

1534
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:58,340
be able to sit there from
the beginning is amazing.

1535
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,690
Well thank you. And I promise
I'll be training soon.

1536
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:05,740
Soon as his knee feels better, I'll

a brotherhood and sisterhood and that's

1553
01:37:02,471 --> 01:37:06,010
one of the best things about it is how,
how much it is like family over there.
