[theme music]

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.220
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. 
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.780
We've all come across that film that was either good or okay,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.140
but then the ending ruins everything.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.520
From "Into Darkness" to "War of the Worlds" to...

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.740
... yeah, every single "Iron Man" movie,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.820
the ending can often have a talent for taking several hours of our lives that were enjoyable,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.820
and suddenly making it feel like they were wasted.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.540
But why?

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.200
If two thirds of the movie are good, sometimes even more than that,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.500
why do we get so upset when 
a small percentage is bad?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.360
If we have a meal that's mostly good,
but might have a spice we don't like,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.420
we don't get too angry.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.480
If we look at a painting that moves us,
but might have one stroke that's a little off

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.440
we don't dismiss the whole thing as garbage.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.100
So why does the ending have such an impact on us?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.420
Why can it ruin what was, for the most part, perfectly fine?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.860
Without getting too much into spoiler territory,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.460
we should probably talk about some of the films that have what many consider awful endings,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.340
without actually giving the endings away.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.060
Some of the more notable ones, as I mentioned before,
are "Into Darkness" and "War of the Worlds",

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.640
but other ones a lot of people bring up recently
are "I Am Legend", "Amazing Spider-Man 2",

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.620
"The Number 23", "Ninth Gate", and "Now You See Me".

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.880
All of them have audiences going on and on about how they would have liked the film

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.280
if it hadn't been for the last few minutes.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.280
I'm actually a firm believer that 
"X-Men 3" wouldn't have been that bad a film

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.560
or at least on par with the others, if the ending actually went somewhere important.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.360
Instead of just, you know, sucked.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.300
A lot of characters are killed off, 
but if it led to somewhere meaningful,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.400
people probably would have accepted it and acknowledged a lot more of the cooler scenes.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.480
Arguably, some of the coolest out of 
the previous "X-Men" films.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.620
A good example of doing that right 
actually comes from another "X-Men" film.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.240
In a lot of ways, "Days of Future Past" 
actually does what "X-Men 3" did;

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.880
it kills off a lot of characters from the previous film, 
changes timelines from the comic,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.540
and puts characters in roles 
very different from their original intention.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.960
But it works in "Days of Future Past" 
because it amounted to something,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.280
something important, something huge.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.860
Because of this, people remember even more of the cool visuals and action sequences,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.660
where "X-Men 3"'s are overlooked.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.000
But not always forgotten.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.720
Even this clean slate still had Kelsey Grammer back,
arguably the best Beast,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.060
so even a sequel trying to retcon this movie

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.620
had to acknowledge there were some things that were really good.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.240
So even if a movie throws in a lot of cool stuff, oftentimes it just comes down to:

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.040
"What do you have to say?"

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.040
There's an alternate ending on 
the "Thank You for Smoking" DVD

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.080
that actually destroys everything the film had been building on.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.840
This ending would have transformed it from one of the greatest comedies ever written

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.460
to meaning absolute dick.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.960
Why? 
Because the film was about going all the way.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.340
Finally picking an ethical side
and sticking to it without tap dancing.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.960
It's like watching all of "Schindler's List" 
and at the very end somebody just says:

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.460
"Eh, maybe Hitler was right." 
And then rolled the credits.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.260
Everything would have meant nothing! 
And all from just one line.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.840
Spielberg obviously knew how to end this movie, but that hasn't always been the case with him.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.980
From "War of the Worlds" to "Lost World" to "Minority Report" to "A.I."

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.220
to even the movie that invented the blockbuster, "Jaws"...

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.840
Yeah, they brilliantly kept the shark a secret, building up what he looks like,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.080
but then, when they actually showed 
more and more of him,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.800
a lot of people weren't impressed 
the more they revealed.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.680
"The shark still looks fake."

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.260
But the interesting thing about Spielberg is half the time, he's pigeon-held it to these endings.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.940
"War of the Worlds", for example,
is technically how the book ends,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.480
but the other incarnations knew
to make a bigger deal out of it.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.220
This one forgets to have a climax, which is closer to the book but not the best for a movie.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.780
"A.I." is known as one of his worst endings,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.140
but he did it as a dedication 
to his friend, Stanley Kubrick,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.660
who, despite every writer telling Stanley that the ending sucked,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.760
still wanted it that way before he died,
so Spielberg did his best to honor his wishes.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.740
Who would have thought being too faithful
and understanding could work against a film?

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.900
Nevertheless, most of these movies were still hits,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.040
despite them leaving people scratching their heads 
at the endings.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.160
In fact, for all the films we bring up that have endings that ruin the movie,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.720
sometimes a bad ending doesn't even make a dent.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.380
Take "Superman", for example,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.500
arguably, the stupidest cop-out ending ever.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.600
Yet people still see this as the best "Superman" film,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.760
because everything else was so good.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.300
Even the emotion before the lame ending was genuinely powerful.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.960
"Return of the King" practically held us hostage
for the number of endings it had,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.300
but everything else was so huge and well done, and it was wrapping up three very long movies,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.460
that we allowed our asses going numb 
for these sometimes awkward moments.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.000
[makes an uneasy sound]
It's still creepy!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.660
People didn't like the Ewoks or Vader's reveal in "Return of the Jedi",

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.020
but they still thought it closed things out well enough.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.140
And even all the "Iron Man" movies, 
with their painfully botched villains in each film

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.840
still managed to be spectacular at the box office.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.140
So... What did these films do right 
to excuse the bad endings that these films didn't?

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.500
Well, maybe they got the spirit down.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.040
All the "Iron Man" movies have had bad final acts,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.980
but it's still Robert Downey Jr.'s incredible charisma 
at the center,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.200
and the faultiness of his character 
that drew us to like them in the first place.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.280
That is one of the elements that's always kept in check.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.380
You can say the same thing about "Superman", or "Star Wars", or "Lord of the Rings":

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.160
even though they get the final part wrong, it's still felt it was in the same vein

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.980
of what made it charming and likable to begin with.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.840
The ending of "A.I." is not the same feel as the opening.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.620
The ending of "Into Darkness" is 
an immediate disconnect from the rest of the film.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.560
But this isn't as surprising, seeing how a lot of bad endings nowadays come from a very similar place:

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.640
the "twist".

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.240
Years ago, when "The Sixth Sense" came out,
everyone was so blown away by the surprise ending

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.560
that they had to go back and see it again.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.620
Thus, people would go tell their friends
and then they would have to go see it twice.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.260
So not only were a ton of people going to see a movie, they were going to see it two times.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.460
Suddenly, a huge hit didn't need to have a lot of money, it needed a reason for you to come back

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.320
and watch it all over again.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.220
So tons of movies start to throw in twists even if they didn't require them at all.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.540
"Dark Knight Rises", "Remember Me", 
"Last Exorcism", "Secret Window",

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.860
there's too many to count.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.300
Even the guy that started this craze, Shyamalan,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.080
couldn't keep up with constantly forcing them into his stories, and his films began to suck.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.960
So movies that might have been "okay" or "passable"
were suddenly destroyed or made worse

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.060
by shoving in an unneeded element that 
ruins the way not only that you look at the ending,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.060
but the way you look at the entire film.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.740
Oh, that dumb surprise at the end is what's supposed to be going on throughout the entire story?

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.280
Well, that just makes the whole entire story lame then.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.080
So okay, if an ending can ruin a film,
is it possible an ending can save a film?

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.400
It's no secret I'm not a fan of "Jurassic World", but it's hard not to tell someone to go see it

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.840
based on that kick-ass climax,
especially fans of the other movies.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.840
"Usual Suspects" would have probably just been an okay crime thriller,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.100
but the ending turns it into a lot of people's favorite movie.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.340
One of the most interesting cases of this is "The Straight Story".

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.840
This film is purposefully relentless
in how slow and dull it is.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.600
The majority of the time, it's practically unbearable.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.720
But by the time the ending shows up, suddenly everything is made clear why it was so slow and dull,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.500
and it makes everything that you went through suddenly seem phenomenally important.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.500
The whole entire movie suddenly changes from bad to kind of brilliant.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.060
So for some films the ending is everything, but for others it barely makes a dent.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.860
How is that possible?

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.460
Well, the important thing to realize, 
especially focus group suits,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.520
is that while film-making is very technical and precise,
film-watching isn't.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.740
The experience in viewing a movie
isn't measurements or mathematics,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.220
as much as many executives wish it was.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.220
It's entirely emotional.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.520
You want to make a connection with these characters, feel like you're in their spot,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.560
and discover something important or interesting with them.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.900
They seem real when this happens,
and just like real people in your life,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.240
they can piss you off and leave you angry.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.180
Everyone has a friend that you love,
but can sometimes push you a little too far.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.280
Many friendships have been broken
because they were pushed beyond

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.060
what they thought was trustworthy.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.580
Movies, in a strange way, are a form of trust.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.880
You're taking a gamble, spending hours of your time and money

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.920
on something declaring it's going to 
make a connection with you.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.300
If the connection is bad, 
then the whole movie is bad,

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.040
but if the connection is good, but then suddenly can't deliver in its most important moment,

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.820
we feel like that trust has been betrayed.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.280
Sometimes, that's even worse than 
a movie that's bad all the way through.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.500
We identified with you, movie,
we thought you got us.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.540
You took us to an emotional place
we didn't know existed.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.540
And now you throw something at us
that doesn't seem like you at all?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.600
What happened? 
I thought you were cool!

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.180
Much like a friendship, all the wonderful moments you spent together

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.840
can be easily forgotten 
because of one terrible choice.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.700
That's why so many entertainers use 
the phrase "always leave them wanting more",

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.580
because it's the last emotion
they usually remember.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.100
Now does that make it right that we should dismiss all the good stuff that they gave us?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.460
Well, it depends on the viewer.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.580
Again, like a person, it's all about 
the emotional connection you have.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.920
I can overlook the lame ending of "Last Exorcism", but a lot of folks can't.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.960
I think the ending of "Into Darkness" ruins everything, but some people don't mind.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.040
Everybody is going to have a different acceptability of what's fulfilling and what leaves you lacking.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.440
Our memories especially tend to put 
the most value in the last major thing we went through

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.260
even though many other major things
might have happened.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.320
So, can an ending ruin a film?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.520
Absolutely!
And there's good reasons why.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.300
But that doesn't mean 
every film works that way.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.460
A movie can have a bad ending, but maybe it wasn't bad enough to overshadow the good.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.200
An ending can even change 
the way you look at everything,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.960
teaching you that sometimes it really is important to stay and hear everything someone has to say.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.320
It depends on the person and it depends on the movie.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.720
But one thing's for sure:

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.100
a movie is never truly over until it's over.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.660
"The only thing that matters
is the ending."

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.020
Anyway, what fun is it to talk about 
a movie that only has a bad ending?

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.540
It's time to return to the movies that suck all the way through.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.040
[thud]

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.740
[ominous sound]

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.680
Fine. At least this time I don't have to review it

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.360
with a whiny, obnoxious, pain in the a... just zoom out, you know he's here.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.820
What the hell?! I had a cool entrance planned!

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.300
It was a close-up! Clearly you were gonna be in the next shot.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.420
Well, at least it's only the two of us
doing the review.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.520
Yeah, just you, me, and... is it me or is that light looking a little suspicious?

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.320
No, I'm not!

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.040
[theme music]

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.620
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout-out.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.900
This week we are doing "RedRover.org".

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.140
Founded in 1987, the mission of Red Rover is to bring animals out of crisis

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:44.040
and strengthen the bond between people and animals through emergency sheltering, disaster relief services,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.360
financial assistance, and education.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.340
Red Rover accomplishes its mission by engaging volunteers and supporters,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.700
collaborating with others, and maximising the use of online technology.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:00.140
They are about engagement, not only with each other, but also side by side with animal professionals,

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.020
animal groups, local officials, law enforcement, media, and schools.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.640
You see these little animals, you can't help but say: "How can I help them?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.040
How can I make them the best that they can be?"

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.280
Well, if you go to their site (RedRover.org)
or their YouTube channel

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.940
you can see they're not only helping these animals but they're helping a lot of people too.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.340
This is a wonderful organization,
definitely worth checking out.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.160
So definitely go, take a look,
and see how you can lend a paw.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:31.040
