00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.819
Well I was spending time with the Air Force
because I was interested in writing about

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.629
the future of warfare in space.

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.209
And most people don’t realize but we have
an Air Force Space Command and we have a United

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.450
States Space Command.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.029
This sounds like something out of science
fiction but we have them and we have them

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.529
because someday we’re planning to use laser
beams and directed energy weapons in space

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.029
to attack enemy satellites.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.329
So I was spending time with the Air Force
Space Command visiting bases, looking at all

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.180
this new high tech weaponry and the guys who
I was hanging out with started telling me

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.469
stories of the Cold War.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.000
Many of them had served as launch officers
in intercontinental ballistic missile control

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.430
centers during the Cold War.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.930
And it was a natural career path.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.879
If you knew a lot about missiles to go into
the Space Command, and they told me some extraordinary

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.219
stories about accidents involving our nuclear
weapons that I just had never heard before.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.610
And one of the stories that they told really
stuck in my mind and it was the story of an

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.690
accident in Damascus, Arkansas in September
of 1980.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.900
And it just so happens that, you know, we’re
doing this interview on September 18 and it

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.110
was on September 18, 1980 that this accident
happened.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.460
There were workers working in a missile silo
doing routine maintenance, the kind of thing

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.140
that, you know, they did all the time without
thinking about it.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.140
And the missile in the silo was a Titan II
missile, the biggest intercontinental ballistic

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.840
missile the United States ever built.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.820
It was taller than a ten story building.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.310
And while they were doing this routine maintenance
they were standing on a steel work platform

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.960
near the top of the missile.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.710
And one of the guys reached over with a wrench
handle with a socket on it to unscrew a pressure

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.420
cap on the missile and as he reached over
the socket fell off of the wrench handle and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.420
the socket fell in between this narrow gap
between the missile and the steel work platform

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.719
and it dropped about 80 feet, it hit the side
of the silo, ricocheted and then hit the missile.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:21.349
And when it hit the missile it tore a hole
in the missile’s metal skin and suddenly

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.719
thousands of gallons of highly flammable,
highly explosive rocket fuel were filling

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.860
the silo.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.060
And the Air Force literally had no idea what
to do.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.719
No accident like this had ever happened before
and they had to figure out what to do very

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:44.749
quickly because on top of this missile was
the most powerful nuclear warhead that the

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.640
United States ever built.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.890
This one warhead on this one missile had more
than three times the explosive force of all

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.870
the bombs used by all the armies in the Second
World War combined including both atomic bombs.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.159
So I was told this story by this Air Force
officer and I just – I became obsessed with

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.159
it.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.060
I couldn’t believe that I’d never heard
about this before.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.459
I couldn’t believe how close we came to
a major nuclear catastrophe that would have

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.450
consumed much of the state of Arkansas in
firestorms.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.090
So I started researching this one accident
and I thought I’d write a fairly short book,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.840
a minute by minute retelling of this one nuclear
accident.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.510
The more I learned, the more amazed I was
by how many other accidents there had been

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.900
and how many times the United States came
close to losing our own cities as a result

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.689
of accidents with our own nuclear weapons.

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:56.680
So that led me to interview bomber crew members,
missile crew members, nuclear weapon designers,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.090
nuclear weapon repairmen and to do a lot of
searches through the Freedom of Information

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.569
Act for top secret documents about these nuclear
accidents and about safety problems with our

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.340
weapons.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.100
And I got thousands of pages of documents
through the Freedom of Information Act and

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.670
I was sort of amazed by what some of them
said.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.440
One of the reasons that I’d never heard
about and most people had never heard about

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.690
this extraordinary accident in Damascus, Arkansas,
is there was incredible secrecy about our

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.830
nuclear weapons program and there was every
effort made to cover up accidents and near

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.110
disasters.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.700
In the case of the Damascus accident the Air
Force and the Pentagon claimed there was no

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.070
possibility that this warhead could have detonated
if the missile exploded.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.860
And I found that was just pure and simply
a lie.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.060
There had been a top secret study done just
a few years before the accident in Damascus

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.520
that had pointed out that this specific warhead
had safety problems and was liable to detonate

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.450
during an accident.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.630
So there was this effort to keep away from
the American people the truth about the dangers

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.960
and the risks of our nuclear arsenal because
there was a concern that if the American people

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.280
really understood some of the risks they wouldn’t
support our nuclear weapons policies.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.390
If you look at the official Pentagon list
of how many serious nuclear weapons accidents

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.680
we’ve had, the Pentagon refers to them as
broken arrows.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.840
That list includes I think 33 serious accidents.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.870
And when you look carefully at the list in
some of those broken arrows there was no possibility

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.120
of the weapon fully detonating because it
wasn’t fully assembled.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.560
And yet I got a document through the Freedom
of Information Act that listed more than a

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.380
thousand nuclear weapons accidents just from
1950 to 1968 and many of those were far more

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:09.500
serious and far more dangerous than some of
the ones on the Pentagon’s official list.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.720
So we don’t really know – and I don’t
know that we’ll ever know the actual number

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.960
of nuclear weapons accidents.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.190
But I feel confident in saying it’s a lot
larger number than 33 and that we were very,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.610
very lucky to make it out of the Cold War
without one of our weapons detonating either

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:35.030
in the United States or in Europe and destroying
a major city or destroying much of an entire

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.030
state.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.030
All manmade things are fallible and they’re
going to be fallible because we’re fallible.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.660
It’s impossible for human beings to create
anything that’s perfect and that will never

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.660
go wrong.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.670
So the question is how much risk are you willing
to accept.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.440
And those decisions weren’t made by the
American people debating well how much risk

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.750
are we willing to accept.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:06.860
They were made by Pentagon policy makers acting
largely in secret, a small number of people.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.930
Eventually they came to the conclusion that
the risk of an accidental detonation from

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.310
a nuclear weapon during an accident should
be one in a million.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.100
And that’s what they decided was an acceptable
risk.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.400
Now one in a million sounds like a very unlikely
occurrence but one in a million things happen

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.200
all the time.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.210
People who buy lottery tickets and win the
lottery are defying odds much greater than

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.960
one in a million.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.140
And one of the problems with probability with
all these odds – and this is just inherent

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.270
in what probability is – is that if the
odds of something happening are greater than

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.060
zero it means it’s going to happen.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.860
It’s going to happen at some point.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:01.770
It could be in a million years or it could
be next Thursday afternoon at 4 p.m.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:08.470
So all of these technologies, complex technological
systems that we create have risks and when

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.750
you talk about nuclear weapons you’re talking
about the most dangerous technology, the most

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.710
dangerous machines we’ve ever invented.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:22.670
And one of the aims of my book is to shed
light on this technology and involve the public

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:28.340
in this discussion and in these issues because
the consequences of a nuclear detonation would

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:35.630
just be unimaginably high, incredibly, worse
than any natural disaster the United States

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.439
has ever experienced.

00:08:37.439 --> 00:08:44.899
So I think time for this sort of strict secrecy
is now long past over and we need to know

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:50.760
and we need to be involved in the decision
making about these most deadly machines.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.310
When nuclear weapons were first being invented
this was such a new technology and such a

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:03.779
new science they really had no idea what some
of the safety implications would be.

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:10.519
And one of the themes of my book is that this
technology has always from the very beginning

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:15.399
been on the verge of slipping out of control.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:21.120
When they were about to test the first nuclear
device in July of 1945 in the desert of New

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.939
Mexico, they weren’t sure what would happen
when it detonated.

00:09:25.939 --> 00:09:30.249
And a lot of the Manhattan Project scientists
were worried that when the detonated this

00:09:30.249 --> 00:09:38.170
first nuclear device it would set the atmosphere
on fire and all living things on Earth would

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.709
be killed.

00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:45.670
Now they did calculations for about a year
to determine if the detonation of a nuclear

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:51.110
device would set the atmosphere on fire and
they felt fairly confident it wouldn’t.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.449
The physicist Enrico Fermi put the odds at
about one in ten.

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:58.759
And no one was sure if he was kidding or not.

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:04.639
But up until the detonation of that first
device no one could be positive.

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:09.579
And one of the physicists who did the calculations
on whether the atmosphere would catch on fire

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:15.960
was standing ten miles away from the detonation
when it occurred at five thirty in the morning.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.009
His name was Victor Weisskopf.

00:10:18.009 --> 00:10:24.220
And he saw this enormous fireball from a distance
of ten miles and he felt the heat getting

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.620
hotter and hotter on his face.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:33.959
And in that moment he was convinced the atmosphere
had caught on fire and that all life on Earth

00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:36.470
was about to be extinguished.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:46.110
Now he was wrong thankfully but that sense
of not quite being sure about this technology

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.800
has never gone away.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:55.329
And in the year 2014 there are still all kinds
of uncertainties about our ability to control

00:10:55.329 --> 00:11:02.870
this technology and to be able to prevent
catastrophic mistakes and accidents if something

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.610
goes wrong.
