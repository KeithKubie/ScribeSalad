00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We're going to continue our discussion about cancer and cancer  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
genetics today. One small point of clarification:  

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
apparently some people were confused about my out of balance scales here  

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
related to proliferation and cell death, pointing out that if there  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
were more proliferation and less cell death, then the scale should  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
shift this way instead of this way. That's an astute observation.  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It doesn't really matter which way the scales point really.  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The point was that they are out of balance, which is critical for  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
tumorigenesis. But anyway, in review,  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
last time I told you that cancer cells arise from normal cells over a  

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
series of events that relate to mutations in cellular genes.  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I gave you lots of evidence that things that cause cancer affect our  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
genes, and that our genes are disrupted in cancer cells.  

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I briefly mentioned that we have evidence for mutations in  

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
cellular genes in cancer cells. And I'll show you that again today.  

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But all of that brings us to the point of needing to know,  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
what are the genes?  What are the genes that are affected in cancer?  

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And this is important to help us understand how cancers arise,  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
so from a basic biomedical research point of view,  

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but also as we'll see next time, this information is actually very  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
useful in teaching us how to diagnose cancer more effectively or  

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
treat it more effectively. And I'll just show this slide,  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which I showed at the end again as a summary.  The cancer cells arise  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
from normal cells through the acquisition of  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
mutations in cellular genes through this process which we call clonal  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
evolution, more and more abnormal cells growing out from this  

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
accumulating mass of cells. And as we'll discuss today,  

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
these genes affect proliferation and cell death, this out of balance  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
scheme that I alluded to before, but not only these processes.  

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And I emphasize this because these other important processes get a  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
little bit of short shrift in our discussions.  But angiogenesis,  

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
this process of recruiting a new blood supply in cancer is very  

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
important, and also an important therapeutic target.  

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Cell motility, movement of cells, as I mentioned, it's important to  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
get cells away from the initial mass in the process of metastasis,  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and invasion likewise.  And several other processes are also affected in  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the course of tumorigenesis. So what are the genes?  

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
How do we know which genes are affected in cancer?  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Well, this set of experiments, really, has occurred over the course  

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
of arguably the last century. I'm trying to find the genes that  

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
are mutated in cancer cells. And many people point to landmark  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
experiments done in 1910 by an investigator at the Rockefeller  

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
University by the name of Payton Rauss.  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Payton Rauss was a virologist, studied viruses at Rockefeller  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
University.  And one day, a farmer from Long Island brought a  

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
prize-winning hen to this famous doctor at Rockefeller University in  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
New York because the hen was sick. Specifically, the hen had a big  

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
tumor in its breast muscle. And if you remember, that would  

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
mean the tumor was a sarcoma. And he wanted the doctor to cure his  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
prize-winning hen. Payton Rauss said,  

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
thank you, I'll do what I can, and then prominently killed the bird  

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in order to try to study what was giving rise to this tumor.  

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And he did a famous experiment.   

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
He took the tumor, ground it up, filtered it so that  

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
there were no cells present in the filtrate, and also used a small  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
enough pour filter so that bacteria, which were also known at that time,  

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
were removed.  So, he had a filtrate that contained no  

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
cells, no cancer cells, and no bacteria.  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And he took this and injected it into a non-tumor bearing bird.  

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And he observed over time that this bird developed a tumor.  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So he was able to demonstrate the transmissibility of something which  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
could cause cancer in an otherwise unaffected animal.  

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Because it wasn't cells and it wasn't bacteria,  

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
he suggested that it was a virus.   

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And it turned out to be, over the course of the next 50 years  

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
or so, the virus which was responsible for this disease was  

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
identified and given the name Rauss sarcoma virus,  

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
named after Payton Rauss. And the structure of this virus was  

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
also determined. It was found to be a retrovirus.  

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Retroviruses are in the class of HIV.  

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Their genomes are made of RNA, and they convert it to a DNA form.  

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We'll learn a little bit more about retroviruses in a few lectures.  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It was a retrovirus, and the structure of its genome was  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
determined eventually. And it was found to contain in its  

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
genome the genes that the virus required for replication.  

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And all viruses of this class has a very similar set of replication  

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
genes.  They need to produce more virus.  But at the end of the viral  

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
genome, at the extreme right side of the viral genome,  

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
there was another gene which was given the name sarc for sarcoma.  

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And it was termed an oncogene, onco for mass,  

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
oncology, cancer associated gene, sarc-oncogene.  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So, the virus it was found can cause cancer in birds by virtue of  

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
transferring into those cells a potent cancer associated gene called  

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
sarc.  And Payton Rauss went onto win the Nobel Prize,  

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
actually about 50 years later in the early 1960s for this work on the  

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
discovery of Rauss sarcoma virus. And it was extremely important.  

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But it was still a mystery as to where this cancer associated gene  

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
came from.  Where did the sarc gene originate?  Was it a viral gene  

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
which the virus used in some fashion to cause cells to proliferate,  

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
perhaps for its own replication? Or did it come from some other  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
source, some other origin? And here in the story entered two  

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
researchers, Mike Bishop and Harold Varmus.  Mike Bishop is now  

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
chancellor at UCSF. Harold Varmus is president at  

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Memorial Sloan-Kettering. They did this work at UCSF,  

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and I got quite familiar with it because I ended up working for  

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Harold Varmus as a Ph. . student.  This work was done  

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
before I got there in about 1975. And they set out to ask this  

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
question, what is the origin of this sarc-oncogene?  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Where did it come from? And what they were able to show was  

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that this Rauss sarcoma virus derived from a virus that was  

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
related to it called avian leucosis virus.  

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And avian leucosis virus had only those replication genes,  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the genes that the virus uses to produce more virus what they were  

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
able to show was that this avian leucosis virus,  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
when it infects cells, and here's a chicken cell,  

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and here's the nucleus of that cell, inside that cell are normal copies  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
of the sarc gene. They were able to show that the  

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
virus actually acquires this sarc-oncogene from the cells that it  

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
infects.  Now, it doesn't do that every time.  

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
In fact, most of the time, the virus just goes in and replicates  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and produces more virus.   

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
But rarely, and really it's very rarely, the virus actually acquires  

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
a piece of the sarc gene and sticks it into its own genome,  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
thereby creating --   

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
-- Rauss sarcoma virus, which has the structure that I  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
showed you above with the replication genes and  

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
the sarc oncogene. And this is done through a process  

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
called transduction, which is a form of recombination.  

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 The main point of this observation,  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and the really important point of this observation was this potent  

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
oncogene is present in chicken cells.  

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 The sarc is a cellular gene.  

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's not just a viral gene.  It's derived from host cells of chickens,  

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and it's not only in chickens.  It's in all vertebrates including  

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
humans. So, you all have a sarc gene in your  

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
cells, too.  And this was a really momentous observation.  

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And it led Bishop and Varmus to win the Nobel Prize back in 1989.  

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So, what I've just told you is that your cells carry a potent oncogene,  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
sarc.  So, why don't you all have sarcomas?  

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Anybody?  Remember,  

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
we are still being filmed. Anybody?  Yes, somebody's got their  

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
hand up, but I don't see them. Yes?  Almost right.  The gene is  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
not expressed properly, OK?  The virus has co-opted this  

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
gene and placed it into its own genome.  And now this gene is being  

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
regulated improperly. Maybe it's expressed too well or at  

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
the wrong time, or in the wrong cells.  

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And some combination of those things allows the gene to cause  

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
cancer in this setting, whereas when the gene is properly  

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
regulated, and the cells of chickens or in you, it's not cancer  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
associated.  It doesn't cause cancer in its state in the cellular genome.  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, this was extremely important, and as I said,  

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
led to the Nobel Prize for these guys.  RSV --  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 -- is what's called an acutely  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
transforming retrovirus, acutely transforming meaning that it  

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
can transform cells, turn them from normal to cancerous  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
quickly.  And as I said, it's a retrovirus.  We now know of  

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
many acutely transforming viruses of animals: mice,  

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
rats, chickens, turkeys, other things.  

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And from them, we have learned the identity of  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
about 50 or so oncogenes, all of which were derived from the  

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
host cell.  So, we know from this type of experiment  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
of many potential cancer associated genes.  Importantly,  

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
there are no known acutely transforming viruses of humans.  

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Importantly, the vast majority of human cancers are not associated  

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
with viral agents. Occasionally, there are such cases,  

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
but they are quite rare.  Most major tumor types are not caused by viral  

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
infection.  But there is one big exception to this --  

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 -- human papilloma virus.  

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Human papilloma virus, or HPV, and specifically high-risk types of  

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
HPV called type 16 and type 18 are associated with cervical cancer in  

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
the US, but mostly in other parts of the world.  And that's important,  

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
because if one can control exposure to HPV, or eradication of HPV,  

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
one could do something about cervical cancer,  

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and that's actually happening now. And I'll mention that again next  

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
lecture.  But I want you to remember that most cancers,  

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
human cancers, are not virus associated.  But the viruses have  

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
taught us a great deal about cancer genetics.  OK,  

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
so if most human cancers don't arise from a viral infection,  

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
the infection with an oncogene carrying virus,  

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
then where do these mutations come from?  

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
What are the mutations in human cancer?  And here,  

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
just after these experiments were done, around 1980,  

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
comes another one of our local heroes, Bob Weinberg,  

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
who has a laboratory at the Whitehead Institute here at MIT.  

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
He hasn't yet won the Nobel Prize, but I think he's going to, based on  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
this work and a lot of other work probably in the next several years.  

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And what Weinberg's lab did back in this early 1980s.  

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Was to look in human cancers, so not cancers of animals, but in  

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000
human cancers. And specifically,  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
they took bladder cancers and isolated the cells,  

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and grew them in the laboratory.   

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
They assumed that inside of the cells were altered genes,  

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and to become altered through the life of this individual,  

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
giving rise to this cancer. And they wanted to know what those  

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
genes were.  And so, they isolated the DNA from these  

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
bladder cancer cells, and they transfected it into cells  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
from mice.  They sheared it up, and they introduced it.  That's what  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
transfected means, into the cells of mice.  

00:16:30.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And these cells that they put them into were fairly normal --  

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 -- mouse cells,  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
by which I mean they grew a single layer on the bottom of the dish.  

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
There are structures look like normal cells as opposed to cancer  

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
cells.  They were relatively normal cells.  And what they observed was  

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
that a small percentage of these cells that had picked up some bits  

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and pieces of the DNA derived from this human cancer began to  

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000
behave abnormally --   

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
-- and produced what were referred to as transformed cells,  

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
cells that looked more like cancer cells.  So they had converted  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
otherwise normal mouse cells to what looked like cancer cells through the  

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
introduction of one or more human genes.  

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And they further demonstrated that these were cancer associated cells,  

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
cancer-causing cells, by introducing them into immunocompromised mice,  

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000
and observing that over time these cells could produce tumors.  

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So these were cancer cells indeed. So that's very interesting because  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
it says that there are altered genes in these cancer cells that can  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
convert normal mouse cells into cancer cells.  And then to obvious  

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
question was, what are those genes? What is the gene that's responsible  

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:08.000
for this process?  So, they --   

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
-- isolated the human DNA from the transformed mouse cells.  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And I won't tell you how they did that, but suffice it to say,  

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
it's possible to isolate the human DNA away from the mouse DNA in these  

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
transformed mouse cells. They cloned the human DNA into  

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
bacteria using recombinant DNA methods that we've talked to you  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:44.000
about previously.   

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And they sequenced the cancer-causing gene.  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
It turns out it was just a single gene that was providing  

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000
this property.   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And it turned out that this gene was H-RAS [SP?], RAS being a gene that  

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
we've talked to you about before, and important signaling protein in  

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
cells.  Moreover, they sequenced the copy of RAS that  

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
was present in the cancer cells, and compared it to the sequence in  

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
normal cells in the other cells of this individual.  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And they found a single alteration. OK, so what you are looking at here  

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
now is the sequence of the H-RAS gene in normal people or in the  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
normal cells of this cancer patient has a particular sequence.  

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
It encodes a protein, H-RAS, which if you recall is an important  

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
signaling protein that shuttles between a GTP-bound form  

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
and a GDP bound form. In its GTP bound form,  

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
it's active and signals, and then it undergoes hydrolysis  

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
reaction.  So, the GTP is converted to GDP,  

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
and becomes inactive.  The mutant copy found in the cancer cells and  

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
in these transformed mouse cells has been alteration which blocks the  

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
ability of the proteins undergo GTP hydrolysis.  Therefore,  

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
the protein gets locked into this active signaling state,  

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
and stimulates proliferation continuously.  

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And that's why it's a cancer associated gene.  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
OK, so here we have for the first time evidence that a normal,  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
cellular gene gets mutated, presumably by an error or by  

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
exposure to some mutagen that is responsible at least far an aspect  

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
of the transformed state. OK, so that's very,  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
very interesting.  It also raises an important question.  

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
If you note that the change between the normal gene and the abnormal  

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
gene is signal-base change that converts this alanine residue,  

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
sorry, this glycemic residue to a valine residue: single base change.  

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Such single base changes occur in your cells all the time.  

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
It's estimated that the mutation rate inside your cells is about ten  

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
to the minus ninth per cell division. And if you calculate how many cells  

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
you have in your body at any given time based on how many cell  

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
divisions have arisen, we can estimate that there are about  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
ten to the third to ten to the fifth --  

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 -- rasmutin  

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
cells in all of U as you sit there now.  You are all carrying 1,  

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
00-100,000 cells that have this very mutation.  So,  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
why don't all of you have cancer? Why don't all of you have bladder  

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
cancer or some other form of cancer?  Anybody?  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 The reason is that cancer is not a  

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
single step process. Cancer cells arise from normal  

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
cells to the acquisition of many mutations that occur over the  

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
lifetime of the individual. So a single mutation in RAS is not  

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
enough to give you a cancer. It might be enough to cause the  

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
cells to behave somewhat abnormally. But that in and of itself does not  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
produce even hyperplasia necessarily, let alone an adenoma,  

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
an adenocarcinoma and invasive cancer.  

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
It's necessary to acquire multiple mutations.  So you may have cells  

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
that are on their way. But they are not fully there.  

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
And hopefully they'll never get there.  Now, I want to remind you  

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
that this pathway, this signaling pathway that involves  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
RAS is something we taught you about previously.  This should look  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
familiar based on the cell signaling lectures that we had before.  

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
RAS sits right here, this important signaling molecule that links events  

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
that take place at the cell membrane.  

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Sound at all familiar? Yes?  Transmembrane receptors?  

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Growth factor receptors that bind to ligands and cause a series of  

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
events that for example convert RAS to its GTP bound form,  

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
and then initiate a kinase cascade of protein kinases,  

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
map kinase, kinase, kinase, kinase, kinase, kinase, remember the  

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
little movie?  Moves into the nucleus, phosphorylates  

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
transcription factors that initiate the expression of target genes that,  

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
for example cause cells to proliferate.  

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And when RAS gets stuck in its on state as it does here,  

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
these signals are sent constitutively so that the cell is  

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
being told to divide all the time instead of in a regulated fashion.  

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Now, I point out all the different components which I've told you about  

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
in previous lectures because, in fact, it's not just RAS, this one  

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
signaling protein that gets mutated in cancers.  

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Many different of these signaling proteins get mutated in cancers.  

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
It is a very common pathway that's affected in not necessarily all but  

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
a very high percentage of cancers of different types.  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
The RAS gene is mutated at about 30% of cancers.  

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
30% of all cancers have mutations in one of the RAS genes including,  

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
for example, 90% of pancreatic cancer, 50% of colon cancers,  

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
30% of lung cancers carry mutations in this gene.  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
But other components get mutated as well.  For example,  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
the growth factor or growth factor receptor genes get altered in  

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
cancers.  They become amplified. And I'll mention what I mean by  

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
that in a second period. We observe translocations,  

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
these chromosomal alterations in different genes,  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
including the transcription factor genes that lie at the bottom of this  

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
pathway.  There can be deletions that affect the function of these  

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
proteins, make the function abnormally, and subtle mutations  

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
like the one in RAS itself. And there are other examples,  

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
subtle mutations that lock the proteins, for example,  

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:21.000
in an active signaling state.   

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
So, DNA amplification is one such mechanism to alter the function of a  

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
cellular gene in cancer. And an example of that is in a case  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:45.000
of a gene called HER2.   

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
It encodes a growth factor receptor like item number two up here.  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000
It encodes a growth factor receptor. And when it's present in single  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
copy or two copies per cell, it produces a certain concentration  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
of this growth factor receptor protein.  And it signals  

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
at normal levels. And that gives rise to a normal  

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
amount of proliferation. And this is particularly important  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
in cells of the mammary gland. Mammary epithelial cells depend on  

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
this signaling pathway to be produced in the right amounts.  

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Unfortunately at some frequency in cancer cells, and specifically  

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
cancer cells of the breast, and sometimes ovary, an  

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
amplification event takes place so that now instead of having just one  

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
copy of this HER2 gene on the chromosome, there are many copies.  

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
An error takes place in the replication process so that instead  

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
of just copying this gene one time, it gets copied multiple times.  

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
So, now we have too many copies of this gene, and therefore in these  

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
cells, the concentration of this receptor is significantly higher  

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000
than in normal cells such that in these cells, there might be ten  

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
times or a hundred times the amount of signaling, or ten to a hundred  

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
times the amount of proliferation. So, the dysregulation of this gene's  

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
function by making too much of the protein, it's an otherwise normal  

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
protein.  There's just too much of it, causes the cells to get  

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
overstimulated and divide too often. That's bad news for cancer.  The  

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
good news is we now have a therapy, and I'll put you about that next  

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
time, directed against this protein.  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 I'll mention another mechanism of  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
activation, and that's translocation. I showed you slides of cancer cells  

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
that have broken chromosomes or rearranged chromosomes.  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Those rearrangements often produce abnormal genes,  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
sometimes fusions between one gene and another.  Other times,  

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
rearrangements of the promoter of the gene such that the normal  

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
promoter of the gene, which is responsible for its level  

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
of expression is replaced by a different promoter,  

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
which might give too much expression. And that's true for an important  

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
oncogene called MIC .  The MIC oncogene is a  

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
transcription factor. It's like number eight down there.  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
It's a transcription factor that binds to DNA and regulates the  

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
expression of other genes. And it's normally expressed from a,  

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
let's call it, weak promoter.  You don't want to have too much of this  

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
protein produced. It needs to be produced at normal  

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
levels.  So, we get a certain concentration of the  

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:32.000
protein, which gives --   

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
-- regulated cell division. You get as much television as you  

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
need based on the appropriate signals in the environment of those  

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
cells.  In certain types of leukemia, one sees a translocation.  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
The DNA is broken and rejoined so that the MIC oncogene doesn't have  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
its own promoter anymore. Instead, it's next to a very strong  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000
promoter.   

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And now, again, the concentration of this protein is  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
increased.  And this gives rise to deregulated cell  

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
division, same idea. Change the proper regulation of  

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
this signaling network, and now the signaling network is  

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
broken. And as I said,  

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
there are many, many such genes that are known.  

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
We know about 50 or so oncogenes from these acutely transforming  

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
viruses.  We probably know of 50 more oncogenes because of their  

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
changes in the DNA of cancer cells. And by the way, there's a lot of  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
overlap between these two sets. Many of the genes that were found  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
in the context of viruses were later found to be mutant in human cells  

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
having nothing to do with viruses. And RAS is one such example.  MIC,  

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
actually, is another example, and a relative of this HER2 gene  

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
is another example.   

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000
OK.   

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
OK, so the slide is meant to reinforce this notion that cell  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
division, normal production of cells, is tightly regulated through these  

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
signaling networks, and that oncogenes function normally,  

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
their normal cellular function is to control this process.  

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
That's what they do in normal development.  That's what they do in  

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
normal individuals. But they can be subverted in cancer  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
cells by mutation. It makes them act in a deregulated  

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
or uncontrolled fashion. There is another set of genes that  

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
act, in a sense, in opposition to the oncogenes.  

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
These genes function to inhibit this process of cell division.  

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
And they go by another name: tumor suppressor genes.  

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Tumor suppressor genes function to block the normal cell division  

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
process or to inhibit the production of cells.  And they,  

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
too, are important in cancer. You can think of these genes as the  

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
on switch and the off switch of an electrical circuit.  

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
In cancer cells, oncogenes become hyperactive.  

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
When the lights switch gets stuck in the on state.  OK,  

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
it gets taped open. So now, you're getting signaling  

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
through this circuit continuously. Tumor suppressor genes normally  

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
inhibit cell division. And so, in cancer, these genes get  

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
inactivated.  It's like the light switch getting turned off.  

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
And the process is normally regulated that way, and  

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
these get stuck off. OK, so want to tell you a little bit  

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
about tumor suppressor genes now which is the other major category of  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
cancer associated genes that we'll cover here.  Briefly,  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
just to reiterate that point, in addition to the light switch  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
analogy, people often use the gas pedal and breaks analogy,  

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
or the go signal and stop signal analogy.  So, I'll use that as well.  

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
In normal cells, when they receive the signals to divide,  

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
they are stimulated to go, that is, to divide to make more such  

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
cells. This happens in development when you  

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
need to make more cells. It happens in wound healing.  

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
It happens in normal homeostasis. And then, when the process is  

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
completed, there are stop signals sent.  The go signals represent  

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
oncogenes, normally regulated, stop signals tumor suppressor genes  

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
normally regulated. In cancer, oncogenes become  

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
deregulated.  And pushed too strong they send constitutive signals.  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
And as a consequence, too many cells are produced.  

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
And likewise, the stop signs, the stop signals are lost so that  

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
one produces even more cells. OK, so hopefully these are useful  

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
analogies to think about these two opposing sets of oncogenes and tumor  

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
suppressor genes. OK, so to get into tumor suppressor  

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
genes, sorry, this just makes the point, oncogene mutations,  

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
tumor suppressor gene mutations. To get into tumor suppressor genes,  

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
the second class, an important class of human cancer genes,  

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
let me tell you a little bit about this disease which is called  

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
of the eye, of the retina. It's not very common.  Only about  

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
one in 40,000 children develop this tumor.  But it's very important what  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
it's taught us about cancer genes. And you can see in the normal eye a  

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
normal looking retina, and in the cancer containing eye,  

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
these blobs of tumors.  We now know the gene that's responsible for this  

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
disease, the gene that's mutated in the formation of this disease.  

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
And that gene is the gene called RB, named after retinoblastoma.  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 And this gene functions as an  

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
important regulator of cell cycle progression.  If you remember cell  

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000
cycle progression, mitosis, S phase mitosis,  

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000
the G1 phase, the G2 phase, again, dim memories from earlier in  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
the class. The RB protein,  

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
which goes by the name of PRB, this is the protein encoded by this  

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
tumor suppressor gene, RB, acts to inhibit cell cycle  

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
progression.  That's its function. It blocks cell cycle progression  

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
literally like the brakes on a car. Now, you might ask,  

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
if it's there and functioning, then how do you ever get cell cycle  

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
progression?  And the answer is that this active inhibitor can be  

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
inactivated through phosphorylation. When this protein gets  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
phosphorylated, it becomes inactive.  

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 And now, cell cycle progression  

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:14.000
can occur.   

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
It becomes inactive when the cell receives growth stimulatory signals  

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
like through that signaling network that I mentioned previously.  

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
These signals, then, act on cycline CDK complexes,  

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
cell cycle associated kinases that you were taught about in the cell  

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
cycle lecture, and these go about inactivating the  

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
RB protein, allowing the cells to cycle.  

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
In addition, when the cells shouldn't be cycling in the presence  

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
of growth inhibitory signals, inhibitory signals are sent to the  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
cycline dependent kinase proteins, and they don't function, thereby  

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
blocking the inactivation of RB. RB stays in its active state and  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
blocks cell cycle progression. OK, so that's how this really  

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
important cell cycle regulator functions more or less.  

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
And it's a very important human tumor suppressor gene,  

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
which is itself mutated and probably 30 or 40% of human cancers.  

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
And the pathway that regulates this gene, this pathway,  

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000
is mutated in probably 95% of human cancers very, very commonly affected.  

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
OK, so given what I've told you so far, would you expect the mutations  

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
that we find in the RB gene in human cancer to be activating mutations or  

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
inactivating mutations? Inactivating.  It's the brakes.  

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Cancer cells want to get rid of the brakes.  

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 And so we find inactivating  

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:23.000
mutations in the RB gene in human cancers like deletions or nonsense  

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:31.000
mutations, that is, stop codon mutations.  

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
OK, that's the kind of mutations we find in this gene.  

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
For the oncogenes, which we focused on at the beginning,  

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
are the mutations in oncogenes dominant or recessive?  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Are the mutations in the oncogenes dominant or recessive?  

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
The oncogene mutations are dominant. When you acquire mutation in an  

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
oncogene, whether it's a subtle mutation or an amplification,  

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
it doesn't matter what's happening to the other allele.  

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
This thing has new function, gain of function.  It will transform  

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
or start the process of transformation,  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
regardless of what is happening to the other allele.  

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
And that's evident, by the way, in this transfection  

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
experiment.  This would only work if it were a dominant mutation.  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
So, oncogene mutations are dominant mutations.  Are tumor suppressor  

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
gene mutations dominant or recessive? These are recessive mutations.  

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Here, it matters, the state of the other allele of the  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
RB gene.  As long as you have one functional copy of the brakes,  

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
you can do this.  You can control cell cycle regulation.  

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
In order to make this dysregulated, you need to get rid of both copies.  

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
You need to get rid of the brakes entirely.  So, these mutations  

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
are recessive. And this class of mutations are  

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
recessive.  Tumor suppressor gene mutations are recessive.  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
So this raises an interesting question.  Tumor suppressor gene  

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
mutations are recessive. I've told you that tumor suppressor  

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
gene mutations occur commonly in human cancer, not just this RB gene  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
but others too, and yet you are all diploid.  

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
You all carry two copies of the tumor suppressor genes.  

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
So, how do we ever find mutations in these genes in human cancer?  

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Is it enough to mutate just one copy?  No, because they are  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
recessive mutations. So, to find mutations in tumor  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
suppressor genes in human cancer, it's not enough to mutate just one  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
copy.  Both copies need to be mutated.  

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 Recessive mutations require there be  

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
two mutations. And this is what typically happens  

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
in the development of a tumor with a mutation in the RB gene,  

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
or any other tumor suppressor gene. Again, there are probably 20 to 50  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
different tumor suppressor genes. Initially, a cell, which has a  

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
normal copy of RB on both copies of chromosome 13,  

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
that's where this gene sits, and here we are looking at a linked  

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
polymorphic marker, big A little a, if you remember  

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
polymorphic markers, big A little A.  

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:00.000
First, one copy of RB gets mutated. In this cell, there is still a  

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
normal copy of RB. And therefore,  

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
this cell that has acquired this mutation is normal.  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
It's functionally normal. However, it now has just one copy  

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
of the RB gene. And so, it's predisposed to  

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
becoming a cancer cell if that normal copy gets lost.  

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
And what this shows you are various mechanisms by which the  

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
normal copy of the RB gene can be lost.  

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
The other copy can acquire its own mutation.  Or,  

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
the chromosome that carries the normal copy of the RB gene can get  

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
lost in the developing cancer cell. Or, it can be a recombination of  

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
that, that replaces the normal copy of the gene with the abnormal copy  

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
of the gene.  And all three of these things happen in the development of  

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
cancer cells.  And depending on which mechanism is used --  

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 -- one can observe something  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:30.000
referred to as loss --   

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
-- of heterozygosity, loss of heterozygosity within the  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
cancer cell.  You will notice that this cancer cell,  

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
sorry, this normal cell, is heterozygous for this A allele,  

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
big A little A.  And you will notice that here and here,  

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
the cell has become, the cell carries only one version of that A  

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
allele, big A. So, there was heterozygosity.  

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
And in the cancer cell, there's now loss of heterozygosity.  

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Loss of heterozygosity is a hallmark for tumor suppressor genes,  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
the involvement of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer.  

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000
OK, now I told you several times that proliferation is important and  

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:33.000
cell death is important, too.   

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Cell death control in cancer: I don't have a lot of time to tell you  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
more about this in this class, but I want to just emphasize that  

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
the pathways that lead from cell death signals,  

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
the signals that tell cells to commit suicide to ultimately undergo  

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000
this process called apoptosis are also dysregulated in cancer.  

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 For example, there's a gene called  

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000
BCL2, which becomes mutated in certain types of cancer.  

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
BCL2 normally blocks this process of cell death.  

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
And in this type of cancer, it becomes hyperactive.  So there's  

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000
not as much cell death. BCL2 is an oncogene.  

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Another gene, very important gene in human cancer is P53.  

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:49.000
It stimulates cell death. P53 gets lost in a high percentage  

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.000
of cancers.  It's a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore gets  

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
inactivated. BCL2 is an oncogene.  

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
It gets hyperactivated in cancers. I'll talk more about this pathway  

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
next time, but just to put in your minds, P53 is a very important  

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
signaling protein responsive to many signals upstream,  

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
giving rise to signals that lead to death as well as arrest.  

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Hang on, please.  Hang on. Two minutes left.  

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
And this slide is just a summary of what we've been talking about so far.  

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Control of proliferation, control of cell death, the normal  

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
balance, perturbations in these pathways, oncogene mutations that  

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
stimulate proliferation, tumor suppressor gene mutations that  

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
stimulate proliferation. Alterations in apoptosis,  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
oncogene mutations that block apoptosis, tumor suppressor gene  

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
mutations that block apoptosis. All of these are important in  

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
cancer. Next time I'm going to tell you that  

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
some cancers are caused by inherited mutations.  And this is a pedigree  

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
of such an example, and lastly to remind you,  

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
mutations affect proliferation in cell death.  But they also affect  

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
many other things: invasion, angiogenesis, as well as metastasis.  

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.400
And I'll stop there.
