00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.182
We've already seen many
examples of infinite series.

00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:06.765
But what's exciting about what
we're about to do in this video

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:09.879
is we're going to use infinite
series to define a function.

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.420
And the most common
one that you will

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.120
see in your mathematical
careers is the power series.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.010
And I'm about to write a general
case of the power series.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.250
So I could imagine
a function, f of x,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.100
being defined as
the infinite sum.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.900
So going from n equals 0
to infinity of a sub n--

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.760
so a sub n is just going to be
the coefficient on each term--

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.320
times our variable x
minus some constant c.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.160
You could almost
imagine this is shifting

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.260
our function to the n-th power.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.910
So if I were to
expand this out, I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.390
have my first term's
coefficient, a sub 0,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.630
times x minus c
to the 0-th power,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.400
plus a sub 1 times x minus
c to the first power.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.180
This one, of course, will
simplify just a sub 0.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.590
This would simplify to a sub
1 times x minus c plus a sub

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.700
2 times x minus c squared.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.587
And I could just keep
going on and on and on.

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.170
Now, when you see
this, you might say,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.760
aren't our geometric
series, don't

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.440
those look like a special
case of a power series

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.260
if our common ratio was an x
instead of an r in that case,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.920
or if our common ratio was a
variable, I guess I could say?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.060
And you would be right.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.490
That absolutely
would be the case.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.800
So a geometric series.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.050
So let's just think about
defining a function in terms

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.482
of a geometric series.

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:33.940
And of course, we
don't have to use

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.650
x all the time as the
independent variable,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.650
but this is kind of the
most typical convention.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.900
I guess we could also use r
as an independent variable

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.240
if we wanted as well.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.067
But let's imagine
a function g of x.

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:45.900
We could have g of r
if we wanted, but let's

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.200
do g of x is equal
to the sum from n

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.060
equals 0 to infinity
of a times x to the n.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.220
So this is kind of a typical
geometric series here.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.020
And what's the difference
between this and this?

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.259
Well, the difference is is
here, for every term we're

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.800
going to have the
same coefficient a,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.864
while over here we have a sub n.

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:12.280
We're multiplying by a different
thing every time up here.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.610
We're multiplying by the
same thing over here.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.930
And in this case, this
particular geometric series

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.420
I just made, instead of
having x minus c to the n,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.580
we have just x to the n.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.705
So you could say, well,
this is a special case when

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.270
c is equal to 0.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.440
And we can expand it out.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.040
This is a times
x to the 0, which

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.540
is just going to be a, plus
a times x to the first,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.330
plus a times x squared.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.210
And we just go on and
on and on forever.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.540
Now, what's exciting
about this is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.510
we know that this, under
certain conditions,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.950
will actually give
us a finite value.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.640
This will actually converge.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.350
This will actually, I guess,
give us a sensical answer.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.520
So under what conditions
does that happen?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.279
Well, this converges
if each of these terms

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.820
gets smaller and
smaller and smaller.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.390
And each of these terms gets
smaller and smaller and smaller

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.470
if the absolute value of our
common ratio is less than 1.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.100
So let me write that down.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.410
So this converges if
the absolute value

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.181
of our common ratio
is less than 1.

00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:19.680
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.020
this is another way
of saying that x

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.120
is in the interval
between-- it's less than 1

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.280
and it is greater
than negative 1.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.640
And this term right over
here, now x is a variable.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.300
x can vary between those values.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.640
We're defining a
function in terms of x.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.740
We call this the
interval of convergence.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.487
And so we know that if
x is in this interval,

00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:50.070
this is going to
give us a finite sum.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.380
And we know what
that finite sum is.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.620
It's going to be equal
to-- if it converges.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.950
So if it converges,
this is going

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.950
to be equal to our first
term, which is just

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.490
a-- this simplifies to a
right over here-- over 1

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.580
minus our common ratio.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.820
What's our common ratio?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.360
Our common ratio in
this example is x.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.120
Going from one term to the next,
we're just multiplying by x.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.640
We're just multiplying
by x right over there.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.510
Now, this is pretty
neat, because we're

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.390
going to be able
to use this fact

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.030
to put more
traditionally-defined functions

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.750
into this form, and
then try to expand them

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.660
out using a geometric series.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.722
And this whole idea
of using power series,

00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:35.430
or in this special
case, geometric series

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.280
to represent functions,
has all sorts

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.750
of applications in
engineering and finance.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.980
Using a finite number of
terms of these series,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.130
you could kind of
approximate the functions

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.020
in a way that's simpler
for the human brain

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.470
to understand, or
maybe a simpler

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.690
way to manipulate in some way.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.610
But what's interesting
here is instead of just

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.540
going from the sum
to-- instead of going

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.922
from this expanded-out version
to this kind of finite value,

00:05:01.922 --> 00:05:04.130
we're now going to start
being able to take something

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.930
in this form and expand it
out into a geometric series.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.734
But we have to be
careful to make sure

00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:11.150
that we're only doing it over
the interval of convergence.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.790
This is only going to be
true over the interval

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.010
of convergence.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.550
Now, one other term you might
see in your mathematical career

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.220
is a radius.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.945
Radius of convergence.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.770
And this is how far--
up to what value,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.180
but not including this value.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.760
So as long as our x value stays
less than a certain amount

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.680
from our c value, then
this thing will converge.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.470
Now in this case,
our c value is 0.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.720
So we could ask
ourselves a question.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.120
As long as x stays
within some value of 0,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.540
this thing is going to converge.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.914
Well, you see it
right over here.

00:05:55.914 --> 00:06:01.302
As long as x stays
within one of 0.

00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:03.010
It can't go all the
way to 1, but as long

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.000
as it stays less
than 1, or as long

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.500
as it stays greater
than negative 1.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.490
It can stray anything
less than one

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.380
away from 0, either in
the positive direction

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.460
or the negative direction.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.560
Then this thing
will still converge.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.640
So we could say that our radius
of convergence is equal to 1.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.550
Another way to think about it,
our interval of convergence--

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.490
we're going from
negative 1 to 1,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.980
not including those
two boundaries,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.690
so our interval is 2.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.450
So our radius of
convergence is half of that.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.920
As long as x stays
within one of 0,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.440
and that's the same thing as
saying this right over here,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.310
this series is
going to converge.
