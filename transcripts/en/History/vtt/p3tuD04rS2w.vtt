00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.040
Up first is the kill test.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.960
Doug?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.500
DOUG: Master bladesmiths, to
see what kind of lethal damage

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.330
your rhomphaias will do,
we will take your rhomphaia

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.460
and deliver lethal
slashes and thrusts

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.460
to this wild boar carcass.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.620
Dwight, you're up first.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.380
Are you ready?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.210
I'm ready.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.540
[music playing]

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.080
Wow.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.040
Damn.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.710
[inaudible]

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.750
DOUG: Well, Dwight, on
the initial draw cut,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.710
it is sharp to where
it lacerated deep

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.330
into this wild boar carcass.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.750
On the thrust, it penetrated
easily into the carcass,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.580
and on the final cut right
here, your blade cut all

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.210
the way through the carcass.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.380
Overall, your
rhomphaia would kill.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.380
Thank you.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.500
DOUG: Good job.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.960
All right, Billy Bob.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.920
That's a hard act to
follow, but let's do it.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.710
[music playing]

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.750
[sighs]

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.540
[inaudible]

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.120
DOUG: All right, Billy Bob.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.580
It's so light, you can almost
wield it with one hand.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.040
The edge over here is so
sharp, it lacerates easily,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.460
without much force.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460
The profile you have
over here for thrusting

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.750
allowed it for a very deep
quick in-out penetration.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.290
Overall, your
rhomphaia will kill.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.710
Thank you.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.620
Next up is the strength test.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.290
Ben?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.000
BEN: Gentlemen, to test
the strength and durability

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.750
of your blades, I'm going to
clamp them into this machine,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080
and it will deliver a
strike on the sugarcane

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.170
of about 500 pounds of force.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.250
Remember, this test is all
about what the sugarcane

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.790
does to your blade,
and not what your blade

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.420
does to the sugarcane.
[sighs]

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.830
Dwight, I've already
clamped yours in.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.790
Are you ready to go?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.960
I'm ready.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.500
BEN: 3, 2, 1.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.000
Phew.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.330
Well, Dwight, your
blade held up perfectly.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.460
It's like it didn't
hit anything.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.580
It's still dead straight.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.960
Very well done.
- Thank you.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.170
Billy Bob, you're up next.
You ready?

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.120
I can't wait.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.960
BEN: All right.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.710
Let's do this.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.170
3, 2, 1.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.540
BILLY BOB: Ah.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.170
Kill me.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.120
Well, Billy Bob.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.540
I love the overall weight.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.040
It feels like it's a
really good chopper.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.380
And most importantly, the edge
is still as razor sharp as it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.540
was when you brought it here.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.540
Very well done.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.710
Thank you, sir.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.040
BEN: Next up is
the sharpness test.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.880
And for that, I
give you to Dave.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.540
DAVE: All right, gentlemen.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.000
I'll be working my way through
this rope maze by cutting.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.460
We've seen your blades kill.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.040
Let's see if they've
held their edge.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.880
Dwight, you're up first.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.960
You ready?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.040
I'm ready.
DAVE: All right.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.920
Let's do this.
[music playing]

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.250
All right.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.170
So Dwight, your blade
is just pristine.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.000
I mean, there's-- there's
not a mark or a hair

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.420
hanging on it or anything.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.710
Feel wise, it's got a
lot of forward weight.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.170
It makes for a very strong chop,
but I do have to stop and slow

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.540
it down and back it up.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.250
I think it's a beautiful weapon.
- Thank you.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.540
Thank you.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.000
All right, Billy Bob.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.420
You ready to go?
- Let's do it.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.210
DAVE: OK.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.580
[music playing]

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.290
Billy Bob, this is sharp.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.420
It blew through
rope like nothing.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.250
I felt I could really
control this weapon,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.040
just because it's so much
lighter up through here.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.460
Fabulous weapon.
- Thank you.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.040
Well done.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.790
DOUG: Dwight, Billy Bob.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.040
You've both done masterful work,
as expected from master smiths.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.580
However, in this
arena of competition,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.460
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:21.460
and that champion is Billy Bob.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.460
Congratulations, you are the
"Forged in Fire" champion.
