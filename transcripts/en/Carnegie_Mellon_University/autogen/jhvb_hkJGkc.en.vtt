just was clear to me that Carnegie

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240
just was clear to me that Carnegie
 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.570
just was clear to me that Carnegie
Mellon had had such a great impact upon

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580
Mellon had had such a great impact upon
 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.610
Mellon had had such a great impact upon
me that I felt I wanted to get

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
me that I felt I wanted to get
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.160
me that I felt I wanted to get
re-involved with it so much of what I've

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
re-involved with it so much of what I've
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110
re-involved with it so much of what I've
learned both professionally and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
learned both professionally and
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.200
learned both professionally and
personally and then even from a family

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
personally and then even from a family
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420
personally and then even from a family
perspective came during my time at

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
perspective came during my time at
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.910
perspective came during my time at
Carnegie Mellon and so in that sense I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
Carnegie Mellon and so in that sense I
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979
Carnegie Mellon and so in that sense I
sort of felt an obligation to give

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
sort of felt an obligation to give
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960
sort of felt an obligation to give
something back to an institution that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
something back to an institution that
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969
something back to an institution that
had been such an important part of my

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
had been such an important part of my
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.620
had been such an important part of my
life and of course now still is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
life and of course now still is
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.590
life and of course now still is
everything I find myself doing I always

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
everything I find myself doing I always
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.810
everything I find myself doing I always
think there's an aesthetic to it both

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
think there's an aesthetic to it both
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.000
think there's an aesthetic to it both
from an engineering perspective but also

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010
from an engineering perspective but also
 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.030
from an engineering perspective but also
from a sort of outside aesthetic and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
from a sort of outside aesthetic and
 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.430
from a sort of outside aesthetic and
clearly being an apple a lot of what we

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440
clearly being an apple a lot of what we
 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.950
clearly being an apple a lot of what we
do really involves building things that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
do really involves building things that
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.380
do really involves building things that
aren't simply great to use but they're

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
aren't simply great to use but they're
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450
aren't simply great to use but they're
beautiful to look at and I think that's

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
beautiful to look at and I think that's
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.580
beautiful to look at and I think that's
a something the Carnegie Mellon has

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
a something the Carnegie Mellon has
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.140
a something the Carnegie Mellon has
helped me really understand throughout

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
helped me really understand throughout
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420
helped me really understand throughout
my career as well as of course being

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
my career as well as of course being
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.730
my career as well as of course being
married to an artist she's really helped

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
married to an artist she's really helped
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.090
married to an artist she's really helped
me understand as well how art is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
me understand as well how art is
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.950
me understand as well how art is
important and how artists think about

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
important and how artists think about
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.140
important and how artists think about
things and I think that form of thinking

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150
things and I think that form of thinking
 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.210
things and I think that form of thinking
that non-technical way of thinking can

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
that non-technical way of thinking can
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280
that non-technical way of thinking can
be critical to creating really great

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
be critical to creating really great
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530
be critical to creating really great
products and so part of what attracted

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
products and so part of what attracted
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.750
products and so part of what attracted
me to go into Apple for example was they

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760
me to go into Apple for example was they
 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.370
me to go into Apple for example was they
bring those two elements we bring those

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
bring those two elements we bring those
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.620
bring those two elements we bring those
two elements together if you look at the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
two elements together if you look at the
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899
two elements together if you look at the
pace of Technology and you look at

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
pace of Technology and you look at
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.240
pace of Technology and you look at
what's happened over the last hundred

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
what's happened over the last hundred
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.640
what's happened over the last hundred
years and then you look at what's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650
years and then you look at what's
 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.230
years and then you look at what's
happened over the last ten years and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
happened over the last ten years and
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.089
happened over the last ten years and
even what's happened over the last year

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
even what's happened over the last year
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.609
even what's happened over the last year
you realize it's this rapidly increasing

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
you realize it's this rapidly increasing
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.550
you realize it's this rapidly increasing
ability to go do things that even a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
ability to go do things that even a
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.020
ability to go do things that even a
couple years ago we run imagine

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030
couple years ago we run imagine
 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.940
couple years ago we run imagine
well when you look at the kinds of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
well when you look at the kinds of
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.280
well when you look at the kinds of
things that the web has enabled and the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
things that the web has enabled and the
 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.960
things that the web has enabled and the
number of people connects and people

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
number of people connects and people
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.690
number of people connects and people
talk about social networking three four

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700
talk about social networking three four
 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.510
talk about social networking three four
or five years ago one couldn't imagine

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
or five years ago one couldn't imagine
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.890
or five years ago one couldn't imagine
that we would have the capability you're

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900
that we would have the capability you're
 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.390
that we would have the capability you're
going to do that so it's just an

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
going to do that so it's just an
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.150
going to do that so it's just an
exciting time because we're getting more

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160
exciting time because we're getting more
 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.400
exciting time because we're getting more
and more the tools that enable us to go

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410
and more the tools that enable us to go
 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.559
and more the tools that enable us to go
build products that change people's

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569
build products that change people's
 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.780
build products that change people's
lives or if they don't change their

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
lives or if they don't change their
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.490
lives or if they don't change their
lives at least or things that people

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
lives at least or things that people
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.380
lives at least or things that people
love to go use and not all of these will

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390
love to go use and not all of these will
 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.600
love to go use and not all of these will
be technical in many cases they'll be

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610
be technical in many cases they'll be
 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.760
be technical in many cases they'll be
artistic works when you look at what the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770
artistic works when you look at what the
 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.060
artistic works when you look at what the
web has done for example to enable

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
web has done for example to enable
 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.550
web has done for example to enable
musicians and artists and filmmakers to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
musicians and artists and filmmakers to
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560
musicians and artists and filmmakers to
reach audiences that previously you

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570
reach audiences that previously you
 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.680
reach audiences that previously you
couldn't go reach it's amazing okay and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
couldn't go reach it's amazing okay and
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.949
couldn't go reach it's amazing okay and
so much of that groundbreaking work the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
so much of that groundbreaking work the
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.420
so much of that groundbreaking work the
foundation of that is based on things

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430
foundation of that is based on things
 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.600
foundation of that is based on things
that happened at Carnegie Mellon
