in the area of confidence we have a lot
of trouble properly interpreting the

more than less confident people even

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:24.249
more than less confident people even
 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.980
more than less confident people even
when they're actually less accurate and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990
when they're actually less accurate and
 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.779
when they're actually less accurate and
and less knowledgeable so for example

after those four days it turns out to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860
after those four days it turns out to
 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.140
after those four days it turns out to
have rained on three out of those four

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150
have rained on three out of those four
 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.950
have rained on three out of those four
days that is 75 percent of the days

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

which weather forecaster do you think

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340
which weather forecaster do you think
 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.940
which weather forecaster do you think
was the better forecaster now the right

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950
was the better forecaster now the right
 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.349
was the better forecaster now the right
answer is forecaster b-because

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:07.359
answer is forecaster b-because
 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.969
answer is forecaster b-because
forecaster B said there's a 75 percent

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979
forecaster B said there's a 75 percent
 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:09.690
forecaster B said there's a 75 percent
chance of rain

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700
chance of rain
 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.399
chance of rain
and he was right on 75 percent of those

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409
and he was right on 75 percent of those
 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.080
and he was right on 75 percent of those
days it actually did rain he's what we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090
days it actually did rain he's what we
 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.330
days it actually did rain he's what we
call perfectly calibrated but a majority

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340

of subjects in this study preferred

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840
of subjects in this study preferred
 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.109
of subjects in this study preferred
forecaster a and the only difference

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119
forecaster a and the only difference
 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.190
forecaster a and the only difference
between forecaster a and B as a

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200
between forecaster a and B as a
 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
between forecaster a and B as a
forecaster a is more confident

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210
forecaster a is more confident
 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.270
forecaster a is more confident
forecaster a is sort of more decisive in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280
forecaster a is sort of more decisive in
 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.069
forecaster a is sort of more decisive in
his forecasts but less accurate

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079
his forecasts but less accurate
 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.739
his forecasts but less accurate
yet we still prefer that forecaster even

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749
yet we still prefer that forecaster even
 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.719
yet we still prefer that forecaster even
knowing their track record and here we

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729
knowing their track record and here we
 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:31.950
knowing their track record and here we
actually know what their track record is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960
actually know what their track record is
 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.389
actually know what their track record is
so we should really be able to say look

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399
so we should really be able to say look
 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.760
so we should really be able to say look
this guy got it right he's the right one

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770
this guy got it right he's the right one
 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.620
this guy got it right he's the right one
but instead even knowing their track

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630
but instead even knowing their track
 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.999
but instead even knowing their track
record we go for the one who's more

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009
record we go for the one who's more
 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.830
record we go for the one who's more
confident and this is an unusual case

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840
confident and this is an unusual case
 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.969
confident and this is an unusual case

the information you know it and you need
to know to make the right decision if

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130
to know to make the right decision if
 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.440
to know to make the right decision if
you think about people who forecast the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
you think about people who forecast the
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.660
you think about people who forecast the
stock market or who forecast political

in shopping and design and so on we

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909
in shopping and design and so on we
 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.010
in shopping and design and so on we
don't know what the track record of

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020
don't know what the track record of
 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.389
don't know what the track record of
those people are when we pick which ones

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399
those people are when we pick which ones

we like better so we're even more

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479
we like better so we're even more
 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.840
we like better so we're even more
seduced by confidence and we don't

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850
seduced by confidence and we don't
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.859
seduced by confidence and we don't
realize that we're paying so much

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869
realize that we're paying so much
 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.480
realize that we're paying so much
attention that we think we're making a

with references to the brain a lot of

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
with references to the brain a lot of
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.770
with references to the brain a lot of
people think that if you can say

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780
people think that if you can say
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.480
people think that if you can say
something about the brain then you must

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490
something about the brain then you must
 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.920
something about the brain then you must
know more about how the mind works and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930
know more about how the mind works and
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.150
know more about how the mind works and
it really doesn't work that way the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160
it really doesn't work that way the

with some colorful blobs showing this is
 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.460
with some colorful blobs showing this is
where the brain is active while we're

where the brain is active while we're
 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.620
where the brain is active while we're
doing some particular tasks doesn't

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630
doing some particular tasks doesn't
 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.450
doing some particular tasks doesn't
necessarily tell us a whole lot more

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460
necessarily tell us a whole lot more
 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.640
necessarily tell us a whole lot more
about that task and how our minds

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650
about that task and how our minds
 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.500
about that task and how our minds
accomplish it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
accomplish it
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.060
accomplish it
likewise a lot of talk about the brain

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070
likewise a lot of talk about the brain
 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.460
likewise a lot of talk about the brain
is often used to sort of as an add-on to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470
is often used to sort of as an add-on to
 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.990
is often used to sort of as an add-on to
other arguments to make them seem more

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000
other arguments to make them seem more
 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.010
other arguments to make them seem more
convincing it's sort of like an

convincing it's sort of like an
 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.960
convincing it's sort of like an
all-purpose you know reference to make

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
all-purpose you know reference to make
 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.640
all-purpose you know reference to make
your argument more convincing is to say

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
your argument more convincing is to say
 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.600
your argument more convincing is to say
it has something to do with the brain

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610
it has something to do with the brain
 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.070
it has something to do with the brain
and show a picture of the brain and so

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080
and show a picture of the brain and so
 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.690
and show a picture of the brain and so
on advertising does this quite a bit as

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700
on advertising does this quite a bit as
 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.250
on advertising does this quite a bit as
well you can see the brain if you look

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260
well you can see the brain if you look
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.600
well you can see the brain if you look
in all kinds of advertisements where

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610
in all kinds of advertisements where
 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.130
in all kinds of advertisements where
when you think about it it's really not

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140
when you think about it it's really not
 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.070
when you think about it it's really not
that relevant and I sort of am a little

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080
that relevant and I sort of am a little
 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.600
that relevant and I sort of am a little
bit troubled by that trend while at the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610
bit troubled by that trend while at the
 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.800
bit troubled by that trend while at the
same time I think it's exciting to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810
same time I think it's exciting to
 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.180
same time I think it's exciting to
discover more about the brain it's just

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190
discover more about the brain it's just
 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.470
discover more about the brain it's just
as long as we know what that knowledge

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480
as long as we know what that knowledge
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.210
as long as we know what that knowledge
means and that it doesn't mean that

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220
means and that it doesn't mean that
 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.800

traditional psychology is somehow

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810
traditional psychology is somehow
 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.570
traditional psychology is somehow
obsolete and replaced by neuroscience

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580
obsolete and replaced by neuroscience
 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.280
obsolete and replaced by neuroscience
and so on they're two topics of study

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290
and so on they're two topics of study
 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.990
and so on they're two topics of study
that definitely relate to each other

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000
that definitely relate to each other
 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.850
that definitely relate to each other
quite a bit but the one doesn't replace

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860
quite a bit but the one doesn't replace
 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.580
quite a bit but the one doesn't replace
or really make the other any more

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590
or really make the other any more
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.100
or really make the other any more
credible
