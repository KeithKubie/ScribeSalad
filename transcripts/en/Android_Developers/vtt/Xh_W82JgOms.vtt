NAZMUL IDRIS: Hi.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.790
I'm Nazmul Idris, a developer
advocate on the Android team.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.659
And welcome to this
episode of DevBytes.

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.200
In today's episode, we're going
to cover the new app indexing

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.560
feature that we recently
announced for Google search

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.967
for Android.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.050
Currently, when you do a
Google search on the web,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.450
you get results that
are links to websites.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.010
It's not easy to
get your Android

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620
apps by doing web searches.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.442
I mean, you can
find results that

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:30.900
link to listings
on the Play Store,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.950
but you can't do
much more than that.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.620
With App Indexing,
you will now be

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.750
able to point Google
search users on Android

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.150
directly to content
within your app.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
Google search will be
able to surface deep links

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.190
within your app directly
in search results

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.110
and provide a
call-to-action button

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930
to launch your app directly.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.030
This is particularly useful
when the search terms

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.730
are really specific
and can be resolved

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.850
to content that's
presented inside

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.630
of your Android application.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.550
For example, imagine that you
run a restaurant review website

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.030
and have an app that also
shows restaurant reviews.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.510
Thanks to the App Indexing
feature, when a Google

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.200
search is done in a mobile
device for a restaurant

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.750
and one of your reviews
is a search result,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.110
the user will now be able
to open that result directly

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.260
in your application, if
they have it installed.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.800
You also have control
over when Google displays

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.470
the open-in-app
call-to-action button

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.660
so that you can decide when you
want to guide people to content

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.310
on your website
and when you want

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.710
to highlight your Android app.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.540
Now, in order to
enable app linking,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.790
you have to perform at least
two things, one on your website,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.580
and one in your
Android application.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.920
On your website, you have
to annotate each page

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.210
with app links
that can be opened

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.030
in your mobile application.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.720
You need to specify how
the page's content can

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.820
be opened in your Android app.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.250
Now, in the Android
app, you have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.180
to add intent filters
for deep linking

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.280
in your application
manifest to specify

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.220
how to reach specific content
inside of the application.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.720
Correctly configuring
both your website and app

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.820
allows Google to
crawl and process

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.900
both the website
and app and index

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.960
the relationship between the
web page and your app correctly.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.040
This helps our algorithms
show the open-in-app button

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.900
in the search results,
if appropriate.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.280
Now, each page on
your site can specify

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.520
how its contents can
be loaded in your app.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.580
We offer two equivalent ways
to tell Google's algorithms

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.010
about the relationships between
the page and your application.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.780
And these are using
 elements

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.660
in the  section
of the page's HTML,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.050
or you can use 
elements in the sitemap 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.150
element specifying the page.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.820
And again, for more details,
please read the blog posts

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.190
that will be released.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.870
In order for Google to index
the content in your application

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.880
and for users to enter your
application from Google search

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.010
results, you must specify intent
filters in your application

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.120
manifest that define how
to reach specific content

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.630
inside of your application.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.380
And again, for more
details on doing this,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.736
please reference the blog posts.

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:03.360
Now, if you're an
Android developer who

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.810
has a web presence and
you want more control

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.320
over how your content
is accessed from search

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.390
via your website or your
Android application,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.320
App Indexing is a great
feature for you to explore.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.170
Also, enabling your website
and application for indexing

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.820
is a great way to
increase engagement

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.200
by making your content
more discoverable and more

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.880
accessible to users directly
from the search results page.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.740
