00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Google-Plex.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.830
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.125
And I'm here today
with Scott Jensen.

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:06.875
SCOTT JENSEN: Hey.

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: And Scott
is the maestro of all things

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.310
Internet of Things, and
in particular something

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.589
called the physical web.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:13.880
So we're going to get together.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.190
We're going to talk
about the physical web.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.950
And I know I'm going to learn
a lot, and I hope you do, too.

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.700
So Scott, physical web, that's
what we're here to talk about.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.600
Tell us all about it.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.980
SCOTT JENSEN: OK.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.146
Well, when people talk about
the Internet of Things,

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:31.390
there's so much to it.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.694
There's networking protocols
and data standards and so forth.

00:00:34.694 --> 00:00:37.110
But we're trying to solve the
front-end piece of it, which

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.150
is to say you want to walk up to
a device and be able to use it.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.440
So there's things like the
Nest, or Bluetooth door locks,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.850
or Zipcars.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.440
All these devices
today have an app

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.773
that you have to install to use.

00:00:47.773 --> 00:00:50.500
And that's fine, if you only
have two or three devices

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.534
in your life.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:53.200
But if we believe in
Moore's Law at all,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.640
there's going to be thousands if
not billions of these devices,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.070
a lot of them in public places.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.424
And apps just don't scale.

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:01.840
If you're in the
middle of a mall,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.489
you're not going to download an
app to talk to a movie poster.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.129
It's just not going to work.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.520
So we're trying to get rid
of all of that friction,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.484
so that you can just
with a couple of taps

00:01:09.484 --> 00:01:11.900
interact with the device that
you're standing in front of.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.630
Now, how does this get rid
of that kind of friction?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.750
How is it engineered to do that?

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.620
SCOTT JENSEN: Well,
the way we're doing it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.607
right now is we're using
Bluetooth low energy.

00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:18.940
It's a new version of Bluetooth.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.120
It's extremely low power.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.977
It broadcasts a URL in
the advertising packet.

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:25.060
And it does it once a
second, over and over again.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.100
But it's so low power, it's
actually measured in microamps.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.695
It's not even milliamps.

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:28.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Interesting.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.036
SCOTT JENSEN: So a
little tiny coin cell

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:31.190
can last for over a year.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.024
And of course, if you
attach it to something

00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:34.856
that's plugged into the
wall, it's infinite.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:37.110
But the intention is that
you just broadcast the URL

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.130
over and over again.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.250
And then your phone, or
your tablet, or eventually

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.550
your headset could
then just scan

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.760
for all the URLs in
the area around you

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.460
and then rank them
and let you pick.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.510
But it won't be shout-y.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.700
It won't be in your face.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.697
You will only be able to
do it if you ask for it.

00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:54.030
You open your phone, pull
down the notification manager,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.900
see what's nearby, and
then when you tap on it,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
it just takes you there.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.850
So it's meant to be
you're under control,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.930
and you do it when you're ready.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.510
Now, is there some
way of it being

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.710
able to filter out
the kind of things

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.270
that I'd be interested
in and the kind of things

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.240
that I'm not?

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.530
SCOTT JENSEN: Well, initially
what we're trying to do

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.122
is to get you to see the
thing that you're in front of.

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:10.830
But because we go
through a proxy server,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.527
we can kind of do
some safe searching

00:02:12.527 --> 00:02:14.860
and so make sure we get rid
o spam and things like that.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.167
But we also are
thinking about having

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:19.750
it have some sense of history,
so that the things that you use

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.420
more often will rise to the
top, or things in your house,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.745
you could actually star
so that it would actually

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:25.000
make sure it pops to the top.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.810
So we're experimenting with
a lot of different ways

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.830
to make sure that if you
do see a lot of things,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.630
the things that are
important to you show up.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
mentioned you're experimenting

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.670
a lot of different ways.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.086
What kind of stuff
have you built?

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.430
Anything fun or interesting?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.263
SCOTT JENSEN: Well,
what I've done right now

00:02:37.263 --> 00:02:38.975
is last year I
went and on eBay I

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:40.400
bought a vending
machine for $250.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.320
LAURENCE MORONEY:
A vending machine?

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.653
SCOTT JENSEN: And I bought
it myself, took it all apart,

00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:45.840
and put in a Raspberry
Pi, just to simulate

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.924
what we could start to do.

00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:49.048
And the idea is you walk
up to the vending machine.

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:50.470
It's broadcasting the URL.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.950
You then go to the website.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.640
And then, you can use any
kind of web payment means

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.370
that you want to.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.360
But then when I actually click
on the thing that I want,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.751
it just sends a
WebSocket message

00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.250
from the web server
to the Raspberry

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.874
Pi, which then spins
a little relay,

00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:02.040
and it just drops the candy.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.705
And the whole thing takes
less than 100 milliseconds.

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:04.560
It's kind of cool.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.860
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That is pretty cool.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.990
SCOTT JENSEN: And right
now, I'm just simulating

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.069
just the actual purchase.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.610
But we can do so
much more than that.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.750
Because when I actually
talked to Coke about this,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.480
they got really excited.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.240
And they were like,
wait a second,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.860
we could change the
whole experience

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.276
and be like,
"Welcome back, Scott.

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:17.730
Do you want Diet Dr Pepper?"

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.630
So it can remember.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.122
Or "I see that you've bought 10.

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:21.580
Do you want the
eleventh one free?"

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.990
So it's not just
simply about payment.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.390
It's actually about changing
the entire experience.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: So Scott, what
is it that brought you to this?

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.750
And what made you think of
working with the physical web?

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.170
SCOTT JENSEN: I'm actually
a UX designer by training.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.280
And I've worked an
awful lot with companies

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.719
that are trying to both use
websites and applications.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.260
And it became really
clear that there

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.200
was this effort involved
with using applications

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.726
for thin, lightweight things.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.350
And it became really
clear that there's

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.340
a UX issue involved about
being able to the interaction

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.380
as quickly as possible.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.640
At heart, it's really a user
experience of technology.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.200
Right?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.450
SCOTT JENSEN: Well, precisely.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.930
Because the web is this
really lovely white box

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.030
we call the DOM.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.730
And all these years,
but on top of it

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.940
we have this little URL
bar that hasn't really

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.700
changed in 25 years.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.630
It's a DOS prompt
on top of the web.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.640
We have to go dub,
dub, dub dot cnn dot.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.880
It's like, we haven't
changed that in so long.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.440
Why can't the mobile phone
browser use the same sensors

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.731
that every other app has?

00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:19.230
All the physical
web is trying to do

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.506
is let the browser
use the sensors that

00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:22.630
are on the phone in itself.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.945
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.460
So that gives the
scenario that you

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.710
were talking about earlier on.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.390
If I'm in a shopping mall
and I see a movie poster,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.600
that movie poster could
be broadcasting the URL.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.740
My phone sees that URL.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.837
And then that URL could
give me the trailer

00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:36.503
or give me a link to buy tickets
or something along those lines.

00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:37.310
SCOTT JENSEN: Oh, precisely.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: A much
better user experience

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.220
than me looking at
the poster and then

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.950
trying to pull out my
phone and figure out

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.870
how I can learn more about it.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.480
SCOTT JENSEN: Well,
and some people

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.340
have said, well, wait a second.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.100
We have QR codes.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.974
Why don't those work?

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:47.875
And QR codes tried
to solve a problem.

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.750
But as we all know, it
wasn't very effective,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.400
because no one's going
to take out their phone

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.650
and focus on one little thing.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.020
And we can do 50 URLs from 50
meters away simultaneously.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.570
It's a totally different idea.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.330
And by making it
UX-driven, we're

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.520
trying to make it
effortless and fast.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.212
And the technology, we initially
tried using Bluetooth regular

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:08.670
and realized it
wasn't appropriate.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.990
We even tried using Wi-Fi.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.120
It wasn't appropriate.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.850
So we've been trying to do this,
until Bluetooth as low energy

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.300
came out, that actually
made it kind of work.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.990
Cool.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.560
So you spoke about
the URL almost

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.720
being like the DOS
prompt of the internet,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.560
and this thing's
broadcasting URLs.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.727
So does that mean it's just
a browser-only technology?

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:28.435
SCOTT JENSEN: Well,
the advantage of URLs

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:30.040
is they're so flexible.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.551
So initially having the
URL take you to a web pages

00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:34.050
is the quickest,
lightest way to go.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.240
But it can also deeply get
into a native application.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.980
So when I was talking
to one company that

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.220
wanted to use this, they
already have an app.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.470
But they loved the idea that
the web browser would now

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.430
allow someone to walk
up to their device

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.195
and use it right away.

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:49.820
And then, once they
kind of get hooked,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.361
they can install
the app and then get

00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:52.770
a different kind of experience.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.780
So URLs cross both boundaries,
which is really quite nice.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.180
Yeah.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.050
Because, of course, it can
describe a web location,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.050
and it could describe
context in an application.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.892
SCOTT JENSEN: Well,
and also URLs are just

00:06:01.892 --> 00:06:03.100
really flexible in cool ways.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.940
Like, I have a
temperature sensor,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.330
and the URL can actually add
and ampersand t equal 72.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.090
So the URL can
dynamically change.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.120
Or if you want to
have a URL with an 8-

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.900
or 12-digit rotating ID that
can't be copied or spoofed

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.270
for extra-secure applications.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.580
So the URL provides
a lot of levers

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.060
that we can pull and grow
over time as this changes.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.630
So that makes it
really flexible.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.880
SCOTT JENSEN: Yes.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.450
Exactly.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Awesome.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.330
Cool.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.616
So now this kind
of thing has got

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:32.990
to be open for everybody to
be able to build with, right?

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.073
Or it doesn't really work.

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:35.960
What's the developer
story behind this?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.800
SCOTT JENSEN: Well, because
I'm on the Chrome team,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.200
and we're filled with a
bunch of goody two shoes

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.616
on the Chrome team,
we just really

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:42.390
want everything to be open.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.740
And it's a really cool team
to be involved with that.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.560
This is completely open source.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.720
So our prototype app is from
open source, the proxy server,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.660
the beacon firmware,
all of it is wide open

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.730
and there to be used.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.130
And we very much want this to
be effectively an extension

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.120
to the browser.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.681
So we want this to be on
every platform, every browser,

00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:00.180
everywhere.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.260
And so this is not
a Google product.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.630
And I mean, we're most likely
going to be implementing it

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.220
through Chrome eventually.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.415
But the goal though is to have
this be available to everyone.

00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:11.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.250
So where would the source be?

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.250
Or where can developers
get started with looking

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.470
at the [INAUDIBLE] now?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.400
SCOTT JENSEN: So
we have a GitHub.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.630
LAURENCE MORONEY:
There is a GitHub.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.050
Perfect.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.360
SCOTT JENSEN: And
we have two GitHubs.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.020
We have one for the
overall project called

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.811
the physical web, which
has the application

00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:22.710
and the proxy server.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.918
And then, we have a separate
one for just the beacon,

00:07:24.918 --> 00:07:27.300
which is called the URI
beacon, U-R-I beacon.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.400
And the intentions is--

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.900
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That kind of URI.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.990
SCOTT JENSEN: Yes.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.700
And we're trying to create
two different effectively

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.060
ecosystems.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.080
We're trying to create
an ecosystem of devices

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.144
that are broadcasting.

00:07:35.144 --> 00:07:37.060
And they're just always
broadcasting the URLs.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.972
And that needs to
be massively open.

00:07:38.972 --> 00:07:41.555
And that's where we're using the
Bluetooth low energy standard

00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:42.980
and the advertising packet.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.480
And it's just broadcasting those
things over and over again.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.070
And then, we have
a whole other cloud

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.980
of devices that are
listening and ranking.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.860
And we hope to be a
lot of experimentation.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.950
There is already somebody
who has implemented

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.222
for Google Glass, for example.

00:07:54.222 --> 00:07:55.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.426
SCOTT JENSEN: And someone
is trying for Firefox OS

00:07:57.426 --> 00:07:58.300
and things like that.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.630
So we've got lots
of different groups

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.790
that are playing around it.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.414
And they may try different ways
of ranking and organizing them.

00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:05.680
And that's to be expected,
and we hope that happens.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, you
mentioned on the hardware side

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.200
there's Bluetooth low energy.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.070
Is that the only standard?

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.760
Or are there others?

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.790
SCOTT JENSEN: Well,
Bluetooth low energy

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.680
is kind of the new black.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.721
Everyone's excited by it.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:13.800
Everyone's doing that.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.580
But we also have
support for MDNS,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.260
which is a Wi-Fi based
technology, which

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.470
is really handy, so that
if you're in your house,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.720
you don't necessarily want
your neighbor know you just

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.080
bought a 120-inch television.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.504
We actually have
ways around that.

00:08:26.504 --> 00:08:27.920
We talked about
ways, for example,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.429
that your TV could be
broadcasting an obfuscated URL.

00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:32.679
And then, when you walk up
to it and you first buy it,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.804
you could push a button
and then it gives you a URL

00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:36.251
that you can connect to.

00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:38.500
And then, it gives you a
cookie, because it's the web.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.120
And then, only you
can connect to it.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.286
So that's one way around it.

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:43.940
But MDNS goes through
your Wi-Fi network, which

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.466
really is much more secure.

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:47.840
And we've even had a German
research company, FontHopper,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.980
just go to our GitHub.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.542
And they added UPnP
support as well.

00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:51.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.333
SCOTT JENSEN: So we're
trying to effectively

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.306
be the technology of
broadcasting URLs.

00:08:55.306 --> 00:08:57.680
And we want to have multiple
ways in which it can happen.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.096
What I have noticed
is that people

00:08:59.096 --> 00:09:02.850
love open-source projects as
long as you do all the work.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.350
So I think what
people are waiting

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.010
for is for Google to get behind
this and to really push it.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.130
And then, once we get
behind it and start going,

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.229
then they're going to
say, it's open, right.

00:09:12.229 --> 00:09:13.770
And I think that's
the important part

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.160
about this is that we have
to kind of make the market.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.909
And we have to kind
of get people excited.

00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:19.510
But frankly, that's
so not a problem.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.640
We already have people
chomping at the bit

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.900
that we just have to kind
of get the ecosystem going.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.330
And so we're really hoping that
Microsoft, Firefox OS, even

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.444
Apple, will kind of
say, hey, we can kind of

00:09:31.444 --> 00:09:32.610
get on board with this, too.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:32.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.910
Now, is this something that has
to be built into the browser

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.300
and that's why you
mentioned those companies?

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.990
SCOTT JENSEN: Well,
building it into the browser

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.410
we feel is the
best way to do it,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.580
because that way it offers,
again, more competition.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.790
So if Chrome did it and Firefox
did it and you had them both,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.086
you can pick and choose
which way you want to do it.

00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:50.210
So we think this is more
appropriate at the browser

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.850
level than it is at the
operating system level.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.890
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Makes perfect sense.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.890
Cool.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.142
So everybody, that's it.

00:09:55.142 --> 00:09:57.100
We're finished in our
chat with Scott for today

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.210
on the physical web.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.460
Thanks, Scott, for being here.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:09:59.820
SCOTT JENSEN:
You're very welcome.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.790
Glad to be here.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.640
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I've learned so much

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.723
in just these few minutes.

00:10:02.723 --> 00:10:03.770
And I hope you have, too.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.599
And be sure to go check out
the GitHub on GitHub itself.

00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:08.140
You can just search
for physical web,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.030
and you'll find everything
that Scott has spoken about.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.400
And I believe, Scott,
you're constantly on there,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.670
you know, fixing code,
answering questions,

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.930
and all that kind of thing.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.180
SCOTT JENSEN: That's how
we want to engage people

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.900
That's the best way to do it.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: All right.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.310
So thanks, everybody.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.870
And again, thanks, Scott.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:36.510
