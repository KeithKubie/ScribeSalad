(light electronic music)

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.390
- Welcome to a Conversation with History,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.070
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.710
of International Studies.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.180
Our guest today is John Heilbron,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.380
Emeritus Professor of History

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.780
and History of Science at
Berkeley who is this year's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.570
Hitchcock Professor at Berkeley.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.520
Professor Heilbron
created the Office for the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.369
History of Science and Technology

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:53.753
during his 30 year tenure at Berkeley.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.430
He was the class of 1936
Professor of History

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.360
and the History of Science and also served

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.930
as Vice Chancellor and
Chair of the Berkeley

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.320
Division of the Academic Sen.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.260
Since his retirement, professor Heilbron

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760
has been a visiting
professor at UC Berkeley,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.130
Oxford University and Yale University.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130
He is honorary fellow of Worcester,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.718
Worcester College Oxford
and now lives in England.

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:28.950
John, welcome back to Berkeley.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.027
- Thank you Harry.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.750
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.320
- I was born and raised across
the bay in San Francisco.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.190
- And looking back, how do you think

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.690
your parents shaped your
thinking about the world?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.610
- Well I should say almost
completely when young.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.520
My father was very much
involved in civic life.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.170
He was an attorney, but he
served on the California,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.130
well served on, he headed
the board of trustees

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.102
of the California state
colleges, now state universities.

00:02:00.102 --> 00:02:03.413
So I grew up in a family in which,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.430
what the merits and
peccadillos of professors

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.713
were discussed at dinner.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.380
- And I would assume it was a home

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.296
with a book lined library?

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:18.910
- Yes, yes.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.670
- And the topics at the
dinner table in addition

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.670
to the difficulties of
dealing with faculty included?

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.430
- Well, almost anything.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.010
My father also was very active
in the World Affairs Council

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.410
of Northern California of which

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.690
he was its president for a time.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.220
And what else?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.493
He was a leading figure
in the Jewish community.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.853
And so,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.110
almost anything could turn
up at the dinner table.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.590
- Did you have any
teachers as a young person,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.060
I know you went to Lowell High School,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.870
that kind of influenced you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.230
in the direction of science?

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.680
- I don't think so.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.853
Lowell was and is a very
good general high school,

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:10.210
so one took languages
and history and science,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.910
but I didn't concentrate
on anything in particular.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.890
Mathematics, I did concentrate
on mathematics I suppose

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.740
and then I took all that was offered,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.110
but otherwise no, except I can
say that my physics teacher

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.560
was so bad that he,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.800
or she I think it was,
inspired me with a desire

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.240
to learn how anybody
or any subject so empty

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.970
could have built an atomic bomb,

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.370
or I should have been under,

00:03:40.994 --> 00:03:43.190
should have supplied the information

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.980
for building such a weapon.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.980
So like many other people influenced by,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.320
young people influenced by the standing

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.433
of the brilliant young physicists
in song and literature,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.407
I went into physics and studied
physics at the university.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.400
And it wasn't because of any
aptitude or any inspiration

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.760
that I received in high school.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.760
- So you saw physics as a
heroic discipline basically?

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:15.940
- Oh yeah, I started in 1951.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940
And still physicists were
bathed in this glow of glory.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.000
And it was a hard subject,
so people who wanted

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.543
mental exercise also
drifted in that direction.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.090
- And this would have been at the height

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.580
of the legitimacy of science
in the United States probably.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.350
- Well I didn't know it,
but of course during my

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.610
undergraduate years, the fight
over the National Science

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.093
Foundation took place.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.940
The AEC got involved or had been,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.540
stayed involved and all sorts of things,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.160
the Office of Naval
Research was supporting

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.750
so-called non-mission
oriented research everywhere.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.970
Yeah, but I didn't know
a thing about that.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.540
- And you actually came to Berkeley,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.657
so you just went across the bridge.

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:06.490
- Just across the bridge.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.203
- And what was Berkeley like then?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.810
- Well when I started it was still

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.240
full of veterans on the GI bill.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.100
So there was a certain maturity,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.030
or lack of it depending
on which set of veterans

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.500
you happen to, and they were,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.500
by and large, intent upon
moving forward their careers

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.960
because of course they were older.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.700
But they also had a lot of school spirit

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.370
so they filled the football
stadium, and so on.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.700
It was quite, I think,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.840
useful to have this older crowd around.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.523
Then they disappeared
by the time I graduated.

00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:53.010
But I still feel from what my

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.240
father and mother, who were
also Berkeley graduates

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.763
told me about their time
that it wasn't so different.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.770
It was of course in the 50s

00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.663
where students were relatively docile.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.360
- And Berkeley at that time really lacked

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.633
the multi-cultural dimension that it.

00:06:12.508 --> 00:06:15.695
- I, well multi-cultural,

00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:18.670
certainly it's not as varied as it is now.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.940
But the Asian community, San
Francisco Asian community

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.310
was full, the university had a great many

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.660
students from the San
Francisco Asian community

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.650
many of whom I knew from high school

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.550
because Lowell, even then,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.550
was largely, though not
yet a majority, Asians.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.860
So,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.280
but the groups kept, to
some extent, separate.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.350
I did lose track of many of these friends,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.250
which I regretted.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.130
- You majored in physics.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.060
- [John] Yes.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.680
- And what was the physics
department like then,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.388
because the titans were
walking through the doors.

00:06:59.388 --> 00:07:03.000
They had been here or were still here.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.360
- Yes, when I started graduate school

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.240
in physics here, Ernest Lawrence was still

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.090
among the living.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.651
McMillan, Alvarez,

00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:16.600
Seaborg, they were all around.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.753
But I was too dumb really to know it.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.160
- You should have taken
history of science.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.280
- I really should have done,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.247
because I never set eyes on Lawrence,

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.747
which is a shame because
I wrote a book about him.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.930
I did gradually understand
the importance of Alvarez

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.930
and company when it came time
to choose a thesis advisor.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.070
But no, although there was a portrait

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.900
of Lawrence hanging in the library,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.793
which did give some
hagiographical slant to things.

00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:58.610
At least to the undergraduates

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.210
and beginning graduate students,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.510
the glory that was
Berkeley was not trumpeted.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.170
- And so at what point,

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.700
before graduation as an undergraduate

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.030
or after did you move to
the history of science?

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.350
Did you go to gradate
school in the sciences also?

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.990
- [John] Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.823
- Yeah, yeah.

00:08:19.823 --> 00:08:21.693
- No, I was a very slow learner.

00:08:23.887 --> 00:08:26.880
No, I was in graduate school in physics

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.540
for three or four years
when I finally decided,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.090
I was working on a dissertation in fact

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.240
when I decided that that really was not

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.030
what I wanted to do.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.550
And so I went down to
the history department,

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.510
I'd always been interested
in medieval history.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.630
I went down to the history department

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.580
to ask whether they would have me.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.600
I was referred to a medievalist,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.410
and he patted me on the
head, almost literally,

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.260
in an avuncular way and he said son,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.600
go back and finish your degree,
the country needs physicists

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.283
it does need medievalists.

00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:01.218
- Oh dear.

00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:02.883
- Which was certainly true.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.463
And so I went back doing work more,

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:09.710
this medievalist neglected to tell me

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.120
there was a person named Thomas Kuhn

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.390
just arrived on the faculty
who was fresh from Harvard

00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:20.360
and an historian of science,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.803
who was desperate for students.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.370
So eventually I came to
know Kuhn and I changed.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.840
- I'm a little curious
about your thought processes

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.360
in making the switch before
you found the place in history

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.270
was, what did you see about yourself

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.230
and the work that you were doing,

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.760
or was it the issue area,
namely you thought it was

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.900
more important to put science
in the context of history?

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.853
- I wish I could say that, but in fact,

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.900
as I worked into my dissertation topic

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.070
I realized I'd have to
know more mathematics,

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.730
quite a bit more mathematics to do it.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.933
And so I thought as long
as I was going to retool,

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.140
why don't I do it in something
that interested me more?

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.210
Not to save society,
not because I felt that

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.730
physics was going the wrong direction,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.923
no big issue at all.

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:22.160
Just simple desire to follow

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.180
what appeared to me to be my interest

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.313
and perhaps a slightly stronger
suit than I had in physics.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.053
- Tell me about Kuhn because I know when,

00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:38.420
when the 60s came around I was here

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.940
in graduate school,
his work was considered

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.630
so very important in understanding
scientific revolutions.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.630
How was he as a teacher and
what was his influence on you?

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.600
- Well he was a terrific
teacher if you happened

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.740
to find something that worked in well

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.120
with the structure of
scientific revolution.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.120
And I was lucky in finding
such a vein early on.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.640
And so he was, for a
time, much more interested

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.253
in my work than I was, and
that's wonderful for a beginner.

00:11:17.768 --> 00:11:20.500
And so enthusiasm,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.980
good ideas about where to look for things,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.537
a pretty general ignorance about history.

00:11:27.537 --> 00:11:28.370
- He had.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.810
- Yeah, he had.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.473
- He had started in physics too, right?

00:11:31.473 --> 00:11:33.210
- Well he had done more than start,

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.790
he got through his PhD in physics

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.150
and then he got caught
up in this Conant program

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.370
at Harvard to teach undergraduates the,

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.680
what do they call it, the
tactics and strategy of science.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.830
Which meant in effect, exposing
them to what they called

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.350
case studies of the history of science,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.160
but of past science,
science so remote that even

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.113
a Harvard undergraduate
could understand it.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.620
And so from that, people
were to understand

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.230
how difficult it is to arrive at usable,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.260
effective scientific theories

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.854
and would then cheerfully pay their taxes

00:12:16.854 --> 00:12:21.040
to support science during what was then,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.403
when Conant began to plan,
the beginning of the Cold War.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.570
- Now, and what was the
topic of your dissertation

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.083
that interested Kuhn?

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.259
- Oh actually it wasn't my dissertation.

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:37.530
- Oh it was what you
were interested in, okay.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.160
- No it was the first set of papers

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.420
I wrote for him as a student.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.630
They had to do with early electricity,

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.220
electricity primarily in the 18th century.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:51.220
And it happened that the
development of the subject

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.740
fit his ideas fairly well.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.920
And so he was quite interested.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.110
My thesis was on the
history of atomic models,

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.543
20th century quantum theory
and things like that,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.440
which was an outgrowth of a project

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.627
that he headed up and I participated in

00:13:11.627 --> 00:13:16.627
to interview quantum
physicists and to collect their

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.973
documents, letters, records, papers.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.060
- And just in passing,
what department was he in?

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.000
Was he in philosophy or he was in history?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.100
- He was half, he began half in history

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.860
and half in philosophy.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.720
But then when it came time
for the tenure decision,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.693
He became 100% in history.

00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:38.060
- I see, okay.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.060
Let's talk a little about doing history

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.780
and then the history of science.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.760
What do you see as the skills involved

00:13:51.141 --> 00:13:53.723
in doing the work that you do?

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.870
- Other than patience?

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.210
- Well yeah, patience, I was
gonna ask you about that.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.310
- Well that is one, just to
revert to Kuhn for a minute,

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.780
that's one of the things that
he lacked as an historian.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.640
He didn't have the
metabolism of an historian.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.473
Sluggish.

00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:14.320
- (laughing) Patience is better.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.550
- Patience is perhaps better.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.633
And the idea of,

00:14:20.346 --> 00:14:22.990
reading lots of documents,
many of which are going

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.773
to yield very little was
not his notion of good fun.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.920
- So but what else?

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.490
Students watching this program,

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.150
patience okay, if you
don't have it don't do it.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.940
- Well I think you need
a funny combination

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.373
of patience and boldness.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.700
So that you have to impose
your structure on the world.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.330
Reading historical
documents does not give you

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.593
history as you know.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.913
And you need to have
principles for selection

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.460
and for organization which naturally means

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.430
you're going to leave things out.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.620
However, a third point, you have to have

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.520
respect for the evidence.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.420
And some of the things
that are written now,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.900
and no doubt were always written,

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.540
but of which I'm
particularly conscious now,

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.790
have some good ideas
and no doubt the writer

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.710
tries to impose upon the material,

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.950
but the way of arguing, the
way of treating evidence,

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.950
respect for the testimony of
the past, is often lacking.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.393
So I would say to anybody out
there who might be listening,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.160
common sense way of arguing is far better

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.900
often than these fancy
methods that are dreamt up

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.610
in order to limit the materials to suit

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.623
a certain point of view.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.900
So Harry, if you're
going to be an historian,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.060
you must cultivate
patience, you must cultivate

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.380
respect for the sources,

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.710
and by respect I mean not only taking them

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.276
at face value, insofar as you can,

00:16:07.276 --> 00:16:10.810
but also paying attention to what others

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.190
have written about the subject.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.000
I think that too many beginners think that

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.440
they should begin with the archives,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.610
with the first piece of
paper that was written

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:24.770
on some such subject.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.140
They early learn that that's not possible,

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.550
then they go to imposing their will.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.560
But you have to read
good secondary writers

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.490
and you have to know their points of view,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.760
so as to be able to judge them.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.050
But we too, despite what Kuhn said,

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.313
we too, we historians, we
build upon our predecessors.

00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:49.530
- In listening to your
lectures and looking

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.210
at some of your books,
I think when one gets

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.030
into science there's really

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.150
two important things that stand out.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.520
One, in your lectures,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.390
to in a way be a cosmopolitan yourself,

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.350
be well-versed in languages

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:12.350
and to essentially play
off the conversation

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.280
in different parts of the world

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.820
during an historical period.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.020
Is that fair?

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.170
- Yeah, this is one of the
old slogans in history.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.440
You're able to converse with
whatever mind you choose

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.510
from the past, well
that's a little bit bold.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.473
But certainly if you know
the language of this person,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.410
then you can enter into
some kind of relationship.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.410
Perhaps a bit of a necro,
a bit of necromancy is,

00:17:42.934 --> 00:17:47.934
is required, but that's one of
the great treats of history.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.217
It frees you from time and place.

00:17:53.217 --> 00:17:57.644
- And to really get into the head

00:17:57.644 --> 00:18:00.620
of the principle you're looking at.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.630
Because on the one hand
he may be a scientist

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.820
but on the other hand he
may think he's god basically

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.081
or a prophet as you discussed
in yesterday's lecture.

00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:14.350
- Yes, though I would not
presume to get into the mind

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.963
of anyone who thought himself god.

00:18:18.505 --> 00:18:23.505
But in fact, one has
to, of course construct

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.733
the persona of this person
with whom you are conversing.

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:33.740
And you're not climbing into his head

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.560
and thinking his thoughts.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.630
You are constructing from what

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.530
remains there may be, which are not

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.646
necessarily only literary.

00:18:43.646 --> 00:18:46.067
What sort of paintings
did this person like,

00:18:46.067 --> 00:18:47.543
what sort of music?

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.710
And so on.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.000
But you are constructing
an artificial person,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
and your success depends
upon, very similar to,

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.320
how you are able to make
use of what is known

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.910
in order to construct a plausible picture.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.776
A bit like a novelist but
you're more constrained.

00:19:10.776 --> 00:19:13.720
- And also in the history of science,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.180
it's very clear in looking at your work,

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.810
you really have to understand
the technical issues,

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.510
the struggle with ideas in the science

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.010
that the figure you're
writing about was involved in.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.660
- It's best to be able to do that, yes.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.643
- Not absolutely required, yes.

00:19:33.108 --> 00:19:37.083
But also then to be able
to write about it clearly.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.454
- Yeah.

00:19:39.454 --> 00:19:42.096
- Because you may put down the formulas,

00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:44.870
but in fact you have to explicate

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.360
because the people who may
be your primary readers

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.280
are not necessarily
scientifically trained.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.820
- Well you're absolutely right,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.570
you have your finger on a
big problem which gets more

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.000
difficult as the science you review

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.120
comes closer to the present
and gets more difficult.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.772
That's why I mentioned in
Harvard case studies method,

00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:12.180
the idea was to use old dead science

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.250
because it was qualitative
and didn't make such

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.040
great demands upon the students.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.510
So, right, how then to inform people,

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.590
in an interesting way, about
what you have found out

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:27.233
about some persons who science,

00:20:27.233 --> 00:20:32.233
they may need some background
to understand? Yeah.

00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:37.340
- In looking at your

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.653
publications,

00:20:41.432 --> 00:20:44.060
there are three biographies

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.190
of scientists in different periods.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.023
Or at least of the ones
that I sort of looked at.

00:20:53.422 --> 00:20:55.022
I'm trying to think, Max Planck,

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.070
Lawrence.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.210
- [John] An Englishman named Mosley.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.330
- And Mosley, yeah.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.163
And so,

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.110
was it a common set of problems in all,

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.860
in digging in and coming to understanding?

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.640
They had very different life stories

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.940
and they lived in very different eras.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.480
- Well partly opportunism.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.560
So in the case of Mosley
I found a big chunk

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.920
of letters that nobody knew existed,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.673
and that was a lot of fun.

00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:27.220
I tracked them down in an old Saxon house

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.403
way out in the country in England.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.420
Planck was something the same,

00:21:33.718 --> 00:21:35.760
I by chance happened to find out,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.050
well actually another
project I was working on

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.320
found out that although Planck's own home

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.330
and his papers had been
destroyed by the US Army

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.803
Air Force during the war,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.280
second world war, there
were great quantities

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.170
of the letters he had
written that had been

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.010
preserved by people like Einstein

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:00.090
and Bohr and von Laue and so forth.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.580
So, that made another

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.490
set of material that
nobody had worked up before

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.070
and as for the third one, Lawrence,

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.450
that had to do once
again with circumstances

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:18.450
that made it opportune,
reasonable to tackle

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.180
Lawrence at the time.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.180
So I cannot claim any
organic unity to that work.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.140
In 10 years time if
I'm asked to reminisce,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.870
I'll probably construct,
I will have constructed

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.880
some line that ties them all together.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.473
But you can take it from
me that there is none.

00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:41.330
- There is none.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.810
- Except that I do like
the genre biography.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.900
And I'm engaged in a biography right now

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.150
which is about a guy who
couldn't be more different

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.480
than any of those three or
from myself, for that matter.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.840
An Italian who lived from 1663 to 1729.

00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:05.650
And who to me is very interesting

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.303
because he was an expert
at so many things.

00:23:11.355 --> 00:23:15.026
- And who do you see as
your primary audience

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:16.893
as an historian of science?

00:23:17.769 --> 00:23:20.060
I mean I know that you
probably want to reach

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.060
a wider audience than either
historians or scientists,

00:23:25.075 --> 00:23:27.403
but what is the answer here?

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.410
- I've changed of course, over the years.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.830
When I began I felt, as do many beginners,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.840
rightly, they should write for those

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.090
who are gonna judge them.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.860
But gradually I have tried
to reach wider audiences

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.973
and my test for that is simple.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.710
Does my conversation about
these subjects interest anybody?

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:59.280
And if the answer is no, I
realize that I'm probably

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.630
not going to succeed

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.420
in attracting a readership.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.730
I don't want a great big readership,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.970
but I would like to be able to

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.970
say that at least some
of my work has interested

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.170
and diverted, and maybe
possibly instructed

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.183
more than a handful of people.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.270
- I'm curious about this
focus on personality

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.650
in these three biographies.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:32.650
Do you see that as a way to
draw people in to elevating

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.900
consciousness about the problems
in the history of science?

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.220
Because it's fascinating.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.460
In the case of Mosley, just
zipping through the book,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.123
the whole idea that he died so young.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.270
- [John] A biographer's delight.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:53.270
- Yeah, you could make a romantic
40s movie out of his life.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.283
- You could.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:02.470
Well yes, it does enable
you to draw people in

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.050
with some kind of an obvious human hook.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.683
It also provides a chronology ready-made,

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.930
and provides a selection
process ready-made.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.193
So in a way biography is one
of the easiest of genres.

00:25:21.516 --> 00:25:26.516
Though I think you do
need a little bit of a

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.720
novelist's touch to create the persona.

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:39.056
- Was doing the work on
Lawrence in the Lawrence Lab

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.780
easier or harder?

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.130
I mean obviously you were
here, you knew many of the

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.163
principles who were still living.

00:25:50.055 --> 00:25:52.658
But the material was all here.

00:25:52.658 --> 00:25:56.707
So what, was there any particular

00:25:56.707 --> 00:26:01.160
intellectual problem set
that you had to deal with

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.808
as you got into this material?

00:26:02.808 --> 00:26:03.641
- Well a little bit,

00:26:03.641 --> 00:26:08.280
but if I can revise the
question a little bit.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.160
- [Harry] Oh please do, please.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.290
- Although all the material about,

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:15.413
virtually all the material
about the laboratory was here,

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:21.610
my interest also had to do
with visitors to the lab.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.940
And so I read a lot of letters

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.950
from visitors back to
their home countries,

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.690
which required visiting archives abroad.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.300
And the only reason I mention that is that

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.190
one of the, if the book has any strengths,

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.640
one of them is that the laboratory is seen

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.820
not only through the eyes
of those who worked here,

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.900
but also through the eyes of visitors,

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.880
some of whom were not as
ecstatic about the way

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.600
things were done as were the

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.553
cronies of Lawrence.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.210
- And Lawrence as a figure was

00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:07.010
a very colorful guy, an entrepreneur,

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.843
and,

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.610
that dimension of his career stands out

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.160
as much as his science I think.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.818
- Oh yeah.

00:27:16.818 --> 00:27:19.330
The 30s which we're talking about,

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.770
during the 30s, Lawrence
changed quite a bit.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.207
So one of the interesting features,

00:27:24.207 --> 00:27:29.000
or one of the interesting
story lines in this history

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
is to show how Lawrence
began as a sort of comrade

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.793
of the senior students in the laboratory.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.680
Gradually as the search for money and the,

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:48.000
his association with the
people who could provide it,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.293
turned him to the right,

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.813
well he developed.

00:27:54.918 --> 00:27:57.560
With consequences that we
try to point out in the book.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.390
I say we because I had a co-author.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.203
We must acknowledge Robert Seidel.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.693
- And is that the Seidel
who worked with Oppenheimer?

00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:11.460
- No he was a graduate student of mine.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.310
- Oh he was a graduate student, okay.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.160
You did a book, a very
well-received book which won

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.920
the Pfizer Prize called
The Sun in the Church:

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.320
Cathedrals as Solar Observatories.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.208
How did you wind up doing that?

00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:34.170
It sounds utterly fascinating
because it points to a link

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:38.330
between science and
religion that the popular

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.774
notions are just wrong about.

00:28:40.774 --> 00:28:45.774
- Well this was the greatest
research project I ever had.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.790
Because, I didn't have to be

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.683
to the research site, as it were,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.490
which were these
cathedrals which served as

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.693
solar observatories until noon.

00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:01.278
(laughing)

00:29:02.455 --> 00:29:06.423
After my deep observation,

00:29:07.276 --> 00:29:08.910
I had to adjourn to the (foreign language)

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.113
around the corner to,

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.743
what shall I say, digest
my research material.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.700
There again I cannot claim
that I had gone around

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.270
searching for a topic
that would illuminate

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.330
the connections between
religion and science,

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.020
but rather tripped over
one of these long lines

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.697
embedded in the pavement
of a cathedralist,

00:29:35.715 --> 00:29:36.963
well it's not a cathedral.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.300
Let's see, where was it?

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.470
At some San Pietro in
Bologna, a cathedral.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:45.303
Which,

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.760
runs for about 250 feet.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.783
And this line is a noon mark.

00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:58.480
So the sun stands directly over
in the meridian of the place

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.780
at noon, and from the position

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.950
of the sun's image on
this line during different

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.810
parts of the year, the sun
is higher in the summer

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.943
as the image is closer to the vertical.

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:16.943
You can learn things
about the solar orbit.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.440
And ultimately these
things got to be so precise

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.750
you could tie down or answer the question

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:28.290
whether the earth's axis
remains at the same angle

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.790
to the plain of its
motion during the year.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.370
This is a very subtle effect
and it was first tied down

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.500
at the solar observatory,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.030
I meant these cathedral observatories.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.784
That fascinated me.

00:30:39.784 --> 00:30:44.480
Then I tried to study as many

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.900
as I could find,

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.283
which did contribute to astronomy.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.230
And in the process found out
all kinds of things about

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:57.230
the relationship between
astronomy and the Catholic church

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.350
in the years after the
condemnation of Galileo.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:06.080
That turned out to be quite
illuminating to see how,

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.137
what was, no matter what
you had to say about it,

00:31:09.137 --> 00:31:10.810
no matter which side
of the story you stand,

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.833
was a stupid administrative decision.

00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:18.960
And so then better administrators
of the next generation

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.010
had to figure out how to impose this

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.620
prohibition against the
teaching of Copernicanism,

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.510
this sun-centered universe.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:35.510
And the ingenious ways
that administrators found

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.050
to look the other way,
and astronomers found

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.743
not to incite them.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:46.030
This I thought was a
minuet which I had seen

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.293
performed before.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:50.523
- [Harry] In many different contexts.

00:31:50.523 --> 00:31:51.663
- In many different contexts.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.210
With the consequence
that long, long before

00:31:57.321 --> 00:32:00.840
the proscription against
heliocentrism was removed

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.980
from the index of prohibitive books,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.030
it was standard to teach
the Copernican astronomy

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.900
in Catholic schools, even by the Jesuits.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.900
- And one issue here was
that the church needed

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:18.990
to know exactly when Easter occurred.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.830
So there was an instrumental reason,

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:24.520
among I'm sure many others,
that led them to sort

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.210
of wink, sort of.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:31.210
- Yes, although to establish Easter,

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.953
and Easter is a lunar solar holiday.

00:32:38.652 --> 00:32:41.620
That means that calendrical
problem associated with it

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.700
has to do with bodies
that could just as well

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.470
go around the earth, one
of them does, the moon.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.960
And as for whether the
sun goes around the earth

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.344
or vice versa, it doesn't matter.

00:32:52.344 --> 00:32:54.830
It's only when you get
the planets into the story

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.883
that Copernicus is so
much better, clearer.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.590
Anyway, so you didn't have
to go to a new astronomy,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.350
but you has to use astronomers in order

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.890
to tie down the parameters
that would give you

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.000
the basis for calculating
Easter more exactly.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.230
And astronomers were interested
in the newest astronomy.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:21.230
So you were having to deal
with people whose interests

00:33:21.683 --> 00:33:25.470
would naturally cause
them to pay no attention

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.230
to your prohibitions.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.421
Also I should say that the same people who

00:33:30.421 --> 00:33:32.630
would be interested in calendrics,

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.190
who would be interested in astronomy

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:37.482
whether new or old, are also the guys

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:41.190
whom you would call to repair the church.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.101
Because applied mathematics
included astronomy,

00:33:44.101 --> 00:33:48.100
fortification, canalization of rivers,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.980
hydraulics, navigation, astrology,

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.390
whatever you want that
applied mathematics,

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:57.000
and they were, of course,
necessary for the upkeep

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.950
of the church's fabric, buildings,

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.793
and also surveying of domains,

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.100
keeping control of the rivers.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.648
One of the most frequent
things that mathematicians

00:34:09.648 --> 00:34:12.400
in Italy did in the 17th and 18th century

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.860
was to advise various governments

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.310
on how to control the rivers.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:22.113
- You, during your career at Berkeley,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.033
became the Vice Chancellor.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.450
So to a very a important
role on the campus,

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:33.460
namely the top academic officer

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.890
and the person who really runs the campus,

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:37.970
you brought

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.810
a unique perspective as
a historian of science.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.140
Or did it matter?

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.130
So I guess what I'm trying to ask you is,

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.603
did being an historian of science,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.210
was that a good thing
to have under your belt

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.810
when you undertook the role?

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:54.950
- Well I think that it was useful

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:57.550
in that I could speak out
of both sides of my mouth.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.980
So I have the vocabulary
that enabled me to talk

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.760
to at least some scientists
and to some humanists

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.270
including historians.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.453
And that was a benefit.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.870
It was a most interesting experience,

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.780
and I think if I can
refer back to my interest

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.410
in how administrators
in the Catholic church

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.860
handled the proscription

00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:29.770
we were speaking about a minute ago,

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.550
I think that interest arose from my own

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.533
academic administrative responsibilities.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:40.743
And so, that has proved,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.790
that proved useful to me in
other approaches to history.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.530
So I recommend that if you can do it,

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.510
take on some kind of administrative role

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.263
and find out what other
people really are like.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.065
- So, okay now I want to understand this.

00:35:58.065 --> 00:35:59.310
There are two things that stand out

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.560
both in your lectures and
here in our conversation,

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.890
you have a real sense of whimsy

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.080
and then you're now
talking about the limits

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.910
of what can be achieved in organizations

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.170
because of the way people are,

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.620
human nature and people's
interests and so on.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.230
So, did that come from

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.760
your study of history?

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.160
Or was there a synergy
between those studies

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.030
and what you were learning
as an administrator?

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.780
- Well I'd like to think there was.

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:38.563
And yes, perhaps there was.

00:36:43.686 --> 00:36:45.853
The recognition that,

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.653
institutions, though they
may have a single name,

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.620
contain a lot of different
disparate elements.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.300
And, if you apply that insight,

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.050
which you don't have to
have been an administrator

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.990
to have achieved, to the Catholic church,

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.170
you don't go around saying
that the church did this,

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:09.273
the church did that.

00:37:10.152 --> 00:37:13.570
You know perfectly well
there were Franciscans,

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.843
and there were Dominicans, and Jesuits,

00:37:17.093 --> 00:37:19.410
and the Vatican and
the cardinals all going

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.720
different directions and so forth,

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.540
so that the decisions
that it finally reached,

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.300
that is the church, the
Catholic church finally reached

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.463
were often negotiated ones.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.660
- So an awareness of the
complexity of institutions, yeah.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:39.465
- And of course, then there
was geographical distances.

00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:44.393
- As Vice Chancellor, was
there ever a time where you

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.351
sort of concluded that you
were really learning something

00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:51.860
about the organization of science

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.970
that you had not known as an historian

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.923
or had not come across
in your previous work?

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.833
- Yes, I think so.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.567
You learn various things
of great importance.

00:38:04.567 --> 00:38:07.516
For example, who wrote the memo?

00:38:07.516 --> 00:38:10.260
(laughing)

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.430
You know, you have a
conversation with somebody

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.400
about something that needs to be done,

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.220
and you agree what is to be said,

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.200
and then the other fellow
goes and writes you

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.110
your memo which you then respond to.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:28.110
So I learned that you can't even tell

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:32.350
from the signature who
had the principle input

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.710
into a document, it might
very well be the recipient

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.663
and not the sender.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:41.050
I learned any number of things

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.520
which I probably should not disclose.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:48.520
But one of the things I learned
about was that our faculty,

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.303
whose minds are so vast,
they encompass the universe,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.563
are generally unable to understand
the concept of overhead.

00:39:01.459 --> 00:39:06.330
And so, one of the most
interesting parts of my job

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:10.260
was trying to explain to
a disbelieving faculty

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.781
that they did not own the overhead

00:39:12.781 --> 00:39:15.840
recovered by the university,
under research grant.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.880
- We should explain to
our audience when you get,

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.530
say a Federal grant, there
is a charge put on the grant

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.540
which the university
gets because of its costs

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.840
in running the university.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.130
- That's it.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:33.923
Which, when I was here,
was a little under 50%.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.890
- We just interviewed
Donald Kennedy yesterday

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.950
and this topic came up,
so it must be something

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.760
dear to the hearts.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.538
Is there, in your role as Vice Chancellor,

00:39:46.538 --> 00:39:50.520
what was your biggest
challenge, basically?

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.270
Was there one particular problem

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:57.090
that you had to deal with
that stands out in retrospect

00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.620
or that was a problem
of the particular time

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.810
when you were the Vice Chancellor?

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.273
- Well I think we had a lot of problems.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.584
But they were, many of them,

00:40:10.584 --> 00:40:15.584
of the standard kind that can't
be solved, just ameliorated.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.320
But, they were to some degree intensified

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:25.280
by the fact that during the
four years I was Vice Chancellor

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.580
our state budget was
cut regularly each year.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.893
Now that's bad.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.903
But it's not all bad.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.690
Because, if you have to
make deep enough cuts

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.290
then you have to make decisions.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.920
And I think that although
that was probably

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.893
the toughest thing we had to do,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.970
nonetheless it was in some
since the most creative.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.900
When everything is going very well

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.120
and this year you're
incrementally better than you were

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.450
last year, you don't go back to anything

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:04.210
like zero based budgeting,
you just let things go.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:08.050
But if you have to cut,
what I've now forgotten,

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.620
but it was something
like an accumulated cut

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.680
of 30% of state funds,
then you're talking about

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.930
decisions of importance.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.690
And I think that we,

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.560
on the whole, navigated fairly
well through that bad time

00:41:25.953 --> 00:41:30.953
and were able to, by creative
use of such things as

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.563
the retirement incentives,

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.710
which enables us to
switch some money about,

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.820
managed to get through
without doing real damage

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.860
to the program, instructional
and research program

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.760
of the university.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.340
- When you have budget
cuts and I'm not talking

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.090
about your tenure as Vice Chancellor,

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:57.030
it's often the case that the humanities

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:01.730
suffer more than the other disciplines.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.960
Are we gonna pay a price for that

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.160
in the sense that it would
seem as there's more and more

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.100
change with science, that the humanities

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.550
are more important than ever.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.779
- Well that would be my position.

00:42:17.779 --> 00:42:22.600
The question whether the
humanities are more vulnerable

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.560
to budget cuts or not,
this is not so easy to say

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.500
because the overhead in the sciences,

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.763
having to do with laboratories
and so on and so forth,

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.743
does in some respects
make it more vulnerable.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.563
When all your money is in
salaries of tenured faculty,

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.030
it's hard to say anything without
closing down a department.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.530
If you ever tried to do that around here,

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.440
you will know that there are some causes

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.133
that are truly hopeless.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:58.859
So yes, but not perhaps
they're more vulnerable

00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:01.760
because they're loaded

00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:06.600
here on tenured faculty.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.710
There isn't much you can do

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.730
except not to fill vacant slots

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.530
which is one of the things that we did.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:19.450
We just let openings accumulate
and use the salary savings

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.303
for programmatic purposes.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.760
But the other question
would be something like

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:31.660
does the growth of the

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.710
engineering side of the natural sciences,

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.550
engineering applications
of the natural sciences,

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:41.120
and business on the campus threaten

00:43:44.374 --> 00:43:48.570
the health of the humanities,
in which I include history.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.240
Well I'm glad to say I'm
not close enough an observer

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.230
of what's going on at
Berkeley at the moment

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:57.030
to offer and kind of definitive answer,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.430
but I would think that from
a general point of view,

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.093
you could not help but worry.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:08.280
And one of the problems here I believe

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.903
is that the humanities and,

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.540
the more humane social sciences

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.030
are not sufficiently aggressive.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.667
- Getting back to the history of science

00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:24.040
and this whole question of the humanities

00:44:25.765 --> 00:44:28.290
and the situation we
find ourselves in today,

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:33.290
why is the history of science
important for science?

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.443
- Yes.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.010
Well, I think the history
of science is important

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.648
for science in the same way that history

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:49.648
is important for everybody,
for society at large.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.780
And history of science
may be of greater interest

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.250
to scientists than the history of Greece

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.030
or something like that, but maybe not.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.590
I know lots of scientist
who would far rather read

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.240
the history of the middle ages

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:12.240
than of what, the history of
science during the 19th century

00:45:13.579 --> 00:45:16.993
which to many of them is as
distant as the middle ages.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.493
But it's history that one
ought to read and ponder

00:45:27.111 --> 00:45:31.990
and use to take distance from
one's own immediate position.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.143
And perhaps,

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.090
such study might render one less arrogant

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:43.697
and less confident that the solutions

00:45:44.831 --> 00:45:47.930
of all time are to be found just right now

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:49.073
by our generation.

00:45:51.117 --> 00:45:56.117
A certain amount of
humility is often engendered

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.433
by a study of history,
often not to be sure.

00:46:01.937 --> 00:46:05.050
But, so I wouldn't say
that the history of science

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:10.050
provided anything in the
grand picture for a scientist

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:14.460
more than history itself,
and maybe general history

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.940
would be even more useful.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:20.760
However, as a pedagogic tool,
I think the history of science

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.003
has much to offer that has
not been capitalized upon.

00:46:25.003 --> 00:46:26.710
- For example?

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.060
- For example the standard
textbook presentation

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.080
which tends to be
axiomatic and by principle,

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.070
I mean not necessarily formally axiomatic,

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:41.070
but it's arranged in some
sort of logical order,

00:46:41.511 --> 00:46:44.290
does not reach all minds.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:49.290
Some people find it much
easier to digest information

00:46:49.403 --> 00:46:52.733
in the same way almost
in which it was found.

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.880
And if not that, some
sort of combination of

00:47:00.994 --> 00:47:03.820
a wider approach to the subject matter

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.910
and the more principled

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.090
delivery of knowledge
which is now possible.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:16.360
And another thing is it
can be psychologically

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:21.360
very encouraging or reassuring
for students to find out

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:27.370
that Galileo or Bohr or
Maxwell didn't come to their

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:32.680
theories in a flash of
genius, but rather worked

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.780
very hard on them and faced problems

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.660
that were just the same
problems that an undergraduate

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.350
today has to struggle with.

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:45.820
I've had some moderate
success in teaching people

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.820
quantum mechanics by bringing
them back to the problems

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.483
that caused people to invent
it in the first place.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:00.090
And to show that these
inventors had terrible problems

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.440
and sometimes exactly the same problems

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.150
that the student today had.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.080
Thermodynamics is another good case

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.160
where an historical
approach can be useful.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.840
I don't say it's useful for everything,

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.840
but only that it is an unmined source.

00:48:15.992 --> 00:48:19.740
- And in a society where
the consequences of science

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.390
are greater and greater
every day and we have

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:27.000
to inform out citizenry
about how to think about

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:31.380
science in the public
realm, what you're saying

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:35.410
strikes me as kind of an interesting way

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:37.822
to elevate that general conscious.

00:48:37.822 --> 00:48:39.790
- Well that's one thing,
but I'm glad you brought

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:40.930
the matter up in the way you did,

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.220
because it allows me to say
I think history of science

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.290
is much more important for non-scientists

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:46.333
than for scientists.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:51.512
And that's one reason I try to write

00:48:51.512 --> 00:48:53.573
a little bit more broadly.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.610
- If students were
watching this interview,

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:01.840
how would you advise them
to prepare for the future,

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.200
whether as an historian or not?

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.430
Is there some lesson that
we can draw here about

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.140
understanding

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.870
current events, what's
gonna happen down the road,

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.743
in light of the kinds
of things you studied?

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.363
- Well I'm not gonna set up as guru.

00:49:28.516 --> 00:49:30.500
- This is your guru moment.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.333
- No, I,

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.870
all I can do is fall back
on platitudes that have

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.713
been around since the
time of Cicero, you know?

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.540
- [Harry] Since no one is reading Cicero.

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.150
- Historia magistra vitae, right?

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:48.133
History tells you, directs you, helps you

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.040
understand your predicament
as a human being

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.240
and by reviewing the historical record

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.110
gives you some idea of the
direction in which you're going,

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.736
precautions to take,
opportunities to seize.

00:50:02.736 --> 00:50:07.423
It's not an infallible guide.

00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:10.900
- But let me make this the final question,

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.050
what about policy makers?

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:16.730
In other words, is there a lesson here

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:18.640
for the policy makers who have

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.640
to deal with the issues that
are affected by science?

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.400
- Of course, and not only just
those affected by science.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.390
We know perfectly well,
we see it dramatically

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:37.270
exposed every day that statesmen,

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.573
ignorant of the circumstances,

00:50:42.505 --> 00:50:45.253
countries they are pleased to invade.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:50.200
Not only themselves pay the price

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.830
but also everybody else.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:56.930
Yeah, about that, of
course there is no doubt.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.170
Although the past doesn't
tell you what the future

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:00.830
is gonna be, it can really give you

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:02.923
good indications about what not to do.

00:51:03.874 --> 00:51:05.615
- Well on that note
John I want to thank you

00:51:05.615 --> 00:51:07.930
for coming back to the
campus and thank you

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:10.405
for taking time to do
this interview with us.

00:51:10.405 --> 00:51:11.660
- I thank you, Harry.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.780
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.773
for this Conversation with History.

00:51:16.834 --> 00:51:19.334
