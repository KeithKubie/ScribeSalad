1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,940
I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,800
This is radio lab and today today
we've got a guy asking a pretty common

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:08,650
question. Yeah.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,230
But the way he tries to
solve this question is at
first thrilled to him crutch,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,610
then the curse and then it ends up
in an extraordinarily deep puzzle.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,020
It comes to us from producer Andy
Mills. A story is about David Weinberg,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,190
a buddy of mine,

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,760
and it starts off uh right around the
time he gets out of high school. Yeah.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I graduated from high school in 2000
and then went directly to university and

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:36,780
then I got kicked out somewhere at the
beginning of the second semester and then

11
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:40,170
left that town that I was living in and
moved to the town where all my friends

12
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,190
were going to college and
he moves into a group house.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,950
It was a party house, him
and a bunch of his friends.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,750
There was a giant cross in the front
yard that my friends had found wild

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,000
tripping on acid and put in a shopping
cart and they put in the front yard.

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,970
Our fact checker actually found out
that they were tripping on mushrooms,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,350
not acid, but anyway, a lot of drinking,
a lot of partying. And for David,

18
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:05,340
like for awhile it was good hanging out
with like the people that I care about

19
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:10,050
most in the world, I feel incredibly free
because I don't live at home anymore.

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,220
Um,

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,220
and then I just started to get old for
one everyday when his friends would go

22
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,610
off to class,

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,150
David would have to go to work during
the day I was working as a janitor at the

24
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:26,100
university where my friends went and
during the evenings I would deliver pizzas

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,900
and it went on like this for years, you
know, day after day they would party.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,420
But then in the morning when
his friends would go to class,

27
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:37,530
he would go and clean toilets and then
deliver pizzas all through sophomore year

28
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,890
they would go to class, he would
clean toilets than deliver pizzas,

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,410
junior year class
toilets, pizzas. And like,

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,190
I think looking back on it now,

31
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:52,191
I think there was this rage that started
to build up inside inside me because I

32
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:58,380
mean I was really sick of cleaning the
toilets of kids in the dorms who I resent

33
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,161
but are also,

34
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,970
but I also recognize are able to do
something that I wasn't able to do.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,541
And you know,

36
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,900
all my friends were at that university
and they were about to graduate.

37
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,570
And so I think I was
also worried that like,

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,480
well they're all going to go off and live
these lives and I'm going to be stuck

39
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,910
here cleaning toilets. And on top of that,

40
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,910
by the time most of David's
friends were seniors,

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,620
he was spending his weekends in jail
for driving on a suspended license.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,940
So my life at that point was like
cleaning toilets in the morning,

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,700
delivering pizzas in the evening.
And then every weekend I was in jail

44
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,760
and there was kind of this breaking

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,580
one thing that one thing that
we did a lot of like, uh,

46
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,900
we listen to a lot of punk music.

47
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:43,680
My friends were in punk bands and we
would just like get really drunk and like

48
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,000
yell into the speakers probably like
three or four nights a week, you know.

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,580
And One night we were doing that,

50
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,910
it was me and my friend
Danny and my friend mark and
some of them you've snapped

51
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:55,980
inside me. I just got lost.

52
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:59,980
It just started like grabbing chairs
and hurling through windows and just

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,400
like smashed out all the
windows in our house.

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,180
You couldn't see the floor cause there
was just like wreckage everywhere and I

55
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,740
was all bloody and I was just
like, it was intense. It was,

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,140
I don't think it hit me until the next
morning when I saw what it looked like,

57
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,800
like a hurricane and like
ripped through the house. Yeah.

58
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,640
And all of his friends, everyone was just
sort of stunned. There's sort of like,

59
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,680
what's going on? And then you know, when,
when you confront a reality like that,

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,800
everything just sort of gets stripped
away and you're just left with this

61
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,270
question that's like, who am I like
and what am I doing with my life?

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,900
And around that time, David was
driving around delivering pizzas,

63
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,650
listening to the radio and WBZ
Chicago. It's this American life.

64
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,240
Am I right glass heard this story, this
Scott carrier story called the test.

65
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,100
I was hired to interview men and women
in the State of Utah who received

66
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:05,690
Medicaid support for treatment of mental
illnesses generally die and interest

67
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:10,370
like stop me in my tracks. So the
story is by a guy named Scott carrier.

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,610
He's a frequent contributor at this
American life and it's basically about how

69
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,660
he gets this new job.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,860
He gets this job driving around the
state of Utah interviewing schizophrenia,

71
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:23,840
people giving them this test. I
took the job because I had no other,

72
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,190
I took the job because I had just quit
my steady job, my professional job,

73
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,610
and this is happening at a point
where Scott's life is falling apart.

74
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,560
What I wanted more than anything was to
put my boss on the floor and stand on

75
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:40,850
his throat and watching gag talks about
how he hates his boss and my wife moved

76
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:44,450
out, took the kids and everything,
his wife and just left him.

77
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,480
So I took the job and did the job
and my life will never be the same.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,330
And David says, as soon as he heard
that story, I remember thinking like,

79
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,260
I need to figure out how to become a
radio producer. That's what I need to do.

80
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,950
Why, why does he want it
to become a radio for this?

81
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,450
Well, I think first off,

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,080
Scott carrier is really good
at what he does. Yeah. Uh,

83
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,390
there's something about him
that is magnetic, right?

84
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,280
It gets people thinking I want to do that.

85
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,590
But maybe more importantly
in the story, Scott is stuck,

86
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,590
not too dissimilar from, uh,
where David finds himself.

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,620
And a good Scott does is he
turns his stuckness into a story.

88
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,950
And in doing so kind of gives it meaning.

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,460
So He's, yeah, it's getting, it's
rising above your situation. Sorry.

90
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,630
Yeah. Yeah. And when David
hears it, he thinks like, well,

91
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,930
maybe I can do that too. It
makes sense. It was like, okay,

92
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,760
this is my ticket.

93
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,530
So that summer he lined
up a job at this camp,

94
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,690
this summer camp in upstate New York.

95
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,760
And I bought this mini disc
recorder already. Got himself. Mike,

96
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,480
the little mic that you could
clip onto your shirt and testing.

97
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,190
Recording inside the tent. He and his
buddy mark who had just graduated,

98
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,210
they left Colorado and headed to upstate
New York. My idea was like, okay,

99
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:14,750
I'll just go around and get all these
recordings and then I'll write these

100
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:19,751
stories about what it all means and day
one sort of like on the road but with

101
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,703
recording.

102
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,220
Great. On the line, on the law,
you recorded the kids at the camp

103
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,070
[inaudible] step out. Yeah.

104
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,080
We don't meet this bar fight one
night when he was out with the other

105
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,480
counselors. What's going on with
it? Is there keyboarders Huh? Yeah.

106
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:35,180
We brought the keyboards
flirting with girls.

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,400
What do you got these
added for buddy? Listen,

108
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,230
this is the coolest thing in the world.
Put these on. I mean, isn't that cool?

109
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,320
It's a live recording of what's
happening right now. Right now. Yeah.

110
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,510
I distinctly remember just being in
complete awe of hearing recordings that I

111
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:52,684
had made

112
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,130
where nothing was happening.

113
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,420
The idea,

114
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,470
the idea that I could make a recording
and listen to it. It was like,

115
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,580
like early man sees a mirror, you know,
and just can't stop staring at it.

116
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,970
Yeah, yeah. Actually wasn't it

117
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,590
interviewing people or anything like that?

118
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,840
He'd sort of decided that he wanted
to record moments as they happened,

119
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,310
like to him and he figured the
best way to do that was to record.

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,620
Secretly I had cut a small hole in all
of the pants and shorts that I had in the

121
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,050
pocket. So like I'd get up in the morning,

122
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,930
put the mini disc recorder in my pocket,

123
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,790
and then I'd run the cord down my shirt
and anytime something interesting was

124
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,230
happening, I would slip my finger in
my pocket and just press the record.

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,960
Well, launching fire at first, just
some, you know, moments here and there.

126
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,580
This is really scary. These
possible little scenes for a story.

127
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,040
Maybe Abraham.

128
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,740
Then we got to Queens, we got
to get to the seven trays. Him,

129
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,760
he and his buddy mark
built in New York City.

130
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,730
Everything sounds interesting.

131
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,940
So he's recording more and
more on the upper middle,

132
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,380
falling there. Then every day

133
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,300
after New York, he and mark hitchhiked
across Europe together. I'm sure, uh,

134
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,280
my name is mark or I'm David.

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,580
And at this point David is recording
people that pick them up in Europe,

136
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,220
e n mark and there other buddy
dom on the side of the road.

137
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,760
Well, the rhythm of the
cars on the highway is even,

138
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,640
it sounds almost like waves and the ocean.

139
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,670
No,

140
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,670
every street performer I would run up
to stand next to and record and just

141
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,010
everything. And you're still
thinking to yourself like, man, I am

142
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,430
just getting gold. Yeah. I was
like, you know, this is the,

143
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,700
this is the raw material for my
first grade story, you know, and uh,

144
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,430
I think I tried, like I
separated myself from, it's like,

145
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,810
it's kind of cliche like, oh yeah,

146
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,390
you graduate from college and you backpack
around Europe. And it's like, no, no,

147
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,500
no. I'm not one of those people.

148
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:15,240
Like I'm actually making a
grants documentary. Like I'm a,

149
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,690
I'm a, I'm a somebody, you know, I'm
not just like everybody else. Yeah.

150
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,370
Meanwhile,

151
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,660
David is accumulating hundreds
and hundreds of hours of
tape and one thing that

152
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:29,220
you'll hear if you managed
to listen through all of it
or most of it as I did is

153
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,500
just him hanging out with his buddy mark.

154
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,530
He was one of the people like we became
instant friends the moment we met mark

155
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,980
was your older than David. He was really
into music. Sound engineering? Yes.

156
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,930
Magic pocket.

157
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,740
We had this like perfect dynamic
where mark had like enough talent,

158
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:53,700
like he could actually play music and
like rift these funny songs on the spot

159
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,210
and I sort of like brought
the wrong, boozy ASM to it

160
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,620
and the two of them together that we
would just end up in these crazy places.

161
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,330
[inaudible]

162
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,050
oh yeah. Do you remember this
recording? Yeah, I remember that.

163
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,590
[inaudible]

164
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,280
we were in Croatia and then we
ended up at this huge amazing party.

165
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,250
It was like in this old
abandoned cabin, his building,

166
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,280
which is hundreds of
beautiful Croatian people.

167
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,740
That was such a great day,

168
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,150
but then she didn't want a trailer
slate. Do you want French fries,

169
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,230
veggies or apple sauce?

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,900
David and mark came back to the states.

171
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,010
Mark went out to Seattle to record
an album with his band. And David,

172
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,030
I got a job waiting tables at an apple

173
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,880
[inaudible] or salads
or soup before the meal

174
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,040
back in his hometown living in
his parent's basement. Yeah.

175
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,190
And if you guys aren't taking two seconds
to try to up sell and you're taking

176
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:15,070
money out of your pocket, you're
taking money out of your pocket,

177
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,480
you're taking money out of mind.

178
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,960
This kid did, he hung out with the most
that I worked with was this meth addict.

179
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,040
I would go to his place after work and
like drink beer and play video games and

180
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:28,570
he would get high and it was just like
really depressing, um, a hard time,

181
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,913
this shitty.

182
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:35,130
And David has all of this tape like tons
and tons and tons of tape from times

183
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:38,770
with mark and, uh, in New York, in Europe.

184
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,360
But he has no idea what to do with
it. So he just keeps hitting record.

185
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,420
Yes. Set up for the night shift

186
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,773
the morning.

187
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,100
Yeah. I mean I just, I
just that more, I think

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,340
I needed the recording and the
wire more than any time in my life.

189
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,263
Didn't want that.

190
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,590
Like that was the period when I needed
the wireless most cause it was like

191
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,920
raspberry lemonade. Sure, sure.

192
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,790
This sucks. But like I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get through this.

193
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,340
I'm gonna and this will
be a chapter in the story,

194
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,873
but just

195
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,563
[inaudible]

196
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,063
[inaudible]

197
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,480
I spent a lot of my time with my finger
gently resting on the mini disc player.

198
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,360
I could feel the disc spinning
when it was recording.

199
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,860
It was just very satisfying
and comforting. You know,
like a pulse in a way.

200
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,720
Yeah. Yeah. I think
it's still going. Yeah.

201
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,860
Excuse me. Excuse me. No,

202
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:03,400
we should get one of those bells.
Put it right here. So tightening

203
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,690
the meeting or like if I just made
this friend or make it big, you know,

204
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,410
like they made it, they just kept getting
louder and louder until you made the

205
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,810
[inaudible]. No, not
at all. Some bartender

206
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,993
[inaudible]

207
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,053
[inaudible] [inaudible]

208
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,960
does he have a story? I'm not
so sure he's caught to tell. Oh,

209
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,910
well hang on. Okay. And after
the break, I think you'll,

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
I think you'll hear an answer. Okay.

211
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,403
[inaudible]

212
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,810

Invisibilia is back for new
season with all new stories.

217
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,760
All out of 22 arrival. Danielle,
everyone get down. This is a robbery.

218
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,900
We have stories about small personal
battles. I didn't leave my house.

219
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,930
I wanted somebody to see me really sorry
about the past and stories about huge

220
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,050
cultural issues. This is probably
gonna get somebody killed. Just evil.

221
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,130
You can hear Invisibilia in NPR

222
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,350
one or wherever you get your podcasts.

223
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,280
I am Robert Krulwich. I'm
Molly Webster and we're back.

224
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,660
And today we're w we're in the middle
of a story about David Weinberg who is

225
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:14,260
recording almost every day of
his life. And last we left him.

226
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,390
He was in Applebee's, uh,

227
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,750
working as a waiter and living
in his parents' basement. Right.

228
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,010
But he did eventually, yeah,

229
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,290
save up enough money to travel again.
I went to Alaska, things like that.

230
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,440
And he says that, well, when times
were bad, like at Applebee's,

231
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,210
he needed these recordings to make his
life feel like it had a meaning when

232
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:35,200
times were good,

233
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,930
he couldn't stop recording because
he was worried that he was gonna miss

234
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:40,360
something. Yeah. Occasionally,
like something would go wrong.

235
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:43,390
Like I lost three or four recorders.

236
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,110
They broke down over the course of the
years that I was recording and whenever

237
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,831
our recorder broke,

238
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:51,580
there would be a period where I'd have
to wait for the new recorder to come.

239
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,170
[inaudible] and I just felt like
on edge all the time, you know,

240
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:58,150
like I need to be, I'm missing,
I'm missing out, you know.

241
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,770
And like in this weird twisted way,

242
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:03,520
like I felt like I was missing out on
life because I wasn't recording it.

243
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,520
So when you would get the recorder,
it would be like a relief. Oh yeah.

244
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,050
It was like, oh, thank
God I can, you know,

245
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,570
like this pressure would be released
and I could go back to recording and,

246
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,840
and I would just feel like myself
again, you know? But then, hey, hey,

247
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
why is Brian ahead of you or behind David
ended up down in Seattle where he met

248
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:26,041
back up with mark and mark and I got in
some big arguments in Seattle before I

249
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:27,010
left.

250
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,710
It's something that you
said that with private,

251
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:33,590
like what is why it is that
you feel uncomfortable.

252
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,740
He just told me when I had the buyers
like I hate the fact that you record me

253
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:42,720
all the time and you know, I was
recording that conversation too.

254
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,890
I don't want to get to the heart of why

255
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,920
and he just laid it all
out for me. You know,

256
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:54,921
like he was someone who spent his day all
day in a recording studio meticulously

257
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,410
laying down perfect tracks,
you know, that was his life.

258
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,850
And so to him that idea that you would
just sort of like record everything.

259
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,250
It was wrong for a lot of
reasons. One of which was just,

260
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,920
he just didn't think that
experiences warranted that.

261
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,770
And then he had like
philosophical objections to it

262
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,683
for both

263
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,353
[inaudible]

264
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,050
that like what makes life great and
worth living is that it is this fleeting

265
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:26,430
thing and it's temporary.

266
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,530
Well I liked my life being
temporal. I don't want him to,

267
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,400
posterity is only good
in like certain doses

268
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,470
and when you are trying to
constantly record it and capture it,

269
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,280
you're just taking away
from that aspect of life.

270
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,750
It's like don't keep trying to capture
like the essence of this thing.

271
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:49,680
Just be in the essence of the
thing. Right. So here you've got

272
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,980
David saying that you know he's recording
all the time as to not miss anything

273
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,730
and mark is saying that no,

274
00:17:56,731 --> 00:18:00,600
by recording all the time
you are missing everything.

275
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,930
You're missing the important thing.

276
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,910
And it got to the point where he

277
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,370
said he didn't want to be recorded
anymore and it was like really getting the

278
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:13,700
way of our friendship cause it was like
it like puts a ceiling on where your

279
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:18,701
relationship can go when someone feels
like they can't open up to you in that

280
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,580
way. That just puts this wedge between
you in a way that's just like awful.

281
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,030
Did you stop recording at this
point? Well, I couldn't stop like I,

282
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,340
that I had just like, I don't know
whether it's OCD or whatever. It was like,

283
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:32,990
I was just like, I
couldn't stop recording.

284
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:37,991
And so I was always recording and the
recording was like almost like a uniform

285
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,450
for this person that I
wanted to be. It was like,

286
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,340
it's like you're in a play and
you think you're living this life.

287
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,900
And then when the desktops suddenly,

288
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:52,190
like the lights go up and you realize
it's all fake, just like face it dude.

289
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:53,024
Like

290
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,340
you're just drifting.

291
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,500
At this point, David has
around 2000 hours of tape, um,

292
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,720
because he keeps on recording. He's not
really hanging out with mark anymore.

293
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,610
And he ends up just drifting
down to New Orleans.

294
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,540
And this is not very long after Hurricane
Katrina. And it's like, you know,

295
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,980
like, you know, everyone has heard
about the flood and I was like, no.

296
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,471
So I was like,

297
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:23,160
listen to these people's
like heroin journeys and then
like all these injustices

298
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:26,100
that they had faced. So he
decided to do something that he,

299
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:30,840
he never really done before and
started interviewing people.

300
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,970
Yeah, I've been assessed the stall,

301
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,880
but I've been living in New
Orleans east telling their stories.

302
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,520
How has it changed since? Huh?

303
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,500
I will change that much since Katrina
with their permissions, you know,

304
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,650
not recording them
secretly it up, you know.

305
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,800
So where did you do your grocery shopping?
I was doing a daughter jets really?

306
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,230
And then he started getting those stories
onto New Orleans public radio station,

307
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:55,340
listening to Wwlz street talk stories
of New Orleans cultural rebuilding.

308
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,330
[inaudible]

309
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,350
I'm telling you man, I appreciate that
discipline cause I was growing up, man,

310
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:02,150
I was growing up, just terrible man.

311
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,040
And then at night, uh, he'd go home and,

312
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,320
and he would listen to audio from
the wire tape of like me and some

313
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,210
bar and I think I am
ready. Everyone in a bar.

314
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,590
I hear Ya. Yeah. You didn't make
very many friends there, like

315
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,360
super drunk. And it's like,

316
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,690
what? Like, why did I think
this mattered? You know, like

317
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,143
why, you know,

318
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,690
and then also this like dynamic started
to change in my mind where like it's one

319
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:37,870
thing to record your own life
and yes, I mean to be fair,

320
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:41,530
I was also recording other people but
it was always framed around me and

321
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,080
everyone else was just sort
of like supporting characters.

322
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,970
But then when I started
doing stories in the wounds,

323
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:49,240
it was like this is not about
me, this is about other people.

324
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,100
And like suddenly it did start
to feel dirty to record people.

325
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,100
It was like all of that sort of came to
a head and I just felt worse and worse

326
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:01,450
about recording and then I just
stopped. I was like, I don't want to,

327
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:02,650
I don't want to do this anymore.

328
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,540
What about that feeling you were talking
about just moments ago where without

329
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,510
the recorder recording, what's happening.

330
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,950
You felt as if you were missing out
that an experience was kind of wasted

331
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,260
because you hadn't gotten
a chance to record it.

332
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,840
I mean that didn't go away. That
definitely didn't go away. I mean,

333
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:24,410
I feel like that still to this
day, I sometimes feel like, man,

334
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:27,410
I wish I was recording this, you know? Um,

335
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,830
but it just forced me to really think
hard about what moments in life were worth

336
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,400
capturing and what [inaudible]

337
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,390
weren't, you know. So like if
you do try to capture a moment,

338
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,480
then you're kind of out of that moment,

339
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,380
but if you don't then it's gone.

340
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,370
So that has the potential to be
lost. Right. I think that yeah,

341
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:52,810
we all can relate to
this idea. But for David,

342
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,490
the crux of that tension to do it or
not to do it like that became really

343
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:03,780
difficult for him in part because of what
happened next few months after he had

344
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,110
quit recording. I used talking
to mark who uh, you know,

345
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,890
still back home in Seattle is very
happy to hear the David wasn't recording

346
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:15,150
anymore and so mark decided to go down
to New Orleans and visit David and their

347
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:16,530
buddy Danny who was down there too.

348
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,540
And um, man,

349
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:25,370
this is hard cause I haven't really
told the whole real story about what

350
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:27,080
happened with mark. And
I'm trying to think,

351
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,540
I'll tell you the real story
and um, shoot. Um, with, uh,

352
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,130
Dan and today Danny and mark and I
were really close to three of us. Um,

353
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,050
and one thing we would do a
couple of times a year, we,

354
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:42,170
we would all go out to the mountains
together and just have this great trip

355
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:47,090
together like as friends. And so we
were going to do that in New Orleans.

356
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,700
And so, um,

357
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,730
we got on our bikes and we
rode down to the river and um,

358
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,870
sat along the river for awhile and then
we took the ferry over to the wet West

359
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,610
Bank, the other side
of the river, you know,

360
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:06,470
like New Orleans is like glittering across
the water got stoned and it was just

361
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,350
magical, like in the, we were just sitting
there for a long time, just talking,

362
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:12,410
like having those sort of deep
philosophical conversations

363
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,590
for the first time in a long time.
[inaudible] was not recording,

364
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:17,720
wasn't worried about
capturing the moment. So

365
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,260
my mind was free to not think
about the recording, you know,

366
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,800
and then I was actually more
present in some way. You know,

367
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,870
and it just felt like it always did when
we were close back in the mountains in

368
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:30,471
Colorado, you know,

369
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:35,471
it was just like a great moment and I
wanted to keep hanging out there and mark

370
00:23:36,621 --> 00:23:39,500
was like getting kind of antsy. He
wanted to go explore the city, you know,

371
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,690
he wanted to go exploring
and I was just like,

372
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,090
they didn't really feel like
I was just sort of like,

373
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,250
they didn't want to be
around other people.

374
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:50,750
I was happy to be there with them and
then mark just jumped up and took off,

375
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:54,610
like just sprinted away. And we were
like, well that was weird. You know,

376
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,990
like it was very strange. David says that

377
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,180
mark said something in a moment but
he can't like remember exactly what

378
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,740
and so we like got on our bikes
and we were only a maybe, I dunno,

379
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,320
maybe a hundred yards, 200 yards
from the ferry that was parked there.

380
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,340
And by the time we got to the bridge
that connects the land to the ferry,

381
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,630
I saw that Mark's bike was laying on
its side on the ramp. I was just like,

382
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,960
well that's weird. You know, in my
mind am I, when I think back about it,

383
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:29,470
I feel like things happened very
slowly. Why is Mark's bike laying down?

384
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:34,060
Why are all those people shouting?
They're looking into the river.

385
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,290
Why are they looking at over?

386
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,000
And then I look in the river and
there's mark and he's swimming in the

387
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:42,970
Mississippi and he's shouting something
and I can't figure out what he's saying.

388
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,420
And I was just like, Holy Shit.

389
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:51,240
Like this is really bad. And then I
got really, really scared and I looked,

390
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Danny and Danny looked totally
terrified and he started to,

391
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,320
you know, he was going down
river. Obviously it's the river.

392
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:03,520
And so there was a point I could see off
in the distance that there was a boat,

393
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,530
like a rescue boat or something
had gotten into the water.

394
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,120
And mark started to drift around the
bend and he disappeared out of you.

395
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,810
David and Danny, they kind of
walk up and down the river, um,

396
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,970
looking for mark and they couldn't find
him. Then it gets dark. Um, and Danny,

397
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Martha, just head home and wait
for news there the next morning.

398
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,980
Still no news. A few days
later, the authorities,

399
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:31,120
they gave up their official
search for mark and,

400
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:36,060
and assume that he was dead and week
or so later they found his body he had

401
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:41,030
drown. And I should just add that there
is no reason to suspect that this was a

402
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:45,560
suicide. Yeah. I'm sorry the mark
passed, man. That's [inaudible]

403
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,080
it's a tough story to hear.
Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask you this,

404
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,483
okay.

405
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,290
Thinking about this as a lens of
like, you being as someone who has a,

406
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,320
a compulsion and obsession that is
now under control but still live,

407
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,300
lives in you, is there, uh,
still is there a part of you that

408
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,640
[inaudible]

409
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,210
wishes that you had been
recording that day? Um,

410
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,800
uh, I don't know.

411
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,270
The thing is, David says, uh, you
know, not long after your market died,

412
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:26,840
he started going through a lot of his old
recordings and sometimes he would hear

413
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,990
on them these great moments
between the two of them.

414
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,060
But a lot of times he
says it almost like, uh,

415
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,750
he could hear that ceiling,

416
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,570
but those recordings had put
on his friendship with mark.

417
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,300
Man, I want to fucking take
a boat down the coast, man.

418
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,680
So I was acting different than I would
would've if I hadn't been recording.

419
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,190
You know, like I was conscious
that I was on tape all the time.

420
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,520
I don't know, even if the
boat, even if, you know,

421
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,780
Damien was saying that
he was willing to like,

422
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,150
and I also hear myself in these
recordings often, like stepping over him.

423
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,240
Like he'll say something and then
I'll jump in and, and, and just like,

424
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,510
clearly I'm just like,

425
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,760
I'm on my own like train of thought
and I'm not really listening to him.

426
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:12,990
And that bothers me a lot.
I'm glad I don't have,

427
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,500
I think I'm glad that, I don't know.
It's just a hard, cause I'm on one hand,

428
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,580
I'm very glad that I don't have to

429
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,300
live with that tape and that it doesn't
exist. But at the same time David says,

430
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,110
I feel like maybe I miss something and
maybe there's some part of what happened

431
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:31,940
that night that I can't, that
I missed. All I know is that

432
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,750
he just said, let's get out of
here and like jumped up and like,

433
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't even remember
exactly how he put it.

434
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:41,450
I just remember all of a sudden he
was gone. If I had that recording,

435
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,900
maybe I could make sense of it and maybe
something would be more clear about it.

436
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,910
Um, I think about that a lot,

437
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:51,790
but then I also think of what would have
marked what would mark have wanted. And

438
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,933
you know what?

439
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:01,420
That probably trumps whatever
clarity. I don't know. I don't know.

440
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:03,040
Yeah. But I still think about it a lot.

441
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,510
I still think about what I would get
from those recordings if I had them.

442
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,730
And, um, yeah, I don't

443
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,613
[inaudible] [inaudible]

444
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:18,770
[inaudible] [inaudible] a big

445
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,850
thank you to David Weinberg for opening
up his audio archive and sharing it all

446
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:25,280
with us and sharing the
story and thank you.

447
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,620
And you also produced the whole thing and
listened to all of those hours of day.

448
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,110
Uh, I should add here a
little update on, on David.

449
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:40,060
He's actually a producer at
KCRW and he's got this, uh,

450
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,140
series that you should all
check out called below the 10.

451
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,070
And if you want to know more about that
or maybe you listen to a lot of the 10,

452
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:50,980
what it's a series about people, um,

453
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,170
like very one of a kind interesting
people who live in La, a couple of the 10,

454
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,620
if you want to hear it, uh,

455
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,160
find links to it or hear little
snippets from the archive.

456
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,310
You can find all that on our website.
That's the thing you could do.

457
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,730
I don't know if that's the thing we
should say, which is radiolab.org events.

458
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,080
That's it. Still it.
