fact Sigmund Freud wrote a book called
the interpretation of dreams which many

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
the interpretation of dreams which many
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.250
the interpretation of dreams which many
people think is the the foundation of

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
people think is the the foundation of

psychoanalysis well scientists now have

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
psychoanalysis well scientists now have
 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.189
psychoanalysis well scientists now have
looked at 40 in psychology and the brain

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
looked at 40 in psychology and the brain
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.320
looked at 40 in psychology and the brain
using all these modern techniques and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
using all these modern techniques and
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.300
using all these modern techniques and
first of all we realize that perhaps

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
first of all we realize that perhaps
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.670
first of all we realize that perhaps
Sigmund Freud wasn't totally wrong

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
Sigmund Freud wasn't totally wrong
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.679
Sigmund Freud wasn't totally wrong
there are many text books which simply

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
there are many text books which simply
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.900
there are many text books which simply
dismiss Freudian psychology calling it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
dismiss Freudian psychology calling it
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.480

scientists of the last century but now

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
scientists of the last century but now
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799
scientists of the last century but now
we realize there's more to it first of

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
we realize there's more to it first of
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.049
we realize there's more to it first of
all the unconscious mind we can actually

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
all the unconscious mind we can actually
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720
all the unconscious mind we can actually
see the brain in motion and we realize

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
see the brain in motion and we realize
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.850
see the brain in motion and we realize
that much of the activity is totally

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
that much of the activity is totally
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.340
that much of the activity is totally
unconscious just like what Freud

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
unconscious just like what Freud
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979
unconscious just like what Freud
predicted and Freud also said there is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
predicted and Freud also said there is
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.220
predicted and Freud also said there is
the ego the it'd and the super-ego that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
the ego the it'd and the super-ego that
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560
the ego the it'd and the super-ego that
we are in a constant battle with our

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
we are in a constant battle with our
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.369
we are in a constant battle with our
desires and our conscious and we see

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
desires and our conscious and we see
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.650
desires and our conscious and we see
that now with brain scans the ego is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
that now with brain scans the ego is
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.319
that now with brain scans the ego is
basically your prefrontal cortex that is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
basically your prefrontal cortex that is
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.560
basically your prefrontal cortex that is
who you are when you wonder where am i

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
who you are when you wonder where am i
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780
who you are when you wonder where am i
anyway well you're right there you are

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
anyway well you're right there you are
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.870
anyway well you're right there you are
sitting right behind your forehead and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
sitting right behind your forehead and
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.109
sitting right behind your forehead and
then your desires we see the pleasure

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
then your desires we see the pleasure
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.050
then your desires we see the pleasure
center right there the center of the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
center right there the center of the
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.960
center right there the center of the
brain that is the libido we see where

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
brain that is the libido we see where
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.539
brain that is the libido we see where
the pleasure center is located and then

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
the pleasure center is located and then
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.149
the pleasure center is located and then
your conscience is right behind your

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
your conscience is right behind your
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.480
your conscience is right behind your
eyes the orbital frontal cortex right

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
eyes the orbital frontal cortex right
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090
eyes the orbital frontal cortex right
behind your eyes is where your conscious

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
behind your eyes is where your conscious
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640
behind your eyes is where your conscious
is and so we actually see that in motion

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
is and so we actually see that in motion
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.819
is and so we actually see that in motion
if you were to see a chocolate cake you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
if you were to see a chocolate cake you
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.499
if you were to see a chocolate cake you
would see these three parts of the brain

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
would see these three parts of the brain
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.179
would see these three parts of the brain
going Zippity back and forth like a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
going Zippity back and forth like a
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.460
going Zippity back and forth like a
ping-pong ball because you're constantly

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
ping-pong ball because you're constantly
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289
ping-pong ball because you're constantly
debating the pleasure of eating a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
debating the pleasure of eating a
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.450
debating the pleasure of eating a
chocolate cake versus how fat you're

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
chocolate cake versus how fat you're
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.520
chocolate cake versus how fat you're
going to become and all the sugar and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
going to become and all the sugar and
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.050
going to become and all the sugar and
the calories that you don't really need

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
the calories that you don't really need
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.569
the calories that you don't really need
so we see the beginnings of Freudian

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
so we see the beginnings of Freudian
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.990
so we see the beginnings of Freudian
psychology coming out of of brain scans

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
psychology coming out of of brain scans
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.920
psychology coming out of of brain scans
and now dreams Freud had a whole

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
and now dreams Freud had a whole
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.190
and now dreams Freud had a whole
collection of interpretation of dreams

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200
collection of interpretation of dreams
 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.389
collection of interpretation of dreams
scientists have looked at and said

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
scientists have looked at and said
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.839
scientists have looked at and said
nonsense now we understand the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
nonsense now we understand the
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.550
nonsense now we understand the
physiology of the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
physiology of the
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.699
physiology of the
process and we realized that it comes at

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709
process and we realized that it comes at
 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.680

the back of the brain a very primitive
 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.380
the back of the brain a very primitive
part of the brain and that certain parts

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
part of the brain and that certain parts
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.270
part of the brain and that certain parts
of the brain are shut off when you dream

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280

first of all your prefrontal cortex is

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
first of all your prefrontal cortex is
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.339
first of all your prefrontal cortex is
basically shut off it's quiet your

that's not right something's wrong is

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050
that's not right something's wrong is
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.589

what is active when you dream is your
 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.050
what is active when you dream is your
amygdala and what does your amygdala

govern fear and emotions and so right
then you know that when you dream the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
then you know that when you dream the
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.840
then you know that when you dream the
active part of the brain is not the fact

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
active part of the brain is not the fact
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.990

the direction of the dream
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.850
the direction of the dream
well that superstition last year became

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860
well that superstition last year became

science fact at the Max Planck Institute
in Germany they were able to show once

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799
in Germany they were able to show once
 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.870
in Germany they were able to show once
and for all that lucid dreaming is

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880
and for all that lucid dreaming is
 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.229
and for all that lucid dreaming is
testable reproducible it is real and

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239
testable reproducible it is real and
 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.809
testable reproducible it is real and
here's how they did it they took a

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819
here's how they did it they took a
 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.420
here's how they did it they took a
person who was about to go to sleep and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
person who was about to go to sleep and
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.180
person who was about to go to sleep and
told them that when you dream clench

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190
told them that when you dream clench
 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.190
told them that when you dream clench
your right fist and then clench your

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200
your right fist and then clench your
 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.590
your right fist and then clench your
left fist now when you dream you are

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
left fist now when you dream you are
 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.670
left fist now when you dream you are
paralyzed you cannot move when you dream

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680
paralyzed you cannot move when you dream
 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.620
paralyzed you cannot move when you dream
otherwise we be able to carry out all

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
otherwise we be able to carry out all
 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.809
otherwise we be able to carry out all
sorts of horrible things and destroy

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819
sorts of horrible things and destroy
 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.509
sorts of horrible things and destroy
ourselves so we are paralyzed when we

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519
ourselves so we are paralyzed when we
 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.180
ourselves so we are paralyzed when we
dream but when this person went into a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
dream but when this person went into a
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.670
dream but when this person went into a
dream state you can clearly see that the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680
dream state you can clearly see that the
