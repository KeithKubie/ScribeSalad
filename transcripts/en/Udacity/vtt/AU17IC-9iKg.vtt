00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's take a look at getting customers for physical channel. Now, what does that mean.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Imagine you're JetBlue and you now have a new airline route going from LaGuardia

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in the United States in New York City down to Orlando, Florida and you really want to get

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
people to know about this new airline route,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
well the first you're going to use is earned and paid media.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You might run TV ads, you might run radio spots, newspapers, or your website,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you might send out email and the first thing you're doing with this paid media

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is you're trying to get people aware that you even have a flight from New York to Orlando.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This first step in a physical channel is generating awareness.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
People just need to know that this thing exist.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now the bad news is that your ad agencies or whatever could tell you how many people

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
this ad will reach, but they can't quite tell you yet how many will purchase

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but you're interested in--okay, did they hear this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The next thing that you might want is to know are they interested.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Nowadays, even in physical channels, we could see--did anybody hit the JetBlue website

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and did they push the button on fares from Orlando and New York to Orlando,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is there some interest or do they call your 1-800 number but really

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we're finally gets engaging in a physical channel.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Is there people actually asking for the schedules and are hitting the "How much does it cost" page.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In fact, what you really want to be tracking is--are people calling reservations

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or if this was a car dealership--are they showing up in the dealer, taking the car out for a test drive--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that's consideration.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In the physical channel, it's really interesting to measure the differences between

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
how many people did my ads or free media reached versus how many did I get in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to my physical channel to actually consider the product.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
How many showed up in the store, how many showed up on my website,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
how many called the 800 number, and it's this space between actually doing and this

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is what makes it so hard in physical channels.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's all the effort on paid and earned media.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You really don't know where those customers are until they're physically inside you channel

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
considering the purchase, and then of course, when they click "I'll buy it"

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
or tell a dealer "I'll take the car," or in JetBlue's case actually say, "I'll but this fair" or "Book a seat,"

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
you'll finally understand whether you have the order or not and that's what acquisition looks like

00:02:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in a physical channel--awareness, consideration and purchase.
