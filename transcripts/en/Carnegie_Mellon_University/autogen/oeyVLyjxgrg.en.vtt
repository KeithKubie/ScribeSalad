first of all you're using two cameras
because you it's a right eye and a left

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:01.680
because you it's a right eye and a left
 

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.950
because you it's a right eye and a left
eye I mean that's we see in 3d so that's

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960
eye I mean that's we see in 3d so that's
 

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.720
eye I mean that's we see in 3d so that's
what happens so you're so this is twice

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:05.730
what happens so you're so this is twice
 

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.120
what happens so you're so this is twice
the problem you know and it's a very

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:08.130
the problem you know and it's a very
 

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.549
the problem you know and it's a very
interesting thing because you have to

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559
interesting thing because you have to
 

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:13.159
interesting thing because you have to
a real quick quick quick lesson about it

00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:13.169
a real quick quick quick lesson about it
 

00:30:13.169 --> 00:30:14.269
a real quick quick quick lesson about it
as you know our eyes are about

00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279
as you know our eyes are about
 

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.700
as you know our eyes are about
two-and-a-half inches apart and so the

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:16.710
two-and-a-half inches apart and so the
 

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.249
two-and-a-half inches apart and so the
cameras you can't get them that close so

00:30:19.249 --> 00:30:19.259
cameras you can't get them that close so
 

00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:20.570
cameras you can't get them that close so
they actually there was one on top and

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580
they actually there was one on top and
 

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.480
they actually there was one on top and
one on the bottom or one on one here or

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:23.490
one on the bottom or one on one here or
 

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.070
one on the bottom or one on one here or
one it's sometimes like that but these

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080
one it's sometimes like that but these
 

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.789
one it's sometimes like that but these
these interesting rigs and you have to

00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799
these interesting rigs and you have to
 

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:32.389
these interesting rigs and you have to
decide with each shot how much depth and

00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399
decide with each shot how much depth and
 

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:36.169
decide with each shot how much depth and
that's all about like no depth is to D

00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179
that's all about like no depth is to D
 

00:30:36.179 --> 00:30:38.450
that's all about like no depth is to D
and then you widen it to two and a half

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460
and then you widen it to two and a half
 

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.299
and then you widen it to two and a half
you don't go any wider than that for

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:41.309
you don't go any wider than that for
 

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:43.310
you don't go any wider than that for
each shot you know in close-ups you just

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320
each shot you know in close-ups you just
 

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.590
each shot you know in close-ups you just
tighter you know small or smaller range

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600
tighter you know small or smaller range
 

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.659
tighter you know small or smaller range
and then you do depth the bigger depth

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:47.669
and then you do depth the bigger depth
 

00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:51.350
and then you do depth the bigger depth
for the for the wide shots and and we

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360
for the for the wide shots and and we
 

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.389
for the for the wide shots and and we
were it was interesting because we were

00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399
were it was interesting because we were
 

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:55.730
were it was interesting because we were
the first film ever to take 3d on

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740
the first film ever to take 3d on
 

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.460
the first film ever to take 3d on
location they had never done that before

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:58.470
location they had never done that before
 

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.330
location they had never done that before
it was always done on stages and we were

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:01.340
it was always done on stages and we were
 

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.269
it was always done on stages and we were
guinea pigs I guess that went into

00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279
guinea pigs I guess that went into
 

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:08.210
guinea pigs I guess that went into
jungles and caves and cliffs and ships

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220
jungles and caves and cliffs and ships
 

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.999
jungles and caves and cliffs and ships
and it was insane but it was we learned

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:14.009
and it was insane but it was we learned
 

00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:16.070
and it was insane but it was we learned
as we went the cameras have gotten

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080
as we went the cameras have gotten
 

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.009
as we went the cameras have gotten
smaller each time you just have to

00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:19.019
smaller each time you just have to
 

00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:22.610
smaller each time you just have to
they're delicate so you so it you know

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620
they're delicate so you so it you know
 

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.169
they're delicate so you so it you know
it takes twice the amount of time to

00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179
it takes twice the amount of time to
 

00:31:24.179 --> 00:31:27.740
it takes twice the amount of time to
load the film and if one goes down I

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:27.750
load the film and if one goes down I
 

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.450
load the film and if one goes down I
mean I have a great performance and

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460
mean I have a great performance and
 

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.990
mean I have a great performance and
they'd say one I went down you know

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000
they'd say one I went down you know
 

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.190
they'd say one I went down you know
