00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
So if you remember from the last lecture,
Value Propositions, what we're really

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.780
trying to do is find the right product
market fit between what you're building

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.369
and who wants to buy it. Again, we call
this relationship between value

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.470
proposition and customer segment simply, product market fit. Today, in "Customer

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.090
Segments," in this lecture, we're really
going to ask what job are we getting

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.019
done for the customer. That is, what
functional or social jobs are we going

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.820
to get done? What emotional jobs?
What problems or needs are we solving?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.149
What gains are we providing the customer? What pains?

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.100
How does market type affect this? And at
the end, what we're going to come up with

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.170
is a deep understanding of the persona
and architect. Who are they? Why would

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.579
they buy? Why won't they buy? What do you need to say to them? And if you spend

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.910
your energy out of the building, doing
customer development and customer

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.980
discovery here, it will make your company
incredibly efficient in actually

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.020
figuring out how to market and sell to
them. So remember the goal is now to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.780
connect the value proposition with what
you're going to know and learn outside

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.850
the building about customers.
