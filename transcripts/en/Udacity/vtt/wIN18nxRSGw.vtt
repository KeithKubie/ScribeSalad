00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.895
So we know that the total money Grant will
earn from his sales is going to have to

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:07.765
account for both the money he thought he
was going to make from all of the wipers

00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:11.529
and nozzles he thought he was going to
sell and also for the money that he will

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:15.558
no longer make from the canceled orders.
So that means that we can already rule out

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
two of our answers. These two right here,
the second and the forth, each of which

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:24.016
only takes into account one of those two
properties we need to have involved in our

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:28.000
equation. Now we also know that Grant is
not going to make as much money as he

00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:32.250
originally thought that he would because
we need to remove the money that he would

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:36.552
have gotten from the cancelled orders. If
you want to remove a quantity you want to

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:40.449
subtract it, not add it. So that means
that this first answer choice, is the

00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.150
correct one. If we picked the third
answer, then Grant would end up with more

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:48.009
money, since we said that both of these
quantities are positive after the orders

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:52.024
were cancelled than he would have before
any orders were cancelled. So that doesn't

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:55.829
make sense. I know that the wording of
things may have been a tiny bit confusing

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:58.943
here, but in the end this is all going to
help Grant out a ton, so it's worth our

00:00:58.943 --> 00:00:59.943
effort.
