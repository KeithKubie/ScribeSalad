00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:02.305
- [Voiceover] So we've got
an infinite series here.

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:05.113
Negative one to the n plus
one over the square root of n.

00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:06.630
I always like to visualize this

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.276
a little bit more, expand it out.

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:10.685
So when n equals one the
first term is negative one

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:12.461
to the second power, so
it's going to be positive.

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.387
It's going to be one
over one and so it's one

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:16.929
minus one over the square root of two

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.575
plus one over the square root of three

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:22.115
minus one over the square
root of four and then

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.379
plus, minus, and we just go
on and on and on forever.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.810
Now when we looked at convergence tests

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.218
for infinite series we
saw things like this.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.102
This passes the alternating series test

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.015
and so we know that this converges.

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:40.063
Let's say it converges to some value S.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.401
But what we're concerned
with in this video is

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.923
not whether or not this
converges, but estimating

00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:47.436
what this actually converges to.

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:51.197
We know that we can estimate
this by taking a partial sum.

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:55.844
Let's say S sub k, this is the
first k terms right over here

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:57.561
and then you're going to have a remainder,

00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:01.953
so plus the remainder after
you've taken the first k terms.

00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:04.882
So this actually starts
with the k plus first term.

00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.335
And so what I am concerned
about or what I want

00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:10.843
to figure out is what's the
minimum number of terms,

00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:15.030
what's the minimum k here
so that my remainder,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.666
so that the absolute value of my remainder

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:22.666
is less than or equal to 0.001.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:25.164
And I encourage you to
pause the video based

00:01:25.164 --> 00:01:26.403
on what we've seen in previous

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.981
alternating series estimation situations

00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:30.663
to see if you can figure this out.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.552
Alright I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:39.210
So let's just remind ourselves
what R sub k looks like.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.210
So R sub k is going to start
with the k plus first term.

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:50.371
So it's going to be negative
one k plus one plus one,

00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:54.483
so it's negative one
to the k plus two over

00:01:54.483 --> 00:01:59.483
the square root of k plus one.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:06.343
And then the next term
I can just write plus

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:10.465
negative one to the k plus three over

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:14.211
the square root of k plus two.

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:17.198
And it's just going to go
on and on and on like that.

00:02:17.732 --> 00:02:20.683
Now what we know already or
what we've seen an example of

00:02:20.683 --> 00:02:23.242
and we'll verify it or at
least conceptual verification

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:27.872
for us at the end of this
video is the absolute

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:32.872
value of this entire sum
is going to be less than

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:36.397
the absolute value of the first term.

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:37.842
So let me write that down.

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:42.842
The absolute value of this
entire remainder R sub k...

00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:45.280
And some people refer
to this as kind of the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.232
alternating series remainder property

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:49.998
or whatever you want to call it.

00:02:49.998 --> 00:02:52.184
But the absolute value
of this entire thing

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:55.671
is going to be less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:00.671
of the first term, negative
one to the k plus two

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:04.822
over the square root of k plus one.

00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:08.631
And of course we want that to
be less than one thousandth.

00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:13.631
So that needs to be less
than or equal to 0.001.

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:17.480
And so now this setup
right over here inspires

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.752
you, I once again encourage
you to pause the video

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:21.574
and see if you can figure out what is

00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:26.266
the minimum k that
satisfies this inequality.

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:30.690
Well once again I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.820
And the key realization here is that this

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.174
negative one to the k plus
two this makes this whole

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:36.435
thing either positive or negative.

00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:38.514
The denominator is going to be positive.

00:03:38.514 --> 00:03:40.826
Well it's definitely going
to be positive for all

00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:43.089
the ks frankly for
which the principal root

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.691
is going to be defined, but obviously

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.320
these are all positive ks as well.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.128
So the numerator here just flips the sign.

00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:52.999
We flip between negative
one or positive one,

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.616
negative one or positive one.

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:58.074
But if we take the
absolute value whether it's

00:03:58.074 --> 00:04:00.358
negative or positive it's
going to end up being positive.

00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:05.358
So this thing on the left
hand side that's the same

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.480
thing as just one over the
square root of k plus one

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:18.886
and then that's going to be
less than or equal to 0.001.

00:04:21.132 --> 00:04:24.544
And now we just have to
solve this inequality.

00:04:24.544 --> 00:04:28.105
Find out which ks satisfy this inequality.

00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:30.310
And so let's see, we
can multiply both sides

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.547
by the square root of k plus one.

00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:35.135
So square root of k plus one so we can

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:36.904
get this out of the denominator.

00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:39.990
And let's actually multiple
both sides times 1,000

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.023
because this is a thousandth
and so we'll end up

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:43.317
with a one on the right-hand side.

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:47.748
So times 1,000, times 1,000.

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:50.595
And what we're going to be left with is

00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:53.165
these cancel out on the left-hand side.

00:04:53.672 --> 00:04:54.884
We don't have to flip the sign because

00:04:54.884 --> 00:04:56.789
we just multiplied by positive things.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.958
So we have 1,000 is less than or equal to

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.629
the square root of k plus one.

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:07.312
We could square both
sides and we get 1,000,000

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:13.344
is less than or equal to k plus one.

00:05:13.344 --> 00:05:17.304
And then we can just
subtract one from both sides

00:05:17.304 --> 00:05:21.855
and we have 999,999 is going

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:24.710
to be less than or equal to k.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.710
So k just has to be greater
than or equal to 999,999.

00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:32.157
And remember we want the smallest k

00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:33.539
that satisfies these conditions.

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.556
So the smallest k if k has to be

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:36.254
greater than or equal to this,

00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:41.254
the smallest k that satisfies
this is k is equal to 999,999.

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:43.811
So let's write that down.

00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.671
So the smallest k for which this is true

00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:51.671
is going to be k is equal to 999,999.

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:56.656
Now let's convince ourselves
that that remainder,

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.538
that the absolute value
of the remainder is

00:05:58.538 --> 00:06:01.416
definitely going to be less...

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.002
If we take the partial sum of the first

00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:09.910
999,999 terms that this remainder is

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.766
actually going to be less than this.

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:14.532
I'm telling you so far
we've just kind of worked

00:06:14.532 --> 00:06:15.685
from the premise that it will be,

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:18.461
but let's actually look at
that and feel good about it.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.471
And once again encourage you to

00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:21.384
pause the video and try it on your own.

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:23.765
So let's just rewrite this again,

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:26.103
but I'm going to expand out R sub k.

00:06:26.103 --> 00:06:29.789
So we're saying that it's
all going to converge to S

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.949
and we're going to take the
partial sum of the first

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.569
999,999 terms and we're
claiming that this is going

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.347
to be within one thousandth
of this right over here.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.685
So this is going to be plus and

00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:47.507
so the first term of the remainder,

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:52.507
of R sub k is going to
be our millionth term.

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:59.299
And so the millionth term, we
just have to remind ourselves,

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:03.502
is going to be negative one
to the million and oneth power

00:07:03.502 --> 00:07:05.502
so negative one to the
million and oneth power

00:07:05.502 --> 00:07:08.306
that's going to be negative one

00:07:08.306 --> 00:07:09.615
because that's an odd number.

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:11.249
So it's going to be negative one over

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:13.012
the square root of a million.

00:07:13.012 --> 00:07:14.253
So actually let me do it like this.

00:07:14.253 --> 00:07:17.090
So it's going to be minus one

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.326
over the square root of a million.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.161
And then the next term is going to be plus

00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:29.161
one over the square root
of a million and one.

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.456
And it's positive now
because this is gonna be

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:37.475
negative one to the
million and second power.

00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:41.791
And then it's going to be minus one over

00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:46.791
the square root of one million and two.

00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:51.274
And then plus, I'll
just do two more terms.

00:07:51.274 --> 00:07:56.274
One over the square root
of a million and three.

00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:03.896
And then minus one over the square root of

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:08.132
a million and four and then plus, minus,

00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:12.074
it just keeps going on and
on, on and on and on forever.

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:15.613
Now I want to convince
ourselves that this thing

00:08:15.613 --> 00:08:18.921
is going to be, the
absolute value of this thing

00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:21.483
is going to be less than one thousandth.

00:08:21.483 --> 00:08:22.761
It's going to be essentially less than the

00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:25.612
absolute value of this first term.

00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:26.835
So how do we think about it?

00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:28.047
So this first term we already know,

00:08:28.047 --> 00:08:32.625
this right over here is this
first term right over here is

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:37.625
negative 0.001 because
it's one over one thousand

00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:43.685
and we have this negative right over here.

00:08:43.685 --> 00:08:45.556
Now the first thing we could realize,

00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:48.522
if we just put parentheses like this,

00:08:52.522 --> 00:08:54.534
we see that this is going to be positive,

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.045
this term is larger than this term,

00:08:56.045 --> 00:08:57.133
this term is larger than this term,

00:08:57.133 --> 00:08:58.426
and we could keep going.

00:09:02.963 --> 00:09:06.163
So the remainder kind of starts
at negative one thousandth

00:09:06.163 --> 00:09:08.521
and then it just adds a
bunch of positive terms.

00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:11.474
So it's not going to get
any more negative than this.

00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:13.926
So we know that the remainder
can't get more negative

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:16.342
than this, but let's
also verify that it can't

00:09:16.972 --> 00:09:20.352
get more than a positive
thousandth either.

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:23.353
And the way that we can
do that is to just look

00:09:23.353 --> 00:09:25.326
at the parentheses in a different way.

00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:30.326
If we do it this way that's
going to be a negative value.

00:09:33.229 --> 00:09:35.691
This right over here is
going to be a negative value.

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:40.060
And we can say plus that, plus that,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:40.989
and so we're going to have a

00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:42.475
bunch of negative values together.

00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:45.195
So just like that by really looking at the

00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:47.168
parentheses a little bit
differently we're able

00:09:47.168 --> 00:09:48.792
to say that this is definitely
going to be negative.

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:51.224
This remainder is definitely
going to be a negative value,

00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:55.326
but it can't be any more
negative than our first term.

00:09:55.326 --> 00:09:57.767
So that tells us that the
absolute value of our remainder

00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:06.527
can't get any larger than one thousandth.

00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:09.364
As we add more and more
and more terms here

00:10:09.364 --> 00:10:12.280
we're not going to get
any further away from

00:10:13.172 --> 00:10:18.172
the actual sum than the first term.
