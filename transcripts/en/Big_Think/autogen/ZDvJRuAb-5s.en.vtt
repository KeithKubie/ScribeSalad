to do is as an architect is believed in

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420
to do is as an architect is believed in
 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.760

the future where's artists tend to be
 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.099
the future where's artists tend to be
more critical and point out the problems

you're bunched in a pack of other of
 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.819

other people who who've made work like
 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.739
other people who who've made work like
that so there's interesting distinctions

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749
that so there's interesting distinctions
 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.120
that so there's interesting distinctions
that happen between the two disciplines

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130
that happen between the two disciplines
 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.800

I think I don't know where we're headed

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810
I think I don't know where we're headed
 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.330
I think I don't know where we're headed
I think in terms of environmental

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
I think in terms of environmental
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.819
I think in terms of environmental
movement I think we're I think we're

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829
movement I think we're I think we're
 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.289
movement I think we're I think we're
going to be meeting a sequential series

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299
going to be meeting a sequential series
 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.730
going to be meeting a sequential series
of crises that we're going to have to

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740
of crises that we're going to have to
 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.800
of crises that we're going to have to
deal with and those crises are going to

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810
deal with and those crises are going to
 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.620
deal with and those crises are going to
have to force us to live in radically

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630
have to force us to live in radically
 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.690
have to force us to live in radically
different ways and we won't know how

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
different ways and we won't know how
 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.740
different ways and we won't know how
we're going to deal with it until we

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750
we're going to deal with it until we
 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.630
we're going to deal with it until we
come to it but if you look at the past

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
come to it but if you look at the past
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.610
come to it but if you look at the past
how we've dealt with it we're we're able

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
how we've dealt with it we're we're able
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.330
how we've dealt with it we're we're able
as a species of humans to have to turn

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340
as a species of humans to have to turn
 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.100
as a species of humans to have to turn
in a dime pretty quickly when we have to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
in a dime pretty quickly when we have to
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.340
in a dime pretty quickly when we have to
or if

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350
or if
 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.260
or if
faced with a crisis and that's what's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270
faced with a crisis and that's what's
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.520
faced with a crisis and that's what's
going to happen basically there's going

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
going to happen basically there's going
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.470
going to happen basically there's going
to there's going to be a moment where

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480
to there's going to be a moment where
 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.960
to there's going to be a moment where
food is a crisis and we're going to have

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970
food is a crisis and we're going to have
 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.430
food is a crisis and we're going to have
to change radically and we'll deal with

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440
to change radically and we'll deal with
 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.300
to change radically and we'll deal with
it as we have to or or energy or any one

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
it as we have to or or energy or any one
 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.060
it as we have to or or energy or any one
of them but I mean unfortunately it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070
of them but I mean unfortunately it
 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.560
of them but I mean unfortunately it
seems like we're not really able to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570
seems like we're not really able to
 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.080
seems like we're not really able to
mobilize quickly until we're not eating

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090
mobilize quickly until we're not eating
 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.410
mobilize quickly until we're not eating
or we can't breathe or you know you know

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
or we can't breathe or you know you know
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.790
or we can't breathe or you know you know
already we have a certain number of days

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800
already we have a certain number of days
 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.620
already we have a certain number of days
every year in Los Angeles where children

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630
every year in Los Angeles where children
 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.570
every year in Los Angeles where children
can't play outside because of the air

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580
can't play outside because of the air
 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.830
can't play outside because of the air
quality so if even that can't can't

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840
quality so if even that can't can't
 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.850
quality so if even that can't can't
force people to think differently about

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860
force people to think differently about
 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.440
force people to think differently about
how they're living I don't I don't know

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
how they're living I don't I don't know
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.450
how they're living I don't I don't know
what what the threshold is but you know

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460
what what the threshold is but you know
 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.520
what what the threshold is but you know
there is a threshold and then there's a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530
there is a threshold and then there's a
 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.130
there is a threshold and then there's a
radical change because even in the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140
radical change because even in the
 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.960
radical change because even in the
evolution of different species you can

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970
evolution of different species you can
 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.010
evolution of different species you can
see a species kind of evolving over a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020
see a species kind of evolving over a
 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.600
see a species kind of evolving over a
straight line and then all of a sudden a

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610
straight line and then all of a sudden a
 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.050
straight line and then all of a sudden a
sudden shift happens so things don't

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060
sudden shift happens so things don't
 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.630
sudden shift happens so things don't
happen always at a gradual continuous

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640
happen always at a gradual continuous
 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.590
happen always at a gradual continuous
arc but there's their sudden jolts and

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600
arc but there's their sudden jolts and
 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.160
arc but there's their sudden jolts and
you know i think i think you know we've

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170
you know i think i think you know we've
 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.760
you know i think i think you know we've
seen that the beginning of that
