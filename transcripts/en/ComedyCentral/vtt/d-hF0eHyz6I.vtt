00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.880
( laughing )

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.707
I like you, Amy.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:08.942
I like you, too.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.677
Yeah.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.680
In fact, I thought
maybe we could...

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.348
have a sleepover tonight.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.783
A sleepover?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.685
Yeah, a sleepover.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.453
Is that something that
you would be into?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.389
Yeah, I would
totally be into that.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:23.923
Yeah?

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.392
I did want to tell
you something,

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.193
before we go any further,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.562
and it may be like
a total dealbreaker

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.364
and I won't judge
you either way, I promise.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.266
I'm sure it's fine.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.200
What is it?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.705
I...

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.006
have AIDS.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:49.916
What's up?

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.219
Did you hear
what I just said?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.155
Oh, did you say something?

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.956
Did you hear what I said and
you're pretending you didn't

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.358
so you don't have to actually,
like, talk about--

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.261
Yeah, I do.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:02.862
Okay...

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.697
Is that a dealbreaker
for you, or...

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.566
No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.902
No! No, no!

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.937
That's true.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.340
No, that's not
a deal breaker.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:15.809
Oh my God, AIDS?
That?

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.944
No, that's great.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.080
No, it's not great.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.714
I'm not saying, like,
that's great.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.550
I just, like--
Actually, you know what?

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.785
It makes me more confident
in our relationship.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.087
You know?

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.888
'Cause I just--

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.590
Like, I really, I really
like you, I don't know.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.959
I don't know
what I'm saying, ahh.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.527
Like what kind of AIDS?

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:37.297
HIV?

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.532
Uh, no--
Full-blown--

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.201
Full-blown AIDS.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.936
Oh, like the virus
that causes AIDS?

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.371
No, it already caused it.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.541
For what?

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.777
For being honest
about your... AIDS,

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.245
and the state it's in.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.180
I don't know
what I'm saying.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.416
I want you to know that it
doesn't bother me at all.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.118
It doesn't bother me
at all that you have it,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.752
and my dad has psoriasis,
so I get it.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.988
Amy, are you okay with this?

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.656
It's-- it's really fine
if you're not.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.130
Um...

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.998
Actually, I think
I am okay with it.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.666
I think I really am.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.002
Sorry, I kinda--
Had a moment there.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.971
I mean, people do this.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.274
If we just use protection
and, you know, don't, like,

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:24.644
share needles,
then we should be fine.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.380
You are so high-
maintenance, my God.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.349
Garcon, the lady will have
her own needle.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.383
Shut up.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.555
Are-- are we okay?

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:36.923
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.626
We are, we're okay.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.462
God, I think it's kind of
cool, it's kind of badass.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.030
Like, the '90s are back.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:44.964
Okay.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.335
Yeah.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.837
Do you go to, like,
a lot of events?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.973
No, I go to
a lot of doctors.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.375
Yeah, well.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.343
Cheers.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.012
What?

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.283
Mmm, this is really good.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.951
This wine will actually
go amazing with this

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.819
cayenne chocolate
torte that they have.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.254
That does sound amazing,
I can't have that.

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:10.557
I have a gluten allergy.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.292
So that torte would be,
like, my AIDS.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:18.998
Oh, are you going
to the bathroom?

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.833
Is this AIDS-related?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.235
Full disclosure, I didn't
see "Philadelphia,"

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.937
but I did see "Gia,"

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.471
and, like, the tail end
of "Precious,"

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:26.739
so I feel
prepared to help.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.508
No, I'm leaving.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.643
I'm sorry, I'm a total foodie
and I think that

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.279
gluten allergies
are just bull( bleep ).

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.482
Later, Amy.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:41.888
I-- I think you're forgetting
who has AIDS here.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.623
You have AIDS here.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.457
What?
