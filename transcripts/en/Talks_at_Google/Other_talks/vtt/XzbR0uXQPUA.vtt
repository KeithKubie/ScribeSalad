JESS SCHWARTZ: Welcome.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.010
Thanks to everyone for coming.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.840
My name is Jess Schwartz, and
I'm a community manager for

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.090
Google Search.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.060
I'm thrilled to be introducing
Zach Ware of the Downtown

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.710
Project in Las Vegas.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.230
In addition to being one of our
talks at Google, this is

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.680
also one of our Google community
talks in which we

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.480
bring in outside leaders to talk
about online and offline,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.650
in this case, communities.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.870
When I learned about the
Downtown Project almost a year

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.570
ago, I thought about bringing
them to Google for a variety

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.280
of reasons.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.550
And I assume we have a variety
of people in the room that

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.520
represent these.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.400
At Google, we embrace
big ideas.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.160
Trying to make a Las
Vegas into the most

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.215
community-centric city on the
planet certainly is one.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.930
No matter what office you work
in at Google, whether you're

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.710
here in Boulder, or in
Beijing, the type of

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.840
relationship that Las Vegas
wants to have, our rather

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.950
that's Zappos wants to have
with Las Vegas is very

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.830
different than the kind
of relationship that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.160
we imagine at Google.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.480
It's also intriguing to consider
that many of us here

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.930
at Google are fans of Zappos
and its culture.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.710
You only need to look at our
mail pods to see that.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.720
And finally, plenty of us have
visited Las Vegas, but how

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.740
many of us have really
considered what it would mean

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.980
to not leave and to call
us Vegas home?

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.720
When I initially reached out to
the Downtown Project, Zach

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.540
and Tony agreed on one
condition, very smartly, that

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.850
in exchange for having one of
them come, we send someone to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.380
their speaker series.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.230
So a big thanks to Meng, our
Jolly Good Fellow here, for

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.140
making this possible because
he went to Las

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.270
Vegas on our behalf.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.060
And now we have Zach.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.260
ZACH WARE: I think Las Vegas
got the better end of that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.766
stick actually.

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.500
JESS SCHWARTZ: And also a big
thank you to my partner in

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.070
crime for the talk series,
Jacky Hayward.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.180
And the biggest thanks of all
goes to Zach for being here.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.500
He focuses on creating the most
connected city in the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.720
world in Downtown Las Vegas as
a part of Zappos and Tony

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840
Hsieh's Downtown Project.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.900
He's the founder and CEO of
Project 100, and co-founder of

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.270
Work in Progress.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.780
He focuses on connectivity,
mobility, and infrastructure

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.730
in the Downtown Project and
is a general partner

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.400
at Vegas Tech Fund.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.830
And along the way, he developed
and launched Zappos'

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.860
downtown Las Vegas campus after
heading up tech product

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.330
management Zappos.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.834
So let's give a warm
welcome to Zach.

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:19.748
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:19.748 --> 00:02:21.580
ZACH WARE: Thank you.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.540
So that was--

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.980
is this working, can
you hear me?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.130
Oh, this is probably for people
elsewhere, right?

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.170
So that's one way of saying that
I came from tech, which

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.770
I'm sure a lot of you are
focused on, and the last 2 and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.010
1/2 years, been helping to
develop a city, including a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.150
300,000 square foot building and
a variety of other things.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.370
So I think it's kind of an
interesting story about how we

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.980
can take the concepts of
product management, the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.535
concepts of technology
development, and

00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:46.160
apply them to cities.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.340
And it's frustrating
at the same time.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.600
I'm going to tell you
a few stories.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.220
I'm going to tell you a little
bit-- it's really weird to be

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.110
giving a talk and not
hear the microphone.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.210
That's very odd.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.850
So I'm going to give you have
a few stories about how we

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.870
about how we've approached
Las Vegas and why.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.810
I'll tell you the history of why
we came to be in downtown

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.480
Vegas, and how that's
evolved over time.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.570
To give you a little bit of
background about me, I

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.270
actually grew up on
a tobacco farm.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.150
And I learned to drive on that,
which is a little, it's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.460
actually pixelated, but it looks
just about as bad when

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.500
it's in HD.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.840
I'm a computer science
guy, an econ guy.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.150
My career started in food, and
it stayed in food for quite a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.630
while, and then moved into
product management at Zappos

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.190
through some very odd
serendipitous interactions.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.560
That was me in 2010.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.860
And since 2010, I've had the
opportunity to do things sort

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.820
of in reverse order.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.350
My work in downtown Vegas, and
Tony's work in downtown Vegas,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.150
really centered around
the new headquarters.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.650
And I'll talk a little
bit about how that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.570
evolved over time.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.860
We launched Vegas Tech Fund.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.090
We started Downtown Project
after really realizing that

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.070
the opportunity and the need in
downtown Vegas was larger

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.920
than just what our company could
do inside of our campus.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.220
Work in Progress was something
we thought we started to focus

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.190
on helping startups find space
and tools to be successful.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.900
And then some of you might have
heard a little bit about

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.220
the largest order ever placed
for Teslas in North America.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.350
That's Project 100.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.270
We placed an order for 100 model
S's, and I'll tell you a

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.860
little about that, and how it
impacts how we think a city

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.310
can function.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.029
I have to do this just for
the sake of my assistant.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.490
It's the cutest thing
you'll ever see.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.840
I just found out about two weeks
ago she sort of quietly,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.280
without telling me, has been
managing a pretty large Etsy

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.080
store where she makes knitted
things for babies.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.720
And it's the cutest thing
you've ever seen.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.420
It's a mermaid with a
little bikini top.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.570
That child is going to hate her
parents when she's older.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.080
So a little bit of background
on how we started our

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.320
evolution in downtown Vegas.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.940
You all know about that Zappos
and our culture.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.550
And really, the number one
thing for us is, as the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.080
company's evolved, and
particularly as we get to

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.230
scale today is keeping
that culture alive.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.680
The number one reason we're able
to provide the customer

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.700
service we provide, the
happiness to our customers,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.860
and, ultimately, the happiness
of downtown Vegas is because

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.880
our focus almost exclusively
on culture.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.460
And so one of the ways that
sort of came to pass was

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.950
through our core values.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.950
One of the things Tony will
tell you is the number one

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.770
regret he has in building Zappos
and starting 15 years

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.660
ago is what we didn't create
the core value sooner.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.200
And they really aren't this
thing that we created at the

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.690
top of the company
and passed down.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.920
It's something that really
came from the bottom up.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.310
And these core values are what
we hire and fire against.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.870
And as we evolved over time at
Zappos, we really started to

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.080
think more about how those
applied at scale.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.130
And that's important to remember
as we evolve through

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.910
the talk today.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.890
So we have this thing at Zappos
we call the three C's--

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.480
clothing, customer, service,
and culture.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.540
And those are three things
we focus the most on.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.310
Clothing really came out of this
idea that we wanted to

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.950
grow out of being
a shoe company.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.640
And even today, if you go on
Zappos, 90% of you will see on

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.610
the home page will probably
not be shoes.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.010
We're housewares, bags,
and much, much more.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.330
That recipe, those three C's,
and that focus on culture, as

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.450
you guys know, propelled us not
only to over $1 billion in

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.810
gross merchandise sales,
but, this year,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.620
we'll be over $3 billion.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.910
A couple of years ago, we were,
obviously, acquired by

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.000
Amazon.com.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But through the processes, it
remained very independent.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.835
And a big part of that is
because of our core values and

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:17.200
our focus on culture.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.750
Currently, we live on
this really kind

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.790
of nondescript campus.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.300
I was talking this morning about
how the multi-building

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.805
campus structure can be
really challenging.

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:28.730
And for us at Zappos, we've
grown out of this-- number

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.630
one, this was our
building two.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.640
Building one was really for
about 150 people, and then

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.470
300, and then we took the next
floor, and then the second

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.560
building, the next floor, and
the third building, which

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.830
became like Siberia where people
go to work, and you

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.050
don't see them for four months,
and you wonder, when

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.020
you see them, how long, maybe
they've been on vacation.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.010
You're surprised they
still work there.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.570
And so what we've been able to
do at Zappos with our culture

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.250
has been in spite of the
building that we're in.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.880
So through the course of the
last about seven or eight

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.830
years, really kind of starting
when we went to the second

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.840
floor of the Henderson campus,
it was really important to

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.660
think about how we could get
everybody under one roof.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.000
We aren't growing as fast, from
a headcount standpoint,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.980
as you guys are.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.630
So we can think about maybe
one gigantic building.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.010
And that might last
us 15 years.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.770
For you, that would probably
last you about 15 days.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.810
But at Zappos, we could really
think about a corporate campus

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.470
that's maybe three times of
what we have today as

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.440
something we can think of
as a 30 year investment.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.820
So we started looking
at campuses.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.590
We looked at Nike.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.040
We came here.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.060
We were inspired by what Apple's
doing in Cupertino, by

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.510
the spaceship-like object.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.860
It looks like it's just going
to take off one day.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.230
And the reason we really liked
is probably one of the main

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.960
reasons you like this campus.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.660
It's the prevalence of all these
services, these things

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.120
that not only keep you here from
7:00 AM to midnight, but

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.810
really do make your life a
little bit better-- the bar,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.430
the sushi place, the park,
the things to do.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.630
And that really goes
to the heart of a

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.730
lifestyle of a company.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.520
And as we thought about it, we
thought, yeah, we want the

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.230
Yoga studio.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.595
And in the Nike campus,
they have a pub.

00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:57.390
And around the edge, they
have a running track.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.390
And we thought, yeah that's
actually what we want, too--

00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.920
the pub part.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.530
We really don't care about
the running track part.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.680
And the more we thought about
it, though, we thought, this

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.950
feels like the same thing
everyone else is doing.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.600
But for some reason, every time
we go to somewhere like

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.530
New York, we're really inspired
by the overlap

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.390
between a student at NYU, and a
person working in a company,

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.330
and the people that interact and
run into each other from

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.540
different backgrounds.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.670
We like this concept of a busy
storefront and a busy street,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.520
people interacting in ways
that they didn't plan,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.770
co-working spaces, the concept
of being able to just camp out

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.210
and not necessarily be inside of
your campus, and ultimately

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.242
this is the photo that we looked
at, which kind of looks

00:08:36.242 --> 00:08:37.900
like one of micro
machines photos.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.120
But it really sort of gets to
the heart of how we see a

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.909
vision for how a
city operates.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.560
It's these collisions and this
density that creates these

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.030
opportunities for amazing
things to happen.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.980
And the reason that mattered was
we were thinking about the

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.480
growth of the company, and
when you get to a certain

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.770
point, we were currently in
about 1,500 employees.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.910
When you get to a certain point,
you begin to lose that

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.220
happiness, and that innovation,
and that

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.340
productivity.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.760
A lot of middle managers
come in.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.760
People get siloed.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.190
They are in three different
buildings.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.880
Lots of things happen that
ultimately drive down the

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.670
reason why we get up and go to
work in the first place, which

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.220
is to be happy.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.420
And so we found, when we looked
at research on cities,

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.610
which happened to be a very--

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.620
it was very just sort of random
thing a few of us were

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.020
reading about, we realized that
the exact opposite is

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.240
true for cities.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.670
As a city doubles in size,
productivity and happiness

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.710
increases by 15%.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.880
But it's not all true
for companies.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.940
So our thought was, what would
happen if we took the lessons

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.360
of Zappos and applied them to
the work we think of a city

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.070
could use it to invest in
culture in the spirit of

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.260
optimism and happiness but also
take the lessons of the

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.290
city and apply them
to a company.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.290
And a few different bodies of
research, Jane Jacobs, Ed

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.980
Glaeser, which I'll talk about
in a minute, and many, many

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.000
others, we found there were
three key elements to creating

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.180
this environment of serendipity
that really makes

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.680
a city magical.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.610
That's residential density of at
least 100 people per acre,

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.470
street level activity, the
kind of things you see

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.680
happening here is kind of a
version of the street level

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.010
activity, and a culture of
openness and collaboration.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.380
When you look at, historically,
back to Rome all

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.820
the way through the successful
cities of the last 1,000

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.460
years, the things that the
cities that made it through

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.640
the hard times were cities that
had those elements 100%

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.430
of the time.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.930
Cities that didn't, like
Detroit, took an element like

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.230
number two and said, no, we'll
build an elevated train and

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.400
put all the activity
above the ground.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.570
And ultimately, that small
decision, which was designed

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.480
for convenience to connect
different people from

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.040
different parts of the city,
ultimately drove down the

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.060
culture of innovation.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.410
It was a good idea, but it was
a key contributor to the

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.340
failure of the core
of Detroit.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.950
So we thought, how can we take
all these things, wrap them up

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.840
into one, one recipe,
and invest in our

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.790
company going forward.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.280
And we recognize that a key
part of Zappos culture was

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.200
maximizing serendipitous
interactions--

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.120
having one door in
and one door out.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.160
We liked the concept of density
in the office--

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.430
partially because we were cheap,
and we were all kind of

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.055
crammed on top of each other,
but more and more the research

00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:07.610
that we realized that the
density in an office, the

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.960
typical 200 square feet per
person, was actually something

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.560
that was causing a lot of
rifts between people.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.450
So we felt that we could take
some of the density ideas that

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.440
could make a city successful,
apply them to our company, and

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.360
ultimately make decisions that
allowed people to connect more

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.680
freely and prioritize collisions
over convenience.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.790
And I'll show you an example
about that in a minute.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.050
So the thing about downtown
Las Vegas, it was going to

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.020
sort of serendipitous
that a bunch of us

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.740
were hanging out there.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.510
We were in a sort of
nameless city.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.150
Vegas is a place, we were just
talking about it over lunch--

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.240
Vegas is a place that no one
feels like belongs to them.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.240
You live in someone
else's city.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.300
If you've ever visited Vegas
as a tourist, you

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.520
kind of take over.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.390
And when you live in Vegas,
you feel that power coming

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.500
from the strip.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.430
We found this little enclave
in downtown Las Vegas, this

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.360
two block area that had a really
amazing coffee shop, a

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.750
lot of really cool things
happening with a very small

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.590
group of people from the arts
area, from the creative area,

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:06.910
from the music space.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.520
And we said this is actually a
place we want to hang out.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.530
So a few of us were

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.750
independently hanging out there.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.170
And as we were thinking about
the evolution of the campus,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.590
we discovered this building,
which is, it's not like you

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.870
can't see it from a mile away.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.760
But we discovered the building
that would soon become the

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.810
former Las Vegas City Hall
was becoming available.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.620
And we thought that was
interesting because, one, it

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.320
was about twice as large our
current office, which made a

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.790
lot of sense for us.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.970
And two, it included about five
acres of property, which

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.420
would allow us to expand
over time.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.140
So this idea of creating an
urban center for our company

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.870
was something that was actually
within our reach,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.480
instead of going out to the
desert and building a really

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.280
great but, ultimately,
lonely campus.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.010
Bars like Downtown Cocktail
Room, which I highly suggest

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.860
you visit if you come to Vegas,
or the Beat, which is

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.760
the center of activity in
downtown Vegas, upstairs and

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.270
behind it, is emergency arts,
which provides 100 to two

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.070
square feet for artists to have
small galleries for $200

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.690
to $300 a month, which is the
first time in Vegas that

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.080
independent artist have the
opportunity to display and

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.720
share their craft--

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.100
versus a massive gallery at
the Bellagio which an

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.320
independent artist would
never get into.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.320
So we started thinking a lot
about the way that Apple

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.520
campus looked, but started
taking the same things that we

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.680
saw there and saying, well,
how do we bring those to a

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.470
city and ultimately flip
our campus inside out?

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.530
Take what we'd normally put in
the courtyard, and put it on

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.540
the street, and make it
open to everybody.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.420
What would happen
if we did that?

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.720
And on the way, we came up with
this idea that maybe we

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.230
should start thinking a bit more
about the community as a

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.520
part of what we're doing
in our company.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.930
So we added a fourth C to our
three C's and are really now

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.350
super focused on community.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.670
And that word is used a
lot to describe a lot

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.290
of different things.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.030
Obviously we're talking
to the community team.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.190
A lot of you are--

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.020
so for you, the definition
is one thing.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.480
For us, it's a little
bit different.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.500
But it all centers around this
activity of connecting people.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.920
So we thought, yeah, that little
map I showed you second

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.660
ago looks kind of good.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.780
But it would look a lot better
if it looked like this.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.510
And as we thought about it more,
we thought, this little

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.990
piece of property that we have
on the north side of downtown

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.630
Las Vegas probably isn't
the best place

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.920
to center the activity.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.930
We're telling everybody we're
moving our company to an urban

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.550
core, but there is
no urban core.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.050
There's a coffee
shop and a bar.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.420
And occasionally, there's
a festival.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.490
But that's it.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.910
So we started Downtown
Project.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.140
And this is an independent
effort outside of Zappos that

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.220
most people think is
a part of Zappos.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.390
Headlines will read, from the
writers that don't necessarily

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.100
do the time to do the
research, that

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.590
Zappos bought a motel.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.460
Zappos did this.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.170
Zappos did that.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.470
When in fact, anything
that isn't our

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.390
campus is Downtown Project.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.020
And what Downtown Project is,
it's something that people

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.930
think has been around for
four or five years

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:36.930
because of all the--

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.620
it seems like we have our things
together, and all of

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.410
our plans in a row, but,
trust me, we don't.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.270
We came up with this
idea in late 2011,

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.580
launched in early 2012.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.080
And the last 18 months have
really done a lot to help

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.300
invest in revitalizing
the city.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.510
But every day--

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.870
we like to refer to it as
a city is a startup--

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.000
every day is a little
bit different.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.110
So Downtown Project is an
initiative of about $350

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.640
million of primarily Tony's
personal funds and a few other

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.090
investors that's focused
on four key areas.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.630
And I'm going to talk through
the why of those in the next

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.670
few minutes.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.160
$50 million to small business.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.100
You remember when I talked
earlier about the

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.070
ground level activity?

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.550
Our thought processes is,
instead of investing in

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.000
creating the activity
artificially, and bringing in

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.510
a McDonald's, or a Subway, or a
Starbucks, we want to invest

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.100
in independent entrepreneurs
who are passionate

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.170
about what they do.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.270
The concept that we're trying
to follow is that instead of

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.400
having one gigantic idea that
brings activity to the ground,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.890
let's invest in 1,000
small ideas.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.580
Those 1,000 small ideas are
going to be more exciting.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.580
They are going to be more fun
for you guys to hang out with.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:44.730
And three, they're more likely
to collectively be successful

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.060
because they create a density
of creativity and excitement

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.680
that a Starbucks or
a Subway can't do.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.060
We're investing $50 million
in the startup community.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.670
Most of that is through
Vegas tech fund.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.700
Some of it is through a
few other initiatives.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.330
$50 million in education arts
and culture, which is an area

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.760
that is actually quite a bit
of fun and a little bit

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.830
surprising.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.440
And then $200 million
in real estate.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.480
And on the real estate front,
we're going to talk a little

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.490
bit about the concept of
curation and why we're

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.520
acquiring and redeveloping as
much as we are, but in as

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.410
little a disruptive
way as possible.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.620
So you won't see in any of the
areas that we're focusing on,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.270
an edifice of a shrine
to Tony.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.260
When I was talking about real
estate, the ultimate goal for

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.290
downtown project is to create
an environment where people

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.670
can live, work, and play within
walking distance.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.440
We talk about creating the most
community-focused large

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.220
city in the world.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.080
And the way we've actually
evolved over the last year is

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.260
to really think about that as
the most connected large city

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.130
in the world.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.180
Community focus is a weird
thing to interpret, but

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.820
connected is an easy thing
to understand.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.680
And one of the ways we do that,
and one of our biggest

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.340
focuses is to really invest in
creating what we call the

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.280
co-learning and co-working
capital of the world.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.970
This doesn't mean we have tons
and tons of co-working spaces.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.890
It means that everything we do
is about creating places for

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.820
people to gather, to work,
to connect, to teach.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.340
Every one of you has a skill
you can teach everyone

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.190
else in this room.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.640
And the trick in the a growing
community is to pull out the

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.300
formalities and allow you the
opportunity to share those

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.980
skills with someone who
wants to learn them.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.099
So in a lot of ways, we're just
creating an environment

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.430
the supports that
kind of thing.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.940
In fact, One of our biggest
investments is in Skillshare.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.079
And I'm having drinks with
their CEO tonight.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.310
And for the last year, we have
been their number one test

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.349
city for creating opportunities
for people to

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.410
teach, and share, and learn,
which has been a really

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.859
interesting thing to see.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.060
I took a basket weaving class
about eight months ago, which

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.300
was one of the weirdest
things I've ever done.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.160
So at our core, when we think
about return, people ask us

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.290
how does this work
as a business?

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.530
And that's a fun question
for us to answer.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.530
There's a couple of technical
ways that I

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.510
sometimes approach it.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.520
But the easiest way to
understand it in terms of how

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.170
we're spending $350 million
and what we plan

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.180
to get out of it--

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:48.960
it's not a charity.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.750
We're not handing this money
out to anyone who wants it.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.780
We don't consider it to
be money that is gone.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.320
It's very much a for-profit
endeavor but in a way that

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.830
people maybe don't understand.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.580
We focus on what we call ROC.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.730
We like to look at all the
investments that we make and

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.600
think about how they
collectively create community.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.850
So if I invest in a residential
project, or a

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:16.450
restaurant, or a co-working
space, or a music festival,

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.690
what are the elements of that
idea that help create

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.690
opportunities for people
to connect.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.760
And then, collectively, when
you take all those

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.670
investments, maybe 1, 2, 10, 50
of them don't have a clear

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.070
business model up front.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.100
But they solve a chicken
and egg problem.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.800
A startup won't come to town if
they have a ton of family

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.220
people, like kids in their
family that don't have

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.430
anywhere to play, that don't
have a dog park.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.500
So what business model
does dog park have?

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.140
It enables 30 or 40 startup
employees to come live in a

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.010
neighborhood.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.340
So we look at everything we
do as a way to invest in a

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.120
collective, versus a
single, investment.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.460
And the other way we look
at that this concept of

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.820
serendipity, which is something
that just came up

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.370
not too long ago after we read
a couple books that focus on

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.150
this, we started thinking
about this concept

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.300
to return on luck.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.880
And that's a way that--

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.910
for a long time, we had a
difficult time explaining why

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.690
we thought accelerating
serendipity made sense.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.850
But what we actually realized
is if you look back at what

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.610
separates great companies from
decent companies, the one key

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.110
indicator of a company's
potential growth over time is

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.110
how they capture, and how they
sieze, moments of luck these

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.850
things that happen, these
interactions that happen,

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.740
these good things, these bad
things, and how to tackle

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.590
those things.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.690
So to us, institutionalizing
these opportunities to connect

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.190
and take advantage of
opportunities that you didn't

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.785
anticipate having in life,
whether good or bad, is

00:19:34.785 --> 00:19:36.860
something that can have a
massive impact on the way a

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.070
community evolves.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.070
So our big bet, accelerating
collisions, commuting, and

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.040
co-learning will lead,
essentially, to happiness,

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.000
luckiness, innovation,
and productivity.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.090
And that goes back to the
elements of a city that we've

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.860
seen successful over the last
thousand years but haven't

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.800
necessarily been employed, in a
deliberate way, really ever.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.090
Because in every single case,
instead of breaking down

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.365
investments this way, developers
in cities break

00:20:02.365 --> 00:20:05.810
down investments in massive
ways-- a big stadium, a big

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.410
research university, a massive
hospital, a billion project

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.600
that can pass or fail without
really anybody in the

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.130
community interacting with it.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.420
Is it a good sports team?

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.580
Does anyone care
about the team?

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.300
That really isn't
in your control.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.520
But if there are 1,000 small,
really amazing ideas, each one

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.060
of you can contribute to making
those successful.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.320
And collectively, the
neighborhood can grow.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.630
So I wanted to breakdown for a
second really quickly kind of

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.750
how we approach small
business.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.060
People have asked us before,
they come to us all the time

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.730
and say, there's six or seven
of these amazing bars in the

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.350
US, don't you want
one in Vegas?

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.460
And we say, it'd be great
if there's one in Vegas.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.230
We're just not going
to invest in it.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.490
Because we want to have
something that is

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.240
story-worthy, that is unique,
that creates a sense of place

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.990
and an emotional connection
with the

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.870
community that's there.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.580
And in a lot of cases, we find
our best investments from

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.970
people like Natalie, who would
kill me if she knew that photo

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.790
was up here right now.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.150
And she's tough chef.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.370
She'd been at the Hard Rock for
four or five years, and

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.780
hated her job, and was leaving
Vegas, and spent a lot of time

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.280
downtown, was working part time
at the coffee shop, and

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.210
everybody wanted to see her
stay, everybody wanted to see

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.070
her be successful, and four or
five different people started

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.490
coming up to us at Downtown
Project and saying, you've got

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.400
to find a way to invest
in Natalie.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.530
At the time, we'd not told
anybody we were investing in

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:15.990
any restaurants.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.260
We didn't have that idea we
didn't know any real estate.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.190
But about six months later,
when we finally realize we

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.760
were going to have the
opportunity to do it, she's

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.220
the first person we called.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.060
And she opened a restaurant
called Eat, which is probably

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.340
the busiest restaurant in
downtown Vegas right now, the

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.780
seven or eight that have opened
the last couple years.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.510
She told us a number the other
day, that in the last year, a

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.160
little over a year, she's had
more than 100,000 meals served

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.280
at her restaurant.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.910
That's 100,000 opportunities for
collisions that wouldn't

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.230
have been there before.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.530
And it got to thinking a lot
about how we think about

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.910
investments as opportunities
to maximize collisions per

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.960
square foot, versus dollars
per square foot.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.320
And I'll get to that
in a minute.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.700
To our ethos of how we redevelop
real estate, we

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:05.820
bought a check cashing location
in the middle of a

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.200
Freemont East.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.450
This is what it looked like
when we took it over.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.500
In the back there, you see
the bulletproof glass

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.250
and the iron wall.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.400
We met someone named Sarah, who
Tony's known for a while,

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.160
and a few of us just met a
couple of years ago, who has

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.640
always wanted to open
a fashion store.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.680
So she took Checks Cashed,
and she did it.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.570
She painted the floor, she
rusted up the back, and she

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.680
you brought in independent
clothing.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.180
For the first time in Vegas,
you can go into a store and

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.740
buy the things you buy on Hay
Street, or wherever you might

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.600
shop in San Francisco.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.520
You can actually
get independent

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.860
clothes in Las Vegas.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.600
It's unique.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.090
It's the first time it's
ever been done.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.940
And every time you go in
there, it's different.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.430
We liked the concept of
shipping containers.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.460
I used to live in Hayes Valley,
and I was obsessed

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.850
with the proxy project, which
turned out, after I got to

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.770
know the people that built it,
it turned out to be quite a

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.300
more complicated for them to
build, and quite a bit more

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.370
expensive than they initially
anticipated.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.510
But we had hope, and we wanted
to build it in Las Vegas.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.890
And we started with four to
give this opportunity for

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.610
people to have a shipping
container with a restaurant,

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.800
or a bar, or a store, that
can rapidly test an idea.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.270
Instead of spending half a
million dollar to build a

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.380
crazy beautiful storefront,
how do we basically

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.600
do what Proxy did.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.940
We learned the same thing that
the Proxy folks did.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.570
It's really hard, particularly
in a city that's never had a

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.510
shipping container as a building
before and cares a

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.950
lot about fire code.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.160
We had some challenges.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.540
But it gave us a chance
to experiment.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.500
So we started building it.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.250
We bought a Motel 6 which
needed to be condemned.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.030
It's a half city block, and we
kind of went crazy and over

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.860
designed it.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.060
Kind of photo bombing there on
the bottom right is Ern, which

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.170
is another story.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.320
I just noticed that
earlier today.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.340
I'm like it, really looks like
Ern is photobombing.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.690
Ern is my neighbor.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.120
He used to be a Zappos
employee until

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.900
about four years ago.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.650
He left to build a barbecue
sauce business, and makes some

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.540
of the best barbecue sauce I've
ever had, and then got

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.890
into doing barbecue as
a catering operation.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.150
Ern's one of the nicest
guys you'll ever meet.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.330
That container right there is
actually the one that will

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:01.180
house Ern's barbecue in the
Container Park, which is this

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.240
massive center of activity.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.260
It is the biggest real estate
project we've invested in and

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.850
probably the only one that we're
going to be building

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.340
from scratch.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.660
It centers around a kids area.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.700
So in the middle, we have this
element of a kids' play area

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.270
that's surrounded
by restaurants,

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.870
bars, and retail shops.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.940
It's two stories on one side,
three stories on the other.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.430
And when it opens, we'll have
30 or 40 small format retail

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.870
locations for small businesses
to experiment, again, without

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.920
having to spend half a million
dollars just to build a

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.980
storefront.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.620
AUDIENCE: Where is that?

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.410
It's Freemont and 6th, or 7th.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.410
Just an amazing center of
activity centered around the

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.160
kids area and a music stage.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.050
If you guys aren't familiar with
Kaboom, those little blue

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.860
blocks are some of the
most fun things

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.860
you'll ever play with.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.840
I've lost a lot of
hours to that.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.200
And then moving into the startup
ecosystem, for us, the

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.870
environment of rapidly
creating--

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.770
this is something that I don't
need to spend a lot of time

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.740
telling you guys about, but
rapidly creating companies,

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.720
rapidly creating ideas in a fail
safe environment where,

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.240
with the right density, you can
create an idea, fail, and

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.490
you know ecosystem is
going to support you

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.066
getting another job.

00:25:06.066 --> 00:25:08.110
This is what makes San
Francisco so magical.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.670
That is the success of SF is
that I can go to work for a

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.290
crazy company, we can fail, and
I know that I'll have a

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.770
job the next day somewhere.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.240
In Vegas, that wasn't
always the case.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.650
So our focus for the first year
and a half was investing

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.280
in density of engineering
and startup talent.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.150
We did that, and now we're
moving into the world where we

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.590
we're starting to see that
ecosystem pay off.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.100
Our original idea was, taking a
look at the startup hubs of

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.620
the world, we said, what makes
that gigantic blue blob, or

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.820
the one in New York, or even
the ones in Austin, and

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.010
Portland, and Seattle
so powerful?

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.920
And what we found was the common
elements between all

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.470
the different startup ecosystems
were four things.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.580
You don't mind if I cuss--

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.260
proximity to others working
on cool shit.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.320
Proximity to those who
can help you access

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.670
to capital and space.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.030
Basically, proximity, money, and
a place to do something.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.540
And at the end of the day, if
you think about that formula,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.100
it's really not that difficult
to create.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.150
It's just a matter of someone
coming and doing that without

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.800
the normal gatekeepers that
you see in a lot of

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.190
communities, the application
process, the at the front door

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.230
who won't let you in.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.940
Why can't a neighborhood
actually reflect what, to some

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.670
degree 500, or YC has done
with an application.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.320
Proximity to others working on
cool stuff, people who can

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.260
help you, access to capital, and
Nevada's no where in the

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:27.190
top 25 of capital friendly
places right now, and space.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.320
This is a map of all the
co-working spaces in the

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.820
country as of about
eight months ago.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.940
First of all, Las Vegas had
zero, which was really kind of

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.760
depressing.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.300
So we fixed that.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.850
An our overall methodology
is pretty simple.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:40.960
And this is something that
I share with the Zappos

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.600
technology leadership after
I left and was a part of

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.940
investing in four companies that
ended up pulling about 10

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.790
Zappos engineers out of
tech, so the VP of

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.070
engineering hated me.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.480
And I explained to him that you
think about this concept

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.200
of three companies with
three people.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.470
And one of these days, those
three companies are going to

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.340
be three companies that
have 10 people.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.060
And somewhere along the way, one
person from each of those

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.660
companies is going to split off
and start his own company.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.020
And that company is going
to be 10 people.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.290
And right around there, there's
at least one, two,

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.220
three big companies--
in our case Zappos.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.970
And what's so magical about
having that big companies is

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.700
there's someone there who wants
to start a startup.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.620
And there's someone in a startup
who really wants to

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.750
have health insurance.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.490
And when you create the
opportunity for those to

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.450
flip-flop back and forth, you
create this ecosystem where

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.420
you've got one guy coming in
from the startup into the big

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.140
company and vice versa, and it
just starts to revolve and

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.610
support itself.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.020
Someone has to take
the hit up front.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.920
And Zappos tech took
the hit up front.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.130
We lost about 20 people in
Zappos tech to different

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.960
startups over the last
year and a half.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.020
But for us, it made
a lot of sense.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.160
Google would not be here if it
weren't for the fact that

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.450
there's an ecosystem.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.270
There's people that you
can draw talent from.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.210
And that's what makes Silicon
Valley and SF work.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.670
And we're well on our
way in Las Vegas.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.200
Another area we focus is really
trying to create the

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.350
right pool of talent
and pool support.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.980
So we made a big bet on
Venture for American.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.990
We've actually just welcomed
our 14th fellow over

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:03.310
the last two years.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.205
This is an organization, if
you're not familiar with it,

00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:06.700
you should be.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.360
Essentially, the founder, his
mission in life is to save

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.340
college graduates from
investment banks.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.920
And so he takes these amazing
college grads from some the

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.080
best schools in the country.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.840
And it's amazing.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.750
It's only two years old.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.590
But the people that you meet
number one in their class at

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.270
Georgetown.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.770
And people who graduate
with a 4.9 from MIT.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.490
These are people that can go
anywhere in life, and they

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.660
choose to follow
a startup path.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.350
We invest in Teach
for America.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.510
We have a major partnership
with them in Vegas to help

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.140
bring more teachers to the
downtown school system, which

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.430
is amongst the worst in Las
Vegas, which amongst the worst

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.840
in the country.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.220
It's been a pretty awesome
partnership, and over the last

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.670
two years, we've been able to
bring up about 20 to 25 new

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.580
teachers to downtown schools.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.320
We've invested in and are
opening this fall the 9th

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.420
Bridge School in a former
church building

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.170
that the city owned.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.430
They're actually moving
furniture in tomorrow, which

00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.390
is pretty impressive.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.910
They're starting as a pre-K to
kindergarten and then adding a

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.270
grade every year.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.480
And it kind of goes to the
heart of how we invest.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.640
There's so much wrong with
education in the world, but no

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.030
one willing to take the bets.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.700
So by investing in and creating
a fully private

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.980
institution that doesn't take
government money, we're able

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.340
to bring people like Sal Khan
and others in who have

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.620
innovative ways of teaching
people and try it in schools.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.440
We get forward thinking parents
and forward thinking

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.170
kids to think about ways to
do education differently.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.920
And it's all just a matter of,
for us, the big question is

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.340
why hasn't it been
done before.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.210
And the answer to us is that
no one really just ever had

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.220
the guts to do it.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:37.860
So we'll do it.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.530
We'll give it a shot.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:39.700
And if we fail, we fail.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.750
And we'll do it publicly.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.480
Education, arts, and culture.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.150
Some of you might know
the Big Rig Jig.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.680
It right actually in Oakland
right now being cleaned up to

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.390
be relocated permanently
to downtown Vegas.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.650
It'll sit in the middle of
an old motel which we're

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.800
renovating into small-format
retail.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.030
And it will be a centerpiece
that allows people to connect

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.360
and hang around, and ultimately
draws you in from

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.890
two to three blocks away, gives
you a reason to walk.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.200
This is a picture from the
first Urban Burn at first

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.030
Friday, which is a festival that
we bought right before it

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.120
went out of business that
happens every first Friday.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.950
And it was the first time that,
essentially, a Burning

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.760
Man, in this case, a woman has
been burned in the middle of a

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.080
city like this.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.220
25,000 people came to see it,
pretty much all locals.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.430
The Praying Mantis just
found its home at

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:29.015
the Container Park.

00:30:29.015 --> 00:30:32.110
It happened to stop by La Comida
the other day and shoot

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.620
fire at it.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.680
And it will be sitting
about two blocks away

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.690
from the Big Rig Jib.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.735
So as you sort of get sucked
into that, you look over and

00:30:38.735 --> 00:30:40.650
you see fire shooting
across the street.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.350
And it's really just about
creating an environment of

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.440
surprise, and pulling you in,
and helping to create

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.400
something that you didn't expect
in your neighborhood.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.200
So you can tell we're
not really about

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.290
big beautiful buildings.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.430
We're more about really cool
experiences and something that

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.082
sort of surprising you and
keeps you guessing.

00:30:55.082 --> 00:30:57.670
To our spirit co-learning, we
started downtown speaker

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.570
series, which, right now,
is what we were

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.850
just talking about.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.450
I'm the b-squad that
they sent.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.530
We've been hosting amazing
speakers about once or twice a

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.820
week for about a year now.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.870
Two weeks ago, we had David
Copperfield doing a Q&amp;A with

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.770
Kevin Rose and something
disappeared in the middle of

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.210
it, as totally to be expected.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:19.780
We've had singularity.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.460
We've had the CEO
of Whole Foods.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.090
We've had Kevin.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.730
We've had people that
you didn't expect.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.590
Next week, we have Simon
Sinek, who is one of my

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.750
favorite speakers of all.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.580
We have amazing people
coming through Vegas.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.300
We have amazing things
happening.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.590
And as we proceed over the next
couple of months, we're

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.120
actually creating a number of
venues that will support not

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.140
only one once or twice a week,
but once or twice a day.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.110
And that creates an environment
where you know,

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.830
when you just want to take a
break, you can always see a

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:44.500
great speaker.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.525
You don't have to
go to Ted.com.

00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:49.980
On the culture side, this is
something that sort of

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.140
surprisingly happened.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.350
We met someone who worked at
the Cosmopolitan who was

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.780
instrumental in creating an
independent music scene, or

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.600
burgeoning one in Vegas.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.430
He wanted to do something more,
so we invested in Life

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:05.930
is Beautiful, which will be
pretty much the only time a 16

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.450
block area has been shut down
for a music and food festival.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:14.150
It's going to be amazing, and
probably three months after

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:15.980
the Zappos campus moves in is
when it's going to start to

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.290
kind of take its hold on
downtown Vegas, which will

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.220
make it even more chaotic
once we move in.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.990
And I wanted to show a quick
video just to give you a sense

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.240
of the scale.

00:32:35.138 --> 00:35:44.232
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.020
ZACH WARE: So what's so powerful
to me about that is,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.700
a year and a half ago, we
hadn't thought of it.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.450
No one had thought of it.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.210
And what's even more powerful is
that I recognize about half

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.910
of the people that are
in that video.

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.380
And it wasn't something that
we hired extras for.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.630
It was produced by a company
that we invested in called

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.560
Downtown Films.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.520
The video itself, I know
the guys that were

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.320
in the mouse suits.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.990
I was standing on the sidewalk
saying I'm not going to dance.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.790
And so the whole idea is
everything that we do.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.260
So frequently comes
down to the people

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.320
that are in our community.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.170
And we drive it forward
because we want to.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.900
And that, to me, is
very powerful.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.560
So back to what I said
about real estate.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.850
If you haven't read this book,
you need to read this book--

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.200
"Triumph of the City"
by Ed Glaeser.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.060
He's a Harvard economics
professor who did the

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.250
research, going back 1,000
years, to the way that cities

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.600
have evolved.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.300
And a number of things that he
identified were, number one,

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.465
the residential density equation
that started to with

00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:39.840
Jane Jacobs.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.840
But he found that correlation
to ground level activity.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.110
And we begin to think about it
a little bit more deeply--

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:48.190
that there's actually more to be
done than just creating the

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.980
residential.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.200
There's a culture that you
need to invest in.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.060
And so our focus through Life is
Beautiful, to the things we

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.470
create on the ground, it's about
creating and setting the

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:57.560
tone for that culture.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.240
The residential will follow.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.890
But I highly suggest
you read this book.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.680
It is the reason why we started
Downtown Project.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.430
We hadn't thought of in
the fall of 2011 until

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.010
we read that book.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.710
So when I said that the cities
double in size, innovation,

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:16.490
happiness increase by 15%, the
ingredients of serendipity,

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.740
and all the things that I've
covered before, the concept

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.580
that we're thinking about now
is, what happens when we take

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.400
2,000 people, and we put them
in the Las Vegas City Hall,

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.720
and then we add the fact that
we have 1,000 Teach for

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.990
America core members and alumni
in Vegas and centering

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.340
themselves around Vegas?

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.440
We have this amazing startup
community, the small business

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.200
community of passionate
entrepreneurs.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.970
Art and music, I mean, what
you just with Life Is

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.160
Beautiful is a collaboration of
hundreds of different types

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.100
of artists.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.680
And then another different
passion communities, like

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.240
woodworking, or 3D printing and
robotics, which is a big

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.280
focus for us right now-- plus
everyone that lives there now.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.480
You begin to get this mixture
of amazingness that you,

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.710
otherwise, wouldn't
get if you try to

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.100
pre-program It yourself.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.510
So overall, we're basically
thinking that learning from

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.800
Zappos, we believed that culture
of being the most

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.540
important thing to a company
is sort of analogous to

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.570
community to a city.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.940
And community is just another
representation of the word

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.700
culture and this feeling
of optimism.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:16.410
And essentially that mixture
creates this amazing cut

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.290
opportunity for upward mobility,
this concept that

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.120
you can move somewhere,
be somewhere, and do

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.305
whatever you want--

00:38:22.305 --> 00:38:25.610
embracing the concept of
serendipity over pre-planning

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.150
and pre-thinking
things through.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.650
We experiment with ways
to connect people.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.190
So once we have those people
there, what do we do?

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.120
We use things like the
Praying Mantis to be

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.540
a way finding tool.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.790
In most cities, it's a sign.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.120
In our case, it's a giant
bug that shoots fire.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.170
We play around with guerrilla--
this was actually

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.520
a project in Raleigh that got
ripped down by the city.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.540
But it was so popular with
people that the city came

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.820
along and ended up paying
the guy to do it

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.570
across the whole town.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.570
And this guy's name is Matt.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.700
And he has just amazing
ideas about how to

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.890
move people in cities.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.540
And we say, why not?

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.260
We ask questions like
what moves people?

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.940
And most of you who've been,
obviously, in San Francisco,

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.160
you know where this came from.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.570
The guys, Architecture for
Humanity, and this guy Matt

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.990
were the people that made
this happen in SF.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:15.020
And we think that there's a
lot to be learned from the

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.870
concept of nontraditional
things moving people.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.480
We asked questions like, what
does a streetscape do?

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.370
This is a map of San Francisco
that overlays crime, cabs, and

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.160
taxis and finds that where
there's more--

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.950
the yellow is actually a
representation of crime, and

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.050
the blue is a representation
of trees.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.590
What correlation of do those two
things have on each other?

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.790
Clearly, it's pretty powerful.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.020
Maybe it's not the single one,
but it's pretty powerful.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.155
We look at cities like New York
and others and say, how

00:39:42.155 --> 00:39:44.390
can we better invest in places
for people to gather on the

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.650
street and have safe
places to bike?

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.510
How are they going
to get around?

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.460
And then we make big decisions
like building a building for

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.330
2,000 people but only having
1,000 parking spaces.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.490
And we say, well, now we're
actually probably going to

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.390
test this concept of mobility,
and walkability, and how

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.960
people are going
to get around.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.670
So we asked the question, what
happens when you eliminate

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.990
cost as a factor?

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.360
And this is where I get
to my favorite topic.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.010
What happens when you eliminate
cost as a factor and

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.210
essentially say, mobility is
free with the exception of the

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:13.920
monthly membership.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.166
But that action of moving is
something that you shouldn't

00:40:16.166 --> 00:40:17.170
have to think about.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.560
What would happen if every one
of you had a car, a driver,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.380
sitting right outside this door,
and they would be with

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.380
you within five minutes, and
you could go anywhere you

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.460
wanted to go, and it wouldn't
cost you anything.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.840
How would that change the way
you move in a city when you

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.720
can't necessarily walk?

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.850
What happens when you bring
together every possible

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.520
mobility option and eliminate
you having to choose between a

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.010
taxi, an Uber, and a
bike, and a bus.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.550
What happens to your sense of
mobility when you combine that

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:43.930
with a truly walkable city with

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.730
nontraditional way finding.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.000
So we launch project 100.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.710
We're in the process of
launching the company now.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.060
And by the end of the
month, we'll have

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.700
12 full time employees.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.105
But the end of next year,
we'll taken delivery

00:40:55.105 --> 00:40:56.820
of 100 model S's.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.200
Vehicles like Twizy,
where you--

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:58.660
Twizy's from [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.060
Renault we're bringing
into the urban core.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.200
Federating bikes is a free
option for our members and

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.420
using shuttle buses to handle
high density routes.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.040
We're reshaping point to point
transportation in a way that

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.480
cities can't do with a
subsidized $2 route.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.600
But ultimately, on a per ride
basis, you're probably going

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.220
to pay a lot less than $2.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.880
But the idea is, if you
eliminate the mobility

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.240
question from people's
lives, what happens?

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.380
How do they move around a 15 to
20 block area differently?

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.970
Can you go to four places in
a night instead of one?

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.910
Can you eat lunch across the way
and run into other people

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.500
that aren't necessarily right
across from your office?

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.685
How does that change how you
interact with people?

00:41:33.685 --> 00:41:37.840
If you guys come to Vegas, and
you email me, I'll tell you

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.960
you should probably stay at the
Ogden, which is where Tony

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.590
and I moved a couple
of years ago.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.410
I recently moved down
the street.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.840
But he lives in the top
left corner there.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.730
And we have about now
100 beds we treat

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.560
like free hotel rooms.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.080
And the idea first was someone
would email us and say, hey,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.020
I'm coming to town, what's
going on in Vegas?

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.440
And we'd say hey,
come stay here.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.950
We have a bed you can hang out
and just work downtown for a

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.060
couple of days, which is our
way of tricking them into

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.950
coming, and hanging out,
and seeing what we

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.990
were working on.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.500
And what we actually found from
those experiences was

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.730
kind of the same thing you learn
at an event like Summit

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:12.080
or Ted, where the magic of a
community is not what happens

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.760
when it's pre-programmed, but
what happens in between.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.440
And that, to us, is actually
what Vegas can be every day.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.070
So I'll speak more to
that in a second.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.280
But we're investing in things
like the inspired theater to

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.745
support the speaker series on,
not only a daily basis, but an

00:42:26.745 --> 00:42:29.790
hourly, or half hour basis,
where you always know you can

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.890
walk right on it at any point in
the day, and there'll be an

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.590
interesting talk by someone
who has something to share

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.150
every half hour, on the hour,
most days of the week.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.865
They always silhouette
Tony in there, and

00:42:39.865 --> 00:42:42.500
it's kind of creepy.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.610
And so what actually ended up
happening was we accidentally

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.330
created this cadence
of things.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.220
So first, it was about trying
to consolidate all these

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.620
amazing people in tech to come
on one week so they ran into

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.000
each other.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.270
And then once they did that,
we realized there was a lot

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.670
more magic that was happening
than we could

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.570
ever possibly create.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.280
So we start theming
every week.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.080
Week one is First Friday
of the Arts Festival.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.960
Week two is Tech
Cocktail Week.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.700
Week three is a focus on
fashion, with talks and

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.150
workshops for fashion
folks, which you can

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.400
tell I'm not one of.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.835
And Week four is kind of
everything else, Catalyst is

00:43:13.835 --> 00:43:15.700
about inspiring a different
way of thinking.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.960
It's sort of like a mini-Ted.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.910
And so we did that.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.620
And we realized, well, people
asked, well, what are you

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.010
doing to bring people here
over the long term?

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.800
And that got us thinking, well,
what does it actually

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.620
mean to be a resident
of a city?

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.275
And this is a simple
mathematical calculation.

00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:33.950
If you take in travel, and life,
and different things you

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.950
have to do, you, generally
speaking, for most of the

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.860
year, in one year, you're
essentially collisionable, out

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.740
connecting with community about
1,000 hours a year, if

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.660
you take out laundry, and
errands, and so forth.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.600
So this question came from a
guy named Jake, who, at the

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.750
time, had the biggest
fashion-related Kickstarter

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.900
campaign ever based
on underwear.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.890
And this is another terrible
photo that he would hate that

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.000
we're showing.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.090
But the question from him was, I
want to be a part of this on

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:02.840
a regular basis.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.740
But I can't be here 100%.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.570
I have a family.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.610
I have a warehouse
in New York.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:08.650
Is there a middle ground?

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.840
And so we thought for a second,
what does it mean to

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.910
actually be a purposeful person
in a community versus a

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.290
dedicated person?

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.330
So we did a little map
calculation and found that,

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:23.050
essentially, if you come for
three or four days a week, 12

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.690
times a year, your collisionable
hour is when

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.373
you're more purposeful, you
don't have errands to run.

00:44:27.373 --> 00:44:29.810
You don't have kids to pick up,
you're actually about as

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:33.040
collisionable as I am by coming
once a month versus

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.870
being there all the time.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.310
So we have this idea of
subscribing to downtown Vegas.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:40.480
So what we have now is there's
a routine set of 20 or 30

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.070
people that we all see every
month for about a week.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.590
And those people, in my opinion,
are almost more

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.310
collisionable and powerful in
the neighborhood than even I

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.890
am because I have things going
on, and they don't.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.830
They're there 100%.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:57.800
So back to our RRC calculation,
if you break down

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.080
100 residents per acre, that
actually, if you start

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.940
thinking about what I said about
Natalie's calculation of

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.040
more about collisional hours
than dollars, and this is an

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.670
awkward slide, but essentially
instead of thinking about 100

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.710
people per acre, we think
about 100 collisional

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:13.330
community hours per
acre per year--

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:14.540
100,000.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.990
And that really is actually
what kind of happened to

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:21.900
Natalie, except she's on
about 1/120 of an acre.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:26.420
And she's getting 100,000
collisions in a year for about

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.440
an hour at a time.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.400
So Natalie is a part of what
creates that collisional

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.300
neighborhood and those density
points that people connect in.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.850
So to what I said, Triumph of
the City, I think, is probably

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:42.680
one of the best books that
you can read about

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.470
how to build a city.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.250
And the reason why it makes
sense to us is because there's

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.650
a general trend around the world
where, while we all are

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.350
a little bit over, a half to
60%, in cities today, in our

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.130
lifetime, more than three
quarters of the planet will

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:55.180
live in cities.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.520
So if we don't figure out how
to make a city a productive

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.450
and happy part of our lives,
we're not going to be

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.370
successful in our evolution.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:05.010
We're going to continue to kind
of spiral out of control.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.830
So essentially, when you combine
all these things,

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.590
collisions, community,
co-learning, and all the

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.350
environmental variables that I
just described, at the end of

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.910
the day, the question
is, what will

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:13.570
people say about downtown?

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:17.530
And to us, we believe that the
big bet is that downtown Vegas

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:18.810
will make you smarter.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.840
And that's something that we've
spent the last two years

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.900
trying to figure out
how to create.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.270
And that's really all I have to
share with you right now.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.520
Kind of blasted through a lot.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.800
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious more
about the mobility stuff

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.150
that you were talking about.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.540
Have you already launched all
those different services?

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.910
And how's it going?

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.710
And do people like that?

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.320
ZACH WARE: So yes or no.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.580
We are about four to six months
away from phase one

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.550
data of Project 100, which will
essentially focus first

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:56.220
on very enhanced driving
mobility, so essentially car

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.560
sharing with urban vehicle,
and Teslas, and

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.390
bikes in the core.

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.950
Phase two, a few months after
that, we'll add drivers to

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.930
handle when you can't
drive yourself.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.640
And then we'll expand
geographically to include a

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.980
residential area around
downtown.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.680
We're very much on the pathway
to doing that.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.910
By the end of mid September,
we'll have a team of 12

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.660
focused on it.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.070
And I expect to launch
in about February.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:21.160
I think most people, we kind
of point to the Henry Ford

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.610
problem quite a bit, that
you know you like Uber.

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:25.320
You know you like bikes.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.770
You know you like to drive.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.530
The question is what happens
when you put all

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:30.760
those things together?

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.190
And we don't know what human
behavior will be when all

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.140
those options are equalized.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.440
I'm sure people love driving
and riding in a Tesla, but

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.820
it's more long term, what
will they do with

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.840
that technical ability.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.890
So we're very, very focused on
getting the right experiment

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.620
in place, so we can
understand.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.990
AUDIENCE: So it seems like you
guys have done a lot to work

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:52.280
around the area in downtown
through your own startup

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.320
endeavors, but what efforts have
you taken, or do you have

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.950
plans to take more efforts
to work with existing

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:02.260
infrastructure, and communities,
and institutions,

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.020
I guess, in Las Vegas?

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.550
Places like UNLV, is really
right down the street.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.410
And it seems like you guys
could do a lot to sort of

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.070
partner with them, considering
their budget issues in the

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:14.840
last few years and things like
that, to sort of help create

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.990
an incubator for things that you
guys don't have to create

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.320
yourself, but you're working
with something

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.710
that already there?

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.020
ZACH WARE: So you Teach for
America is an example of how

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:25.890
we try to take the work we're
doing and let it spread more

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:29.440
equally across the existing
community and neighborhood.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.080
Specifically, to UNLV, we have
a unique challenge there.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.080
UNLV is not a community
school.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.190
It's very much a commuter
school.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:41.455
And so yeah, it's about four
miles down the street, but no

00:48:41.455 --> 00:48:42.900
one really lives on campus.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.760
It's very much a drive
in, drive out.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.850
We had that same idea a couple
of years ago when we first

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:50.560
started, and we sat down with
the president of the

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:50.920
university.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:56.290
And his solution to helping
technologist for example

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.620
understand what they're learning
today could help them

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.620
start a company was to create
a joint MBA masters in

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.040
computer science program.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.850
And everything they want to
do is about formality.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.710
And we were more like, just get
them to startup weekend.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.450
Let's just get a car and
drive them down there.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.440
And that's step one.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.550
So we're slowly making progress
in that area, but I

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.500
think, in Las Vegas, what the
institutional folks in

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.290
casinos, hospitality, education,
there's very much

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:24.850
an insular attitude.

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.250
And so we're just saying,
OK, we'll just start.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.850
We'll create something, and then
we'll be here, and the

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:31.130
door is wide open.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.700
But we have to demonstrate
that we've got our stuff

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.440
together before, I think,
they'll listen to us.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.380
So the jury is still out.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.590
AUDIENCE: Could you talk a
little bit about sort of the

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.310
reception from different ethnic
communities and also

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:45.660
class community?

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.320
How's that?

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.700
How are they looking?

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.235
How are they seeing the Downtown
Project and the

00:49:50.235 --> 00:49:51.200
participation.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.780
ZACH WARE: Sure.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:56.300
The neighborhood that we were
centered in, one, was barren.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.880
So that's a challenge.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.240
A challenge in the sense that
there was no one really there.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.790
Downtown is really weird.

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:05.330
It's dirt and empty hotels.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:10.200
We're surrounded by very
family focused, but not

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.880
necessarily wealthy,
neighborhoods.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.450
Just north of us is
a huge Hispanic.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:18.510
East of us is a kind
of a hodgepodge.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:21.240
Generally speaking, our approach
is reflected in the

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.770
people that are driving the
things that we're investing in

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.040
and building.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.300
Our ethos is not to create
something that's closed off

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.330
and to create something
that's accessible.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:34.510
So ultimately, we think that
when it comes to housing, or

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.430
restaurants, or food, we have
this opportunity, for example,

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.960
with grocery, to get rid
of a food desert.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.620
And to do that, you have to
have approachable pricing.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.867
And it doesn't just have to
support someone like Tony, it

00:50:45.867 --> 00:50:48.960
needs to support someone
who is on food stamps.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.920
So our general approach has
been, to a degree-- someone

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.560
asked a similar question at a
talk a couple days ago about

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.720
getting more female
entrepreneurs.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.740
And we said, we don't
necessarily have a an outward

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.450
focus on doing it, but we're
not closed off at all.

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:06.250
We ultimately think that the
melting pot that is our

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:11.450
neighborhood can support that
diversity over time.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.340
So we're not reaching out too
heavily to any group from any

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.420
background.

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:19.140
But if you come visit, you can
tell that it's a pretty

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.800
diverse pot of people that are
in our neighborhood, from all

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.190
kinds of socioeconomic
backgrounds.

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.400
And that's what makes
a magical.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.580
And that's the risk that we
have in investing is that

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.500
we'll end up shutting
that group out.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.490
So we try really, really hard
to make sure that we, and no

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:35.055
one else, comes and sort of
gentrifies the neighborhood.

00:51:35.055 --> 00:51:37.670
That's a really tough
thing to do.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.480
AUDIENCE: So I know cities
like New York and San

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.670
Francisco attract a lot
of talented people

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:42.830
from outside areas.

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:46.580
And other thriving cities, I
guess, have, like Austin and

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.850
Pittsburgh have research
or tech universities.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.200
So how does Vegas, or your
project consider bringing in

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.680
outside talent and
entrepreneurs, and artists?

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.090
ZACH WARE: So we host, just a
random stat, we just about 100

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:01.330
people on our crash
pads every week.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:06.460
And the number one recurring
visitor home is New York.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.770
I think what happened initially
is similar to what

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.810
happened to Zappos.

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.110
We focus very heavily on the
experience on the ground.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.905
And when a random person comes
and tells another friend, and

00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:19.170
tell another friend, it begins
to compound upon itself.

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:21.530
So what we've seen both
organically and with things

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.940
like Tech Cocktail Week and
Catalyst Week is this

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:30.220
explosion of interest and word
of mouth sharing that has led

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:34.610
to 37 companies in Vegas Tech
Fund portfolio, probably 25 of

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:38.070
which are from either Seattle,
or San Francisco, or New York.

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.630
They weren't companies we
brought into Vegas.

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:41.890
They wanted to come.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.190
And we happened to participate
in the investment kind of as a

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:46.370
secondary thing.

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.610
Dozens more, either in tech
or elsewhere that have

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.590
independently moved, I think,
because of the entrepreneurial

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:52.710
spirit on the ground.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.450
It's tough to not be infected
by it when you're there.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:01.640
So I think, globally, by
focusing more on the

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.570
experience when you're there,
and they resources that are

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:07.260
there, we feel like if you come
to Vegas, you're probably

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.530
going to come back here
and tell five friends.

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.150
And that begins to compound
upon itself.

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:12.830
And we'd rather do that than go
out and buy an ad, if that

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:13.590
make sense.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.690
Thank you.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.990
[APPLAUSE]
