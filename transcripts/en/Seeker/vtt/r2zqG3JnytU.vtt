This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Dollar Shave Club.

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:04.500
Buying blades is the worst.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.420
You have to go all the way to the store and
drop an A. Jack for a couple mediocre things?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.820
Dollar Shave Club will SEND you blades, handles,
and other bathroom stuff; all for a few bucks

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.820
a month.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.820
Shave time, shave money.

Cheers to beer!

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.330
Science has finally solved the riddle of all
that pesky foam at the top of your favorite

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.259
barley pop.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.230
Howdy beer bellies, Trace here, thanks for
watching DNews!

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.590
Beer is an ancient cultured beverage made
by fermenting grains with active yeast, as

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
everyone knows.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.800
There are innumerable quotes about beer out
there, and here's one more.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800
"Beer is real good."

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.460
You can take that one to the bank.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.860
But there's something about beer that people
often deride, foamy head.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.960
When a beer is poured, carbon dioxide or nitrogen
gasses dissolved in the liquid are released

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.450
forming those tiny bubbles.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.310
Beer isn't the only liquid with dissolved
gasses in it though.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.780
Sparkling water, soda, even cider has those
tiny bubbles, but none of them get head as

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.890
thick and static as beer.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.360
Some beer foams last longer than the beverage
itself!

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.390
A new study from the Journal of the American
Society of Brewing Chemists digs into the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.050
deep secrets of foam, exposing the truth.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.170
Turns out the secret to beer foam is barley
lipid transfer protein No. 1! Yay!

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.410
I think.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.920
A lipid is an umbrella term for a group of
organic fatty acids, mainly natural oils,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560
waxes and steroids.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.870
Different raw grains contain different concentrations
of lipids, so different beers and brewing

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.659
methods will produce very different foams.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.170
Soda, cider and sparkling water don't have
those lipid proteins, so they won't foam like

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.170
a beer.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.420
I would like to point out, beer foam isn't,
in itself, a bad thing.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.800
I know some bros in bro-town think foam is
totally like wasting the keg brah.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.100
But in reality, some beers are foamier than
others.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.670
According to a professor of food science and
technology at the New York State Agricultural

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.940
Experiment Station, the acidity of the beer,
number of molecular ions, ethanol levels,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.970
viscocity, pH and so on and so forth all the
head on your cold ones.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.480
According to Cornell biochemistry professor
Karl Siebert, there's a goldilocks zone for

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480
beer.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.660
High alcohol Belgian beers at 9-12 percent
and low alcohol beers like Bud Light // 3.2

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.340
percent, ladies // won't form foam at all.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.950
Stuff THAT in your keg and drink it bros!

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.660
But a five percent beer, that's going to be
perfection.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.130
When the beer is poured, the tiny bubbles
of gas will form, and stick to the LTP1 forming

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.430
a nice foamy head on the surface.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.819
For beer aficionados, beer is like wine, so
many factors can go into the flavor, and head

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.230
is just one of them.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.150
As my boy StrongBad once said, "A One that
is not cold, is scarcely a One at all."

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.940
Would you rather have a nice thick foam on
your cold beverage?
