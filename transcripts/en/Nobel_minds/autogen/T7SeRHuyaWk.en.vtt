00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:55.560
 
we have a question there and I have a

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:55.570
we have a question there and I have a
 

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.500
we have a question there and I have a
question about these receptors we were

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:58.510
question about these receptors we were
 

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.200
question about these receptors we were
told not just now that they are the

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.210
told not just now that they are the
 

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.160
told not just now that they are the
targets of about half of the

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.170
targets of about half of the
 

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.150
targets of about half of the
pharmaceuticals that the drug industry

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160
pharmaceuticals that the drug industry
 

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.050
pharmaceuticals that the drug industry
make what about them make them so useful

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.060
make what about them make them so useful
 

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.020
make what about them make them so useful
in in medicine well I think there are

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.030
in in medicine well I think there are
 

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.530
in in medicine well I think there are
several things so you in medicine the

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:16.540
several things so you in medicine the
 

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.720
several things so you in medicine the
first is that as you probably heard

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:18.730
first is that as you probably heard
 

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.480
first is that as you probably heard
there are very lot of these receptors

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:21.490
there are very lot of these receptors
 

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.320
there are very lot of these receptors
and they they serve as the Gateway to

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:25.330
and they they serve as the Gateway to
 

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:30.030
and they they serve as the Gateway to
the cells or many neurotransmitters and

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040
the cells or many neurotransmitters and
 

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.990
the cells or many neurotransmitters and
form a body as a result they are

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000
form a body as a result they are
 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.870
form a body as a result they are
crucially positioned to regulate almost

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880

we need to do in cases of disease is to

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:46.870
we need to do in cases of disease is to
 

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.240
we need to do in cases of disease is to
manipulate the activity of these normal

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:51.250
manipulate the activity of these normal
 

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.720
