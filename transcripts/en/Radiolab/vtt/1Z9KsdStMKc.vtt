00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.920
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. Our topic today,

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.920
choice and human destinies. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.180
With the way we are is that the way we're going to stay are very nicely put.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.710
Yes. In the last section we were talking about baboons and their propensity to

5
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:19.920
serious change, which isn't maybe or maybe not. We don't really know. Yeah.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.010
We'll know in a thousand years. Well let's switch our ape.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.900
We'll go to Oregonians,

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.650
which is a rare subset of human beings to set it up.

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.480
We were thinking a lot about um, small groups on this show. You know,

10
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.580
cause that's what we are. We are a small group primates.

11
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.250
That's the phrase that sometimes you use to describe as humans.

12
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:41.570
And it's a phrase that can carry some negative connotations.

13
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.230
As in we evolved in these small groups that we are predisposed to be small

14
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:47.930
minded. No small is not always a bad thing.

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.340
I'm gonna tell you a story now that's a small group story. It's a,

16
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840
just as a warning contains a moment or two.

17
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.710
That's a tiny bit graphic but we hope you'll stick with it cause it's a really

18
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:02.120
cool story. Takes place in a small town like really small,

19
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.360
the kind of town where you can dial the wrong number and still have a

20
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:09.830
conversation cause you know everybody. So tell me where we are and,

21
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:13.880
and uh, downtown Silverton. Uh,

22
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.860
essentially our downtown is not changed since the late forties, early fifties.

23
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.430
Oh yes it has. But we'll get to that. This is stew Rasmussen.

24
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.570
He is our main character.

25
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.910
And a little while back stu gave myself and producer Aaron Scott a tour over the

26
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:30.680
theater on the corner of the old hardware store on this corner,

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.980
this tour of his favorite place on earth, Silverton, Oregon,

28
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.720
which is about 40 miles from Portland.

29
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.940
It's about 40 years from Portland actually.

30
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.550
It's the town I grew up in and this is my image for what I want silver and gold

31
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.250
to be, you know,

32
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.440
I rode my bicycle down the street and king to the hardware store to going,

33
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.980
we're doing goodness. Is that happen to you?

34
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.370
A lot of people just honk and wave all the time. It's a small town.

35
00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:57.340
Everybody knows man, if it were up to to this town would never change.

36
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.370
It would stay frozen in that quaint Norman Rockwell candy coated image from his

37
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.080
boyhood. The weird thing though is it,

38
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:08.820
that image in his head would probably never have [inaudible] included a guy like

39
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.140
stu at least do as he is now.

40
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.150
And if this is a show about change, here is the story money, pretty radical,

41
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.450
bit of change where you wouldn't expect to find it. Speaking of which,

42
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.030
can you describe where we are and what we're looking at while we're standing in

43
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:26.120
front of the palace theater on the corner of Oak and water street,

44
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.390
this is one of those gone with the wind theaters with the big marquis and the

45
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.070
bulb lights and everything built in 1935 and then continuous operation ever

46
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:38.660
since staples out some keys and opens it up, but starting to get really cold.

47
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.570
He suggested that we do the interview here in the town's only theater.

48
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.360
Even smells like a guild at h theater,

49
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.960
which at 1:00 PM still smelled like popcorn from the previous night and was

50
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:51.410
filled with nothing but 200 empty red velvet seats.

51
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.710
Not what you expect in a small town theater. Oh, this is beautiful.

52
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.220
Yeah. Okay. See you later. Okay. Thank you. You'd loved ourselves at right here.

53
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.120
What do you think? [inaudible] seats in the house. Right in the minutes.

54
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
And pretend we're watching the movie of your life

55
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.180
while there is a dull movement. Hardly.

56
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.460
So the movie of stew begins in 1975 he's 27 and he's in a theater just like

57
00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:20.780
this. No moment in my life was when the rocky horror picture show came. Yeah.

58
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.723
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

59
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.660
<v 0>STU is in the projectionist booth cause that's his job. He's changing the rails.</v>

60
00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:30.300
And at some point during one of the musical members,

61
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.740
he glances at the screen and it was like, oh, what was the, what was the,

62
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.100
Oh here was this movie with a guy in drag onscreen.

63
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.030
Just a fleet. Transvestite is a sweet,

64
00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:48.860
transvestite trained sectional friends, sexual Transylvania.

65
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.140
Those are words that I've never heard.

66
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.700
<v 1>Alright, watch that again. And again,</v>

67
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.580
<v 0>fast forward 10 years. Do you now owns the theater?</v>

68
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.820
Just like his dad had before him. He's an upstanding member of the town.

69
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.830
He's on the Silverton city council.

70
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:11.831
Then on the library board and then [inaudible] he starts to transform and

71
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:14.600
everyone will tell you it began with the nails.

72
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:19.601
I think I probably started having my nails done in 94 or 95 and it started out

73
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:24.080
with very masculine nails without Polish and square ends and then slowly grew

74
00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:27.650
them out and then I went into what I considered a masculine nail color of blue

75
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.340
and then he says he gradually started to paint them red and then he put acrylic

76
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.400
tips. Just got longer and longer. This was the first test. Did the community,

77
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.750
Hello Lori. Good evening sir. How are you? It's,

78
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.710
I would be at the theater taking tickets,

79
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.950
be dressed as usual and his plaid shirt and jeans.

80
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.610
His hand would come out for their tickets and

81
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.500
the heel are those, you can't miss it. And you know you had a long fingernail.

82
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.100
Hello. That's Dennis [inaudible] time. Silvertone Ian,

83
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.900
one time when I had to give him my ticket and that's Megan salvo. She's 17.

84
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.160
And he ripped it and like his nails like went down the palm of my hand and just

85
00:05:04.161 --> 00:05:05.460
gave me the chills. Yeah,

86
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.800
probably his nails were the first thing most people notice.

87
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.780
Cal Palmer veterinarian and city councilman born and raised here in Silver Lake

88
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.600
was there talk was Oh people sitting, oh definitely talk.

89
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.200
But it happened so gradually, which is something you hear again and again.

90
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:24.750
It happened gradually, you know, first it was the nails and, and then uh,

91
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.140
at some point in time he changed the focus of the movie theater and was really

92
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.960
making a game attempt to get new releases and down in the theater and do

93
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.370
frequently, you know, when there was a theme kind of movie,

94
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.800
he would get into costume. My name is Ken Hector,

95
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.720
former mayor of a sort in Oregon.

96
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.440
And very often the costume would be female attire.

97
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.920
This is step two of Steve's very careful transition according to everyone we

98
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:51.100
spoke with for years after the nails. He would quote,

99
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:56.101
promote that week's movie by dressing up or one of the new star wars movies was

100
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.040
out and it wasn't a coincidence.

101
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.520
<v 2>He was dressed as queen on the dollar. I love you.</v>

102
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.550
Whatever name is from the movie. Years ago,

103
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.480
you remember some years ago there was a movie called my big Fat Greek wedding.

104
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.630
That's John, Bob, also a lifelong silver Toni.

105
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.290
That whole day he wandered around town in a wedding dress.

106
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.330
The complete with the veil. That of course got everybody talking. You know,

107
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.050
a lot of people laughed about it. I don't think people put it together with um,

108
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.730
this is Linda web. Um, she's a registered nurse. Sexuality,

109
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.160
transgender or any of those things.

110
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:34.390
I think we thought he was just dressing up to go along with this. Uh, Yup.

111
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.160
With his movies. There was clearly a,

112
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:39.940
let's go by the movie theater tonight cause we've got to know what

113
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.640
<v 0>students wearing the, for Stu, this was just the beginning of something. He was,</v>

114
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.290
he wasn't just clowning around. When did your gender complexities begin?

115
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.420
In probably 14 or 15.

116
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.100
I think I was a shy young man and interfacing with girls.

117
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:59.210
My mother was a bit strange on on that in that girls were evil and they would,

118
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.860
no girl was good enough for her son and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

119
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.960
So did you date at all? Not until I was out of high school.

120
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.380
So girls were kind of scary. It sounds like girls were scary. Yeah,

121
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.210
well everybody else went on dates.

122
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:14.450
He says he would build computers from scratch.

123
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.510
And even today in his basement you'll find an entire electrical shop.

124
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.580
I'm like, God, fun stuff. RF generators, spectrum analyzer, project analyzer,

125
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.440
other logic, analyze it. In any case,

126
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.820
two says the best that he can explain himself. Gender-Wise,

127
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.410
it's just to say that when he looks in the mirror,

128
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.770
he likes himself better when he's dressed as a woman.

129
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.720
I don't know how to describe it. It's just, um, I can't understand it.

130
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:46.430
I mean, some people like to dress up and look like a cowboy or a lumberjack,

131
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.730
whatever. You know,

132
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.840
it's your mental image of yourself that you look in the mirror and you like.

133
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.540
So after the nails,

134
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.290
after dozens of episodes of social example cross-dressing,

135
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.160
Stu took the next step. He began to perform some experiments,

136
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:04.190
like he would go to the lumber yard just to get some stuff,

137
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.660
couple of pounds and nails or something.

138
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.580
All the while he would be wearing a padded bra under his flannel shirt just to

139
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.470
see what would happen should this for you. It was like a test.

140
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:16.540
It was like a calculated test. Absolutely gauge if it was possible,

141
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.540
if I could survive with breasts.

142
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.460
So when he was 52 he drove into Portland, visited a doctor,

143
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.560
put him to sleep and the doctors made two small incisions and under each breast

144
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:33.530
about an inch and a half or two inches long and they pulled back the skin on

145
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:34.011
each side,

146
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:38.240
slid in and uninflated balloon and then pumped it up with water until the skin

147
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:40.700
was stretched to the point that it was almost transparent.

148
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.440
[inaudible] that sounds very painful. Was it? Well, I was asleep at the time,

149
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.360
but when he woke up he was a different man because he now had several pounds of

150
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.270
new stuff hanging off his chest. What were you thinking at that moment?

151
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.450
I was thinking, what have I done? It was like,

152
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.100
there's no going back.

153
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.000
<v 2>I can remember being in a Max place downtown at a table and uh,</v>

154
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.880
he was coming across the street with his breasts prominently showing,

155
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.480
and it was the first time any of us realized that he had actually had surgery

156
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.860
and one lady was going, Oh look, look. And the other lady was going, don't look,

157
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:20.670
don't look. Or You'd see stu going across the street and Oh my God, look,

158
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.210
it's too, my God, what is he do? It's just sort of shocking.

159
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.670
There was a buzz around town. Was it a situation where he [inaudible]

160
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.230
<v 0>walk by and then heads would turn, hushed voices would ensue? Yes.</v>

161
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.250
Basically, this is Victoria sage stews, longtime girlfriend.

162
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.350
They've been together for 36 years.

163
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.130
So we would be walking in our local goodwill and we'd be a few miles away from

164
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:45.300
each other. And I would hear that used to be Steve Rasmussen,

165
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.730
like he had changed somehow.

166
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.950
His is trying to fulfill that body image. He's gotten his head,

167
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.980
but he's also going to in way asked you to adjust your body image if your mate,

168
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.333
has that been difficult?

169
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.173
<v 3>Hm.</v>

170
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.690
<v 0>No. Okay. No, I'm sorry.</v>

171
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:14.310
If you want to get kinky about it, Amanda, which is kind of cool,

172
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.243
<v 3>Huh?</v>

173
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.530
<v 0>Okay. Did, uh,</v>

174
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.650
was there ever any concern there was for me? Um, not so much for Stu.

175
00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:28.651
I think partly because he didn't hear as many whispers as I felt I did,

176
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.670
but I was concerned for the theater business. Not without reason.

177
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.930
A lot of kids in the town stop coming to the theater because their parents

178
00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:38.680
wouldn't let them.

179
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.640
Ticket sales took a hit and it wasn't long before pickup trucks full of teenage

180
00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:45.520
boys would drive by the theater yelling slurs. Oh,

181
00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:49.270
I don't know that I go so far as well. Yeah, I guess, I guess

182
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.073
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

183
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.790
<v 0>Faggot is a slur I guess.</v>

184
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.780
So you get to this point in the sped up movie narrative of Stu,

185
00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.810
this point right here where even though he took it so slowly and was so careful,

186
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.170
it's still easy to imagine things turning up.

187
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.540
<v 2>I don't know. What was that movie about? The boy that was a, you know,</v>

188
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.200
drunk and beat to death because he was gay in a small town in the Midwest.

189
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:16.140
You know what ways does your shepherd yeah, might be a little extreme,

190
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.100
but according to Linda Web Silverton's not so different from Laramie,

191
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.880
Wyoming where Matthew Shepard lived. It's a small town, very traditional,

192
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.490
very conservative. You know, you get a lot of rednecks in silver,

193
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.570
and so Dennis Bean puts it, so it's not crazy to expect the worst,

194
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:34.420
but here's the surprise. Give me a call. Right. And the whole reason. Yeah.

195
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.480
And we

196
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.800
<v 0>came here to silver January 5th,</v>

197
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.270
2009 for the worst. It did not happen.

198
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.720
There was no redneck rebellion. In fact, the opposite happened.

199
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.940
Something historic. Yeah. After me. Hi. Hi.

200
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:57.070
On January 5th, 2009 the town of Silverton elected stu mayor.

201
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.790
<v 4>How did the city of Silverton Marion County for congratulated</v>

202
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.050
it has elected the nation's first openly transgender mayor,

203
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.850
nation's first openly transgender mayor. This was a return last year,

204
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:16.870
this election take to do resinous and forcing slide as openly trans ginger as he

205
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:19.600
runs his hometown in heels.

206
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.830
<v 0>And he goes, this is in fact the sound of Stews,</v>

207
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:32.850
four inch heels pounding on linoleum as he goes to a city council meeting.

208
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.090
Hello Harold. Couldn't be better. How are you doing? Good now,

209
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.460
call us, you know, city elitist or whatever,

210
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:44.460
but a mayor and a plunging v-neck sweater and a black miniskirt.

211
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.450
Not what you would expect any tiny, conservative Republican town.

212
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.610
So we wanted to know, you know, why did this happen here? Wow.

213
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.650
So producer Aaron Scott and I walked around town for a couple of days and we

214
00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:59.460
interviewed dozens of people, including a guy named Ken Hector,

215
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.210
who stu beat out for mayor. He's a conservative Republican.

216
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:05.100
Definitely not one of Steve's big fans.

217
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.960
It was just a difference in philosophy about, I don't want to sound pretentious,

218
00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:10.920
but you know, as a mayor,

219
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:15.270
I think there's certain expectations about professionalism that you should

220
00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:15.900
exhibit.

221
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.900
He would come in with a tight clinging top with cleavage down to here that

222
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.090
you're almost pointing at your belly button there a little bit higher. Come on.

223
00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:26.190
You know when you're at the council meeting,

224
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.220
show some dignity here and just dress in the appropriate attire for the

225
00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:36.300
occasion. Can't even try to get the city council to impose a dress code on stew.

226
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.130
But when we asked them, you know,

227
00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:42.450
are you surprised that the town has embraced stu and even gone so far as to

228
00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:46.640
elect a mayor? He said, no, not in this case. You know,

229
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.080
stu is a rarity in that. You know,

230
00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:52.050
there's a lot of people in this town who were extremely religious,

231
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.820
very conservative people were at a stranger who came into town suddenly,

232
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.610
I'm sure that the support and perception might've been different,

233
00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:02.550
but you're talking about a native son who grew up here

234
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.110
and he said, people look, your folks do runs the only theater in town.

235
00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:10.400
So he's out there every weekend standing out in front of the palace theater,

236
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.080
taking tickets. Everybody knows him. Not only that,

237
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.870
back in the day he used to be the cable guys.

238
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.030
So he's literally been in everybody's homes.

239
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.310
He's still the guy you call if you have trouble with your computer.

240
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.220
So it might sound strange to you, but it's really not.

241
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:29.270
And that is when it hit me actually under the right circumstances.

242
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.120
A small town can be like the most progressive place on earth.

243
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:37.670
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

244
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.010
<v 0>and it's exactly because everyone's all up in your grill.</v>

245
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.000
You were forced to know people. Like for instance, how long have you known sue?

246
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.790
Oh my goodness. I grew up with Stu. I mean we, um, I remember when stu,

247
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.360
it's like an alter boy. The church is my brother. This is Susie.

248
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:57.110
Seamless retired t-shirts. Yeah, his parents and my parents were friends.

249
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.640
Like a lot of folks in Silverton,

250
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:02.660
she is known stu for so long and then in so many different contexts that you

251
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:05.390
can't do that New York thing with him where you like you see someone on the

252
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:09.110
sidewalk and you size him up instantly and thinking freak no to her.

253
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:11.300
He's way too complicated for that, you know,

254
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:15.380
to her he's do the altar boys do the computer games? Yeah,

255
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.290
I probably would call it a geek to do the city council, man, let's do the mayor.

256
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.950
Or it's just too just too,

257
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.740
<v 2>just, just do whatever that's him. You know, go on about your business.</v>

258
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:28.883
Yeah. To be clear, a lot of the

259
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.000
<v 0>people we talked to these facts,</v>

260
00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:33.820
some of the same folks who said yes dues just to,

261
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.060
are still not happy about the situation. No. I mean,

262
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.630
I don't think God's across dresser. They either felt it was morally wrong.

263
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:45.220
As in the case of this minister Tom Smith in Genesis one 27 says,

264
00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:48.820
so God created man in his own image. In the more,

265
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.840
some folks like Linda Web's husband. John just felt like he takes it [inaudible]

266
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.040
<v 2>it's right there. It's in your face. He dresses Kinda like a streetwalker.</v>

267
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.220
You feel that that's confrontational? I do that.

268
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:03.320
Most of the people who had objections,

269
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.960
it was a little more nuanced and it went something like this. Well, I,

270
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.360
I personally did not vote for him for mayor because I didn't feel it was a good

271
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:15.770
idea to have someone that looked like that representing us.

272
00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:20.060
But on the other hand, he is a good man and he's got this town at heart.

273
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.560
In other words, according to John Bach,

274
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:25.490
the problem really isn't stu or the town. So the way he, it's the outside,

275
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.340
all those people out there who are going to hear about stu

276
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.050
<v 0>and then judge them,</v>

277
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.000
which is what makes November 25th, 2008 such an interesting day.

278
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.070
Steve had just been elected mayor,

279
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.630
he'd squeaked it out by about 400 votes but he hadn't yet been sworn in when a

280
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:48.560
group of Christian extremists from Kansas showed up in town and started marching

281
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:52.670
up and down main street yelling at people and at one point they even unfurled

282
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.110
and American flag put it on the ground and stepped on it just to show how

283
00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:57.530
offensive

284
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.370
<v 4>they found students. It's our duty to come out here and preach to everyone</v>

285
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.570
is the scariest thing these folks hate stu.

286
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.340
Cause they will not by any means warn him about to send this,

287
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:12.630
taking him to hell. Okay,

288
00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:17.631
so one pleasant and then bringing up signs that key things like a god hates

289
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.940
overtake, God hates your mayor. God hates fags. Your pastor is a horn. Yeah.

290
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.170
It's an abomination for a man put on a woman's clothes and to be the opposite

291
00:17:27.781 --> 00:17:30.250
sex. If he folks from the town decided, yeah,

292
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.760
let's just start a counter protest. We stood, uh,

293
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.290
across the street from these people by and large, just a few guys. At first, no,

294
00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:37.661
earlier,

295
00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:41.010
someone had suggest all the guys ought to dress up as girls and all the girls

296
00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:44.320
had to dress up. These guys. Yesi Davidson said, isn't this a reaction?

297
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:49.260
Was here. Right? But there he was in a dress. I had a great time.

298
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.090
We, Betty new breast [inaudible],

299
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.350
but that really actually was the first time he says that at first he and the two

300
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:59.010
or three other guys who had on women's clothing felt a little weird.

301
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.693
But then

302
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:10.410
people just started coming and this just amazing of a couple of hundred people.

303
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.300
I mean men dressed like women, women just like men.

304
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.360
Some of the people that I sat down there were surprising because I had labeled

305
00:18:18.641 --> 00:18:23.641
them in my head is conservative and people drive by people with signs.

306
00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:29.050
God loves, so God loves stew. With the costumes,

307
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:33.170
the town was really alive in the crowd, just kept getting bigger and bigger.

308
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.320
Who were you? What were you thinking at that moment? From what I understand,

309
00:18:36.321 --> 00:18:38.960
you were standing off to the side just watching what was going through your

310
00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:39.920
mind. Yeah, well,

311
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.220
honestly I tried to discourage people from even giving them the time of day

312
00:18:43.221 --> 00:18:45.140
saying, don't give them any attention.

313
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.560
<v 1>I couldn't get that to happen. They were so angry and</v>

314
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.480
they came out 200 people, men in dresses,

315
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.840
grandmothers, babies. That's,

316
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:11.050
it's just amazing that that was the town that wasn't me.

317
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.500
[inaudible] sorry,

318
00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:21.670
I get a little emotional.

319
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.430
<v 4>That must've been a turning point for you.</v>

320
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.170
<v 1>The biggest one? Yeah.</v>

321
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:36.580
[inaudible]

322
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.710
<v 4>before we go to break, I just want to give props to Aaron Scott,</v>

323
00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:42.220
who did a huge chunk of the reporting for that piece in co-produced it with me.

324
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.000
We'll be right back.
