00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.390
As long as the cell doubles its DNA before dividing, then each daughter

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.689
cell will have the same amount of DNA information as the parent cell did.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt; Sounds like a pretty important step, that

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.300
all the genetic information stays intact for every division.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.490
&gt;&gt; Exactly. We call this kind of division, mitosis. Mitosis

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.740
is a kind of division where the same amount of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.970
information is maintained over many cell divisions. So it's important

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.680
to keep two copies of the chromosome in every cell.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.850
&gt;&gt; Right. This is how a heterozygous cell, where one

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.290
copy of the chromosome has one allele and the other copy

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.170
of the chromosome has another allele, when they divide and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.400
have daughter cells, both the daughter cells will also be heterozygous.
