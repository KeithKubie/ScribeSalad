00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:01.940
In a previous
video, we've already

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.930
shown that if we have some
circle centered at O right

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.570
over here, and that
if OD is a radius,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.050
and it's a radius that
bisects chord AC-- so bisects

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.370
means that it kind of
splits it in two, that AB

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.450
is equal to BC-- we've
proven in a previous video

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.480
that OD will be
perpendicular to AC.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.001
So we've proven that we can
assume that is perpendicular.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.750
And that video, if you
want to look it up,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.320
and you might want to
prove it yourself just

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.944
out of interest, but
the video-- if you

00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:31.650
do a search on Khan
Academy for radius

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.840
is perpendicular
to a chord, you'll

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.520
hopefully find
the proof of that.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.750
What I want to do in this
video is go the other way.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.295
If we know that OD is
a radius and that it

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:43.460
is perpendicular to chord AC,
what I want to do in this video

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.487
is prove that it's bisecting it.

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:47.320
So we're not assuming
that it's bisecting it

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.350
in this video right over here.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.060
We're just assuming
that it's perpendicular.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.710
So we're essentially
going to go the other way.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.835
Here, we started with the
fact that it bisected it,

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:55.940
and we established that
they were perpendicular.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.247
That was in the previous video.

00:00:57.247 --> 00:00:59.080
Now we're going to start
with the assumption

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.807
that they're perpendicular and
then prove that they bisect.

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:04.640
And just like we did
in that previous proof,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.610
we'll set up some
triangles here since we

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.390
know a lot about triangles now.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.640
And we'll set up the
triangles by drawing two more

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.450
radii, radius OC and radius OA.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.020
And that's useful
for us because we

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.250
know that they're both
radii for the same circle.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.720
So they have to be
the same length.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.350
The radius doesn't
change on a circle.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.040
So those two things
are the same length.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.110
And you might already
see where this is going.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.926
Let me label this point here.

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:32.550
Let me call this M
because we're hoping

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.760
that ends up being
the midpoint of AC.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.850
Triangle AMO is
a right triangle.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.930
This is its hypotenuse.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.880
AO is its hypotenuse.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.020
Triangle OMC is
a right triangle,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.940
and this is its hypotenuse
right over there.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.930
And so already showed
that the hypotenuses

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.830
have the same length, and both
of these right triangles share

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.190
segment or side OM.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.580
So OM is clearly
equal to itself.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.990
And in a previous video,
not the same video

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.822
where we explained this thing.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.030
In a previous video where
we talk about-- and I think

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.844
you can look it up.

00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:07.510
I think the video is
called "More on why

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.259
SSA is not a postulate."

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.340
In that video, we say that
SSA is not a postulate.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.280
So SSA, not a
congruency postulate.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.220
But we did establish
in that video

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.530
that RSH is a
congruency postulate.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.830
And RSH tells us that if we
have a right triangle-- that's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.620
where the R comes from-- if
we have a right triangle,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.760
and we have one of the
sides are congruent,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.170
and the hypotenuse
is congruent, then

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.774
we have two congruent triangles.

00:02:40.774 --> 00:02:42.440
And if you look at
this right over here,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.640
we have two right triangles.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.210
AMO is a right triangle.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.940
CMO is a right triangle.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.904
They have one leg that's
congruent, right over here, MO,

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:51.320
and then both of
their hypotenuses

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.870
are congruent to each other.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.590
So, by RSH, we know
that triangle AMO

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.832
is congruent to triangle
CMO by the RSH postulate.

00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:13.540
And so if we know that
they're congruent,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.530
then their corresponding
sides have to be congruent.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.660
So based on that,
we then know that AM

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.980
is a corresponding side.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.130
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.300
AM is a corresponding
side to MC.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.400
So we know that AM
must be equal to MC

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.100
because they're
corresponding sides.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.350
These are corresponding sides.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.380
So congruency implies
that these are equal.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.190
And if those are equal, then we
know that OD is bisecting AC.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.190
So we've established
what we need to do.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.944
Another way that we could
have proven it without RSH,

00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:51.985
is just straight up with
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.630
We already know, just by
setting up these two radii right

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.959
over here, we know that OA--
so we draw a little line here.

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.000
This is another way that
we could have proven it.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.270
We already know that
OA is equal to OC.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.820
And we also know that
OM is equal to itself.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.220
OM is clearly equal to OM.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.670
It's equal to itself.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.610
And we also know from
the Pythagorean theorem

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.370
that AM-- do this
in a new color.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:35.570
We know that AM squared plus OM
squared is equal to OA squared.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.750
The length of the
two legs squared

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.990
summed up is equal to the length
of the hypotenuse squared.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.830
So we know that for the left
triangle right over here,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.590
for AMO.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.580
And we can set up the
same relationship for CMO.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.110
We know in CMO
that-- and I'm going

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:01.670
to try to do it corresponding--
that CM squared plus OM

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.740
squared is equal to OC squared.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.000
Now we know a few things.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.040
We know that OA is equal to OC.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.780
So, for example, right over
here, where we have OA squared,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.195
we could replace this with OC.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.340
And then you can already
see where this is going.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.930
You can already see that CM and
AM are going to be the same.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.320
But if you want to do it a
little bit more formally,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.040
you can subtract OM squared from
both sides of this equation,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.350
and you'd get AM squared
is equal to OC squared--

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.640
I've replaced this with OC
squared-- minus OM squared.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.090
So that's on the left-hand
side right over here.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.980
And then on the
right-hand side, if we

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.450
subtract OM squared from both
sides, we have CM squared.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:00.232
CM squared is equal to OC
squared minus OM squared.

00:06:00.232 --> 00:06:01.940
And then we could take
the principal root

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.610
of both sides of this
because we really

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.410
care about the positive
root because we

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.100
don't want to have
negative distances.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.100
So if you take the principal
root of both sides,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.430
this becomes AM is equal to
the principal root of that.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.070
And we also get that CM is equal
to the principal root of that.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.380
Well, these two
quantities are the same.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.310
So AM must be equal to CM.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.880
They both equal to this
quantity right here.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.680
So AM is equal to CM, and
it might be a bisector.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.370
And this is really common sense.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.274
If you know that two sides of
two different right triangles

00:06:35.274 --> 00:06:36.940
are going to be
congruent to each other,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.690
you can always use the
Pythagorean theorem

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.720
to get the third side.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.019
And that third side is
uniquely constrained

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:43.560
by the length of
the other two sides,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.049
because it's a right triangle.

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:46.840
And so these are all
ways of really getting

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.640
at the same thing.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.240
But now we can feel
pretty good about the fact

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.480
that if OD is
perpendicular here,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.070
then it's definitely going
to bisect this chord.
