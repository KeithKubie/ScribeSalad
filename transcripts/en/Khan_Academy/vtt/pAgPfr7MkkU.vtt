00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.590
Let's say we have a magnetic
field that's coming out of the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.920
right side of the screen.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.340
And it's not just along the
screen, it's actually three

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.110
dimensional.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.470
So it's going above the
screen, below, but the

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.550
direction of the magnetic
field is from the

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.410
right to the left.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.760
Let me just draw that.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.790
And I'm not going to draw a
bunch of the field vector

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.060
arrows because that'll just
take up a lot of valuable

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.160
space on our-- so that's the
vector magnetic field.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.430
It's down here, too.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.390
If I could, I would draw it
above your screen and below

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.780
your screen.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.630
But it's coming from the
right to the left.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.380
And then in that magnetic
field I

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.390
have an electric circuit.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.750
I won't draw the whole
circuit right now.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.525
I'll do that in a second.

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:46.410
But let's say I have--
part of the electric

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.640
circuit is a loop.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.760
And the loop looks like this.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.990
I'm trying to draw
it carefully.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.820
So that we can-- because I think
a careful drawing will

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.210
be more useful in
a second than an

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.540
uncarefully drawn drawing.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.050
So let's see.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.540
So it's a loop.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.700
You can almost-- you could
imagine taking a paper clip

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.670
and putting it into
this shape.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.700
Oh, that's good enough,
I think.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.250
And I have a current going
in this direction

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.190
in this paper clip.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.630
So this is the positive,
that's the negative.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210
So the current is
going like that.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.640
Current is going in
a loop like that.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.930
The current's coming out
of this end, it's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.260
coming into this end.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.420
And let's say that loop of--
it could be a paper clip or

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.300
anything-- let's say
that it can rotate.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.980
And that's important.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.300
What's going to happen?

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.590
Well, my magnetic field is
coming in this direction.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.600
The current is going
down here, up here.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.610
What's going to be the net
force of the magnetic

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.600
field on this loop?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.980
Well, let's try it out.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.220
And it turns out it's going to
be a different magnitude at

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.950
different points
of the current.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.140
So here.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.580
And we don't worry about-- all
we're worried about right now

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.620
is direction.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.190
And then maybe a little
intuition of the magnitude.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.550
So we know that the force of the
magnetic field is equal to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.830
the current times the
length vector cross

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.670
the magnetic field.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.390
Well, what would be the force of
the magnetic field on this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.480
segment of wire?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.110
We could call this L.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.766
And that L goes in the same
direction as the current.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:28.900
Well, let's see.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.390
Current is just a scalar,
but L is going down.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.720
Magnetic field going
to the left.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.000
Cross product.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.850
Cross product, I take my right
hand, put my index finger in

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.390
the direction of the current,
or in the direction of L,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.980
because that's the first term
of the cross product.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.760
So that's the index finger.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.000
So my index finger goes down,
because that's the direction

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.550
of the current.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.460
And then my middle finger-- and
remember, you have to do

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.020
this with the right hand.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.120
If you do it with the left hand,
you're going to get the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.310
opposite result.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400
And now my middle finger is
going to go in the direction

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.940
of the field.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.250
So let me point my
middle finger.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.930
My middle finger is
going to go in the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.870
direction of the field.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.800
I keep having to look
at my own hand.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.900
And then my other two fingers
are just going to do what they

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.400
need to do.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.780
So that's my third finger.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.740
That's my pinky.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.810
And then what is my
thumb going to do?

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.240
What is my thumb going to do?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.020
Well, my hand-- that's
my hand.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.240
This is what my hand is doing.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.350
I'm pointing downward.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.710
And my palm is kind of
pointing at my body.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.360
So what is my thumb doing?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.320
I know it's hard to see.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.220
This is my middle finger
right here.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.290
So my thumb is on the other
side of this drawing.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.070
And my thumb is pointing
downwards.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.350
I hope you see that.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.120
And you try it with
your own hand.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.490
So my thumb is pointing
downwards.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.900
So the direction of the force
created by the magnetic field

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.860
on this current is going
to go downward.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.380
So let me draw that.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.740
So the force vector--
I'll do it in this

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.350
orangey brown color.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.650
The force vector on this segment
of the wire is going

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.360
to be going down.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.660
Now what about this segment
of the wire?

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.440
Well, think about it.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:23.040
This segment of the wire, the
L vector-- this L vector--

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.920
It's parallel to the magnetic
field just in

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.170
the opposite direction.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.040
And so when you take the cross
product-- remember, the cross

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.590
product is you're multiplying
the magnitude of the vectors

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.390
that are perpendicular
to each other.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.480
But if this is the L vector
right here, there's no

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.260
component of it that it's
perpendicular to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.510
the magnetic field.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.050
So the magnetic field and the
current are in the same plane.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.250
They're parallel.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.450
They're not orthogonal at all.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.140
There's no components of them
that are at 90 degrees.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.130
So when you take the cross
product, you're going to see

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.790
that the net force on this
segment of the wire is 0.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.840
And likewise on this segment of
the wire and this segment

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.640
of the wire.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.080
Because they aren't in any
way perpendicular.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.800
No components of them are
even perpendicular.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.530
So fair enough.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.250
So all we know right now is the
magnetic field is exerting

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.860
a downward force on this
side of our paper

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.310
clip or of our circuit.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.620
Now what about this side?

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.230
Well, same thing.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.940
Take the cross product.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.300
If this is our L, L cross B.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.380
So take your index finger
in the direction--.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.760
So index finger goes
like that.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.040
Your middle finger will go in
the direction of the field.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.190
So your middle finger is going
to look something like that.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.330
And then your other
two fingers are

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.490
going to be like that.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.770
And what is your thumb
going to do?

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.720
And this has to be your
right hand to work.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.320
Your thumb is going to
point straight up.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.000
This is like the heel
of your thumb.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.500
Your thumb is going to--.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.530
I don't know if that's a good
drawing of a thumb.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.290
But your thumb is essentially
pointing out of the page.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.710
Middle finger in the direction
of the current, or in the

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.960
direction of our length.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.690
Sorry, index finger in the
direction of the current.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.460
Middle finger in the direction
of the field.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.170
Thumb points out of the page.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.270
Do that with your own right hand
and you'll see that the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.360
net force of the magnetic field
on this segment of the

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.490
wire is going to be upwards.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.720
Let me do it in a different
color just to get some

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.910
contrast.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.800
So what's going to happen?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.770
Assuming that this circuit
can rotate,

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.880
what's going to happen?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.150
On this side there's
a downward force.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.260
On this side there's
an upward force.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.520
So the magnetic field is
actually exerting a

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.380
torque on this wire.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.940
If you viewed this little dotted
line as our axis of

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.190
rotation, the whole coil is
actually going to rotate

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.400
around that line.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.890
And so there's some force over
here, along this whole line

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.610
being applied downwards.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.230
And it's actually perpendicular

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.250
to our moment arm.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.980
If you remember what we had
learned about torque.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.930
So it will actually exert all
of that force-- that force

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.890
times this distance
will be the torque

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.480
applied on this side.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.740
And then likewise there's a
torque-- it's really the same

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.650
sign, in the same direction,
because here on the other side

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.760
of the arm it's pushing
upwards.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.770
So they're not going
to cancel out.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.330
They're both going
to reinforce.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.820
And this whole coil
is going to be

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.030
turning in this direction.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.690
Here it's going to be moving up
out of your video screen.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.950
Here it's going to be moving
down into your video screen.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.440
Now what happens?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.190
I'm going to try to not run
out of time either.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.100
So it's going to
start rotating.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.930
So the left hand side's going
to go below the page.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.630
The right hand side's going
to be above the page.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.015
I want to draw some perspective,
that's why I'm

00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:32.610
just drawing it bigger.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.150
Maybe it looks like that.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.950
Maybe my circuit starts
to look like that.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.926
And I'll redraw my
axis of rotation.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:51.250
So this is my axis
of rotation.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.220
And on the way I drew it--
this part, the axis of

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.280
rotation is still in the
plane of our video.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.190
But this part of the
coil is, you could

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.250
imagine it popping out.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.950
I wish you had 3D glasses on.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.630
It's popping out
of your screen.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.720
This part is going
into your screen.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.450
And the current is still going
in the same direction.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.940
Current is going in that
direction there.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.810
So using the same right hand
rule, on this side of the wire

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.130
the magnetic field is going
to be exerting a

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.420
net downward force.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.370
But the torque is actually going
to be less because our

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.320
moment arm distance is going to
be like-- I want to draw it

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.890
with some perspective.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.600
It's going to look something
like that.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.780
So it's going to be going to the
left and behind the page

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.929
while the torque is still
just into the page.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.630
So you would actually take the
component of the torque that's

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.809
perpendicular.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.720
So there's some component of
the torque that's actually

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.169
perpendicular.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.460
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.000
But you could imagine
the torque lessens.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.630
Even though the net magnetic
force is the same, the

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.900
component of that force that's
perpendicular to your moment

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.150
arm, that lessens.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.500
So there's still going to be
some torque that's going to be

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.680
causing it to rotate downwards
in that direction.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.000
Sorry.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.700
You know what?

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.520
I drew this wrong here.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.740
We're pushing up on the right
hand side, we're pushing down

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.410
on the left hand side.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:14.030
So the direction is going
to be like that.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.510
Pushing up on the right hand,
down on the left hand.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.670
So you're still going to be
doing the same thing here.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.215
You are going to be
pushing up here.

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:24.880
But you're going to be pushing
up directly out of the page.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.610
But that's not completely
perpendicular

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.050
to the moment arm.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.100
So the component that is
perpendicular, that's actually

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.215
creating rotational torque,
that's going

00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:36.090
to be a little less.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.370
And then you could imagine that
all the way to the point,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.470
the coil's going to keep
rotating with smaller torque.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.260
At some point you'll be
looking at it head on.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.220
So I can just draw it like
a straight line, right?

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.000
You can imagine.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.710
This arm is on top and this
arm is behind it.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.260
And at this point, what's
going to happen?

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.360
All the magnetic force on
this top arm is going

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.740
to be popping up.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.860
It's going to be popping up out
of your page but it's not

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.400
going to be providing
any torque.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.270
Because it's not perpendicular
anymore to your moment arm.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.610
And likewise, on the bottom
behind this, if you could

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.760
visualize this, it would be
exerting a net downward force.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.260
And that's also not going
to be helpful.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.510
But maybe they have some angular
momentum so the wire

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.130
will still rotate.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.220
But then when it still rotates,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.390
what's going to happen?

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.610
And this is where I'll
leave you with a

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.370
little bit of a conundrum.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.490
Actually, I don't want to go
over the Youtube limit, so I'm

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.730
going to continue this in the
next video and I'll show you

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.110
the conundrum.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.670
See you soon.
