00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Hello Internet.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.920
When's the next Q&amp;A with Grey?
-Discord21337

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.600
Right now!

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.000
What opinion have you held for a time
and then changed radically?
-desvirtuado

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.220
Well, as mentioned the first time
I talked about changing your mind,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.520
This is always hard to discuss

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.100
because the specifics are often quite personal.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.240
But the biggest non-personal thing
I've changed my opinion on is

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.920
breakfast.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.080
I used to believe breakfast was absolutely vital -

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.280
not just believe it -

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.640
I had evidence that skipping, nay even

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.620
delaying breakfast ruined everything.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.180
But as I've tried to get healthier

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.160
slowly and inconsistently,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.440
I've experimented with various things
and the one that shocked me the most is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.260
breakfast is bulls**t.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.440
After an admittedly rough adjustment period,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440
my body no longer needed breakfast,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.940
and it's hard to describe

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.600
just how much of a huge
quality-of-life improvement this has been.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700
Simplifying my normal morning routine

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.860
and making early travel days easier.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.800
While I'll still eat breakfast sometimes,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.900
particularly on vacations,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.700
because it's clearly the best of the three -

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.240
(seven) -

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.680
meals, it's no longer the necessary
part of life I thought it was.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.380
What do you want people to remember you for 500 years from now?
-Coolie2

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.680
I don't want to be remembered,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.780
I want to be alive.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.500
What is the most frivolous item you own?
-ClenchtheHenchBench

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520
Man, that is a good question

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060
that had me looking up exactly what "frivolous" means:

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.060
Not having purpose or value.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.900
So, a thing I own which has neither purpose nor value.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.800
I'm not really sure anything I own fits that description,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.220
but I'll keep looking for you.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.200
If you have an idea in the shower without phone or notebook present, what do you do?
-Hoepla

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.620
(Shower sounds)

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.740
Hey Siri!

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.200
Hey Siri!

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.260
(Siri pings)

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.380
Make a note;

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.980
must not forget

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.540
million - nay, billion dollar idea

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.340
(Siri pings)

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.700
Nice weather coming up for
Paradise, Nevada, United States.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.500
(Grey groans)

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.140
What do you think of jazz?
-Maxim_Potashov

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.000
Jazz is opposite of everything I like in music.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200
I want music to have patterns, and repetition.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Patterns, and repetition.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.620
This is why I also don't like live music.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.940
I view music as a brain manipulation tool, and to that end, jazz is anti-useful to me.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.440
Do you speak dutch?
-Riobhain

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.380
(In Dutch) I don't speak Dutch, my mother is Dutch, but she never spoke Dutch with me.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.380
(In Dutch) I grew up speaking just one language.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.380
If you had control of a super-intelligence 
to which you could only give 1 command,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.800
and it would execute it to the best approximation of
what you intended, what would your one command be?
-DeepFriedJif

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.480
Min-max happiness and suffering.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.020
Oh wait!

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.700
What's one thing that you're not satisfied with your life right now, and how do you plan to solve it?
-Living-stoneInAfrica

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.000
I've gotten into time tracking pretty deeply.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.040
I used to just track my work hours, but I began to record how every hour of every day is spent.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.220
And, let me tell you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.200
no matter how well you think you spend your time, and no matter how well you do spend your time,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.080
tracking all of your time is an unflinching look
into a mirror, eternally uncomfortable.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.140
So, I'm not thrilled with the way
my pie chart for last year looks.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.240
It was a year of chaos.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.980
But, it's not possible to improve
without knowing where you're starting

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.420
and one of the ways I'm working to make this better is
simply to have the data about how I spend my time

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.300
more visible in more places.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.400
I've just begun in the most
baby steps way possible, but so far,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.380
making life more visible
seems like a good feedback loop.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.420
How are you doing?
-MrEngineeringGuy

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.140
Good, thanks.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.660
You?

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.140
If you had to enroll at a university tomorrow and had to choose one field of study which would you choose?
-rubinowitz

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.200
I'd like to say I'd take a
programming course

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.060
but I'm pretty sure I couldn't pass at the university level.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.020
Constants and functions and loops, oh my,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.340
are fun and clear
but once it gets to pointers,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.140
it's a level too far.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.240
So if I needed to pass
I'd probably sign up for economics

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.840
I dropped out of that Master's course

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.040
as mentioned in a previous Q&amp;A
because it wasn't the right fit in my life at that time

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.840
but I'd be happy to
give it a go again.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.840
Of all the classes you've ever taken at Uni,
what was your hardest?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.820
What did you hate the most? Why?
-Negative-One-Twelfth

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.100
Well, the physics classes in my later
years were the hardest and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.420
were probably the hardest intellectual thing
I've ever done or will do.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.320
But that's the boring-er question.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.460
More interesting question is
which class I hated the most.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.780
That was a required
humanities reading class

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.370
It was one of those classes where

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.390
the professor had free rein to just
select a bunch of books they liked and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.440
force students to read them and write essays

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.430
agreeing with the professor or

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.300
disagreeing in a way
the professor agreed with.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.620
God, did I hate it.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.200
I really think it's the kind of class

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.540
that professors make mandatory because they

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.940
like to teach it and it makes them look smart and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.860
it's easy and not because it's remotely good
for the students involved.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.020
Anyway, it's had to be done

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.820
and I had a pretty good idea in advance I would hate it

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.740
so at my college there was an option

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.780
to compress an entire academic year of
these classes into one intense summer.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.240
So I stayed at college over what was
vacation for most people

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.280
to finish this class as fast as possible.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.880
I've always been pretty good at reading a lot
using an on-off schedule when I need to,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.740
and it served me well here.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.500
I think I read something like 30 stupid or boring or
flowery or pompous books over that summer.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.540
Anyway, it works so well it was a
strategy I used every summer,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.080
compressing as many dumb mandatory classes
into as short a time as possible

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.640
If your school gives that as an option,
I highly recommend it

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.720
so you have more time during the rest of the year
to focus on more important things.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.100
Raisins in chocolate chip cookies?
-interesting-__o__

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.220
Gross.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.020
What noise do you wake up to?
-architecty

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.540
None. I used to use music to wake up to, because this

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.440
(wake-up alarm sounds)
is the world's most unpleasant sound.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.560
But doing so trains yourself
to dislike whatever song you use

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.100
and have it randomly cause you a
sense of drowning anxiety

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.640
when you hear it in a different context.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.160
I used to use a Sigur Rós song
during my teaching years to wake me up,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.800
and I still can't hear the opening few seconds

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.060
without feeling like I'm drowning, a decade later.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.880
Of course, the sound may be none

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.320
but I currently use my Apple Watch
to wake me up with a vibration.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.980
And I know I'm in a good routine
when I wake up naturally before it goes off.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.080
If you could have one superpower
(excluding the power to have all powers),

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.980
what would it be?
-jackmedrek

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.340
Invulnerability.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.280
With an exit option.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.280
Can you wear silly ties for the rest of the video?
-Nesogra

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.260
No, I spent years plotting and scheming
how to escape the world of ties.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.000
I will not go back to it now.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.340
You are given the opportunity to permanently, and
irreversibly, change one fundamental law of physics.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.080
What would it be and why?
-Blarghenshnarf

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.700
On the panel of fundamental laws and constants,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.460
I've draped a very big "do not touch" sign

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.660
How do I get over a crippling Factorio addiction?
-Ggecho_Swe_

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.320
You tell me, man.
I'm over a thousand hours deep.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.060
Do you feel that "Humans need not apply"
needs ... updating?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.200
Has anything changed since its creation
that would change your message?
-DarkJohnson

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.720
Not really anything I would change.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.880
I do enjoy that the debate
around autos has switched from

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.400
"They'll never happen" to "Why aren't they here now?",

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.160
which is an interesting question.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.810
At least in this moment, it feels like progress and
self-driving cars is a bit of an s-curve,

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.660
so maybe I was over-optimistic about the
rapid approach of commercially-available autos,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.560
but I still think they're coming,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.180
and if I can't buy or rent an auto
within ten years of the publication of that video,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.960
I'll be surprised and disappointed.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.600
What is love?
-theheroinwaiting

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.180
What is love?

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.620
Baby don't hurt me,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.920
don't hurt me,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.800
no more.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.500
Lastly, of coursely

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.380
Who's sponsoring this episode?
-Ispri

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.360
It's a new sponsor to the channel.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.200
Skillshare.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.080
Skillshare is an online learning community

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.000
without having to take
those mandatory college classes,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.140
and Skillshare is a great place to do that.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.580

allowing you to acquire new skills
and unlock new opportunities in your life.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.680
I'm certainly going to recommend that, 
if you are watching this video,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.300
you might want to check out
their "learning how to program" classes.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.000
If you want to get started in mobile development,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.560
or any kind of development,
Skillshare has lots of high-quality classes for you.
