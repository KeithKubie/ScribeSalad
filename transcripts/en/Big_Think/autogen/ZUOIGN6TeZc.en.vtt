it's actually in the basement and and so
 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.400
it's actually in the basement and and so
we bring people into the laboratory and

way who has some kind of outsider status
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.060
way who has some kind of outsider status
in some way so you could think about

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070
in some way so you could think about
 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.550
in some way so you could think about
this in the context of gender or race or

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
this in the context of gender or race or
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.800
this in the context of gender or race or
ethnicity or religion but you can also

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810
ethnicity or religion but you can also
 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.950
ethnicity or religion but you can also
think about it in terms of who in a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960
think about it in terms of who in a
 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.870
think about it in terms of who in a
company went to one particular school

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880
company went to one particular school
 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.390
company went to one particular school
versus another you could think about it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400
versus another you could think about it
 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.140
versus another you could think about it
in terms of the founders of a company or

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150
in terms of the founders of a company or
 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.210

in corporate America versus those who
 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.859
in corporate America versus those who
are new so what I like and what I have

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869
are new so what I like and what I have
 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.130
are new so what I like and what I have
started to show is that the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
started to show is that the
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.800
started to show is that the
insider-outsider dynamics may be vocal

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810
insider-outsider dynamics may be vocal
 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.109
insider-outsider dynamics may be vocal
in terms of what the group is but

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119
in terms of what the group is but
 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.990
in terms of what the group is but
everybody experiences outsider status in

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000
everybody experiences outsider status in
 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.700
everybody experiences outsider status in
some context and everyone experiences

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710
some context and everyone experiences
 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.859
some context and everyone experiences
insider status in some context and so

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869
insider status in some context and so
 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.350
insider status in some context and so
I've been doing a lot of work on what

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360
I've been doing a lot of work on what
 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.819
I've been doing a lot of work on what
does that look like what does that feel

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829
does that look like what does that feel
 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.080
does that look like what does that feel
like what are the neurological

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090
like what are the neurological
 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.119
like what are the neurological
underpinnings and how can we bridge

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129
underpinnings and how can we bridge
 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:09.870
underpinnings and how can we bridge
those gaps

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880
those gaps
 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.880
those gaps
absolutely whenever I talk to companies

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890
absolutely whenever I talk to companies
 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.490
absolutely whenever I talk to companies
a starting point is what is the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
a starting point is what is the
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.250
a starting point is what is the
structure of the company that either

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260
structure of the company that either
 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.830
structure of the company that either
facilitates performance of all groups or

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
facilitates performance of all groups or
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.229
facilitates performance of all groups or
undermines performance for all so rather

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239
undermines performance for all so rather
 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.750
undermines performance for all so rather
than some looking inside people for

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
than some looking inside people for
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.479

talent looking at personality matrixes

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489
talent looking at personality matrixes
 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.729
talent looking at personality matrixes
we really need to think about what is

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739
we really need to think about what is
 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:30.930
we really need to think about what is
the structure of the company and I'll

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
the structure of the company and I'll
 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.640
the structure of the company and I'll
give you a couple of different examples

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650
give you a couple of different examples
 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.820
give you a couple of different examples
but we're stereotype comes in and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830
but we're stereotype comes in and
 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.350
but we're stereotype comes in and
stereotype threat comes in is the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360
stereotype threat comes in is the
 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.619
stereotype threat comes in is the
general idea that when you belong to a

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629
general idea that when you belong to a

group that has some kind of outsider
 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.860
group that has some kind of outsider
status and you are in a really hot

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.430
CPA exam you're giving an interview it's
right before year-end evaluations if you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
right before year-end evaluations if you
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.320
right before year-end evaluations if you
belong to a group of which there are

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330
belong to a group of which there are

Americans not being particularly smart
 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.190
Americans not being particularly smart
women not being particularly smart but

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200
women not being particularly smart but
 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.470

only in the area of like mathematical
 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.030
only in the area of like mathematical
performance according to the Google memo

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
performance according to the Google memo
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.820
performance according to the Google memo
right that way yes yes those in those

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830
right that way yes yes those in those
 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.420
right that way yes yes those in those
contexts there is a worry about being

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
contexts there is a worry about being
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.520
contexts there is a worry about being
seen through the lens of that stereotype

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530
seen through the lens of that stereotype
 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.610
seen through the lens of that stereotype
and that that can undermine performance

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620
and that that can undermine performance
 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.530
and that that can undermine performance
actual workplace performance and so you

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
actual workplace performance and so you
 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.979
actual workplace performance and so you
can see it on literally when you sort of

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989
can see it on literally when you sort of
 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.229
can see it on literally when you sort of
take a slice of the brain you can see

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239
take a slice of the brain you can see
 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.330
take a slice of the brain you can see
that the part of the brain the amygdala

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340
that the part of the brain the amygdala
 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.369
that the part of the brain the amygdala
that's associated with with anxiety is

that's associated with with anxiety is
sort of amplify and the prefrontal

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989
sort of amplify and the prefrontal
 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.390
sort of amplify and the prefrontal
cortex a part of the brain that's

cortex a part of the brain that's
 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.759
cortex a part of the brain that's
associated with learning and memory it's

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769
associated with learning and memory it's
 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.710
associated with learning and memory it's
sort of tamp down but what that

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
sort of tamp down but what that
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.740
sort of tamp down but what that
translates into is three things one is

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750
translates into is three things one is
 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.229
translates into is three things one is
your workplace performance just is not

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239
your workplace performance just is not

your workplace performance just is not
as good as it could be

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670
as good as it could be
 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.520
as good as it could be
- your brain is doing double-duty you're

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530
- your brain is doing double-duty you're
 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.250
