00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,320
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hello

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,650
Amy. Hello. The Leopard theme.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,830
You have leopard jackets
today. You have a leopard top.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,460
Is this just a coincidental or
is there something to this? Well,

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,700
I'm a little bit white trash and I want
every, no, I don't know. I I liked,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,310
I liked married with children.
Pulled us up. You don't have to.

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,150
I'm a little bit, uh, and I'm trying to
get comfortable. Are you comfortable?

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,420
I don't know. You seem comfortable.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,840
[inaudible] fine. I'm with the
king anyway. Okay, so leopard,

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,400
Leopard. I like Mary the children. I
don't know. I always peg Bundy. Well,

11
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,320
I was gonna go for Kelly, but thank
you. I like dumb and slutty and a no.

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,460
I do have my friend who started pegging
her boyfriend and my phone has peg

13
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,810
Bundy. Whoa. What's her name? She
started pegging her boyfriend.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,690
She got a new boyfriend. His,
I think he's gay. Honestly,

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,590
I don't sure. Listen, if you get pegged,
I'm not saying you're gay for sure.

16
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,740
But this guy, this guy,
this guy I think is gay.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,880
And what does she think? They broke up.

18
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:09,960
She thinks he's getting out when Jesus
Christ broke up. Why did they break up?

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,590
He was emotionally unavailable
because he's gay. Wow.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,150
I think he's looking for
something with a deck.

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,390
So what was there other signs
with him that he might be,

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,290
I dunno. I think that he just was not he,

23
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,820
maybe he's just an
emotionally unavailable guy,

24
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:31,150
but he seemed to have a lot of
issues around wanting to get Dixonus.

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,050
So it seems like maybe he needs to
try maybe a less plastic one. Yeah,

26
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,840
we probably use already trying it.
Don't you think? Maybe. I mean,

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,753
I don't think he just,

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
why would you waste your time with a
rubber Dick Strap to a woman if you could

29
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,700
just go get maybe Jesus. Jesus
made some Christian stuff like,

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,540
oh yeah, I don't, yeah,

31
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,900
maybe it's like internalized
homophobia or probably,

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,370
or maybe he's just like transitionary
like maybe two years now.

33
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,000
He will look back and go, God, I used
to make girls fuck me in the ass.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,590
I'm was such a dickhead. Why did I do
that? I should have just come out. Yeah.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Or maybe he likes the feminine aspects
of a woman and the rock hard cock part of

36
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:18,720
a dude. There's a lot of people
that liked that. He needs it to get,

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,940
there needs to be like a,
well, I guess that's what a,

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,570
he needs a Hermaphrodite as well.

39
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,040
Whitney Cummings was telling me
that those sex robots, you know,

40
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,550
you saw her specialist
administrates robot. There's,

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,430
they're really popular where they
have a woman's body in a dick.

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,020
Those ones are really popular. All right.
Hmm. All right. You get to live here,

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,670
you get to live here. You just,

44
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,770
you just want everything
inside, outside. Give it to me.

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,310
I had a guy call into my podcast about
his wife won't peg him enough and he's a

46
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:52,650
cock, but she won't. Yeah.
But she like, she liked me.

47
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,550
She like makes love to him while she pegs
him and he wants to be just destroyed.

48
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,330
You know, Jesus Christ. He, he's a
cock. He or she won't fuck black guys,

49
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,140
so he's just, he's like, I'm like,
I feel like for what you want,

50
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,380
you should be very grateful. You
have as a woman, that's pretty down,

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,820
but there's always more.

52
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,330
So I'm wondering if he just wants more
or if this is the ultimate same with,

53
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,480
but just that's how it is with people.
If you go back to the early days of porn,

54
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,490
it was basically just pizza delivery
man and sorority girls and sex and

55
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,560
everybody had a bush. But
then you look at today,

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
everyone's gagging and
slapping and choking and spit
and not choking on pubes in

57
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:34,480
his body. There was none of that
back then. Now it's like standard,

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,210
you know? It's like everything
keeps getting pushed.

59
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,830
Boundaries keep getting pushed.
Everyone's getting the fish. Poor Aziz.

60
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,750
It's fuck cause he's watched the
war, the wrong porn disease. Oh,

61
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,750
you got in trouble? Yeah. What a disaster.

62
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,100
Have you seen a special,
I haven't watched it yet.

63
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,800
I watched a clip and it shot so bad.

64
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,220
It's like you see him and then you see
people behind him in the backstage area

65
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:07,510
milling around and he's
on a seat. It's so dumb.

66
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,170
It's like there's,

67
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,490
there's doors open in the back and
then people walking behind the doors.

68
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,970
It's like some odd artistic
choice to try to be like,

69
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,630
it doesn't matter that I'm up
here. Yeah. Like it's no big deal.

70
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,460
Life still goes on even
though I'm up here,

71
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,820
which means you were thinking that life
doesn't go on and you wanted to show

72
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,760
people that life goes on
too. That's deep. You are,

73
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:32,050
you are insecure about how narcissistic
you are and then you tried to fight it.

74
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,770
Well,

75
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,560
I was thinking it was the director's
choice or was the director who was the

76
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:39,520
director? Was it Spike Jones? Yeah. I
think he tried to do something crafty,

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,790
which you know, is kind of interesting
in any other format. I mean,

78
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,150
it'd be interesting if it was a
conversation, it was just a, you know,

79
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,720
two people talking and they're in a
public square and you see people milling

80
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,630
around behind them. That's not
distracting. But with stand up,

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,630
the more things you have to think about
other than what the person's saying,

82
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,150
the more it's gonna take away
from what the person saying. Yeah.

83
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,910
It does feel weird to
just, I mean, you know,

84
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,880
I go onto the leopard
print jacket sometimes,

85
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,400
but I like to dig myself a little hole,
but the leper print jack is just cool.

86
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:11,830
It's just funny. It's not distracting.
It's just here she is. I like a,

87
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,000
you know, I have my toy store.

88
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,980
I don't know if you've been
around for any of those sets, but

89
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,180
it's late at night.
You got to wake him up.

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,140
You gotta wake him up near Shore.

91
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,730
Just a plastic sword from the toy store.
I spent a lot of time with props. I,

92
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,030
I have fake blood on me most times.
I don't know when there's going to,

93
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,350
I'm going to be inspired to take a
funny picture to make a Prat Fall, fall.

94
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,500
Did you see the pratfalls that
we did? Me and Steven Randolph,

95
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,520
one of the door guys at the
comedy store one was this,

96
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,000
they posted on the comedy store thing.
We did. We challenged each other to,

97
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,840
to three pratfalls. It's so embarrassing.
Listen, after Brody died, I was like,

98
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,980
I'm going all out. I'm experimenting. I'm
having as much fun as I can. You know,

99
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,680
obviously it's about jokes, but
sometimes you gotta really just,

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,890
you got to just have your time up there.
The Brody one was hard on everybody.

101
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,540
I was the one making any sense.

102
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,210
That was one that it just like felt
like swallowing a dry rock. Yeah.

103
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:09,620
A cow. Like how has that car gone?

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,390
It just feel he was just such a
big presence. And then it's sad to,

105
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,540
I don't want to talk too much about
Ios gone here cause I know that's what

106
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,310
everyone does. But um,

107
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:23,330
I did in one and when I did trip
on Iowasca it was right after that.

108
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:27,320
And it helped me a lot with that cause I
kept thinking about how sad it was that

109
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:31,790
he couldn't feel us, like hugging us.
Him, we loved him. Brody was loved.

110
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,000
Like we loved that man. He
was our brother, you know?

111
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,830
And that was the sad part.

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,560
Well,

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,180
I mean I just feel like there's no way
any of us could ever understand what's in

114
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,970
anybody else's brain. You know?
I don't know what's in yours.

115
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,960
You don't know what's
in mind. It's like we,

116
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,660
we assume that there's a similar thing
happening inside our head is other

117
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,360
people's heads. And I think
that's wildly incorrect.

118
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,250
And I think some people are just in pain
all the time and there's not much you

119
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:02,520
can do as a friend to, to
help them, you know? I mean,

120
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:06,870
I felt the same way about
Bordain when Bordain died. Uh,

121
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,900
it was just a how to, I don't get it.

122
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:13,890
I just don't understand how
someone who's so loved, you know,

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,010
he has this amazing job, his
a beautiful daughter. I mean,

124
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:22,500
he has this life that's extraordinary
and very interesting and deep and he gets

125
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,480
to meet these fascinating
people and travel,

126
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,650
travel the world and expose people to
all of these incredible artists and

127
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,860
culinary artists. And yet
still didn't, couldn't take it,

128
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,950
didn't want to be here
for whatever reason.

129
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,050
And I just think about it, it's like,
so they're, they're okay. You know,

130
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:42,440
they're off wherever we go or
whatever happens. They've transcended,

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,960
came back, they're floating
around somewhere. But it's like,

132
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:51,250
selfishly, I'm like, I want more Brody
like, course I want him back course.

133
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,180
And it's, you know, and then you see
people, they just fade. You know,

134
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:58,480
like each year goes by and they just,
which is going to happen to all of us. So,

135
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,710
but you know, luckily he
had a lot of catch phrases,

136
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,060
a lot of stuff online or in the
back of the store. Oh, I love,

137
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:11,590
I kiss it every time I walk by it. I'm
not touching it anymore. Yeah, I lick it.

138
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,310
I give it my herpes. I don't have
herpes yet. Joe Rogan audience.

139
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,910
It's okay. And honestly
if you have it, it's fine.

140
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,090
What am I going to have a vaccination
must have on already they've got to almost

141
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,460
shirt. What do you think?
Conspiracy theorists? Yes. Yes.

142
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,670
Cause he already sparked up when we
talked about the aliens thing with,

143
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,860
did he bring up Ohio? No, I left
it all out. But he got his eyes.

144
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:40,360
There's just something, there's a spark.

145
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:43,810
They have conspiracy that they
have a little spark in their eye.

146
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:47,260
When he perked up, he keeled his asshole
a little bit. When I brought it up,

147
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,690
it was really funny. Like those. The
last question I asked him was about UFO,

148
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,110
just kind of almost as a joke,
but just as a goodbye, you know,

149
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,030
like keep it silly.
That's all I'm reading.

150
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,550
It's in fucking hundreds of articles.

151
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,000
It's all Bernie Sanders says he will
tell the world about aliens if he becomes

152
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,350
president. That's the thing that they
took out of that. Well, it's smart of him.

153
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,130
It feels like Trump's straws. It's
like smart. If Bernie had said,

154
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,880
if Bernie had brought it up, I would've
been like, that is a brilliant tactic.

155
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,340
But don't you think that
people that believe in aliens
are already going to vote

156
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:23,700
for or that are the most
hung up on it? No. No.

157
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,660
You don't think they're the
same? No, no, no. I think they,

158
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,490
they very wildly conspiracy theorists or
left wing right wing and the alien one

159
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:36,600
is different than any other one. And I
think there's a lot more people that are,

160
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,070
um, that are alien lovers
that cross both sides.

161
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,310
I think it's just one of
those things where you,

162
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,830
there's guys that fuck
alien done. That's the only,

163
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,120
that's the only anchors you're
holding out to pastor Manhattan. Yeah.

164
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,270
Do People claim that? I bet you
they do. For sure. Do you know this?

165
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:55,920
People really in the big foot sexually,

166
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,420
there's like all these novels written
about a big foot tall Armenian. No, no,

167
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,470
no, no. Just that hard
to ever go to Glendale.

168
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,940
Everywhere I go to the
Galleria, there's this big foot.

169
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,800
This is a very localized
reference. There's big foot,
you it, big foot or eyes.

170
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:17,580
You get big foot erotica. Yeah,
I mean it's like really common.

171
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,170
What if he had a small deck?

172
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,350
Like you always hear about the really
tall guys with the tiny decks and when I

173
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:27,070
say care about them, you hear about
them. Get this seduced by big foot. Ooh,

174
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,870
look at, come for bigfoot Virginia Wade.

175
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,500
Big Flood by Lolita young.
Wait a minute. Narrated.

176
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,950
I mean this is an audio book.
[inaudible] you know what they say?

177
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,900
The bigger the big foot, the bigger
the air in the bones. What does that,

178
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,640
I like a guy with very deck, you
know, like you like to listen.

179
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:50,280
People say they don't like
too much heroin balls.

180
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,990
I say get her all the way under the
shaft. Look at this boffing big foot.

181
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,570
What is happening? I thought, I feel
like I liked it. Her name's Ann L.

182
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,710
Gay bigfoot. Look at this last
row and I'll probe is gay bigfoot.

183
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,780
Keep smoking after we fucked. What
the fuck? Mouthful of Sasquatch.

184
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,480
I [inaudible]. I've met that man.

185
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,020
There was like one of the
door guys at the comedy store.

186
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,250
That's one of the tour guys. I got fired.

187
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,970
This is a whole genre of erotica.

188
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,910
There's a bunch of women
that write these books.

189
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,880
This Virginia Wade lady is a,

190
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,240
she's apparently very prolific
with her big foot erotica.

191
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,370
She writes quite a few of
these. How many does she have?

192
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,420
That was 13 at least 13 come
from big foot. Come for bigfoot.

193
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,250
Number 13 she just makes shit up.

194
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,760
Then there I was walking the dog and the
dog had a heart attack. The next thing,

195
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:44,160
big foot stick is in my mouth.
How about I have a good pun,

196
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,100
Harry and the Hummer sons. Henderson Hen.

197
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,560
Don't say Harry on the thinking out
loud and then just sounding it out.

198
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,610
I can't read ever. Leave me alone.
What'd you expect me to come on?

199
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:02,140
And Boone's fucking smart.
So there's at least 13 books.

200
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,000
I Bet Virginia Wade lives in a fucking
giant match and drives around in a rolls

201
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,090
like the l Ron Hubbard. Probably a dude.
No, it's a, but I get to, I bet it's a,

202
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,250
would that big foot five baby come
for big foot baby. What does that say?

203
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:19,030
That one home for big foot five
baby. What does it say baby?

204
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,730
See that Seymour right
hand side all the way.

205
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:24,580
The right all the way to the right
all the way to the right up above it.

206
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,170
There you go. Bam. What does that fuck
is that? Maybe they have a big foot baby.

207
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,150
It looks like a come inside or one.
So she's got, let's find out. Google,

208
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,980
Google, Virginia. Wade's big. Is that
her right there? She looks normal.

209
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,770
It might've been. Was that a photo of
her and go with the goddess? Go back.

210
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,440
It was a different book. They're talking
about. Okay. The ball for big foot.

211
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,274
Does that hurt?

212
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,640
Is that Virginia Wade doesn't normal
looking lady and it might not be her. Oh,

213
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,650
Amazon Poles buffed by big foot
romance novels from shelves. What?

214
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,080
Why are they censoring bigfoot porn
yet? That might've been her. Okay.

215
00:12:59,081 --> 00:12:59,914
Why don't,

216
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,870
why didn't anyone tell me about
these literary treasures? Oh my God.

217
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,720
I thought for a second. The long but
interesting read was about the book.

218
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,740
This is a long but interesting
read. Why are they pulling it?

219
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,550
Why are they pulling this stay
at home mother from Colorado?

220
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,270
Of course she is no real riding
experience. No, of course not.

221
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,770
You don't even have to be good. I mean
she spent all day waxing her nipples.

222
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:25,750
She couldn't get to come to terms with
their hairy body and then she realized

223
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,390
all she needed was to
find her match. She says,

224
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,010
I get this crazy idea for a story.

225
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,920
So she sat down and wrote
the entire book in an hour.

226
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,360
Bella does no fucking,
there's no second draft.

227
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,780
That's what I love to hear
by my, from my authors.

228
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,490
You wrote this all in one draft.

229
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,190
She said just 12,000 words
in a matter of weeks.

230
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,230
She's been considered trying to sell
it to mainstream publisher instead.

231
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,480
She went directly to Amazon's
kindle direct publishing,

232
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,250
an online platform for self publishing.
70% royalty rate for authors.

233
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,720
I think she sold a fuck
load. I had to go viral.

234
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,740
Here's the line from it if you want,
right? I don't think he's monogamous,

235
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,700
but let's bigfoot na. So big click on
that big foot insider, monster porn,

236
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:12,820
Amazon crackdown link. So let's find
out what the fuck is going on here.

237
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,290
Why would they crack down on that?
Ooh, ad blocker. You son of a bitch.

238
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,110
It was the tens dude. So hot author,
Virginia Wade's fiction debut falls,

239
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:26,440
a group of women who embark on a week
long camping trip to mount hood national

240
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:29,770
forest. They are in the shadow of
Oregon's highest mountains. They're,

241
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,730
they're kidnapped and sexually
assaulted. Posteriors woodland creature.

242
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,170
What the hell is that thing? Ass One
protagonist. That's some good writing.

243
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,790
It's fucking big foot. His Shelley,
he's real. For fuck's sake,

244
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,640
har filled her eyes with
a huge sea dash dash dash.

245
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm saying that says
cock corn in the book.

246
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,430
His feet are fucked up with decidedly
un-PC title, like come for big foot culm.

247
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,970
Of course, it's just the first
of 16 fiction ebooks. Wade,

248
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,840
a pen name has written about the
legendary, but sometimes best,

249
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:08,780
sometimes known as Sasquatch,
each legendary beast.

250
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,940
Each detailing a series of graphic and
often violent sexual encounters between

251
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:18,110
the apelike creature in a
female lovers. Okay, wait, wait.

252
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:22,640
Has made an exceptional living
writing these stories. Wow. Okay,

253
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,870
but why did they take them down?

254
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,630
That's reminds me of my
friend from middle school.

255
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:30,770
His boyfriend who is Sicilian. He
was just so hairy and he looked,

256
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,000
it's been downloaded more than a
hundred thousand times. Holy Shit.

257
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,970
That's five bucks. That means she
made $500,000 for the flipper. Why?

258
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,370
Well, she made 70% of it.

259
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:47,780
At least I bet you the other
books didn't take as long either.

260
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,160
Wow. During her best months, she's
netting 30,000 or more in a month.

261
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,090
Writing big foot jerk off books. Wow.

262
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,500
Taken by pirates. Oh, she re she
branched off into other genres.

263
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,330
It's all just getting fucked, taken
by pirates, seduced by the dark Lord.

264
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,320
It's like getting fucked by
demons and pirates and hilarious.

265
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,950
I'm getting traumatized. A traumatic
thing is coming up for me right now.

266
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,570
That's weird. Do you want to hear it?

267
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,050
But my mom wrote romance novels
when I was shut the fuck.

268
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:24,380
Yeah. They were never published.
No, I didn't read them.

269
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,810
They were never published, so it
was really just a fuck journal.

270
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,800
You read your mom's fucked
journal. I didn't read it,

271
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:33,560
but she had romance novels around and I
would definitely knew I was really good

272
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:37,220
at skimming to the sex scenes.
I knew how to flip through,

273
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,440
flip my being to, so your mom wrote,

274
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,530
she was a part of this thing
called romance writers of America,

275
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:47,930
and she actually won awards and
then she never followed through.

276
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,200
So she could have published the
book and probably had success.

277
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,600
And then she had a hole. It was
like a whole suspense romance.

278
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,440
Salinas revenge was what it was called.
She was Lena like the saying no,

279
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:04,940
but that's really funny. She came
back and she said to fuck bigfoot. No,

280
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,870
she fucks. The girl killed her. Mixed
read it. She's dead. I like that lady,

281
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,350
that little Weirdo. I mean I don't like
her because she killed her, but she was,

282
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,820
she's like a real weird, I mean the
girl killed, see, obsessed. Like she,

283
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,800
you know, she reminds me of, she reminds
me of, and I definitely don't like her,

284
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,530
but she, um, she reminds me
of the little woman from um,

285
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,660
okay. Can't remember
what's it called? The uh,

286
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,650
David Lynch that show
which one? Twin peaks.

287
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,780
Which ones when they're
a little lady in it.

288
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,790
I don't remember twin peaks very well,

289
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,730
but there was a little lady in
[inaudible] imagine the day,

290
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,080
but I just remember usually from the
TV movie with Jennifer Lopez in it.

291
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,680
She plays Celine. She played
Selena. That was her big break.

292
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:53,830
She was a fly girl and then she got super
hot and that big ass was exposed to us

293
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,920
and Selena outfits. That's
interesting. Why they go killer.

294
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,220
She was their assistant, right?
Yeah, she was just such a big fan.

295
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,600
I think she was just obsessed with her.

296
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,680
So she killed her cause she was a big
fan. People are just fucking crazy.

297
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,450
That doesn't make sense.

298
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,900
It's probably hated her because she
made her wash her laundry and shit.

299
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,430
She was our assistant or I think she
was the head of her fan club assistance.

300
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,670
Get Weird with people. Did you
ever hear the David Spade story?

301
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,770
His assistant tasered them and fucking
tied him one of going to jail? Yeah.

302
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,780
I guess. Was it a girl or a guy? Was he
trying to fuck him? I don't think so.

303
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,420
I think he just hated him. Oh my God.

304
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,960
I feel like spade would be a nice
employer, but maybe not. Maybe not.

305
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,210
Maybe is now it's good taste.
Wow, I didn't know that.

306
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah. See if he can find
that store spades at some shit at me.

307
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
Got Catfish. He's here. He
gets fished. He got catfish by,

308
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,160
he told it on the norm. McDonald Cho
who catfished him. Someone catfish him.

309
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:55,610
He thought he had met this
model and Twitter. Oh.

310
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,260
And then he saw them out on real life and
was like, hey Twitter. And she's like,

311
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,680
what are you telling them?
And they say something.

312
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,340
Oh that's so embarrassing. Who did spades?

313
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:09,180
Coolest shit. There goes David spades
assistant pleads guilty to assault.

314
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,100
Make that larger police. Oh
my God. David pay spades.

315
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,230
Former assistant pleaded guilty.

316
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,370
Stop to assaulting the comedian with a
stun gun and agreed to seek counseling

317
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,140
for drug and psychological problems.

318
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,480
Beverly Hill Superior Court Judge
Elden Fox also sentenced David Warren.

319
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:30,870
Skippy Malloy on Thursday to
five years probation. That's it.

320
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,740
Two nights straight,

321
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,130
at least named skippy ordered him to
stay at least a hundred yards away from

322
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:38,760
spade and performed 480 hours of
community service. If somebody tased me,

323
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,790
I want more than community service cause
that's a threat and they tied you up

324
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,510
and shit. How did it say? Wait a minute.

325
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:50,511
It says David Spade 36 oozes in the 20s
shut the fuck at the beginning of our

326
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:57,060
call it, oh my God,

327
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,400
he tied him up. How did, I wonder how the
story ended. How did he get out of it?

328
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,650
She just really good
with the untying. Not,

329
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,240
did the guy get tired of
fucking them and get shocked.

330
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,100
G says he was angry in a
psychotic state due to cocaine.

331
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,460
The morning of the attack. I'm Tom
Town. I mean, I've done coke before.

332
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:20,540
I don't think I've been like, let
me tie up my boss and Taser him.

333
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,780
Never done coke with David spade. You're
right around him. Maybe he's, you know,

334
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,820
telling you to take the dog out and you're
like, I can't do this. I can't hyper.

335
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,330
So the Co said the Costar, the
NBC said, come just shoot me.

336
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,610
The new movie Joe Dirt said at the time
that Malloy a 30 year old aspiring actor

337
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:43,560
was a friend who is obviously
mentally troubled right now. Wow.

338
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,890
And I'm more shocked by Joe
Dirt as a new movie. Yeah,

339
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,810
we're digging back in 2001
we are digging back. Wow.

340
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:56,580
Fuck. That seems like a
long time ago. But you know,

341
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,340
it doesn't seem like a long time
ago. 2009 you say 2009 like,

342
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,640
oh that just happen.
Nope. 10 years. A decade.

343
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,470
Like 1960 to 1970 it seems like
forever. 70 to 80 seemed like forever.

344
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,870
80 to 90 seems like forever,

345
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,170
but 2009 to 2019 for whatever
fucking reason seems real close.

346
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,230
Yeah. And it's not, it's
not, it's hot. Whole years

347
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,840
style. We'll show you that too.
Cause I was, I was born in 83.

348
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:28,010
I'm 36 and uh, the kid, the,

349
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,920
the younger kids right now are
dressing like I dressed in high school.

350
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,250
Like it's cycled back
around there in my styles.

351
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,740
Yeah. But that's then like not 2009 to
2019. Is there a difference in style?

352
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,100
Yeah. This is coming from
someone that's Zeros.

353
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,500
Yeah, there is, what is
it? It's okay. From 2009,

354
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,560
um, I would say 2009 was maybe when
they had started having this one.

355
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,140
I have to remember where I was in
life. I just moved to New York.

356
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,030
People were wearing, I dunno, I'd lived
in Santa Fe and I was drinking a lot.

357
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:03,864
So I definitely,

358
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,320
I quit drinking in 2009 I was still
never been assigned comedy then.

359
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,590
Santa Fe's was supposed to be a weird
place. That's where I met Tate Fletcher.

360
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,610
Hallo? Caveman coffee. I met Tej in a,

361
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,290
in Santa Fe. He used to come in with
a bunch of sober dudes after meeting.

362
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,060
I don't know if I'm supposed
to say this, but whatever.

363
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,940
He's pretty open about it. But I mean
it was the truth. They were so annoying.

364
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:28,770
I was like a drunk. I was wasted at this
cowboy bar. To wear a cowboy outfit.

365
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,410
You have to, you have to do,
that's your uniform. Really.

366
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,100
Being a wagers is not humiliating
enough. You will also have to dress.

367
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,650
Just have a John Deere hat
on. No, you have to wear it.

368
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:40,200
You had to wear a cowboy hat and you had
to have a shirt that had yolks on it.

369
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,620
Oh, if you worked there, if you worked
there and not when you went in. Yeah,

370
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,510
that would be crazy. That would be crazy.

371
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,120
But so table come in with a bunch of
people and they just wouldn't order

372
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,240
outcome. I mean it was just like low
sales, high maintenance. I was like,

373
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,280
who is this fucking guy? So big and
ridiculous. And then I was talking to him.

374
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:58,470
I hadn't quit drinking. I didn't quit
drinking til I moved out of Santa Fe.

375
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:02,790
But I told him I want to do comedy and
he made them turn the Karaoke night into

376
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:06,410
a comedy show for me. Yeah. And I got
[inaudible] first time you ever went.

377
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,010
Oh yeah. Wow. Did you have put
things prepared? Yeah, I just, yeah.

378
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,700
And then yeah. And then,

379
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,780
and then I moved to New York to do
comedy and I was, I crashed my mode.

380
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,010
I had a little scooter,

381
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:23,730
a Yamaha Zuma and I crashed it cause
I would drive drunk all the time.

382
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:27,450
I was my happy place. Like to this day
I really was honestly that feeling,

383
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,140
I'm like driving wasted on a scooter
was the wind blowing the air.

384
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,880
Cause you're not wearing a
helmet. You think about them,

385
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,730
you don't really think you can kill
anybody else. So it's not that bad.

386
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:38,564
A drive drunk.

387
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,300
Yeah. But you can, you can get in the
way of someone else or do anything.

388
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:46,220
I fucked myself up so bad. I woke
up, just had blacked out completely.

389
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:49,390
My face was split open. I had
road rash all over my tests.

390
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:53,550
This was father's Day, 2008 you
don't remember falling? I don't,

391
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,940
didn't all I remembered. I just
remembered like little pieces.

392
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,160
I remembered that someone
helped me. I woke up,

393
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:00,560
I was living at my friend's
house. I woke up at the house.

394
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,510
He was staying at his girlfriend's
house. So I was there alone,

395
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:07,070
but my chin was split open. I've been
wearing a dress and it looked like I,

396
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,800
my throat had been slit. Like there
was just blood all the way down it,

397
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,120
road rash all over my tits, all
over this side of my arms, my knees.

398
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:18,890
Like I just was fucked up,
just face, split open. I just,

399
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,580
I went, I peeled out and like just
went chin first and everything.

400
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,410
And then I remembered
that someone who didn't,

401
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,430
a girl that didn't like me had helped
me. That's all I could remember.

402
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:32,660
It was someone who usually hated me,
helped me. Wow. And then, so I went out,

403
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,890
I went to the hospital, I called
my roommate, he came back, um,

404
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,530
I went to the hospital. They gave,

405
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,140
I got nine stitches and I was still
wasted and I was still so hammered and the

406
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:45,980
doctor kept going, were you drinking?
And I kept going just between us.

407
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,530
And he's like, yeah. And I went, nope.
They're like, I'm not gonna fucking jail.

408
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:51,500
You motherfucker. I was like, no, I
just crashed my scooter. It's crazy.

409
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,460
He didn't know that I didn't wake up
to drink through the pain. So, um,

410
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,660
so then I got the stitches
and I was friends with all
the cops in Santa Fe cause

411
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:02,420
I was an alcoholic. So
that's a really good plan.

412
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,110
You gotta befriend them so
they don't arrest you. And uh,

413
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,880
they had told me if they had caught me
cause I ended up finding my scooter on

414
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:12,320
the side of the road. My
friend drove me around.

415
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,990
So I found out where I had peeled out
and there was like a bunch of loose

416
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:15,441
gravel.

417
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:19,850
So I just peeled out on the gravel
and the cops said that they would have

418
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,510
arrested me for an Agora aggravated
DUI because I hurt myself.

419
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,740
I'd injured myself. That's
what an aggravated DUI,

420
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,250
that's what they said back then. I mean
I was still wasted when they said that.

421
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,400
That's worse if you hurt yourself. Yeah.

422
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,180
Cause I had to go to
the hospital and stuff.

423
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,850
You would think you got a little
punishment in there. Yeah.

424
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,220
So then I didn't learn the lesson.

425
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,250
I went out drinking that night with
the stitches in my face and I had,

426
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,280
my line was I would carry neosporin
around and ask guys if they wanted to rub

427
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:50,240
neosporin on my titties. Like almost
lost a nipple. I mean it got so close.

428
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Yeah. I looked crazy, but I was
drunk. So I was like, whew, fun girl.

429
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,720
Yet they still call me fun girl, Andy
behind my back. And I thought they were,

430
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,260
I thought it was like a cool, I didn't
realize they're making fun of all cheese.

431
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,970
So anyway, uh,

432
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,910
so then I went out that night and I
saw this guy with a puppy and I started

433
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,270
playing with the puppy and I was like,
oh your puppy, so cute. And he goes,

434
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:11,540
do not remember me. And I'm like,
I've never met you before. He goes,

435
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,220
last night I helped you, you crashed
your scooter. And I was like, Oh fuck.

436
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:17,360
And he's like, I ride a motorcycle.

437
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:20,150
So I didn't want to call the cops or
anything cause I know you would've gotten

438
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:23,420
in trouble. And there was like, who
helped me? And he's like some girl.

439
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,580
So then my friend called me,
he's like, my boss told me.

440
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:28,790
So it was my friend's boss from this
hotel that used to get wasted at,

441
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,020
he was the bartender.

442
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,590
So she hated me because I would
just go get hammered at their nice

443
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,424
establishment.

444
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,900
Do you look back on those days with
any fondness because you're sober? No,

445
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,020
you're all, I'm clean. Yeah,

446
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:44,280
I mean I think I have a wealth of stories.

447
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:48,360
I was a juvenile delinquent and I had
so many childhood traumas and abuses and

448
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,290
weird things that happen.

449
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:53,250
I was running for my life in Jersey City
when I was 15 from like a fake modeling

450
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:57,690
agent who was like a six foot eight
drag queen named Mahogany running for my

451
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:02,040
life, trying to hide so long. I just
have a lot of stories and not a story.

452
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:06,240
You can brush what happened.
You were 15 so I was,

453
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,040
I had gone to Mahogany yet, so I had gone
to John Robert Powers Modeling School,

454
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:15,690
one of those like fake modeling schools
and it's you pay like 200 bucks and they

455
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:18,390
make look a compilation
headshot. Yeah. You like go,

456
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:20,580
they give you classes and
modeling. Like that's a thing.

457
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:23,430
It's like you either like are
weirdly weird looking alien,

458
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:27,720
hot and tall and skinny or
not. Yeah. Or you're not.

459
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,310
I mean I maybe could have done commercials
or something. I was cute, but I,

460
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,750
I also had very low self esteem.
It was just such a weird,

461
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:37,530
it was such a weird thing
to be doing. So, um,

462
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,740
and I had been a Tom boy up
until that point. So we go,

463
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:45,741
I go to this modeling thing and then we
went to paid more money to go to like a

464
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:51,780
modeling convention and then they had
actual modeling agencies and then they had

465
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:55,530
just random people that I get paid to
be there. So mahogany was one of them.

466
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:59,760
And my mom's like super liberal and so
she likes anything that's like a little

467
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,270
on the fringe that she could brag
about it or book club or whatever.

468
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,250
If that sounds like I'm angry,
I'm not angry. Forgiven. But um,

469
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,180
so they ended up, they were like,

470
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:16,620
we want to take your daughter for two
weeks and we'll send her out on auditions

471
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:21,450
and stuff over spring break. And we
have this nice place in Jersey. Teen.

472
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,230
Yeah.

473
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,850
Your mom let Mahogany take you
for so many more stories. Joe.

474
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,700
Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah, no, there was,

475
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:32,610
my mother did not have anything bad
happened to her when she was growing up.

476
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:36,300
She was adopted by a very nice family and
she went to a nice boarding school and

477
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:39,900
stuff and nothing happened to
her. And she read the newspaper.

478
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,880
She didn't read the newspaper. I don't
think much. So she, it just, she didn't,

479
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:48,090
she wasn't aware. So
anyway, so then, okay,

480
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:49,950
so I was,

481
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,510
I went to this place in Jersey City and
Jersey City. I don't know how it is now,

482
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:58,980
but it was fucking crazy back then.
It's still fucked. It was fucking crazy.

483
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:03,981
So we were in this one little condo and
it was Mahogany and then there was like

484
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,220
some other people that were there.
None of us were really that,

485
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,970
I mean I probably was like the
hottest, but I was pretty raw. I mean,

486
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:14,070
I don't know. I think I was cute.
I don't think I was like, uh,

487
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,020
I don't think I was a model and I,
I don't think that was my future.

488
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:22,020
Maybe I could've done something, but I'm,

489
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,210
the only person that I had really bonded
with was this 23 year old Guy Chris,

490
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,150
who was this black guy from, I dunno
where he was from, but he was really cool.

491
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,030
He was really nice and
he was a little creepy.

492
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,800
Like he would say things
like if I was your age,

493
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,740
but he never was trying
to fuck me or anything,

494
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,290
but he kind of was protecting me and at
some point Mahogany got mad. There was,

495
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,340
it was fake. Like I would just,

496
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,910
he would make me go buy him weed on the
corner and stuff and it's just a fake

497
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:49,870
thing. My parents paid like $1,500 to
send me to this thing and he would,

498
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,620
I think he sent me out to be a,

499
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,190
I had to go into New York by myself on
the train at 15 wearing the sluttiest

500
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,760
clothes ever to this thing
to, and then he would tell me,

501
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:05,761
pretend you're lie and say you're 21 to
be an extra on like sex in the city and

502
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:08,830
stuff. It just wasn't real. There was
nothing real about, it was a total scam.

503
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,430
So I was starting to catch onto that and
I was supposed to be there for maybe 10

504
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:15,310
days, I think. And they'd, these
next door neighbors, shorty,

505
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,390
this little Puerto Rican lady, she
was away. I smoked blunts with her.

506
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,640
But um, so this guy,

507
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:24,100
Chris was kind of protected me and he
would go into the city with me and then

508
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:26,710
all of a sudden mahogany
didn't like how close we were.

509
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:29,230
So he separated us and he said,
you can't see each other anymore.

510
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,680
And I was like, well, I don't feel
safe if I can't talk to this guy.

511
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,340
Just would rather go home.
I want to call my parents.

512
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:36,370
I don't think this is real. This
seems like bullshit and a scam.

513
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,560
And he was like, you can't
talk to your parents.

514
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:41,950
And he locked the door and
took the phone away from him.

515
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,510
So I packed all my shit up and I threw
it out the window and I yelled down to

516
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,800
shorty. I was like, Yo, I'm going to run.
So grabbed my shit. And then the guy,

517
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,550
one of the other kids that was staying
at the modeling place knew the situation.

518
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,230
So he went down and bumped into the door,

519
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,570
unlocked it without him
noticing and distracted him.

520
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,320
And I just jetted out of the fucking
house and he started chasing me.

521
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,930
I was like screaming. I was like,
call the cops, help me, help me.

522
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,480
And I was wearing a tube top.
My like 15 year old titties.

523
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:10,450
I had nipple rings were like hanging
out. I mean, I looked like a prostitute.

524
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,330
The cops ended up coming and they thought
I was a prostitute. Mahogany got me.

525
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,220
At one point I was hiding
under cars for my life.

526
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:18,280
Like I thought I was going to
get killed. I was like screaming.

527
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:22,080
People were just watering their plants.
Like what the fuck on the Lakers cars?

528
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,500
Yeah. Cause he was chasing me.

529
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,110
So I was trying to hide and
he finally got me was like,

530
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,630
get in the hat like you're
ruining my scam pretty much.

531
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:30,670
And then he scratched
my arm, but that's all.

532
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:33,160
And then the cops came and arrested.
Both of us thought he was my pimp.

533
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,980
I thought I was a prostitute.
I come from like a,

534
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,150
like a [inaudible] when you came home? Um,

535
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,510
well they came to the cops and then the
cops told them that they should arrest

536
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:45,940
my parents. They were like, we should.

537
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:50,860
And I think they just were in denial
about it or whatever for a day at least.

538
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,700
Yeah. They didn't. And then
more stuff happened after that.

539
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,380
They'd made more mistakes. Yeah.
But it's okay. We all make mistakes.

540
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:04,270
I love my family. They're good now. But
I also look at all these things. No,

541
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:08,380
I really like have had to do a lot of
work on it because to forgive them. Yeah.

542
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,900
Because, well I blame myself
for all of it, for most of it,

543
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,160
which was my defense mechanism.

544
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:15,100
Like the stuff I had some stuff happened
with a teacher in high school to him

545
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,840
right after that. Actually it was about
six months after that happened and uh,

546
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,620
you know, was a therapy session. I
don't want to do a therapy session.

547
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,720
I don't want to do that. But anyway,

548
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:30,530
you had asked me about am I happy about
these things? And so I'm coming to it.

549
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,980
But the point that I'm coming
to is I am happy with them.

550
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm so happy with like where my life
is now that I can't be mad about any of

551
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:40,040
these other things. Do you know
what I mean? Like they're, they're

552
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,580
like exciting and now they're
funny cause I didn't get heard.

553
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,120
That's what I'm saying. Like looking
back on the fucking hilarious. Yeah,

554
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,500
there's some crazy shit.

555
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,160
There's some romance to it if you're
[inaudible] I flashed a chain gang once on

556
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:55,760
my motor scooter and then it didn't
start and I had to like put my shirt down

557
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:57,230
and keep bogging it. Like it's hilarious.

558
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:01,820
I did crazy shit and I came out like
genuinely I feel good, you know,

559
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:05,260
I'm happy with my life. So it's
good. Thank you for getting that.

560
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,950
Getting me off of that path.

561
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:11,951
But well it's just everyone that I
know that's funny is fucked up and had

562
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,350
something go wrong. Just that's how,

563
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,420
and it's like how you get through it and
then your insight into it on the other

564
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:22,760
end you persevere and then
you don't blame people.

565
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:26,780
You don't let go around being mad at the
world. I think it's, it's easier to be,

566
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,110
um, I don't know. It's just some of the
most hilarious people did blame people.

567
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,560
Yeah. Cause that's Kennison
Kennison was always, you know,

568
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:40,790
screaming about his ex wives. Yeah, no,
that's true. That's funny too. I just,

569
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:44,840
for my own personal sanity cannot
run around angry at everyone.

570
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,150
Well you don't need to be,
I mean it's not necessary.

571
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,480
And especially now that you're sober,
which obviously [inaudible] had never got,

572
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,030
he uh, was friends with them? No, no,
never. No, never met him. Saw Him,

573
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,390
saw him live a few times
once, uh, once at work.

574
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,330
Once when I was working I was
working at a great woods, um,

575
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,350
center for the performing arts and it's
like a amphitheater in Mansfield doing

576
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,320
sun fall kicks. No
security. Oh cool. Yeah.

577
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,110
And I got to see Cosby there, Rodney
Dangerfield cause see a few people.

578
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,440
Did you want to do
comedy yet? Um, I was 19.

579
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,850
I probably had thought about it
a little bit. You know, maybe,

580
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,340
maybe it had been in
my head like slightly,

581
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,950
but I didn't really start thinking
about it until I was like 20.

582
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,810
And you feel embarrassed when you had
that thought at first of doing comedy?

583
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,490
No, but I did feel like
it was preposterous.

584
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:45,590
I did feel like, um, look, it's
such a difficult way to make it.

585
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,780
Like I remember my
girlfriend when I was 21,

586
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:52,781
her dad was mocking this idea
that I was going to be a comedian.

587
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,390
Like I remember him
saying, well, you know,

588
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,960
the odds were not in your favor.
No, they're not in anybody's favor.

589
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,190
But I remembered that's what he was
saying. You know that like who makes it,

590
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,490
how many people make it as a kid and
even if you do make and how much money do

591
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:10,850
you make? He was a doctor. That's
so funny. He was really angry.

592
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,380
Like he just felt like I
was a waste of his daughter.

593
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,330
It's really funny cause he's still
alive. Let's get him on the podcast.

594
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,430
It's probably not, you know, doctors
don't live that long. A lot of them died.

595
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:25,580
That was so, it was sad when he
died. I was like, I trusted you.

596
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,370
Well there's a great book called
dead doctors don't lie, but this guy,

597
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,540
Joel Wallach and what a lot of it has
to do with nutrition and it's about

598
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,620
mineral deficiencies and vitamin
deficiencies and doctors who abuse drugs.

599
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,280
And I'm essentially

600
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,660
talking about how people rely on
doctors for advice about health,

601
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,300
when in reality doctors are
good at very specific things.

602
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:48,180
Like if you're a podiatrist, you're good
at fixing feet. If you're a, you know,

603
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,730
an orthopedic surgeon, you're good
at knees and shoulders and shit,

604
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,450
but you probably don't know a fuck load
about nutrition and you really don't

605
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:58,230
understand like the mechanisms of the
body's absorptions of nutrients and

606
00:35:58,231 --> 00:35:59,220
minerals and vitamins.

607
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,520
And one of the things that I've learned
from doing this podcast is to understand

608
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:06,990
that even like when I, the cursory
understanding of it that I have,

609
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:11,280
you have to go through fucking hours and
hours and hours of reading and watching

610
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:15,930
documentaries and listening to experts
and I still have to go back over and over

611
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:16,764
and over it again.

612
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,490
So I've talked to doctors before and
they'd been like super dismissive about

613
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:24,270
even taking vitamins and I get
angry at them. I'm like, well,

614
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:26,790
I think all you need is a balanced
diet. I'm like, well, you're retarded.

615
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,460
Like what are you talking about?
That's it. And by that way,

616
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:34,461
I don't mean someone with downs syndrome
that is a retarded way in slow down.

617
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,970
You are your, you have a diminished
capacity for advancement.

618
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,060
You are slowing down the reality of
the progress of nutritional science.

619
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,490
This is a stupid thing you're doing
right now and giving me bad advice.

620
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,610
You really don't know what the fuck you're
talking about. I get angry. I'm like,

621
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,210
why would you say that? Like this is dumb.

622
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,340
Don't tell me that there's no benefit to
taking vitamins when there's a fucking

623
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,770
ass load of studies.

624
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,840
There's data and science
and it's all proven.

625
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,550
[inaudible] spent thousands
of hours researching this
stuff and trying to figure

626
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:09,060
out what the fuck is good for you and
what's not good for you and some Chubby

627
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,870
asshole with a fucking skinny fat body
is telling me that all you need is a

628
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:14,730
balanced diet. I'm like,
bitch, what's your diet?

629
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,050
You ain't got a balanced diet that
they're just doing that because they don't

630
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:22,650
get money out of there, out of the
vitamins. No, no. They don't have.

631
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,200
It's not feel like reading up on
the new stuff, but they haven't.

632
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,900
They haven't decided to pursue
it. That's all it is. I mean,

633
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,250
and if they did pursue it,

634
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,330
they'd realize it's a fucking bottomless
pit of information from essential fatty

635
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:36,900
acids to different kinds of proteins
and absorption of plant based proteins

636
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,280
versus animal based proteins.

637
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,240
What's the benefit of grass
fed beef over regular B?

638
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,510
It's a fucking endless stream of, yeah,

639
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,870
I mean if you follow someone
like Dr Rhonda Patrick,

640
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:50,250
you realize really quickly that she is
in the heart of this shit 24 hours a day,

641
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,700
seven days a week and she's still
learning things net. It never ends.

642
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,400
It never ends. I mean we,
we, and also it varies.

643
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,860
What's good for you is not
necessarily good for me.

644
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:03,380
Your Diet might not be as effective
as my Diomede elk cause that bad.

645
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,340
That's good. That's good for
everybody. It is alk all day.

646
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,010
Turn you into a fucking savage. I'll
give you this fucking elk. Give you some,

647
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,390
I got it. I got some waiting for
fanny pack and some Goddamn alk.

648
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,180
That's what kind of a cooking
set up do you have at your place?

649
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,450
I just have just a stove with frying
pan, like cast iron frying pan. I do.

650
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:25,560
I have to know how to cook. You could
cook. I'm all right. Decent. Okay.

651
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,470
I'm decent. I'll hook you up with some
elk sausage. We'll start with that.

652
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,100
I'll give you a recipe how to cook it
correctly. Do you have a thermometer? Um,

653
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:36,220
I'm really into, I'm really into,
um, big foot porn. Can you not say

654
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,990
elk sausage in front of me? Yeah.
Um, I don't have a meat thermometer.

655
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,130
No. Well that's good for elk
sausage. It's fine. And you'll,

656
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,730
you'll get a sense of when it's going
to leave. You want want line me? Y, Y,

657
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,640
y n cause I didn't get to a quick, when
you're talking about choke sausage, Bro,

658
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,500
I'm sorry I'm insulting or no, it's
just big foot dick elk sausage.

659
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,120
I don't know why I wouldn't draw those
two. I wouldn't pull those together.

660
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,690
Why you wouldn't, yeah. Why W why would
I not have one of them as a undulate?

661
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,840
The other one is a legendary
primate. Oh my God.

662
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,700
You're ever really getting
stuck in semantics here. Listen,

663
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,910
you're the one who cracked the joke.
Let me just make some fucking jokes.

664
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:20,590
I just got accused of doing a therapy
session and now I'm telling jokes,

665
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,930
I'm feeling triggered. Are you
feeling judged? No. No, but I'm,

666
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,280
I'm not feeling judged,

667
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:31,000
but everybody that I know that
has had those wild drunken days,

668
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:35,830
it has come out on the other sides.
There's something like nostalgic about it.

669
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,980
Like you look back and you go,
Huh, I made it through that.

670
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,480
Have you been to an AA meeting? You can't.

671
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:45,481
It's like the good old times and AA or
I always felt like people were either

672
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,330
telling these stories that were so
insane. I was like, I'm not an alcoholic.

673
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:52,870
Or they were like, I was like, let's
put Shit, you know, get outta here.

674
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,230
You don't even cool enough to be
here. Like celebrity rehab. Right.

675
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,250
Did you ever watch that show? One of the
best parts about it was Eric Roberts.

676
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,640
Julia Roberts brothers has
been a bunch of movies. He, uh,

677
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,130
was there for weed addiction. Yeah.

678
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,490
And everybody else was having the fucking
d dts or on the floor in the fetal

679
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:13,390
position shaking. He's reading
the paper [inaudible] Shit.

680
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,430
Cause on a treadmill, it's so
ridiculous. Like some people,

681
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,320
you know their stories are a joke.

682
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,850
I did quit smoking weed and it did
make things a lot easier, like laundry,

683
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:27,130
just little things. I was like,
oh that was maybe making things.

684
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:30,040
I would always smoke weed before I
cleaned my apartment and I was like seven

685
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:33,940
years to get my apartment. Glenn. Yeah,
it can get distracting. It doesn't,

686
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:35,980
it does not affect me. Well yeah.

687
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:38,260
Well when I do things like
if I want to clean my office,

688
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,060
I just have like a thing, like this is
what we're doing now. And I had her all,

689
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,890
even listening to music is not good.

690
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,280
I find that I used to listen to
podcasts while I clean my office,

691
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,070
but then I find that I would be like
pausing and listening to a particular part

692
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,430
and then I'd want to rewind it. I'm
like, Oh, I'm fucking with myself here.

693
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:57,790
I'm distracting myself. And then
that's a weird defense mechanism too.

694
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,870
Cause I do that all the time too.

695
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:02,080
I'm always multitasking and I always
have to be doing three things at once.

696
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:05,050
It's like why? Cause it's gonna make
me, I'm gonna slow down so much.

697
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:08,260
I might have to like deal with them. Yeah.

698
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,160
So like writing to like sometimes
I write listening to music,

699
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:16,780
but most of the time it's better
without music. With lyrics. Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,260
Sometimes lyrics and sometimes
foreign music I like foreign music is,

701
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:23,010
I don't know what they're
saying. What kind Brazilian. Oh.

702
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,530
Like a lot of Brazilian music. I look a
lot of Spanish music, Bollywood or what?

703
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,060
I listen to some of that dollar men
day. Do you know dollar Bandanas? No,

704
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,570
you don't. No dollar now. Oh he's amazing.
It's really cool. I just listened to,

705
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,290
I listened to a lot of Elton John.
That's what I'm into right now.

706
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,570
That's why I like to wear all my
crazy things too. Like to Elton John.

707
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:45,100
That shit put you some dollar Mindy
here. Play it on my phone. She didn't.

708
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,550
We get banned 100%. 100%. Why it's
gotten before. Even if we have,

709
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,000
cause you can't, how do
you spell his name? D a.

710
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,910
There it is. Dollar Mindy. Um,

711
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,471
what does this say?

712
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:04,310
The song is not currently available
in your country or region. Oh my God,

713
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:08,900
I love it. And now I'm really into it
and I want that shit. What is that? Oh,

714
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,734
here it goes.

715
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,390
[inaudible] we can't hear. We can't
hear. We can't hear. We can't hear.

716
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,570
That's actually a woman getting fucked
by big firm. The Guy Yelling. Yes. Wow.

717
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,980
Okay. Welcome to the wonderful
world of the Internet.

718
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,340
Um, anyway, I like dollar Mindy. It
sounds cool, but this is named dollar d a.

719
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,540
H. Hold on. I would like to better
if it was like the [inaudible] l.

720
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,860
E r m e. H. N. D. I,

721
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,230
but I think he got arrested
for human trafficking.

722
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,710
But can you still like his
work? That's a problem.

723
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,800
Like I was at a Dave Chappelle and
I did some shows the other day,

724
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,970
DJ and the DJ was playing all this, uh,

725
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,740
Michael Jackson music
and uh, he is so good.

726
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,330
Yeah, he's great. Go. He's a
fucking pedophile. Allegedly.

727
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,340
Most likely. Yeah, pretty. Probably.
Definitely did something wrong. Yeah.

728
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,880
Even though it's still
fucking great. Yeah.

729
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:17,000
But also he's dead. Yeah.

730
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,640
So what if you don't listen to
his music, you're punishing?

731
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:24,110
What are you punishing? Okay. The man's
dead bright. But even if he wasn't dead,

732
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,770
like if Ted Bundy had some great
poetry, would you want to read it?

733
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,040
Would you enjoy it? Um, no. I
don't create it. Probably not.

734
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:38,690
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I really
don't know what Michael Jackson did.

735
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,870
I don't know. And I don't think anybody
does other than the snow. He did it too,

736
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,920
but there's a lot of fucking
weirdness to it for sure. Yeah.

737
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,950
Hands with little boys. And I
know it's really uncomfortable,

738
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:51,980
just like inappropriate boundaries.
And that's enough to like Molesta Kit.

739
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,461
Honestly,

740
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:56,730
just having that inappropriate listen
blurred thing between kids and grownups.

741
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,890
That's not good. Yeah.

742
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:02,270
You hold hands with your nieces
and nephews and that makes sense.

743
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,160
Your children, that makes sense.

744
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,880
But if you're a 55 year old man and you're
holding hands with 11 year old boy in

745
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:11,300
Dubai, yeah, that's where I gotta
get. I gotta get suspicious.

746
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,840
I got a question whether I'm going to
enjoy this song that I'm enjoying right

747
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:19,670
now. I want to be. It's done. It's
done. It's done. It's so good.

748
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:23,300
I was listening to the music. I was like,
God damn, this guy was amazing. Yeah.

749
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:26,660
So except there's no way he wasn't
molested. I mean, it doesn't,

750
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:29,600
he seem so molested. Well, um,

751
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,190
in the interest of being
beaten a fucking dead horse.

752
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,250
I have talked about this many times in
the podcast where I think that he was a

753
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,953
cast trato,

754
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
which is someone who was castrated when
he was very young to preserve his high

755
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:48,390
pitched voice. Then his doctor,
the same doctor that killed him,

756
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,040
came out later.

757
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,760
This is long after I'd predicted this
and said that he was chemically castrated

758
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:57,060
to preserve his voice. So he,
he confirmed what I was saying.

759
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,580
Now whether this doctor's
telling the truth is castration.

760
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,360
Are you not able to get a boner?
I don't believe so. Um, oh my God.

761
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:05,490
So he maybe was him less
than them, but he was just,

762
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,010
he could have been just being
weird with them. I don't know who,

763
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:10,830
maybe didn't do anything with them.
Maybe he just wanted to be a child.

764
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,830
Maybe his childhood was stripped from him
because he was famous from the time he

765
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,970
was five fucking years old and his
father did something to definitely was a

766
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:22,440
weird life. According to the doctor, his
d, His father did did something to him,

767
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:24,900
like chemical castration is
what they do. That pedophiles,

768
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,500
they'll do it to pedophiles so
that they can never get erections.

769
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:31,620
And it basically stops your body's
production of testosterone and kills your

770
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:35,100
testes. And they do it with
some, some chemical injection.

771
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:39,090
And apparently according to the doctor,
that's what they did to Michael Jackson,

772
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,160
which you think about his voice.

773
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,260
It makes sense because his voice
was insane. It was so high pitched.

774
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,100
And if you listen to like ca
Strados, those a, there's,

775
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,100
there's only a few recordings
of actual Chris throttles.

776
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:56,940
But it was a common practice. Not
Common. Most everybody did it,

777
00:45:56,941 --> 00:46:00,800
but it was a practice that was done to
young boys to preserve their high pitched

778
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:05,250
voice where they're at fucking cast rate
and what a word, horrible cause strata.

779
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,330
But they did it. I mean,

780
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:09,810
people would let their children
get their balls chopped off,

781
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,770
can sing good, and they would, you
know, it'd be very valuable too.

782
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,060
How long ago was that? Well, there's
a recording, so the recording,

783
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,890
I don't think they had recordings
until like the late 18 hundreds I don't

784
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,410
believe when there was a lot of dance

785
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:32,030
dancing last one 1922 1922 is
the last Castrato recording.

786
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,350
And how old was that dude?
So he's probably born in
the 18 hundreds or something

787
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,940
died in that same year. So that's,

788
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:48,810
but it's, he died. Never
nothing but always. Yeah.

789
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,790
Have you ever heard the voice of an
angel and the, we can't play that either,

790
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:57,510
right? No. You should listen to it
though. We'll, I'll play it upsetting.

791
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,660
It's upsetting. It is upsetting.
It's haunting. Yeah, you can. Yeah,

792
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:01,920
you can enjoy that. Yeah.

793
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:03,990
I played it for a friend of mine the
other night and he was like, what?

794
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,270
And I was like, look, you got to listen
to this. And I played, he's like,

795
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,920
is that fucking real? And he's like,

796
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:11,040
it sounds like like someone who like did
something to somebody and you're like,

797
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,701
oh,

798
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:16,701
maybe people show jerk off to it to like
an honor of the man was 63 when he died

799
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:20,280
in 1922 he was born in
1958 and those recordings,

800
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:25,970
1851 and 1902 to 1904 so that makes them
forties he was in his forties when you

801
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,010
say Lord knows you said
1958 you mean he was born

802
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,150
in 1858 and 58 when he was born, I'm
sorry. Yeah. And died in 1922 wow.

803
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,880
Yeah, that's the whole thing's dark.

804
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:42,050
The look you gave me during my circle
jerk idea was [inaudible] we'll look,

805
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:47,020
I'll you, you gave me a come
on bitch circle jerk for the,

806
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,300
I was saying it to [inaudible] he
couldn't come. Look, you're projecting.

807
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,480
Listen, I know this is uncomfortable
for you and you're nervous to be here,

808
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:58,930
but I'm your friend and I love you
and I want you to be happy. I'm not

809
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:05,140
looking at trip. Come up the
king. You know I love you. I know.

810
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:08,710
I love you too. Thank you so much for
having me. I really do appreciate it.

811
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:12,580
I am trying to be chill. It's just
like a cool weirded out by this,

812
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,190
by being here. I'm not weirded out.
I'm trying to be in the moment.

813
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:18,760
I like to be funny impulsively like it's
my impulse to always like tell jokes

814
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:22,990
and stuff and this is a
more like chill, less jokey.

815
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:26,800
You could be jokey now
there's pressure to be joking.

816
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,270
You're overthinking this shit.
Too much overthinking anything.

817
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:35,620
I'm being chill in normal. Everyone.
Two Cups of coffee, cups of coffee.

818
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,490
One's calling me a con. What is a
one of them? One of them is cave man.

819
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:42,340
What's the other one? This is
caveman and this is a cunt mug.

820
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,880
I got it from my dad and I got one
for myself to got it for your dad.

821
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:50,080
He has a joke. Well, my dad and I, it
also looks like it says aunt. We one time,

822
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,310
uh, we went to, we were
at the post office.

823
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:59,020
My Dad's very funny. He reminds me of
caddy. Daddy actually the, Oh, really?

824
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,190
Held down against thing. By the way,

825
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:04,160
that fucking thing is hilarious that
you guys are doing. It's fun. Yeah.

826
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,820
We recorded one and then, uh,
it just wasn't funny. It wasn't,

827
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,890
we'd have to rethink it.
Don't want to put out,

828
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,630
we don't want to disappoint
with Capitol one.

829
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:17,620
You did do the one you did put it out
was hilarious. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah.

830
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,350
He's so funny. He's hilarious. But, um,

831
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,240
so my dad and I were at the post office
and mailing something out and I was

832
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:29,110
taking a while to mail something out and
just were just jokingly antagonistic.

833
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:32,050
You know, my dad's like, come on. I was
like, Dad, leave me alone. I'm not done.

834
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:33,710
You know, we're just joking
with each other. Right.

835
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,680
And this old woman who's been observing,

836
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,610
she goes to leave and then she just
pivots before she leaves and turns around.

837
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:43,120
She goes, she goes, you know what
young lady, you're a real itch,

838
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,300
itch, itch. And my dad goes,
I think he mean an end,

839
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,370
which is fucking one of our
best stories. My Daddy's funny.

840
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,650
So she doesn't realize, you're
just joking around. She didn't get,

841
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,980
we were just joking. She was like,
Oh, you're being sewn. And it's like,

842
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,750
did you tell her, Hey, this is
my dad. We're just joking around.

843
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:03,150
My Dad said she's an aunt and we
laughed. So I think she got up. Yeah.

844
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,920
Well she was leaving when he said,
yeah, we just worked with like crying.

845
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:10,921
And the fact that someone really needs
to stump you and put you in your place.

846
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,700
Yeah. It's just so silly, but it's like
she was old. What does she know? Ah,

847
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,010
I'm sure. I'm just going to try really
hard to not be one of those old people.

848
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,650
What do you think you're going to be
like as an old lady? I'm going to peak.

849
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,380
I'm excited. Well, I'm
trying really hard to,

850
00:50:23,381 --> 00:50:28,381
I'm trying really hard to be in the
moment and appreciate each new age and not

851
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,100
get anything in my face
or anything like that.

852
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,700
And just sitting in your face while, you
know, except come shots obviously. No,

853
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,500
I'm in like a, you know?
Oh you, I don't, yeah,

854
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,580
I'll try not to do anything
too crazy. It's just,

855
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,720
it's fighting an inevitable thing. And
I think it's a gift to age. You know,

856
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,870
we get to be different every day.
My mom was a, she worked at, uh,

857
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,140
this organization called Gray Panthers,

858
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:54,350
which can cause for old people,

859
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,650
old people that like to fuck. I
mean, I'm sure they like to fuck.

860
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:00,530
But Maggie Kuhn, Maggie
coon was the woman's name,

861
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:05,090
which I know there's a little bit
of a parallel between gray panthers,

862
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:09,050
Black Panthers, her last
name is [inaudible], but
it was spelled differently.

863
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,030
Um, but so she was this, it was
in Philadelphia and she was, uh,

864
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,700
she liked [inaudible] was 90, maybe 89,

865
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:18,860
but we used to hang out with her
all the time. And she had dated,

866
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,490
famously dated like a 40 year old, I
think in her eighties or something hollow.

867
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,740
So I think she was fucking pegging
him. She might've been pegging him.

868
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,770
I don't know if she
could peg at that point.

869
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:31,520
She had a lot of hats and a lot
of cats down. He could peg. Oh,

870
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:35,030
he can peg himself.
Remember Elizabeth Taylor?

871
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:39,630
It was like she married a series of gay
guys before she died. Oh yeah. Yeah.

872
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,250
That happens really pretty
old ladies that you know,

873
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,410
they just want a man to
tell them they're beautiful.

874
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,400
I've been just showered with
compliments by gay men. Yeah.

875
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,500
I think they go through menopause too
and they probably give up on the idea of

876
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:55,160
sex. They just want pretty
men around them. Yeah.

877
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:58,310
I mean not that her gays were that
pretty. I've had prettier gays.

878
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,670
I've definitely been the law. I've
been the last post for a couple guys.

879
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,610
The last post before gay.
Yeah. Where I'm like,

880
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:07,250
and then one guy had got married
and shit. I was sure he was.

881
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,290
I sure I was sure it was his last. Listen,

882
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,330
just because you got married
doesn't mean he's not good. Yeah,

883
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:12,260
that's a good point. I know.

884
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,170
Did he guys would read gay
men would reach out to him.

885
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:17,090
They would try to touch him
and he's always wearing a suit.

886
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:20,450
We lived in Santa Fe. I'm like, where am
I going to suit? Like slap their hands.

887
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,750
I'm like, not until he comes out
here. I knew. I mean I was like,

888
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:27,080
there's no way. He used to always want
to have like threesomes with other guys.

889
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:27,914
Like there was always,

890
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,920
I remember we invited my one friend
and we were just drinking so much.

891
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:31,754
We call it a,

892
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,430
we called Jack Daniels o j so we didn't
feel weird and more like past the OJ,

893
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,720
we're just like fucking
shit faced all the time.

894
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:40,670
Shuggie [inaudible] went
to this college, what?

895
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,870
My college and I'm going out of business,

896
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:45,910
just this little school in
Santa Fe just hammered. And uh,

897
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:50,310
my friend who I worked at a restaurant
with a guy friend, he wanted to hug,

898
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,740
hook up with me and he's like sweet.

899
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:54,530
So he like hops into bed with us and
then he leaves the next day. He's like,

900
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,980
he kept looking me in the eye
and he kept looking at me.

901
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,630
He kept trying to make eye contact
with me. So he was bone in you and you,

902
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,640
your boyfriend was like, I don't
know if he ended up owning me.

903
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,970
I think he would just, he hopped
in the hopped out pretty quick.

904
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,630
What does that mean? Cause he got
freaked out cause he kept looking at him.

905
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,960
I don't know if it actually, I mean we
were in full black lights at that point.

906
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:16,933
I don't remember.

907
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,840
I really feel like I'm five years younger
than I am because I just blacked out

908
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:25,100
five years. You should write about
those days. I don't know. This book,

909
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,891
there were so many.

910
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:28,950
I have so many crazy stories and it's
funny because I always thought everyone

911
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:32,520
else had them. I really thought
everyone else had this crate. I'm like,

912
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:34,050
you didn't steal cars
when you were little.

913
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:37,170
Like you didn't do all these
things that never happened to you.

914
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,230
Have you thought about writing
a book? Yeah, but that'd be,

915
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,620
it's also a great glide comedy
writing act. Yeah, I know.

916
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,610
I want to tell these stories on stage
to the more flashing. The changing was,

917
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:50,340
I mean there's just been so many.
I drew some pictures I draw too,

918
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:52,260
so I've been drawn in a while,

919
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:55,050
but I drew like a coloring book once
that I never followed through with,

920
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:59,040
but it was a lesson from a Chubby
alcoholic and it was just different,

921
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:03,570
like true scenes from my drinking
days. Just fucking crazy.

922
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,450
This shit I did. So how did
you stop? I will tell you,

923
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,000
that actually brings me back to
Tate. So I moved to New York.

924
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:10,410
I wanted to do standup so bad.

925
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,830
I'd just done that one thing at the
cowgirl in Santa Fe and I liked it.

926
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:16,770
I really, I was nervous
and I don't remember.

927
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:20,550
I'm sure it was like all abortion
jokes. I don't really remember.

928
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:24,610
But then I do remember my
first set after that. Um,

929
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,280
I remember all the beginning ones. So
the first one was when I got to New York,

930
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:31,620
I moved to New York to do
standup. I crashed my scooter,

931
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:33,480
so I wanted to move to la.

932
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,450
I had met people out in La and I
thought that was where I wanted to go.

933
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:38,250
But because I kept drinking
and driving, I was like, oh,

934
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:39,510
I have a drinking and driving problem.

935
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,900
I have to go somewhere where I can't
drive. So I moved to New York, thank God,

936
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,400
because I think I really,

937
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:49,110
I think it helped me really push and get
really strong before I came out here.

938
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,280
So I moved to New York. I wanted
to do standup. I was just drinking,

939
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:57,090
I was partying. I have so many friends
I just met on benders, like random shit.

940
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,430
I was just doing insane
things, day drinking,

941
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,220
just way more drunk
than everyone else. My,

942
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,100
I left my drinking buddies in Santa
Fe and everyone else was kind of like,

943
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:05,761
what are you up to?

944
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:09,690
So I was staying on my friend's
couch and I wanted to do stand up.

945
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,050
And so finally she was like, look,
um, let's just go to an open mic.

946
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:16,470
I'll go with you. And I was like, all
right. So I got all my jokes ready.

947
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:20,910
We go to an open Mike. Um, I go up,

948
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:25,050
I dropped my setlist and then I
completely black out. I'm so nervous.

949
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,200
I'm like in this basement at
this place called cake shop. Um,

950
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:31,860
my friend Caper lamp was the host of it
or was she the host yet? I don't know.

951
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,160
Anyway, I got up on stage
and completely bombed.

952
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:36,480
Just started yelling at everyone.

953
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:40,050
I just started yelling at all of these
comics like, fuck you. He pieces a shit.

954
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:41,940
Like I don't know what happened.

955
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:44,370
And then I sat down at the bar
and I'd already quit Jaeger.

956
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,050
Jaeger was the first thing I quit.

957
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,320
So I was sitting at the
bar and some guy came up,

958
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:53,070
this comic who I did not like or think
was funny or want anything to do with,

959
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:56,250
and he kept buying me drinks. He was
buying me shots of Yeager and I was like,

960
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:58,860
look man, I'm like struggling
with drinking. I really like,

961
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,310
I can't really say no to a drink,
but please stop buying them from me.

962
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,250
And he just kept buying them like I just
was, you know, I wasn't going to stop.

963
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:06,960
And so he kept buying them.

964
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:11,400
And then so then I ended up
waking up on his air mattress.

965
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,240
Is that for my first [inaudible], waking
up his air mattress fully clothed.

966
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,060
That didn't fuck him or anything.
Just like trap somewhere in Bushwick.

967
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:20,370
It was snowing. I was like,
where am I? What am I doing?

968
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,370
I looked around his apartment. I'm
like, all I want to do is be a comedian.

969
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,270
I was so sure that's what I wanted to do.
I was spending all this time drinking,

970
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:31,360
getting fucked out. Second
set. This was my second. Yeah.

971
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,430
This was what I had moved to New
York was my first one in New York.

972
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,470
What made you so sure that
you wanted to be a comedian?

973
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,990
I just never wanted to do
anything else. And when I think,

974
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,310
but you only had one set at a karaoke
bar and then the second set where you

975
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:43,840
screamed and told everybody to fuck off.

976
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,460
What was it that made you think that you
could do it? Um, I just, I don't know.

977
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:50,830
I just never wanted to do anything
else. I just didn't have another,

978
00:56:50,831 --> 00:56:53,260
there was no other plan. I
had been a special ed teacher.

979
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:56,780
I had done a Gogo dance. I'd worked
at the bars, I'd done all that stuff.

980
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,880
I just never, I just always, I just felt
like if I could do it, I could do it.

981
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,020
I mean, I guess it's that little bit
of that delusion and that, but I just,

982
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,480
I never, but I knew that
I wouldn't be able to do,

983
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:10,720
I knew there were obstacles in my way
and I knew that drinking was one of them.

984
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:15,520
I had talked to a comic before, uh, that
sat at the open mic and he had said,

985
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:18,410
just try not to, his advice to me
was try not to hook up with the,

986
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,060
with the guys that open my ex because
you're gonna get a reputation when you're

987
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:24,730
just trying to be respected.
So he had said that to me.

988
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:27,880
I think it was great advice because
it's also, there is no time for that.

989
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,780
This was my whole hustle also.

990
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,650
What are the odds that person's going
to fall through a few fall through and

991
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:34,750
become a comic? What are the
odds that they are? Yeah,

992
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,850
you might get hitched up to
some fucking loser. Yeah.

993
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,980
You definitely don't want to
get hit shot. But it also was,

994
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:40,270
I needed to put all my energy.

995
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:43,450
I was in an m s barely in a place now
to be in a relationship. So it's like,

996
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:47,800
this was 11 years ago. So I, um, I,

997
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,880
I, when I woke up on that guys
air mattress, I was like, fuck.

998
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:55,870
Like I already broke the thing that I
wanted to do and I was already, you know,

999
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:58,840
from all my, like weird sexual
assault stuff when I was younger.

1000
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:02,320
I just didn't have a good relationship
with sex. Drinking, didn't help with it,

1001
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,870
you know, everything was
just out of control and all,

1002
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:09,580
and I had this thing now this like
precious thing that I want so bad. So,

1003
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:12,660
you know, crashing my scooter,
almost dying all that shit. Nah,

1004
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:16,060
it wasn't enough, but stand up
really was, that's what I wanted.

1005
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,510
So I went to my friend's
house and I called Tate,

1006
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,210
I just called [inaudible].
I was like, I got to,

1007
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,520
I just want to do this and
I want to quit drinking.

1008
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:30,130
And so he told me to go to
meetings and just cha try it out.

1009
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,980
Do you remember your first
meeting? Yeah, I went to one,

1010
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,890
I think it was the lower east side
and the guy sharing was talking about,

1011
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:39,850
he's like, I always knew I had a
problem because I, I, when I was two,

1012
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:43,600
I took all of the Tylenol and I was
like, what are you talking about?

1013
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,870
Any kid with a childproof thing
is just gonna eat the pills.

1014
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,210
I remember kind of judging
him and being like, whatever.

1015
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,510
But it was good to have that community
then because I needed to detach myself

1016
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:56,860
from like the partiers and all
that lifestyle. So I did go to,

1017
00:58:56,861 --> 00:59:00,970
I did 1998 at a meeting every day for
90 days and then I never went back.

1018
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,970
Some people actually learn how to
do stand up from those meetings.

1019
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,890
There was a gun, I mean, not a bomb.

1020
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,130
There was a guy named Dave Fitzgerald
who was a really funny comedian back in

1021
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,840
Boston and um,

1022
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:15,870
he learned how to do stand up from
making hilarious stories out of his drunk

1023
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:20,830
days cause he, he was a fucking
raging alcohol. The same thing,

1024
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,070
just quit and then started

1025
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,190
doing, stand up and literally
learned how to do a family meeting.

1026
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,800
Cause he would tell these crazy
stories about being blacked out,

1027
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:31,190
drunk and fucked up and being
at gun fights, you know,

1028
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:35,840
high speed chases and all this nuts had
alcohol to shed. Crazy stuff goes down.

1029
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,810
Yeah. But those guys, many of
them learn how to do stand up.

1030
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,360
You're standing up in front of an
audience. I was brought up Quaker too,

1031
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:42,230
so our church was,

1032
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:45,410
you stand up and speak and everyone just
sits there in silence and watches it.

1033
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:48,430
Yeah. What's that like? Which
one's Quaker? That's the oats box.

1034
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,230
[inaudible] box. Everyone's
like gets a confused with Amish,

1035
00:59:51,231 --> 00:59:53,150
which has nothing to do
with Amish. The difference.

1036
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,250
It's just a very chill Christianity. So
it's, those are the pilgrims. The fist.

1037
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:03,170
Quakers. No, I don't think they were.
They were, um, when do Quakers and start,

1038
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:05,390
I don't ask sophists.
They're, they're pacifists.

1039
01:00:05,391 --> 01:00:07,910
They believe that God's in the form of
an inner light that's in everyone and

1040
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:10,040
everything. So why would you fight?

1041
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:13,790
I mean I agree with that just from
hallucinogen and shit too. But, um,

1042
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,360
it's something I struggle with. Like
I have to look back at, you know,

1043
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,230
childhood predators and I'm like, can I,

1044
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,170
I have to forgive these people because
they are from the same light. I guess.

1045
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,300
What is the, what's the
wacky thing Quakers? Quakers
are, well, it's just very,

1046
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:29,210
it's just, you sit in silence. So
the churches, there's two types.

1047
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:31,280
There's programmed and
unprogrammed I was unprogrammed,

1048
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:35,690
which is the super chill one. There's
no bible talk. There's no preacher.

1049
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:38,240
There's nothing. You just sit
in benches facing each other.

1050
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,650
My meeting house had these old creaky
explain. What are you talking about?

1051
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,270
So it's like a, it's a meeting house that
you meet up with the onset on Sundays.

1052
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,320
Yeah. You look down at your hands, you
don't really look at each other, but you,

1053
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:54,650
you sit, there's facing benches and
then there's, you know, benches here.

1054
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,220
So you are kind of all looking
at it. You're facing each other.

1055
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,280
And what do you do? You sit in silence
and then if you feel moved to speak,

1056
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,420
it's supposed to be God speaking to you,

1057
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:03,890
but if you just feel
moved to speak at all,

1058
01:01:03,891 --> 01:01:06,170
you just stand up and you
say whatever you want. Wow.

1059
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,190
And so you don't reading
scripture. I mean, some people,

1060
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:12,140
every once in a while someone
would do that. Growing up,

1061
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:15,680
I went to a Quaker school
too, and we were little kids.

1062
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:18,590
We used to have to sit in silence for
like 45 minutes, which was impossible.

1063
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,090
It's such bad 80 dude. It was insane.

1064
01:01:20,091 --> 01:01:22,610
I would wear shirts that had like
things on it. I could play with.

1065
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:26,390
Like I had a shirt with a phone and it
had like a cord and I would just wear it

1066
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,610
and I would set alarms and set on
my alarm so it wouldn't go off.

1067
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:30,620
I just had to be doing
stuff. It was crazy.

1068
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,980
You're just so little and you're just
sitting there. So bored. Little incense,

1069
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,640
so bored, you know? And what's
the first thing they do?

1070
01:01:37,641 --> 01:01:40,490
They try to medicate them
because they're so bored. Well,

1071
01:01:40,491 --> 01:01:44,720
I got medicated to
Ritalin and stuff. Oh No.

1072
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,540
But when I was older, I don't
feel like it affected me.

1073
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:48,980
They put me on
antidepressants a little bit,

1074
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:51,350
but I was pretty good at being like,
I don't want to do these things.

1075
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:53,930
Don't feel like it affected
you to be why stolen.

1076
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:57,710
But I didn't take it for that long.
How long did it take it for? I Dunno.

1077
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,080
I don't think I took it for
that. Allie Makowski Duh.

1078
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,390
She was talking about it last
night. I love her. Love her too.

1079
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:08,210
She was telling us about how that same
shit happened to her when she was kid.

1080
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:12,260
Yeah. Bouncing off the walls and
the Medicaid you, yeah. It's so,

1081
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:17,060
it is interesting cause it is. I can only
imagine what it's like to be a parent.

1082
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,890
You just, there's all this
information coming at you and you're

1083
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,420
dealing with your own shit.

1084
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:25,240
And a lot of people didn't go through
their healing process or anything to,

1085
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,720
it's, it must be so hard to be a
parent. It's just gotta be crazy.

1086
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:28,650
I think about it.

1087
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,220
I never wanted to have a kid until I did
some hallucinogens and then I was like,

1088
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:35,640
maybe I want to have a kid. You'd be
a great mom. Yeah, I think I would,

1089
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:39,120
but I'm just dealing with all my
heel. I'm dealing with all my,

1090
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,710
I just want to make
sure I'm not in a place.

1091
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:44,070
I was very angry in the past and
it's something that I work on a lot.

1092
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:47,250
I just wouldn't want to redo
patterns and stuff like that.

1093
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:50,820
But I do think because I've had, I had
such traumatic stuff, I think I would be,

1094
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,470
I think I could protect
my kids in a good way.

1095
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:56,910
And Quakers are allowed to medicate their
kids. It's part of the doctrine. Yeah,

1096
01:02:56,911 --> 01:02:59,640
you can, there's no dye.
I mean it's pretty loose.

1097
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:00,870
It's like you can do whatever you want.

1098
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:04,300
There was one guy that wore his
like Jewish stuff to a meeting. Uh,

1099
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,500
well I went to meeting after the
election. I want a little bit. I was like,

1100
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:11,100
maybe I want to go back to the
church. The Quaker church. Yeah.

1101
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:13,350
I just feel doesn't 16
yeah. Cause I just was,

1102
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:15,780
it just triggered a lot of
things in me and, and uh,

1103
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,310
I went real crazy for a second.

1104
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:20,910
I just had a lot of trauma that I wasn't
dealing when Trump won. It wasn't,

1105
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:24,630
this is embarrassing. Okay. I was
hanging out with a lot of, anyway,

1106
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,170
what happened? I just got really
like, I got really mad. I don't know,

1107
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:33,090
I got really mad. I just
wasn't, I wasn't um,

1108
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,590
dealing with stuff and it just kind of
pushed all this stuff forward for me.

1109
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,910
And also, what do you mean?

1110
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,630
But just like some sexual
assault stuff just came up.

1111
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:46,710
Like I think a lot of people that were
angry and were marching around and stuff

1112
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:47,100
were,

1113
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,570
had some personal triggers that had
happened for them because of like the grab

1114
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,270
them by the Pussy and then you read it
and then I read up on it and it's not

1115
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:57,900
what it seems. And I don't
know, I just, I, you know,

1116
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:01,730
there was a lot of hysteria
and it just trigger,

1117
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,880
it just triggered a lot of my shit.

1118
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:05,430
But I'm glad it did because it
helped me get through a lot of stuff.

1119
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:06,600
And I definitely,

1120
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:12,090
I think have a different view on
those things now. And I, you know,

1121
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:16,890
I was running around so mad at who I'm
like, who am I mad at? I did a lot of,

1122
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:18,960
like, when it first happened,
I was like, fuck man,

1123
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:21,300
I did that for about three months.
Thank God I got out of that.

1124
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:25,350
But really angry and just projecting
and pissed and all this stuff.

1125
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:29,580
And it's like, there's a few, there's a
few men, I'm at it right. There's a few,

1126
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,860
I'm certainly not mad at men, but
there are a few from your past. Yeah.

1127
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:35,221
You know,

1128
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:38,610
and that was something I had to deal with
and I had to learn to compartmentalize

1129
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:41,070
that and not make it this broad
thing. I hate when people do that.

1130
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:45,120
So upsetting the drinking days, the
drinking days, and from my childhood,

1131
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:49,560
you know, I had, I had some fucked up,
shit happened. But you know, it, it's,

1132
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:52,230
you can't, it's just important to,

1133
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:57,290
for me to not blame a large group of
people that have nothing to do with my

1134
01:04:57,691 --> 01:05:00,090
trauma. And it's also
when I get triggered,

1135
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:04,080
what I needed to learn was that's my
responsibility to handle my trigger.

1136
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:08,130
And I can't just be running around like
this, like unsheathed sword. I mean,

1137
01:05:08,131 --> 01:05:09,810
I can, I'm going to
cut everyone around me.

1138
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,340
You're the thing that people do when
they blame everyone that's part of that

1139
01:05:14,341 --> 01:05:18,340
group. You know, it's so common and
it's so, you remember, uh, there

1140
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,180
was a real problem a few months
back where Liam Neeson, uh,

1141
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:26,770
was talking about one of his friends
that had gotten something that happened

1142
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:31,090
where, uh, a black, I had done something
murdered. One of his friends are raped,

1143
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:33,130
one of his friends, something
awful. I think it was great.

1144
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:38,790
And so he would go out at night with
a bat looking for a black guy to start

1145
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:43,750
trouble. And he talked about,
and everybody was furious
at him and he's saying,

1146
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:47,230
look, look, I didn't do anything and
I was in a terrible state of mind.

1147
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:49,510
I'm just being honest about
this. I'm not proud of this.

1148
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:52,210
It was one of the most embarrassing
and darkest moments of my life,

1149
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,650
but I did it right.

1150
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:58,651
And not letting people express those
things and talk about it and say a wet

1151
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,920
cause. I am embarrassed that I got so
man hideous. I mean it's, you know,

1152
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,530
there's a couple of podcasts I did where
I was like, fuck man. You know, and I,

1153
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:08,130
that hurts people. I hurt
people by saying that. Well,

1154
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,490
I mean it's still whatever. No,

1155
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:11,770
but people have lashed out
at me for stuff like that,

1156
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:12,850
but it's like I don't fucking,

1157
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,300
I don't have the capacity to hate an
entire group of people. And I certainly,

1158
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:19,810
like I have brothers, I have my
dad. I don't, don't use any of this.

1159
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,300
Sometimes you say things and that's
not really what you mean. Yeah.

1160
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:27,970
And then expressing anger of course. And
then I think right now what's going on?

1161
01:06:27,971 --> 01:06:29,710
And I've checked out of a lot of stuff.

1162
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:32,980
I don't pay attention to a lot of things
anymore cause it was just like the news

1163
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:36,610
you mean? Yeah. It's just like not,
it's not real. I don't read Twitter.

1164
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:37,960
I don't, I just don't do it.

1165
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:42,961
It's like I got to focus on what I can
do and how I can feel good and how I can,

1166
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:46,330
I just want to make people laugh, have
a good time, make people feel good.

1167
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,500
I want to feel good.

1168
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:50,980
It's like I can't do that if I'm in this
constant state of taking in all this

1169
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:54,190
information that's just pushing my
buttons, pushing my buttons. Well, yeah,

1170
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,670
some of it's not going to be, but
someone certainly is. And you,

1171
01:06:56,671 --> 01:07:00,670
if you're not controlling the,
like you have a mental diet too.

1172
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:03,280
And that's something that people
don't think of all the time. You know?

1173
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,290
I don't remember who, who
described it that way,

1174
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:06,970
but it's the best way of describing it.

1175
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,470
You have a physical diet and if you have
a poor physical diet, your body's sick.

1176
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,740
But if you have a poor mental
diet, your mind is sick. Yeah,

1177
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,100
you're taking a nonsense all
the time and fights. You know,

1178
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:22,570
I had Bernie Sanders on yesterday and
that guy who was running for something,

1179
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:26,710
my dad. Yeah, a little
bit cool. Um, and uh,

1180
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:31,180
I briefly looked into the comments of uh,

1181
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:36,450
one of the posts and so many fucking
people are so God damn toxic.

1182
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:38,020
Yup.

1183
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:42,810
They're just battling it out left and
right and misrepresenting his position and

1184
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:47,020
misrep someone was calling me and
all right. White supremacists.

1185
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:51,250
White nationalists. Like what in
the fuck. That's so high scent.

1186
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,280
I am at tee shirt. So this has,
someone said that I had someone,

1187
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:57,070
what is this storm front
or something like that?

1188
01:07:57,071 --> 01:08:01,480
What does that white supremacist page
storm in front of something they said I

1189
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:04,690
had the founder of Stormfront and my
potluck. The fuck are you talking about?

1190
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:08,130
You're just making it up
properly? No proud of those guys.

1191
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,670
I had Gavin McGiven Gavin who is
the founder of the proud boys.

1192
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:16,040
I had him on before, but I had him on
before. There was a proud boys. I didn't

1193
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,690
even know what the fuck.
Why can't you talk to him?

1194
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:23,480
I asked him about it and I was critical.
I was criticizing him. I was like,

1195
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:26,630
you can't just claim you're going
to have violence with people.

1196
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:29,270
It's so fucking dumb. And
then all the proud boys,

1197
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:33,410
shit that happened with
violence came far after that.

1198
01:08:33,411 --> 01:08:36,320
But people were like blaming
me for having him on.

1199
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,900
I don't even know what the fuck it
is. He's the Co founder of Vice.

1200
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:41,180
That's what I knew. It
just, it's also interesting.

1201
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:42,710
Don't you want to hear the other side?

1202
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,830
Like don't want to hear everyone's
opinions and everyone's thoughts when you

1203
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,810
want to try to understand
and come to a common ground.

1204
01:08:47,811 --> 01:08:50,270
Don't you want to realize like I'm
not religious really or anything,

1205
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:54,230
but it's like we are all God's children.
Like there's missing this whole thing.

1206
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:56,750
It's this fight against each
other. Yes. But no. Okay.

1207
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:01,280
The problem is there's a lot of these
people that do go on shows and try to

1208
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:03,890
reinvent themselves disingenuous way,

1209
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:07,250
and they try to whitewash what they're
doing and whitewash their past.

1210
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:08,900
And to that point,

1211
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:13,901
I mean the idea is that you're
helping them recruit people.

1212
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,690
Before he was on my podcast
though there was no record,

1213
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:22,160
there was no people for him to recruit
to is that people need to understand like

1214
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,293
he wasn't,

1215
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:27,290
there was nothing like I had a mom because
he was this guy who was funny and he

1216
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:28,850
used to do a lot of interesting videos.

1217
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:33,200
He fucked up when he started that group
and he fucked up when he was calling for

1218
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:36,830
violence and telling people to choke a
bitch and punch people and grab these

1219
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:41,420
people. And he was doing it in response
to the violence that Antifa was,

1220
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:45,290
was pushing on right-wing people that
would have these meetings and they would

1221
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:48,800
show up. Yeah. Doing like this
all clown mirror back at them.

1222
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,130
It's all crazy area was
all poorly thought out.

1223
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:55,860
But the idea that that makes you a
white nationalist cause you talk to,

1224
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,610
you talk to them. Yeah.
It's so fucking stupid.

1225
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,670
But it's like this is the world we
live in and everything's so polarized.

1226
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:05,090
It's like your left or right. You're
black or white, you're one or zero.

1227
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:07,910
It's like there's no gray
area with the August freeze.

1228
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:11,930
You and the one moment that you said
the thing and then there's no before or

1229
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:16,460
after, there's no growth, there's nothing.
It's like, yeah, fucking out. Yeah.

1230
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:19,720
They just look for this quote
trap and just that's it.

1231
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:23,450
You said that you said that. I'm like
no Mike, I clarified, I expanded,

1232
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,530
I took it back.

1233
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:29,060
I revisited it like there's a lot of
things that people do when you talk or you

1234
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:30,830
just, you know, you say things like,

1235
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,830
you say things like you don't even know
what the fuck you're going to say when

1236
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:36,320
you're saying it and then you
go, that doesn't make sense.

1237
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:41,370
Then you re re clarify and when you're
talking a long foreign conversation and

1238
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:46,160
like this in a podcast and someone wants
to take a snippet out of it and I just

1239
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:50,300
decided that's who you are. It's nuts.
It doesn't make any sense. And it's,

1240
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:51,590
this is the world we're living in today.

1241
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:53,810
Everybody wants to paint
everyone as toxic. Yeah.

1242
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,690
Everyone that you want to paint.
So many people, I should say,

1243
01:10:56,691 --> 01:11:00,140
want to paint people as being
a problem or a negative thing,

1244
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:05,120
and it's like this is the Twitter world
where 20% of the people make 80% of the

1245
01:11:05,121 --> 01:11:09,470
posts. So many of them are fucking
losers and just also it's such a,

1246
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:11,690
you're giving all of your
power out to outward.

1247
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:14,040
You're not paying attention to
yourself, blaming others. You're

1248
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,450
trying to change the world around you.

1249
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:19,060
You're trying to create a safe space
through other people. Yeah. It's like,

1250
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,040
do you know unhappy?

1251
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:24,100
You're going to be in your life if you're
expecting other people to come cower

1252
01:11:24,101 --> 01:11:25,950
to all of your demands
and do all of your stuff.

1253
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,290
Everyone's dealing with their own fucking,

1254
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,770
they're not trying to be
happy. Part of it. What's,

1255
01:11:29,771 --> 01:11:34,390
what they're trying to do is somehow or
another score points and rack up was,

1256
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:34,851
you know, and,

1257
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:39,450
and distract themselves from their own
life by focusing on these external issues

1258
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:42,000
that they think are critical
and super important.

1259
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:44,490
And some of them are obviously
running for president.

1260
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:48,150
Whoever's going to be presidents, very
important issue. And most of the time,

1261
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:51,000
like 95% of time I avoid comments,

1262
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:54,390
but for whatever reason I
just found myself flipping
through it because I wanted

1263
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:57,960
to see what the people think about Bernie.
Yeah. I'm like, oh, what a mistake.

1264
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:00,780
You can't look, you can't
love. It seems worse though.

1265
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,060
It seems like every time I check if I,

1266
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:06,770
if I don't check Twitter for four months
and then I check it, it's like Whoa,

1267
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:09,210
it was, things accelerated this much.

1268
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:13,880
Or people are so angry at so many
different things and just they,

1269
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:18,990
they paint people in such character
caricature like AOC and the,

1270
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:21,900
she is a woman who I don't think they're,

1271
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,780
I don't think I've ever seen anybody work.

1272
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:29,781
So people work so hard to mischaracterize
her or paint her in a horrible light.

1273
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,840
And I'm like, look, she says
things that I don't agree with.

1274
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,350
Why is everyone so fucking
angry? Like what is this?

1275
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:40,820
Well people were put all their thing on
things, on, you know, and those are the,

1276
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:44,590
they have these beliefs. And like
definitely when I was in my whole like,

1277
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:48,160
you know, when I was extra angry
and feeling, you know, you,

1278
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:52,240
you have this whole system
around you and you, you know,

1279
01:12:52,241 --> 01:12:55,240
you can't hear the other side
and you have to like, yes,

1280
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,190
everyone has to be a
villain in that are they?

1281
01:12:57,191 --> 01:12:59,250
They're either with you or
against you. And I dunno,

1282
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:02,560
it's just to me is just
unhealthy. I had to tap out,

1283
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:05,560
I stopped paying attention to a lot of
stuff and I don't know if that makes me

1284
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:07,480
ignorant. I just got to live a happy life.

1285
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,040
No, I don't think it does make you angry.

1286
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:12,760
I don't think it's an effective way to
communicate. I think it's a really piss,

1287
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:16,870
poor way to communicate. And I think
it, it fosters rage more than anything.

1288
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:17,320
Yeah.

1289
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,860
There's something about being able to
talk to people where you don't have social

1290
01:13:20,861 --> 01:13:22,180
cues, you don't have empathy,

1291
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,550
you're not looking at them
and people say the meanest,

1292
01:13:24,551 --> 01:13:27,790
nasty shit each other and
it's insulting people.

1293
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:29,890
And dunking on people is
more important than actual,

1294
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,950
well, it's attention
to, so it's, you know,

1295
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:34,920
they're maybe trying to impress their
other buddies that are on there.

1296
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:38,070
They're trying to get those extra
little likes right there. Like the,

1297
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:41,460
the main point would be they want
to get your attention. Holy Shit,

1298
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,640
they got Joe Rogan's attention.
That's so cool. You know,

1299
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:47,880
they just want to feel alive or
whatever. And that's, you know,

1300
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:50,670
people have their own processes. I
tried to not take anything personally.

1301
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:53,460
It's like you don't know me if you
don't like me. Like that's weird.

1302
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:56,300
You don't know me. You shouldn't
really have that much of an opinion.

1303
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,080
It's like not finding your validation.

1304
01:13:58,081 --> 01:14:00,690
You can't find the good stuff or the
bad stuff in the comments. You can't,

1305
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,940
what's, if you're looking at
the comments for good things,

1306
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:04,830
it's just as bad as
looking for bad things.

1307
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:05,903
Yeah. I mean,

1308
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:10,410
some people think it's a good idea to
gauge like whether or not the conversation

1309
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:11,800
was effective or not.

1310
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:16,330
You could have done something better than
navigate it more efficiently or more.

1311
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,330
Um, more entertaining for the,

1312
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,130
make it more entertaining for
the people that are listening,

1313
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,880
looking for the constructive
criticism. Yeah.

1314
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,210
I mean there can be some
of that from some people.

1315
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:30,160
The problem is you're trying to
manage all this data at scale, right.

1316
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,270
You're dealing with thousands
and thousands of humans
that are charming in and a

1317
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:36,980
lot of them are deeply unhappy. Yeah.

1318
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,240
A lot of people that are commenting on
things that are just really frustrated

1319
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:40,931
with their lives.

1320
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:45,370
Like imagine if someone saw or
listened to you when you were like,

1321
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:49,070
fuck man. [inaudible] and they're
like, oh, that's who she is. Exactly.

1322
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,290
Then you see, they see you on here
laughing and being silly. Like,

1323
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,850
wait a minute. Who is this bitch?
Yeah. Like that doesn't make any sense.

1324
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:57,280
That's not the same person. Yeah.
Well, you're not the same person.

1325
01:14:57,281 --> 01:14:59,080
You're not the same person
who you were six months ago.

1326
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:02,870
I know we grow in. Yeah, I would
fully, yeah, I hope so. I mean, I do.

1327
01:15:02,871 --> 01:15:06,780
I tried to do a lot of work on
myself. Um, I stopped watching,

1328
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:11,900
watching this was huge for me. I was
watching a lot of true crime. Oh Jesus.

1329
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:14,540
I was watching like
dateline, stuff like that.

1330
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:18,470
All these things and I
mean that is fucking toxic.
People are obsessed with it.

1331
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,380
They're obsessed with it. And
I just started to realize,

1332
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,210
I know a friend of mine had,

1333
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:27,170
there was one about her sister and once
I saw that and I just realized like this

1334
01:15:27,171 --> 01:15:27,890
is not good.

1335
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:31,040
This is finding entertainment out of these
really real things that have happened

1336
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,830
to people in this pain and I have
had fucked up. Things happen.

1337
01:15:33,831 --> 01:15:36,140
I've had friends have fucked up,
things happen. I've seen these things.

1338
01:15:36,141 --> 01:15:39,200
I don't need to bring
awareness to this. I know that.

1339
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:43,280
And I'm not a women get
into those true crime shows.

1340
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,880
It's like traumatic and everything,
but it's not, it's, it's real.

1341
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,030
These are real things
that happened. Right?

1342
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,620
But is it because you want to know that
that's out there so you can prepare

1343
01:15:52,621 --> 01:15:54,540
yourself or so you can
be aware like what is,

1344
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,740
what is the appeal cause a
apparently c f find out this is true,

1345
01:15:58,741 --> 01:15:59,940
but I remember reading this,

1346
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:04,770
that true crime shows sort of
skew in their demographics, um,

1347
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,840
more female than male.

1348
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:09,990
Like the more females are into
true crime shows than male.

1349
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,760
Yeah, I dunno. I just, I think it's like
a beginning, middle and end to a story.

1350
01:16:13,761 --> 01:16:16,640
Like there's a whole plot line and then
they catch the person and the way the

1351
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:21,040
editing is, and they don't have
the interviews and well, for a lot,

1352
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,610
a lot of the episodes they will,

1353
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,950
sometimes they catch them before they
kill them and that's disappointing. But,

1354
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,330
um, it's just very

1355
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,410
young women are the biggest true
crime buffs. And here's why.

1356
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:36,690
If you're even remotely interested in
true crime story O in true crime, boy

1357
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,250
[inaudible] have the last couple
of years been good to you.

1358
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:45,570
First there was the mega hit podcast
serial, which launched October, 2014,

1359
01:16:45,571 --> 01:16:49,950
several months later, the HB HBO re
released the Genx six episode documentary,

1360
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,740
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, captivating. Um,

1361
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,800
as captivating as the programs
were for the general public,

1362
01:16:55,801 --> 01:17:00,180
one group in particular has become
particularly enthusiastic about the genre.

1363
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:02,400
Young women. Hmm.

1364
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:05,570
It's weird and a lot of the victims
are young women. It's like, well,

1365
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,900
I don't know what it is. Hmm.
I don't know what sort of,

1366
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,070
we'll get it. According
to Dr. Howard Foreman,

1367
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:15,300
a forensic psychiatrist at
Montefiore Medical Center,

1368
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:19,500
the trend is rooted in empathy.
By the time you get to adulthood,

1369
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:24,000
women are able to empathize with a
greater degree than men. On average.

1370
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:28,590
Foreman tells tech inside of this may
lead to true crime being more interesting

1371
01:17:28,591 --> 01:17:29,424
to women than men,

1372
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,870
simply because if you
empathize more with the victim,

1373
01:17:33,871 --> 01:17:36,570
it may be more relevant
to you and more gripping.

1374
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:40,550
Hmm. And then if you empathize with
the murderer or you're in some trouble.

1375
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:44,660
Yeah. Like, Oh, you did a good
job. It just was too, I don't know.

1376
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:48,110
It just got so dark and weird
and yeah, I had a guy in my,

1377
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,150
when I was living with my
ex boyfriend in this hood,

1378
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,920
in this a apartment building,

1379
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:56,360
there was this really weird kid who was
so overly familiar and just really weird

1380
01:17:56,361 --> 01:18:00,830
with me and I felt, I really
felt threatened by him.

1381
01:18:00,831 --> 01:18:03,680
I felt really uncomfortable with
him. I told the landlord, you know,

1382
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:07,640
my boyfriend was traveling a lot for
work and stuff, so I was alone a lot.

1383
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:12,230
I had a bat, he was like maybe
18. And he was young written by,

1384
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:16,970
he just was weird. He was off
Asperger's. He very weird, like very,

1385
01:18:16,971 --> 01:18:19,040
just the way he looked at me was weird.

1386
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,520
He overly complimented me
in an inappropriate way.
I would set up boundaries.

1387
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:23,720
He would keep coming. He tried to,

1388
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:27,510
I was bringing my laundry
up to my apartment and, um,

1389
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,710
my boyfriend was out of town and he,

1390
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:33,560
the kid lived at on a different
floor than me. And he goes, Oh,

1391
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:37,790
let me take your laundry. I go, no, no.
And he goes, Oh, let me take it. I go,

1392
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:42,620
no, I'm, I don't need your
help. Very clear. And then he,

1393
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:47,420
the door opens to the elevator. He
tries to take my laundry. I go, no.

1394
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,590
And then I get off the elevator and I
start walking and he starts following me

1395
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,440
and I go, you don't live on
this floor. And he goes, oh,

1396
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:56,510
sometimes I get off here and
walk up. I go, no you don't.

1397
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:57,770
You're not supposed to be on this floor.

1398
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,530
And then I pretended to go into someone
else's apartment cause I couldn't let

1399
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:02,690
him know where I lived. And then he left.

1400
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:06,330
So that's when I called Tate again
and he sat me up with Scott Epstein,

1401
01:19:06,331 --> 01:19:09,710
a 10th planet. And that's when I'd been
started doing Jujitsu. Cause I'm like,

1402
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:13,520
nobody's fucking with me anymore. There's
no, I can not control my surroundings.

1403
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:16,040
I cannot control that. All I
can do is control my ability.

1404
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:18,800
Same building, Ma. Jesus Christ. Yeah.

1405
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:20,240
That's the thing that
women have to deal with.

1406
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:25,100
And I have experienced it to a far lesser
degree with creepy dudes who want to

1407
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:26,240
follow me in hotels.

1408
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,910
Oh yeah, you have. I've seen people.
People are so weird with you. Yeah,

1409
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:33,160
it's weird. They want to follow
you in hotels though. Yeah. Look,

1410
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:37,900
guys follow me into the elevator and
want to come to my room like, hey, yeah,

1411
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:42,850
they want to watch you jerk off.
I'll do me. Please leave me alone.

1412
01:19:42,851 --> 01:19:45,190
Once I'm near them. They
just to stay close people.

1413
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:50,500
People come up to you and
they're so, I'm excited.

1414
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:53,560
This is their moment. They're,
they're shivering. They're shaking.

1415
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:54,580
I watch it all the time. It's,

1416
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,090
I told you I want to do a reaction
or they just should have our faces.

1417
01:19:58,091 --> 01:20:01,180
Your friends faces when people are
approaching you, we're just all like,

1418
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:05,320
oh my God. I mean they do it on a, a
smaller scale with other people too,

1419
01:20:05,321 --> 01:20:08,160
but I'm hitting you really have
it there. Unfolding a paper.

1420
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,080
They've always got something
they need to share with you.

1421
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:13,470
Like this is their big chance to tell
you whatever the thing is that they need

1422
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:15,720
to tell you. I mean, it
is really their moment.

1423
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,140
You're a part of people's biggest
moment of their life all day long.

1424
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,320
The biggest one is when
they have a business pitch,

1425
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,770
the most frustrated Sienna.
And I'm like, listen,

1426
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,950
we are not going into business together.
How do you know if you don't hear it?

1427
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:30,870
Cause I don't have time to
do what I'm doing already.

1428
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:34,500
And I have a friend party
selling fanny packs.

1429
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,450
I can't do more super busy with fanny
pack business higher primate.com so they

1430
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:40,284
brought your fanny pack.

1431
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:45,230
I died when you told me you sell
at Vandy packs out so funny.

1432
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:48,450
Every month I have to keep restocking.
I'm really king, I don't even get it.

1433
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:50,520
I sell a lot of fucking fanny packs.

1434
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:52,710
They sell like crazy but
they're really high quality.

1435
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,840
I was living out of my
car when you told me that.

1436
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,090
It's a company called roots from Canada.

1437
01:20:57,091 --> 01:21:00,420
They make them super high quality leather
and I just get them to print it with

1438
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,220
the high higher primate logo on them.

1439
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,730
But you know how I found out about this
company and they're excellent fanny

1440
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:10,100
packs that involve anal sex. No dice
clay. Oh my God guys. Clay. How to say,

1441
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:15,000
John. And I said, where did you get
that glorious fanny baggers? Like, oh,

1442
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:19,710
you like it. [inaudible] and uh,
he showed it to me and I said,

1443
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:22,800
this is fucking excellent. It's roots.
There's nothing in there, but you know,

1444
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:27,180
they're showing good. His keys.
Chapstick. Yeah, it's a CVD. Chopstick.

1445
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:32,550
[inaudible] that's the only one I
fuck with. I took some before I came,

1446
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:37,200
so I didn't freak the fuck out. Just to
help you. Oh, there's something in here.

1447
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,470
Okay. So rich show yourself ranch.

1448
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:43,890
I was living in my car next to
parking next to one of your cars.

1449
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:46,080
That's it right there.
See that roots fanny pack?

1450
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:47,730
That's where I learned
about it. Oh my God.

1451
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,800
Got The fucking beautiful fanny
pack. What makes yours yours?

1452
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,360
Well, I bought it from the roots company.

1453
01:21:54,361 --> 01:21:56,790
I had them produce them for me and
it's hard to see because it's Kinda,

1454
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,830
this is an older one. That's why
I've had this one for a few years.

1455
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,770
But there's the higher
primate logo that's in Boston.

1456
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:05,460
The M can you get one
that says Annie Fanny? No,

1457
01:22:05,461 --> 01:22:09,660
but you can make it gel. Bring it
somewhere. [inaudible] some money,

1458
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:15,480
some money to make my fanny bag
glitter on it. It's a, yeah,

1459
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,870
she'd do it like a craft thing. Like
that'd be fun. Should we have a cra? Yeah,

1460
01:22:18,871 --> 01:22:21,510
we'll do a little craft show
that's not hard to puffy paints.

1461
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:25,920
Just do it with glue. You paint it with
glue and then you sprinkles, you know,

1462
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:30,750
a glitter all over it. The glue will
stick to Glidden. Very glittery.

1463
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:34,050
Yeah. There you go. I don't think
so. I try very hard though, Dude.

1464
01:22:34,051 --> 01:22:34,980
That's a good look for you.

1465
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,580
I'm trying to Elton John and I watched
this video of Elton John Live all the

1466
01:22:38,581 --> 01:22:40,590
time at, what are you
showing me, Jamie guys?

1467
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:45,500
The trend of wearing them on up here.
Those people are cowards. No, no,

1468
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:49,500
no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. They are cowards.

1469
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,570
They don't want to wear
it as a fanny pack.

1470
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,170
So they wear it over their shoulder
because they're cowards and if a hot girl

1471
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:56,310
comes, it doesn't like fanny packs.

1472
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:59,580
They can throw their elbow into it
and pretend they're injured. No,

1473
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:03,480
that's not what they're doing. So sling.

1474
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,130
They're doing it because
they don't want, they want

1475
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,370
the functionality of a fanny pack,
but they don't want the social stigma.

1476
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,170
They're counting,

1477
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:13,800
well, it's a new, yeah, it's like
the Jaden Smith. Jaden, I don't know.

1478
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:16,050
It's like he would wear that
wedding. It's the younger,

1479
01:23:16,051 --> 01:23:17,340
this is the younger generation.

1480
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:20,100
They're re they've taken our fanny packs
and they've made them into something

1481
01:23:20,101 --> 01:23:20,550
else.

1482
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:25,140
Non-Binary maybe. What is it saying
at the bottom of that picture with

1483
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,380
any pack and see through
Iridescent Zip. Okay. Fuck.

1484
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:35,410
Don't have a see-through bag, by the
way. Nobody wants to see your tampons.

1485
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,960
Hers maybe. I don't know. You never
know what these young boys, these days,

1486
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:44,080
they're very woke.
Whoa, they're so polite.

1487
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,650
But there's all these women that
want to get choked by bigfoot. So

1488
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:52,680
I was reading this thing about Yale and
that Yale put tampons in the men's room

1489
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:57,700
because they said, not
everyone who menstruates is
a woman. And I'm like, yeah,

1490
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,400
yes they are. I thought maybe
they worked for diarrhea. Yes.

1491
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:05,960
Everyone who bends straight
is a woman. Scientifically,

1492
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:11,810
we're getting [inaudible] women right
now. Can you tell them wacky? Yeah, it is.

1493
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:15,440
It is a weird thing that's happening.
Oh my, Oh, anyone. Whatever they want.

1494
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:18,740
It's just a weird, yeah, I will too.
I have no problem. I wa I would,

1495
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:23,240
I would love to make you happy. It's
as long as it doesn't, it's so wacky.

1496
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:27,470
We'll Chappelle said that thing on
his special where he said, uh, um,

1497
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:31,400
to what degree do I have to
partake in your self esteem?

1498
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,400
Right. That's a good way of looking
at it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's,

1499
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,490
but it's not just that,
it's, it's an enforcement.

1500
01:24:38,491 --> 01:24:43,491
There's like an authoritarian enforcement
of certain language and certain ways

1501
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:46,160
of communicating with people. You know,

1502
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:51,170
there is a Goddamn hilarious thing
that Tim Poole posted up of a communist

1503
01:24:51,331 --> 01:24:56,331
meeting where this woman is calling
everyone comrades and this guy is like,

1504
01:24:56,401 --> 01:25:00,360
it could everyone please stop moving
because could you guys please stop moving

1505
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:05,361
because I have severe ADHD and all
this moving is really distracting me.

1506
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:09,000
And the woman goes, all right,
thank you comrade. Duly noted.

1507
01:25:09,001 --> 01:25:13,020
And then the guy goes, please, can
you stop using gendered language?

1508
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,070
When you say that,

1509
01:25:14,071 --> 01:25:18,810
in my view it's very
offensive and like it is woke.

1510
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:19,340
God,

1511
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:23,190
this is what I was saying before about
how it's like if you're expecting the

1512
01:25:23,191 --> 01:25:27,600
world to accommodate to you, like your
safe spaces inside yourself, you fall,

1513
01:25:27,601 --> 01:25:30,060
it's inside you. You don't have
control of the outside world.

1514
01:25:30,061 --> 01:25:33,420
This is people trying to control the
language of everyone around them and then

1515
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:36,420
saying it's unsafe. If they
don't follow your new vocabulary,

1516
01:25:36,421 --> 01:25:40,010
that's an unfair thing to find
it and you're unfulfilled.

1517
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:44,880
I'm looking an Asian lady and he said,
this can't be real. I'm going to find it.

1518
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,010
It's like two days ago he put it me,

1519
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:51,160
Sam Harris reminded me of it as we
were fucking howling laughing about it.

1520
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:53,500
It's just done. It's like parody.

1521
01:25:53,501 --> 01:25:56,470
It's like the onion is
not ridiculous enough.

1522
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,460
Like these people are more ridiculous
than the most ridiculous parody.

1523
01:26:00,461 --> 01:26:01,990
Like you can even mock it,

1524
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,190
but do you think that
it is them trying to see

1525
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,340
what they can get away with? Yes.
They're a little kid. How far can I go?

1526
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:10,610
They're playing, make believe they're
there. I'm, I'm a chicken. You know,

1527
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:13,850
I'm someone who is, someone said this
to me, I can't remember what it was,

1528
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:16,790
but that all of the words,

1529
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:20,110
the keywords that people are using
now like triggered safe spaces,

1530
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,710
they're autistic terms,

1531
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:26,780
they're terms that people use with
autistic children here. This play this.

1532
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:29,180
If we want to defeat capitalism,

1533
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:33,260
we are going to need a party that will
organize working people to fight for the

1534
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:37,460
demands that we want and to win
socialism. Thank you so much. Great.

1535
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:41,380
Yeah, it's quite a privilege. Quick
credit, personal privilege guys.

1536
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:45,580
First of all, James Jackson's
Sacramento, he him. I just want to say,

1537
01:26:45,581 --> 01:26:48,610
can we please keep the chatter to a
minimum? I'm one of the people who's very,

1538
01:26:48,611 --> 01:26:50,590
very prone to sensory overload.

1539
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,420
There's a lot of whispering
and chatter going on.

1540
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:55,840
It's making it very difficult
for me to focus. I know it's,

1541
01:26:55,841 --> 01:26:57,340
we're all fresh and ready to go by.

1542
01:26:57,341 --> 01:26:59,050
Can we please just keep
the chatter to a minimum?

1543
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:00,880
It's affecting my ability
to focus. Thank you.

1544
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:04,830
Thank you, comrade. What is this?
Okay. Is there a speaker against name,

1545
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,930
Chapter Pronouns? Point of
personal privilege? Yes.

1546
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:13,130
Please do not use gendered
language to, to address everyone.

1547
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:19,050
Okay, what did you a red
headed monster. Where is he?

1548
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:24,090
Right in the lower right hand corner
with the Halter top whatever tank top

1549
01:27:24,091 --> 01:27:27,420
thing. See that? That would the
redhead red hair crazy right here.

1550
01:27:27,421 --> 01:27:31,220
That's the one that jumped up.
That's the he him. She her red.

1551
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,540
So he's wearing that red.
So when he gets his period,

1552
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:39,220
do not use gendered language. This is,

1553
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:40,680
this is where we're at. We're at,

1554
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:43,890
we're in nonsense land and people
are acting like this is normal.

1555
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:47,430
You're a bunch of babies. What are
you give a fuck if someone says, guys,

1556
01:27:47,431 --> 01:27:50,220
who cares? The Bible said about saying
girls say girls, I could be there.

1557
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:52,770
Say Girls, I don't care.
This is your, you're crazy.

1558
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:57,540
Please do not use gendered language.
What? How does that change anything?

1559
01:27:58,290 --> 01:27:59,760
And by the way, you can,

1560
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:03,270
if you can't deal with a bunch of people
moving around and distract and making

1561
01:28:03,271 --> 01:28:06,780
noises and shit, just stop.
Get the fuck out of there.

1562
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:11,160
You guys force everybody else to deal
with your fucking weak mind. Go home.

1563
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:16,320
Just watch this on youtube. Eat a steak,
do some squats, steak, eat some elk,

1564
01:28:16,321 --> 01:28:21,210
get your fucking life in Norfolk.
Pipsqueak go fuck a Goddamn bigfoot.

1565
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:25,590
Go right a big foot fuck book and make
millions. What is this seminar about?

1566
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:29,160
About being an asshole?
Communism. Socialism.

1567
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,080
So it's like playing on this
thing to where it's like,

1568
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:33,390
I want people to feel good.
I was a special ed teacher.

1569
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,224
I've done all these things.

1570
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:36,720
Special Ed kids wouldn't
have been talking like this,

1571
01:28:36,721 --> 01:28:40,830
asking for all these things and thought
this is what the with these kids are

1572
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:43,770
calling socialism, right?
Like this is what I mean.

1573
01:28:43,771 --> 01:28:45,810
Everyone has to be like super,

1574
01:28:45,811 --> 01:28:49,200
super sensitive and aware of every
single fucking thing they do.

1575
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:51,840
And every single fucking thing
that everybody around them does.

1576
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:53,310
Everybody seems to comply.

1577
01:28:53,311 --> 01:28:56,580
And it makes you a victim too because
it's impossible for that to happen.

1578
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,040
So no one's ever going to
comply to everything you say.

1579
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:01,710
There's always going to be one person,
even if they don't even, they want to.

1580
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:04,230
Maybe they were listening to something
else and they didn't know that that's

1581
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:07,200
what they were supposed to do or whatever.
So then there's always going to be,

1582
01:29:07,201 --> 01:29:08,820
you're always gonna be
a victim of something.

1583
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:11,310
Someone's always said the wrong thing.
They've always done the wrong thing.

1584
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:15,420
And all of your worth is from something
outside of yourself and you now don't

1585
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:18,150
have to deal with your own. It ramps up.

1586
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:22,140
What used to be acceptable year ago
now is unacceptable. A year from now,

1587
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,650
it'll be something else. After a while,
you won't even be able to say colored.

1588
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:27,420
You're going to have to say
the C-word, right? Yeah.

1589
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:31,040
You have to say you can't say
people of Color, which is PSE.

1590
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:34,080
Just that people of color.
That is a weird one. Yeah.

1591
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,890
Like the NCAA or um, NAACP,

1592
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:41,130
brother National Association for
the advancement of Colored People,

1593
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:45,990
which is bananas. Like you can't say
that. You can't even say that anymore.

1594
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,600
It's like so dumb. It's a
jewelry thing. And also people,

1595
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:53,430
I feel like if people stopped having
attachment towards you could stop having

1596
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:55,800
them mean anything. Like
they wouldn't hurt you.

1597
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:00,240
While the winter news talked about that
in the 60s it was one of his bits in the

1598
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:04,410
60s he would, he would call people by
a bunch of ethnic slurs and then say,

1599
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,741
you know,

1600
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:08,640
the problem with not saying these words
is that if you say these words enough

1601
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:11,550
time, they lose all their meaning and
there's not going to hurt some feelings.

1602
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:15,190
I'm paraphrasing, but this is
the opposite and you know what?

1603
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:19,920
This is nothing. They turn him
into a woman and Ms. May is a,

1604
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:25,170
Oh they rerouted that. They rebooted
him. I've watched a little bit.

1605
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:25,741
I think it's good.

1606
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:30,030
I haven't watched 'em but it is
Marshall that Mrs Maizel has him. Yeah,

1607
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,820
she's the mother audition for that. And
then when I saw her tits in the front,

1608
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:36,890
I'm like my tits audition for her. Ted's,
that's like amazing show, you know.

1609
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:40,590
But in the first scene she showed her
tits. I was like, all right, thank you.

1610
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:43,710
Thank you for getting me that audition.
I don't understand what you're saying.

1611
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:47,130
She showed her tits in the first scene
and I didn't realize that that was going

1612
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:50,220
to be in the scene. They didn't
make me go topless or whatever,

1613
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:54,930
but I was honored to have been
in the same audition pool is,

1614
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,710
oh, okay. This is Rachel Brosnahan
juice. Sheila's great. She looks great.

1615
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,550
She's got it. She's a great
actress. She is hilarious.

1616
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:06,150
But I was talking to a male comic. It
was really funny and he was like, ah,

1617
01:31:06,151 --> 01:31:09,180
I don't like that fucking show. Because
there was no woman like that back then.

1618
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:11,730
Yeah. There was no superman either, man.

1619
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:13,920
Like with the [inaudible] talk
about there's no walking dead.

1620
01:31:13,921 --> 01:31:16,890
Rick didn't kill any zombies.
Guess what? It's all fake. Yeah,

1621
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:22,110
he's a really freak you out. There was
a woman comic like they're about comedy.

1622
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,330
So funny show about comedy.

1623
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,410
You should be excited that there's a show
about standup comedy in the 1950s and

1624
01:31:28,411 --> 01:31:33,150
sixties it's fucking great. Like so what
do you care if they made up a woman?

1625
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:37,290
Like why? Well, they're not
getting represented. The white men.

1626
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:42,010
It's not even that. It's like, it's
like a historical thing. Yeah, it would.

1627
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:44,700
[inaudible] was bothering
him historically. They are,

1628
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:46,740
they are intersecting with
real things that happened,

1629
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:48,300
so I can see where
that's a little annoying.

1630
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:51,090
I don't wanna bring up Elton John Again,
but I did see rocket man in it. It is.

1631
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,420
It was weird when they were not, if
there are things that happened in your,

1632
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,970
why do you say bring up
Elton John Again? Yeah.

1633
01:31:56,971 --> 01:31:58,920
You just didn't even bring him up earlier.

1634
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,480
I've just been talking about him
the whole time. Did she know,

1635
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,940
I listen to Elton John
a lot. Did you? Yeah,

1636
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:07,060
I watched this one live video of him a
lot. I don't think you said they were,

1637
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,810
it did. Did you? Yeah,
I forgot. That's okay.

1638
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:15,730
I can only be expected to be
listened to 20% of the time.

1639
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:20,260
What was wrong with rocket mare? Well,
it's just, he didn't write the lyrics,

1640
01:32:20,261 --> 01:32:21,041
which they said,

1641
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:25,240
but then the whole movie was like trying
to force these life events into the

1642
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:30,130
lyrics. So it was like, but he didn't
write it so he didn't write it.

1643
01:32:30,131 --> 01:32:32,170
So it just wasn't, it didn't feel real.

1644
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:35,350
I would have rather have heard more shit
about when he married that woman and

1645
01:32:35,351 --> 01:32:38,740
stuff. You know, married a woman.
Yeah. He married a woman. Whoa. Yeah.

1646
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:41,890
How frustrated was she? She
must've been a really horny,

1647
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:46,090
just sliding around in there. Just
probably didn't know. She's probably rich,

1648
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:50,470
but I think, I think probably maybe it
was just a beard situation. She knows.

1649
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:53,690
But also it's got gotta be a
lot of those pos long drives.

1650
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:56,770
I want to believe that they
can be straight. You know?

1651
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:59,200
That's why they buy the
Whitney Cummings Dick Doll.

1652
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:04,480
But that's where like that all pray
the gay away stuff is, Oh yeah.

1653
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:05,021
You ever heard of those?

1654
01:33:05,021 --> 01:33:08,860
Pray the gay away camps guys are
sitting around holding men with boners.

1655
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:12,830
They really get hard ons holding you
and telling you you're not gay. Yeah.

1656
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:16,660
What the fuck's going on back down?
It's fucking crazy. It's like,

1657
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:20,230
it's so wild to not be like, just lean
into what you are, your happiness,

1658
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:23,890
your joy and yeah, but think
about yourself. You were
raised a Quaker would've.

1659
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:27,540
If you raise some wildly, you've
been told that [inaudible],

1660
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:32,350
you know anybody who does that is Satan
worshiper and you're going to go burn in

1661
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:35,800
hell and you live with all this
guilt and sin feeling like that.

1662
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:37,810
Shame that you're rotten
or whatever. I mean,

1663
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:40,990
I definitely have my own shame and I
know probably everyone carries some with

1664
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:43,540
them. I can't imagine on
that scale. That sucks.

1665
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:47,140
That is probably one of the biggest
ones. If you're raised Christian though,

1666
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:51,130
if you're raised like serious
Christian, especially fundamental,

1667
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:57,940
it's one of the worst sins to lay with
another man and just dealing with it.

1668
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,890
The deck that they must
get at those camps.

1669
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:03,790
I mean they must just be
pounding each other out.

1670
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:05,880
They probably come so quick cause
you can't believe they're actually,

1671
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:06,813
they're just like,

1672
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:11,110
and then they have that comradery in the
fact that they both are trying to not

1673
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:14,650
be this thing. Oh my God, I'm getting
horny just talking about it. Honestly,

1674
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:19,360
I have a new genre. It's not big foot.
We have to, we have to work through this.

1675
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:23,170
I mean, I'm not getting, you're not gay,
even though we're just fucked. I know.

1676
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:26,680
Just crying in each other's
gay arms. What a sneaky trick.

1677
01:34:26,681 --> 01:34:29,680
If you believe in God that
God did, God said, listen,

1678
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,540
you cannot have sex with men,

1679
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:34,210
but you're gonna want and you're
nothing really gonna want it.

1680
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,000
They're going to want that all
day. You're going to see them all.

1681
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,700
Your mostly assholes
all day more than food.

1682
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:43,650
You want them more than water and
you just want to Duke and bought,

1683
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:48,650
do deck bought, ah, firemen and fo

1684
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:52,690
Indians and cowboys,

1685
01:34:52,691 --> 01:34:55,210
and then a band's going to come
out and they're all going to play.

1686
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:58,330
It's each part and you're going
to have to try knock some damn,

1687
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:02,760
and then you can't even go
to the YMC anymore. I mean,

1688
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,900
if you really believe in Jesus and you
really believe that you shouldn't be gay,

1689
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:10,640
but you are a gay, what a dirty
trick God is. It must be terrible.

1690
01:35:10,641 --> 01:35:13,580
I just feel like there's nothing
more dangerous than we're oppressed.

1691
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,730
That's gotta be aware of
cancer, not just homosexuality,

1692
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:20,720
but repressing any sort of feelings
like that. It's gotta be what cancer is.

1693
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:25,010
Will repress sexualities. Always
strange. Like when I was in high school,

1694
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:28,850
there was always these girls from Catholic
school and girls from Catholic school

1695
01:35:28,851 --> 01:35:33,120
that went to all girls, Catholic
schools with the biggest homes, county.

1696
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:36,440
They couldn't wait to get some
deck because it was so forbidden.

1697
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,700
It was a forbidden fruit.

1698
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:40,340
They just would get so excited and
they couldn't believe it was real.

1699
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,020
Just fighting off these hormones.

1700
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:47,030
It just has such a terrible trick to
play on a young person to tell them that

1701
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:51,650
their body is dirty and awful and that
these thoughts that are just prevalent,

1702
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:56,860
omnipresent in their mind or their wicked
ways of the devil and that which you

1703
01:35:57,111 --> 01:35:59,960
resist persists. You know?

1704
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:03,920
You're just thinking about
that fucking bud hole all day.

1705
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:08,660
Fucking suck in a deck, fat, juicy
hog. He just can't have it. Yeah,

1706
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:13,430
I mean it's terrible. It's really bad.
You guys. Also, if you're out there,

1707
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:18,170
listen, let's just say, let's
God, let God give you a hall pass.

1708
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:21,230
Go fucking asshole. Go
fucking asshole. Go second.

1709
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:24,650
Just move to boys town and realize
like you're going to be fine.

1710
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:28,100
There's a group of them, they get
together and they have a great old time.

1711
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:32,690
There's a parade. They're so
happy if you go down that street

1712
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:37,040
[inaudible] so happy
free. They don't even,

1713
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:40,670
their shoulders are exposed like
there's just a tank tops everywhere.

1714
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:44,330
Just hair shaved. Anything
you want. Just every time.

1715
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,850
I love going. I feel invisible. It's
amazing your level. I could just walk,

1716
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:50,420
I could walk bottomless
and they would just,

1717
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,350
I've talked to gay guys or they get
mad that straight guys are and straight

1718
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:58,340
girls are going to gay clubs now to
hang out that it's like a weird thing.

1719
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:04,970
Talk to Martindale. Well, I could
see where you'd be like, Hey,

1720
01:37:04,971 --> 01:37:08,060
this was like our place to
fuck and now you're here.

1721
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:11,480
Like you're wearing glitter.
Yeah. Get the fuck away. Rainbows.

1722
01:37:11,481 --> 01:37:16,160
Member Demitri Martin had that joke
about where he's like, um, gays just get,

1723
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:20,030
I can't, I'm paraphrasing, but gays
just get rainbows. That's not fair.

1724
01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:23,390
You just get fractured light, like
greedy, greedy gaze. I mean this is what,

1725
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:24,800
back in the day when you
could say stuff like that,

1726
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:30,710
that was pretty similar about that they
w there was because of duck dynasty,

1727
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:33,680
one of the guys from duck dynasty
was given, I don't get it,

1728
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,320
I don't understand why g
and my bit was like, listen,

1729
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:40,340
you should shut the fuck up or the game
people will take over Cammo the same way

1730
01:37:40,341 --> 01:37:44,090
they took the rainbow. That's
so funny. They own the rainbow.

1731
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:48,200
The rainbow used to be leprechauns used
to be lucky charms guy who now is gay

1732
01:37:48,201 --> 01:37:51,580
people to the point where if I came on
stage with a fucking rainbow tee shirt on

1733
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:55,560
and people would be like, I know I knew
it. We've been waiting for this moment.

1734
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:59,460
Fucking knew it. But um,
the idea was that if a,

1735
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:04,490
like what all the gay cop guys would
have to do is start every gay porn in a

1736
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:08,470
duck blind. Oh my God. Every
gay porn would start with that.

1737
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:13,410
So they're wearing cammo and the duck
hunting and then someone would come in,

1738
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:17,170
a black eye would come in and go,
somebody [inaudible] make me home.

1739
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:22,110
That like duck whistle thing. Oh my
God. My friend worked on my friend Mike,

1740
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:24,870
who I stayed with worked on duck
dynasty. So he knows all those guys.

1741
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:25,590
And what'd he say?

1742
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:28,110
That seemed like a trip or the bud
fucking all the time when no one,

1743
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:31,170
I don't think so. But you know,

1744
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:35,570
it is funny when you take just a family
and then you make them stars and then

1745
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:39,600
you know the cross between
reality and yeah, all that stuff.

1746
01:38:39,601 --> 01:38:42,780
And then they go crazy and then they
all of a sudden they're on their own and

1747
01:38:42,781 --> 01:38:46,000
they get interviewed and then they say
something really crazy. Trinity Man.

1748
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,410
Hello? Not, yeah, some TMZ guy
puts a camera in their face. Yeah.

1749
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,490
Are they still doing that show? I
don't think so. How could they stop?

1750
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,970
It seems like it was just printing money.
Yeah. I wonder, I mean maybe they are.

1751
01:38:56,971 --> 01:38:59,670
I know my friend doesn't work
for them anymore, but yeah,

1752
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:01,320
you ain't still doing duck dynasty.

1753
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:04,930
I don't think so.

1754
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:06,400
Yeah, I don't,

1755
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,160
I give him the credit for duck
dynasty whether he wants it or not.

1756
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:13,660
I don't know how that show
final episode, March 29th,

1757
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:16,360
2017 how does that show end ever?

1758
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,540
It feels like a smart producer
should step in and go, hey guys,

1759
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:22,360
it's been a couple of years.
I'm on a lot of wacky stories.

1760
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:26,950
Falls asleep with a cigarette in their
mouth. I don't know. It's gone. Yeah.

1761
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:31,660
All that Cammo gone.
It's just, it's weird.

1762
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:35,650
I mean if you watch that show it's like
there's nothing compelling about it at

1763
01:39:35,651 --> 01:39:40,570
all. But it was an enormous hit. Yeah.
Just a bunch of people doing duck stuff.

1764
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:43,240
There is something about reality
TV that where you're just like,

1765
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:46,900
it's so thoughtless. You just don't have,

1766
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:50,400
you're just being taken on this
dumb dumb ride. There's like this.

1767
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:55,000
It's just there's nothing happening.
It's like, all right. Yeah.

1768
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:58,620
Next thing you know you're watching
people dissect a storage container. Yeah.

1769
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:01,780
But you know what I'd really
like is survivor. That one.

1770
01:40:01,781 --> 01:40:06,460
I still like survivors still like
survivor I think is the number one reality

1771
01:40:06,461 --> 01:40:08,620
show cause it's making people,

1772
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:13,810
it's taking away all of their comforts
and they still have to communicate with

1773
01:40:13,811 --> 01:40:18,700
each other like games with each
other. They have to, they're starving.

1774
01:40:18,701 --> 01:40:20,620
They have to do these
physical, it's still,

1775
01:40:20,621 --> 01:40:23,850
you're watching people be like tested
and put, what season is that on?

1776
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:27,280
Oh my God, it's, there's so many
seasons. Like season 1 million.

1777
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:29,290
I've seen all of them.
It's so good. I don't,

1778
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,960
I don't pay attention to them fully
so I can rewatch them at some point.

1779
01:40:31,961 --> 01:40:36,490
I've watched them a couple of times. That
show was on before fear factor. So I,

1780
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:41,520
we started fear factor in 2001 so that
show was probably on in 2019 years later.

1781
01:40:43,331 --> 01:40:47,380
It's in the thirties now. 30 seasons
or something. 33rd yeah. Yeah.

1782
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:50,530
I'm embarrassed. I don't know cause
that's how much it was still a hit. Yeah.

1783
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:53,800
It's amazing. Listen, people either
are on to or they're not yet.

1784
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:57,100
Well, they've actually done 38
episodes or seasons somehow it says,

1785
01:40:57,101 --> 01:41:01,620
but this is the 30th. Yeah,
they do several a year now.
Is it still Jeff probe?

1786
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:05,530
It's still Jeff probes. He's still
the host. It's still under the radar.

1787
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:09,280
Like Jeff probes. Just like catch
those checks and stays home. Yeah,

1788
01:41:09,281 --> 01:41:11,410
but here's the deal. I've
seen him driving around.

1789
01:41:11,411 --> 01:41:14,410
He had his little summer for
Dora. He was riding in his Prius.

1790
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:17,200
I was like drugs ics. This
was like three years ago.

1791
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:20,230
I saw him driving around stockpile
and all the cheese. Yeah.

1792
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:22,270
Maybe he's rich dad. Poor Dad. No,

1793
01:41:22,271 --> 01:41:24,850
I mean he must have all his
money just stocked away.

1794
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:29,770
He's driving around in a Prius. He's the,
he's, I love the show. Maybe no good.

1795
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:33,400
They could take this away from him
at any moment. Somebody replaced him.

1796
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:36,220
Would you notice this part of the show?

1797
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:40,210
I think people would be upset. There'd
would be upset. What would be upset?

1798
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,960
I think people would be very upset.
I think they'd be extra upset.

1799
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:47,800
But if Adam Carolla took a spot,
um, they would get canceled.

1800
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:52,870
People be like Trump now, is he
a Trump supporter? I think so.

1801
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:56,500
I think so, but I don't know for
listen, I don't know for sure.

1802
01:41:56,501 --> 01:41:59,050
I don't want to call anyone
anything. I think he's conservative.

1803
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:00,700
I think he is a Trump supporter though.

1804
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:04,390
Some people get conservative when they
start making money though. I listen,

1805
01:42:04,391 --> 01:42:07,360
I everyone has the right to be whatever
the fuck they are. Or you think?

1806
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:12,670
I think so. What about Nazis? They have
the more of a right. A third, right?

1807
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,520
I don't think that's right.
Something that's a different word.

1808
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,970
What does that even mean? What
does Third Reich? I don't know.

1809
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:24,590
I don't even literally don't. I mean
I've know what the Third Reich is,

1810
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:28,790
but I don't even know what
it means to you. Guess.

1811
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:33,380
I've literally have no idea what that
means. I know it means the Nazis, right?

1812
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:37,970
There's like, but what does it mean in
German? But isn't that a funny thing?

1813
01:42:37,971 --> 01:42:41,170
Like that's like Third Reich is
like everyone knows not that,

1814
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,480
but no one knows what the fuck
that means. Atomology yeah,

1815
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:46,790
you with the big words. I know a few.

1816
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:51,110
What does it mean third regime
or empire or third realm?

1817
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:57,020
Huh. So the third version of the
Nazi party was the holy Roman Empire,

1818
01:42:57,021 --> 01:42:58,370
which lasted until 1806.

1819
01:42:58,371 --> 01:43:02,600
The second would be 1871 to
1918 and this was the third.

1820
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:04,610
Interesting. So they were just,

1821
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:09,200
they were considering themselves to
be the third rulers of the world,

1822
01:43:09,201 --> 01:43:13,220
like the Romans. Interesting.
Yeah. What a mess in the past.

1823
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:14,740
The thing is that that was not that long.

1824
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:18,390
It was not that long ago. It
was not that long ago at all.

1825
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:23,560
If you're see the video of Hitler
tweaking at the 1936 Olympics tweak like

1826
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:28,940
speed, he was on serious speed.
We were um, um, with Brian Moses,

1827
01:43:28,941 --> 01:43:33,410
Brian Moses was saying that Hitler was
into bull semen and I was like, what?

1828
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,540
He's like, yeah. And then
we found out that Taurine,

1829
01:43:35,541 --> 01:43:39,390
which is in a red bull
actually is from bull semen.

1830
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:45,320
That's why like red bull do this.
That's Hitler tweaking. Oh my God,

1831
01:43:45,321 --> 01:43:48,500
look at him. Go straight up
tweaking at the Olympics.

1832
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:51,980
So he was on all kinds of
crazy speed. And then we read

1833
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,820
this thing about how he was like
incredibly fatigued and almost dying.

1834
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,290
And He, um,

1835
01:43:57,350 --> 01:44:02,350
got injected with testosterone and cocaine
and [inaudible] and then went in and

1836
01:44:05,901 --> 01:44:08,840
talked Mussolini out of leaving the war.

1837
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,360
Cause Mussolini wanted to get
the fuck out of World War II.

1838
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:15,600
And Hitler went and just talked at him
for five hours, just raw. They were

1839
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:22,420
all coked up and oxycodone doubt
bull come dripping down his throat.

1840
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:26,720
Oh my God. How did he get, how did he
extract the bull? Come, I don't know.

1841
01:44:26,721 --> 01:44:31,010
But bull semen apparently has this taurine
stuff in it and they extract taurine

1842
01:44:31,011 --> 01:44:36,011
from some other method to make the
torrents and the guys at the gay pride,

1843
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:40,010
the gay away camp to that's there
to take your job from the tap.

1844
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:44,600
They're extracting his dick. You
deserve all that. Well, do you remember,

1845
01:44:44,601 --> 01:44:47,960
I was thinking about that
horse and zoo, the documentary.

1846
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:51,440
That documentary is amazing.
That video of the, Whoa,

1847
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:55,310
I'm so trying and the part that I'm
traumatized by is not the fucking part.

1848
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:58,910
Okay. And do you remember this scene?
Okay. So he gets up on the bucket, right.

1849
01:44:59,180 --> 01:44:59,721
And then you know,

1850
01:44:59,721 --> 01:45:03,080
they need like several people to grab
this giant Horse Cock and put in his ass.

1851
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:07,700
And then the horse rams them
only once and then he goes,

1852
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:11,000
this is the part that got me.
Yes. He looks back and he goes,

1853
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:15,800
did he come like he was so concerned if
the horse came, I was like, oh my God.

1854
01:45:16,350 --> 01:45:17,790
Yeah. And the guy made a noise like

1855
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:23,580
noise where you're dying because you
fought. He was, he died so soon after.

1856
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:27,560
And then his friend
goes too much. Too much.

1857
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:30,560
Like did you get too much worse? Got
Too much. Of course. Like, and he did.

1858
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,590
He died. If you look at the math,
the size of a Horse, Dick, oh,

1859
01:45:33,591 --> 01:45:37,140
I have a body cavity. It's
like, where's it going? Yeah.

1860
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:41,600
What's getting out of the way to
make room for that Dick? Oh boy.

1861
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:44,930
They dropped him off at the, at
the hospital. They rolled him out.

1862
01:45:44,931 --> 01:45:47,810
He was bleeding. He bled out. He
had bled out from his asshole.

1863
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:52,100
And that's how it happened. I don't think
he did. You don't think he was like,

1864
01:45:52,101 --> 01:45:54,920
maybe this was where the hell
did you. If the horse had come,

1865
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:56,690
do you think you would have been worth
it? He would've thought it was worth it,

1866
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:59,210
but do you know that this whole thing,

1867
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:03,110
they had hundreds and hundreds of hours
of footage of him getting fucked by

1868
01:46:03,111 --> 01:46:07,070
donkeys and horses and a bunch of other
people that these people had met online

1869
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:10,270
and the zoophilia right is the,

1870
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:15,290
the medical terminology for someone who
is sexually attracted to farm animals

1871
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,450
and so or animals period.

1872
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:21,920
And so these people all met online in
some chat room and then decided to get

1873
01:46:21,921 --> 01:46:25,610
together in Washington state where
it was still legal to fuck animals.

1874
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:28,760
There's like only a few states where
it's okay. So funny that you had,

1875
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:32,510
there has to be a law. Yeah. There
has to be a lot of tape. So happy.

1876
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:34,190
That's not what you're
into. I'm just like,

1877
01:46:34,191 --> 01:46:37,400
I just wake up so grateful and
blessed. I go, thank God. Right.

1878
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:41,600
Could you imagine if that was
your, your oh trick God, thank you.

1879
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:42,890
You can't control that, right?

1880
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:44,690
If he gets something like
some people are in the feet,

1881
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:48,200
some people are in the getting fucked
with hours. I was segwaying into feet,

1882
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:52,320
huh? Yes. People are in
the fee. Have you heard?

1883
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,630
I've heard they're in the
fee. I can't believe it. Well,

1884
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:59,370
I was reading up on it that it's the
part of the brain that handles your

1885
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:03,210
genitals and your feet are
right next to their adjacent.

1886
01:47:03,211 --> 01:47:06,660
So sometimes the why they think
that the wires get crossed because,

1887
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:11,661
and the guy that studied it was a guy who
studied a phantom limb syndrome and he

1888
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:15,600
was so he was falling when these people's
brains where they would feel that they

1889
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:18,120
still had a foot or whatever
and some guys would get horny,

1890
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:21,910
it would get their brain. So
it was just like crossed, Huh?

1891
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,970
We get horny thinking
of their own, not foot.

1892
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:28,180
It's hilarious how you pixelate
your feet and all those pictures,

1893
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,280
how they get started.
They just, people were,

1894
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:36,930
they started a Wiki fee account for me.
I just didn't know my feet were a thing.

1895
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:40,920
I just didn't know. I thought I was
just walking around and you know,

1896
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:43,220
in slides didn't know I was
walking around him as well.

1897
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:44,310
Just have been bottomless.

1898
01:47:44,311 --> 01:47:47,700
I may as well have just been wearing
like Pajama bottoms with the ass flap

1899
01:47:47,701 --> 01:47:49,920
backwards open. Just put, I mean,

1900
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:54,420
my little feet pussy is just
walking around. So then, um,

1901
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:55,230
once people,

1902
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:58,620
I noticed the Wiki feed thing and then
people were damning me all the time to

1903
01:47:58,621 --> 01:48:02,520
see my feet and I just was like, you
don't get this was pixelated them

1904
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:07,380
[inaudible] Whitney shares dms with us
sometimes. So it's funny. Group chat,

1905
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:08,303
I'm in with

1906
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,850
the Nick Swardson Bristolian Whitney
and she'll post pictures of her dms.

1907
01:48:11,850 --> 01:48:15,000
It's like, what in the
fuck? Yeah, they're wild.

1908
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:20,430
I do a thing on my podcast and on my
live stream some times where I sage my

1909
01:48:20,431 --> 01:48:24,450
pussy at the end of the night.
So I get sage and I just, yeah,

1910
01:48:24,451 --> 01:48:27,480
I just to break the, the negative
Dick Cores that were sent to me,

1911
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,450
the unwanted Dick Cords from
all these dudes, I'm like, Yo,

1912
01:48:30,451 --> 01:48:34,020
put your Dick cords away. Right.
But you know, people are pervs.

1913
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:35,940
What are you going to do?
I just make fun of them,

1914
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:40,560
but it's more guys that are pervs and
girls that are pervs with stuff like feet

1915
01:48:40,561 --> 01:48:44,310
and stat. I think they're a thing that
girls are into. That's kind of gross.

1916
01:48:44,311 --> 01:48:48,480
The money. It's so gross.
But that makes sense.

1917
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:50,850
Like money can keep you like your job.

1918
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,220
Some people are into like the money fat
guy. Some people are into, I don't know,

1919
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:57,360
people are into all different
things but, but not in the same way.

1920
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:58,980
Like not the same. You're
right. It's not the same.

1921
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,900
Some guys are in effect girls too,

1922
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:05,490
but there's a big difference between
that and feet. Men are just very gross.

1923
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:09,900
You're gross, but it's biologically
your dicks or just your just ruled beer.

1924
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,650
Dick's are just dragging you through
the world and it's just gotta be

1925
01:49:13,651 --> 01:49:16,980
acknowledged. We can't pretend this isn't
a thing just dragging you. It's just,

1926
01:49:16,981 --> 01:49:20,190
that's not, we're like breastfeeding and
shit. We're thinking about other shit.

1927
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:24,200
In the archery, there's a term
called front of center, meaning, um,

1928
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:29,100
how much weight is in the front of the
Arrow had th determines like how much

1929
01:49:29,101 --> 01:49:32,360
penetration the Arrow will have on
an animal. I'm getting so horny.

1930
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,890
This is so weird. What
are you talking about?

1931
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:35,640
It's like the same thing with dicks.

1932
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:40,140
It's like dicks or like your front of
center. It's like, yeah, no they're just,

1933
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:40,974
I I like,

1934
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:43,560
I feel like you guys should be like
holding yourselves back to the doorways

1935
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:47,040
cause your dicks are pulling you through
things and it makes life a lot easier

1936
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:49,240
when you just realized
that. But I think he,

1937
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:52,510
it's like I just have only grown up
a girl so I just didn't, you know,

1938
01:49:52,511 --> 01:49:57,511
I knew obviously cause I've had a lot
of sexual attention even very young.

1939
01:49:57,581 --> 01:50:02,290
But it's, it's just like
your decks are thing,

1940
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:07,330
they're fucking things and the 7 billion
people and stuff because it's not

1941
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:09,850
necessarily because women
are that horny. Right?

1942
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:14,530
It's just dudes are trying so hard
to fuck. And now these compelled,

1943
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:17,710
I mean this is an evolutionary thing
and it used to be really hard to stay

1944
01:50:17,711 --> 01:50:19,690
alive. Yeah. Not that long ago.

1945
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,850
Now it's really easy and we're kind of
left with the burden of this shift. Yeah.

1946
01:50:24,851 --> 01:50:25,660
We haven't,

1947
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:30,660
our brains and our biology hasn't really
caught up to the fact that we don't

1948
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,170
need to have as many people as
we used to. We used to, you know,

1949
01:50:35,171 --> 01:50:38,050
used to have a 50% mortality
rate amongst children.

1950
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:42,790
It was very difficult to survive. And I
think that's also was just in China too.

1951
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:47,380
You're seeing more shifting with,
um, you know, like, like those,

1952
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,840
those guys in that video, these Beta guys,

1953
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:52,690
the one guy calling out for people to
stop being distracting and the other one

1954
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:56,100
calling out for people to stop
using gendered language. Like, well,

1955
01:50:56,130 --> 01:50:59,320
who are they? Well, they wouldn't
survive if there was a, you know,

1956
01:50:59,630 --> 01:51:02,700
the Roman army was invading,
they would have never made,

1957
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:05,860
I wonder who's fucking
them? Nobody. Nobody.

1958
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:08,440
Maybe they're just men that aren't
driven by that, you know? No,

1959
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:12,550
that's not true. That's just as good
as they can get. They'd just be jeans,

1960
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:16,030
circumstances and stuff are a
mess. It's a mess. They're a mess.

1961
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,220
This is just weird. How much on survival,

1962
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:22,570
how much of our like cave man shit is
still there and how much of this survival

1963
01:51:22,571 --> 01:51:25,810
stuff like I've been doing listening
to a lot of therapy podcasts,

1964
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:30,860
just one called the adult chair to this
woman Michelle Chalfont and she's just,

1965
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:36,160
it's all about dealing like with your
inner child and then I'll and all of your

1966
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:37,053
instincts.

1967
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:40,270
She has like the adolescent chair and
the adult chair and your adolescent chair

1968
01:51:40,271 --> 01:51:44,320
is all of your ego and your emotions
and your fight, fight or flight,

1969
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:47,440
like all of that. The stuff that
you do, the procrastination,

1970
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:50,680
whatever is your problem,
like why is that happening?

1971
01:51:50,681 --> 01:51:54,310
There's something that's coming from
either your child chair or something from

1972
01:51:54,311 --> 01:51:58,780
your childhood or things like socially
when you have social anxiety and panic

1973
01:51:58,781 --> 01:51:59,530
attacks and stuff,

1974
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:03,340
so much of it could be just back from
in the days if you were ex-communicated

1975
01:52:03,341 --> 01:52:07,090
from your tribe, like you would die
if you weren't a part of the club,

1976
01:52:07,091 --> 01:52:08,710
you would fucking die.

1977
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:13,770
Whitney Cummings that that's the reason
why people are afraid of public speaking

1978
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:16,420
is that when you were
speaking in front of a group,

1979
01:52:16,421 --> 01:52:17,740
you were trying to save your life.

1980
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:20,770
You were trying to plead
your case for the most part,

1981
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,540
unless you were the leader of the tribe.

1982
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:26,050
Most of the people were
just trying to say, please,

1983
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:30,610
I didn't know and don't kill me. Is
that how you feel walking around me?

1984
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:34,090
And they know, but some people they
comedy started. People were like, no,

1985
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:37,090
they're still full king. No. You
know how I feel walking around.

1986
01:52:37,091 --> 01:52:41,950
I feel like they don't, it's
like they don't have anybody,

1987
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,280
but here's the way to put, when you

1988
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:50,330
are listening to someone all the time
and then that person's in your ear,

1989
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:54,380
the person becomes like a weird part
of your life and then you meet them and

1990
01:52:54,381 --> 01:52:58,130
you're like, whoa, this is crazy that
you're right here. I've experienced that.

1991
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:01,010
When I first met Anthony Bordain,
I was weirded out. I was like,

1992
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:03,450
I can't believe you're right
here. This is so weird. I see on,

1993
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,440
and I've gotten used to that over time,

1994
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:09,390
but still it's strange when
I meet famous people. Yeah.

1995
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:12,500
You know when I meet and it's even
weirder when I made famous people and they

1996
01:53:12,501 --> 01:53:16,820
know me, I'm like, yeah, okay, yeah.
The way we can famous people together.

1997
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:17,400
Like hi,

1998
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,900
I know. Yeah, I've seen
that before at fucking one,

1999
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:23,040
two famous people just see it.
And then you're just already,

2000
01:53:23,041 --> 01:53:26,550
you're already in this weird club
of famous people. It's strange.

2001
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:30,410
Automatically a famous
people club. Well it's, it's

2002
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:34,620
not a normal state and it's not,
I mean, and people that are,

2003
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:38,250
that enjoy the podcast and becomes a
part of their life and maybe it benefits

2004
01:53:38,251 --> 01:53:42,000
them and maybe they start
getting motivated and cleaning
up their life and start

2005
01:53:42,001 --> 01:53:44,660
being healthier and exercising and
eating better and it, and then,

2006
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,440
then it becomes just like almost
like a religion kind of thing.

2007
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:53,370
But because it becomes a thing
that you think of, you know,

2008
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:56,790
in terms of like how to benefit your
life, how to live in a positive way.

2009
01:53:56,791 --> 01:53:58,740
You think about the things that
you learned on the podcast?

2010
01:53:58,741 --> 01:54:01,710
Almost like you would look at a
religious doctrine. You look at the,

2011
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:03,870
the teachings of Christ, you know,

2012
01:54:03,871 --> 01:54:07,230
you look at the teachings of
Moses or you look at like, Oh,

2013
01:54:07,231 --> 01:54:08,850
what Rhonda Patrick said was dance.

2014
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:12,660
Oh well you know what Graham Hunt Hancock
was talking about that like in their

2015
01:54:12,661 --> 01:54:15,710
head you're like a hired
coach, both of them.

2016
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:16,603
And there's certainly a bit of that.

2017
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:22,030
And it's also represents my own quest to
try to figure out my own life and to do

2018
01:54:22,081 --> 01:54:26,400
it publicly and explain what I've learned
and how I failed and have what I've

2019
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:30,300
gotten better at. It helps other
people when you hear that cause you go,

2020
01:54:30,301 --> 01:54:31,740
Oh okay, I'm not alone. Like,

2021
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:36,120
cause people think that if like
your life is in order right now,

2022
01:54:36,121 --> 01:54:40,320
that has always been like that. So I
think it really helps people to hear like,

2023
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:43,260
oh I used to be a
fucking loser. And I did.

2024
01:54:43,261 --> 01:54:46,620
And I used to be scared to talk to
bank Keller tellers. And it was true.

2025
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,500
I used to be weirded out
socially. I was very strange.

2026
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:53,260
How can they hear your voice over the
Cha Ching, Cha Ching, Cha Ching to chin.

2027
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:57,120
Cause you're rich. So rich.

2028
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:00,900
You're my richest friends
probably. I'm guessing. Probably.

2029
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:05,520
I can't imagine who's richer. Well
someday you'll be rich too. I can't wait.

2030
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:07,620
We'll laugh. You have
laughed at me before.

2031
01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:11,570
Will you get those same kind of glasses
but surround them with diamonds? Yeah,

2032
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:13,640
I want to get jewels. I can see those.

2033
01:55:13,650 --> 01:55:16,580
How long do you think it's going to take
to surround them with diamonds? Yeah,

2034
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:17,443
just ordered them.

2035
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,160
You don't even think about it because
you're too busy doing other things.

2036
01:55:20,190 --> 01:55:22,590
I'm so busy, so busy.

2037
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:26,140
I'm culturally appropriating with those
hoop earrings cause I don't think that's

2038
01:55:26,230 --> 01:55:27,450
[inaudible]. Have you
heard my jug about that?

2039
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:31,380
Know about how I got accused of cultural
appropriation for wearing these hoops.

2040
01:55:31,381 --> 01:55:36,120
Hilarious. Because uh, but she was
Jew. My, my best friend, she's black.

2041
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:39,690
But I did, I did a slide them
off her neck. She's African.

2042
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:44,040
I do want to be a part of
her tribe. That's the joke.

2043
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,560
That is the craziest shit when they
stretch that neck out with those things.

2044
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:47,423
I know, I'm like,

2045
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:51,240
this is when you can get mad at the
Jenners for cultural probe is when they've

2046
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:53,460
had the lip plate [inaudible]
you know what I mean?

2047
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,750
When they come with the
stretched out thing. Yeah.

2048
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:59,760
It's just a cultural preparations.
A weird, I don't know.

2049
01:55:59,761 --> 01:56:03,660
I think we should all be dressing like,
I think it's cool that we all should be,

2050
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:04,401
I think people should be dry.

2051
01:56:04,401 --> 01:56:06,600
I mean you shouldn't be like
disrespecting people's culture and stuff,

2052
01:56:06,601 --> 01:56:09,670
but I don't know what,
it just seems like a,

2053
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:11,340
what we're calling culture appropriation.

2054
01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:13,390
Today's people looking for
a reason to complain. Yeah.

2055
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:17,160
Cultural appropriation is one of the
reasons why cities are so interesting

2056
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,450
because we share each other's food.

2057
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,870
We share each other's clothes and listen
to each other's music and you know

2058
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:25,170
where each other's jewelry. It's nonsense.

2059
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:28,200
And you know what's interesting is like
how many people from America are upset

2060
01:56:28,201 --> 01:56:28,681
about things,

2061
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:33,681
but then when people from China or Japan
find out that we're wearing a Chinese,

2062
01:56:34,441 --> 01:56:39,420
like Japanese [inaudible], they're
so pissed. No, they like it.

2063
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:45,690
I feel like there's been times where
I've just done stuff online, you know,

2064
01:56:45,691 --> 01:56:46,950
I'll have a beer or whatever,

2065
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:51,420
and then someone else starts doing it
and you don't, you get mad at that. Well,

2066
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:53,580
that's different. Not as,
it's not a joke. I mean,

2067
01:56:53,581 --> 01:56:56,520
just like a thing I'm doing that's
different because then you feel like

2068
01:56:56,521 --> 01:57:01,170
someone's copying you, you know,
summarize at a time. But then some people,

2069
01:57:01,171 --> 01:57:03,630
some people get mad like,
oh, I'm doing a podcast. No,

2070
01:57:03,631 --> 01:57:07,680
he's doing a podcast copied me. Like,
Hey, fuck face. You don't own podcast.

2071
01:57:07,681 --> 01:57:11,130
That's where a dick, I have a
podcast. It's called Asian experience.

2072
01:57:11,131 --> 01:57:11,964
That's fine.

2073
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:15,420
I've literally had that conversation
with people where they were like, ma'am,

2074
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:18,570
but now he's doing a podcast. I'm like,
what are you talking about? Stupid.

2075
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:23,571
There's 600,000 Fox to do with
you just focus on aim your Arabic,

2076
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:27,990
like handle your own life. It's,
it's so, but your own shit.

2077
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:30,690
I have lived as a victim
for many years. It's,

2078
01:57:30,691 --> 01:57:34,500
there is a benefit to it because
you're always fed it. You know?

2079
01:57:34,501 --> 01:57:36,390
If you are looking at the
world that you're a victim,

2080
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:41,490
you will be given everything you need
and please don't stop using gender.

2081
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:44,550
Actually, you're going to be so,
everyone's going to be disappointing you.

2082
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:48,600
Everyone's going to be upsetting you
or you can just accept some fucking

2083
01:57:48,601 --> 01:57:53,340
responsibility and it feels so good.
It feels good. It does feel good.

2084
01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:56,390
Yeah. I mean it feels
good to be calm and to,

2085
01:57:56,391 --> 01:57:59,490
to just be at peace and you know
there's a lot of work involved in that.

2086
01:57:59,491 --> 01:58:02,640
You've got to fucking, you
got to meditate. You got
to iron out your own stuff.

2087
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:06,990
You got to exercise. It's a progress.
Work in progress. Yes. We all are.

2088
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:11,670
I'm fucking trying man. I'm fucking
trying. I've wrapped this up.

2089
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:15,360
If anybody wants to see you, you are
at the comedy store on a regular basis.

2090
01:58:15,361 --> 01:58:17,820
