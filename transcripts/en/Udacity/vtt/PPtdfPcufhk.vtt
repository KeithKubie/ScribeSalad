00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're here at the San Francisco trolley station.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, the trolleys in San Francisco have a lot of mass.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The hills in San Francisco are quite steep.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In order to keep a decent pace going up these hills,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
these trolleys need to have a lot of power.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In this problem, you're going to make some calculations involving

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the power of a San Francisco trolley.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, my question is if you have a cable car with a mass of 2000 kg

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
on a hill inclined at 10 degrees and it needs to keep moving up

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
at a constant pace of 25 kg per hour, what is the necessary power?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, there's two ways to solve this problem.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
One involves using an equation that you learned in one of the problem sets,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and actually this would be a nice, simple, easy way to solve it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The other would require a little bit more work and would involve the definition

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of power that you learned in class.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can enter your answer here in watts.
