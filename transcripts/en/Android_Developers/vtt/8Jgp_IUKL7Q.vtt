KUSHAGRA SHRIVASTAVA: Hello,
my name is Kushagra

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.300
Shrivastava.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.120
I'm a lead on our apps
and games marketing.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.170
Today I'll be talking about how
you can keep your users

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.640
engaged and coming back.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.460
Larry Page, our CEO, once quoted
"products should be

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.700
like toothbrush.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.860
Users should use them at least
twice a day." Building great

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.190
product is the key.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.440
But to ensure your users
love and use

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.350
the product is critical.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.400
In a recent survey, we found
that 40% of the users only use

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.160
an app for a week.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.600
Nobody wants to be an app or a
game which has hundreds of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.660
thousands of installs but
very few active users.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.750
To avoid this, you need to
be smart about marketing.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.130
And marketing always starts
with the product.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.060
In this talk, we have laid out
a few basic principles that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.060
will help you keep your users
excited, engaged, and coming

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.470
back for more.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.380
Here are the five rules to
help boost engagement.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.770
Rule number one, let data
drive the decisions.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.520
It is extremely important that
you look at all key events and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.730
life cycle of your consumers to
understand what is working

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.240
and what is broken.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.210
You only can fix stuff once
you know it is broken.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.200
There are various tools
out there which

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.930
can help you do that.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410
Google Analytics
is one of them.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.120
The Google Analytics engagement
report helps you

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.340
discover how visitors
use your app.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.810
You can use this set of reports
to track a wide range

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.720
of information about your users,
including the total

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.340
number of screens per visit, the
order in which screens are

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.440
viewed, the number of technical
errors an app

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.250
crashes, how often they return
to the app, how long the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.280
sessions were, how long
individual app elements take

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.890
to load, and specific content
actions which are unique to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.870
your app, like social
interaction, clicking on an

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.310
ad, or recommendations.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.340
Data informs your product
and marketing.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.160
Once you have the right data,
you have actionable insights

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.880
to make improvements
and boost usage.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.170
The second rule is educate
and immerse.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.410
For most first-time users,
installing and opening an app

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.930
is like going on a blind date.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.640
The first impression is the
most important thing.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.720
Don't assume that users will
figure out how your app or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.270
game works.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.370
Visually explain it to them,
and help them get started.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.000
Also, tell them how to get help
if they ever need it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.780
The most basic thing you can do
is to have a great welcome

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.460
screen and build from there,
leading to fun, interactive

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.730
tutorials, on-screen
instructions and more.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.470
This is your chance
to get creative.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.110
Test different messages.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.380
Try new things.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.240
Number three, understand
the learning curve.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.590
Every user has a learning curve,
and understanding that

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.220
is critical.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.100
At a macro level, it is
important that you talk to the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.980
user at the right time.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.910
For example, if you're a game
developer, don't tell users on

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.810
how to use a new power play
mode which they can only

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.470
unlock after 30 hours
of game play.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.310
That said, casually telling them
that this is a power play

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.220
mode which they can unlock
is all right.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.370
Fourth principle, remind why
users like your app.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.100
An app is not the center of the
universe for most people.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.830
Well, for some die-hard
fan, it might be.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.550
That said, to keep users engaged
and coming back, you

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.930
have to remind them why they
love your app and what are

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.220
they missing out.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.960
Some app developers have used
native Android features like

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.120
push notifications, widgets,
lock screen widgets, live

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.940
wallpapers, to boost engagement,
stickiness, and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.960
constantly bring users
back to the app.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.650
Pulse is a great example.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.540
They leverage rich notifications
to push new

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.330
stories to the user on
the home screen.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.820
Also, it is a great time for
you to remind yourself that

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.620
the objective is to keep users
engaged and not spam them.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.630
These features can easily be
an overkill and frustrating

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.890
for the user.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.100
Use them smartly.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.110
The last principal that I'm
going to talk about is to

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.140
reward and bring your
users back.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.080
Now that your product is doing
the marketing for you, you

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.800
need to look into the final
aspect of retention and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.060
engagement which is custom
marketing and loyalty.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.600
Put your existing marketing
channels like social media,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.320
in-app reward mechanism, emails,
gamification, et

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.660
cetera, to use based on the
data you have seen.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.630
Reward the power users
with something

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.400
tangible, unique and personal.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.190
It will help boost their morale
to share your messages

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.520
and keep them active.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.330
Overall, aim to boost the
lifetime value of your users.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.560
At the end of the day, it is
all about building apps and

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.780
experiences which you yourself
would like to use.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.550
And gradually start a
conversation with the user and

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.750
make the experience personal.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.470
I hope this was useful, and
thank you for watching.
