I think that everyone in the world could
 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.419
I think that everyone in the world could
be a math person if they wanted to the

be a math person if they wanted to the
 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.250

reason mathematics is difficult to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
reason mathematics is difficult to
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569
reason mathematics is difficult to
understand is actually because of that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
understand is actually because of that
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.179

dependencies when you have long chains
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.499

there are very few starting points very

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
there are very few starting points very

few things I need to memorize I don't
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310
few things I need to memorize I don't
need to memorize for example all these

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
need to memorize for example all these
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139
need to memorize for example all these
things in history such as when was the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
things in history such as when was the
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.190

war of 1812
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.450
war of 1812
well actually I know that one because

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
well actually I know that one because
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190
well actually I know that one because
that's a math fact it was 1812 but I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
that's a math fact it was 1812 but I
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.660
that's a math fact it was 1812 but I
can't tell you a lot of other facts

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
can't tell you a lot of other facts
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.609
can't tell you a lot of other facts
which are just purely memorized in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
which are just purely memorized in
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410
which are just purely memorized in
mathematics you're very few that you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
mathematics you're very few that you
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.389
mathematics you're very few that you
memorize and the rest you deduce as you

go through and this chain of deductions

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
go through and this chain of deductions
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.520
go through and this chain of deductions
is actually what's critical now let me

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
is actually what's critical now let me
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109
is actually what's critical now let me
contrast that with other subjects like

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
contrast that with other subjects like
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.760
contrast that with other subjects like
say history history doesn't have this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
say history history doesn't have this
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.339
say history history doesn't have this
long chain in fact if you fully

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
long chain in fact if you fully
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.440
long chain in fact if you fully
understand the war of 1812 that's great

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
understand the war of 1812 that's great
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.670
understand the war of 1812 that's great
and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
and
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.899
and
it is true that that will influence

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909
it is true that that will influence
 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.000
it is true that that will influence
perhaps your understanding later of the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
perhaps your understanding later of the
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.000
perhaps your understanding later of the
women's movement but it won't be as

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010
women's movement but it won't be as
 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.770
women's movement but it won't be as
absolutely prerequisite in the sense

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
absolutely prerequisite in the sense
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.330
absolutely prerequisite in the sense
that if you think about the concepts I

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
that if you think about the concepts I
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.949
that if you think about the concepts I
actually think that history has more

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
actually think that history has more
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780
actually think that history has more
concepts than mathematics it's just that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
concepts than mathematics it's just that
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.399
concepts than mathematics it's just that
they're spread out broader and they

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409
they're spread out broader and they
 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.709
they're spread out broader and they
don't depend on each other as strongly

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719
don't depend on each other as strongly
 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.440
don't depend on each other as strongly
so for example if you miss a week you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
so for example if you miss a week you
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.059
so for example if you miss a week you
will miss the understanding of one unit

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069
will miss the understanding of one unit
 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.369
will miss the understanding of one unit
but that won't that won't stop you from

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379
but that won't that won't stop you from
 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.839
but that won't that won't stop you from
understanding all of the rest of the

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849
understanding all of the rest of the
 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.940
understanding all of the rest of the
components so that's actually the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
components so that's actually the
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.770
components so that's actually the
difference between math and other

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
difference between math and other
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.940
difference between math and other
subjects in my head

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
subjects in my head
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.069
subjects in my head
math has fewer concepts but they're

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079
math has fewer concepts but they're
 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.050
math has fewer concepts but they're
chained deeper and because of the way

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
chained deeper and because of the way
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.000
chained deeper and because of the way
that we usually learn when you have deep

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
that we usually learn when you have deep
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920
that we usually learn when you have deep
chains it's very fragile because you can

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
chains it's very fragile because you can
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.409
chains it's very fragile because you can
lose any one link meaning if you miss a

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419
lose any one link meaning if you miss a
 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.300
lose any one link meaning if you miss a
few concepts along the chain you can

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
few concepts along the chain you can
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.159
few concepts along the chain you can
actually be completely lost if for

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169
actually be completely lost if for
 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.959
actually be completely lost if for
example you're sick for a week or if

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969
example you're sick for a week or if
 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.580
example you're sick for a week or if
your mind is somewhere else for a week

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590
your mind is somewhere else for a week
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.869
your mind is somewhere else for a week
you might make a hole in your

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879
you might make a hole in your
 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.699
you might make a hole in your
prerequisites and the way that education

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709
prerequisites and the way that education
 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.399
prerequisites and the way that education
often works where it's almost like

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409
often works where it's almost like
 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.259
often works where it's almost like
riding a train from a beginning to an

riding a train from a beginning to an
 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.030
riding a train from a beginning to an
end well it's such that if you have a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
end well it's such that if you have a
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.770
end well it's such that if you have a
hole somewhere in your track the Train

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
hole somewhere in your track the Train
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770

is not going to pass that hole now I

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780
is not going to pass that hole now I
 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.930

think that the way to help to address

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
think that the way to help to address

this is to provide a way for everyone to

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919
this is to provide a way for everyone to
 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.250
this is to provide a way for everyone to
learn at their own pace and in fact to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
learn at their own pace and in fact to
 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.140
learn at their own pace and in fact to
fill in the holes whenever they are

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
fill in the holes whenever they are
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.819
fill in the holes whenever they are
sensed and I actually feel like if

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829
sensed and I actually feel like if
 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.339

everyone was able to pick up every one

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349
everyone was able to pick up every one
 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.050
everyone was able to pick up every one
of those prerequisites as necessary

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060
of those prerequisites as necessary
 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.280
of those prerequisites as necessary
filling in any gaps they have

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
filling in any gaps they have
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.649
filling in any gaps they have
mathematics would change from being the

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659
mathematics would change from being the
 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.500
mathematics would change from being the
hardest subject to the easiest subject I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
hardest subject to the easiest subject I
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.869
hardest subject to the easiest subject I
think everyone's a math person and all

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879
think everyone's a math person and all
 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.699
think everyone's a math person and all
that one has to do is to go through the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709
that one has to do is to go through the
 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.289
that one has to do is to go through the
chain and fill in all the gaps and

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299
chain and fill in all the gaps and
 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.999
chain and fill in all the gaps and
you'll understand it easier more better

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.009
you'll understand it easier more better
 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.730
you'll understand it easier more better
than all the other subjects actually

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740
than all the other subjects actually
 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.429
than all the other subjects actually
