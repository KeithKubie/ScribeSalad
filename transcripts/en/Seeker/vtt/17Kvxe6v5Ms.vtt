00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.759
Physicists have discovered yet another form
of matter: excitonium!

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.990
The new discovery has them all very ecstatic.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.049
If Julian was here that pun would have made
you unsubscribe.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.510
Excitonium is pretty exciting, because this
is a discovery 50 years in the making.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.529
That’s when excitonium was first theorized,
but proving it existed has been a bit tricky

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.710
because it looked remarkably like another
kind of electron movement called a Peierls

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.710
phase.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.310
Basically, it’s all about how the electrons
move around the nucleus, but don’t get too

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.790
electrified, let’s back up a second.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.010
Thanks to new measurement techniques, excitonium’s
existence has been conclusively demonstrated.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.210
So now we know it exists, but what exactly
is it?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.150
Excitonium is a condensate, a collection of
particles that exhibit quantum phenomena like

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.070
superconductivity or superfluidity on a macroscopic
scale.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.720
The particles that make up excitonium are,
naturally, called excitons.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.000
Excitons are bosons, the category of particles
that includes such hits as the photon, the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.420
gluon, and of course the higgs-boson.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.141
Now tilt your head back because here comes
the part that will make your brain melt and

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:07.799
dribble out your nose.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.149
Excitons are composite particles.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.220
A composite particle is something made up
of two or more elementary particles.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.499
But, with excitons it’s actually not that
simple.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:21.399
They’re made up of an electron that has
jumped to a higher energy level from the crowded

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.530
outermost shell of an atom, AND the HOLE that
electron left behind.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.580
The other electrons in that crowded shell
make the hole behave as though it were a particle

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.929
with a positive charge, and the hole attracts
the escaped electron back like it’s coaxing

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.679
a runaway dog home with a treat.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.380
When the two are reunited, they form an exciton.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.579
If an electron combining with the empty space
it left behind to make a new particle makes

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.619
perfect sense to you, then congratulations
on your future as a particle physicist.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.509
For the rest of us, it’s just one more example
of how the quantum world is as intuitive as

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.509
Windows 8.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.619
But don’t fret, even physicists aren’t
totally sure what excitonium will actually

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.619
do.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.979
Before it was discovered it was argued that
it would act like a superfluid, a perfect

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.360
conductor, or an insulator.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.800
Now, that we’ve finally found it we can
figure out which argument was right, and what

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.230
it could actually be used for.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.310
