[cello music playing]

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:21.426
&gt;&gt;Dor Abrahamson:
What is mathematics

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:22.246
if you think about it?

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.346
Mathematics is a
way of thinking.

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:28.256
It's a way of solving problems.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.446
I'm Dor Abrahamson.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:33.046
I'm a professor of mathematics
education over at U.C. Berkeley.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.976
I study the way that
kids learn mathematics.

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:37.886
I'm also an inventor.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:40.756
I build all kind of gadgets
using both traditional

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:42.006
and cutting-edge technology

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.136
to help kids learn
and teachers teach.

00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:53.546
Usually when people think
about math, they think about,

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:55.386
you know, X and Y and numbers

00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:56.696
and doing all these
calculations.

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.666
However, mathematics is about
making sense of the world

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.636
and unless we can sort of
ground all of the scribbling

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:04.496
in something concrete
that we really get,

00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:07.346
we'll never understand
what we're doing.

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:09.956
Like adding, you
know what adding is.

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.886
Take one and one and woo!

00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:12.636
You have two.

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:15.186
Or if you think about
multiplication,

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:17.386
it's like you take, "what
is five times three?"

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:18.916
Three and three and
three and three.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:20.616
You have a sense of
what this thing is.

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:23.266
But beyond that, do
people have a sense

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:27.156
or are they only scribbling
around and getting answers

00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:29.316
but not really understanding
what these things are?

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:31.966
My job is to help kids connect

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.886
between what their brain
already knows to do and the math

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:37.446
that they are being taught,
so that they can do much more

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:39.416
than just scribble little
numbers and symbols,

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:40.746
so that they can really get it.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:42.606
So they can go out
into the world

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:45.646
and identify those
phenomena, see those patterns,

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:48.426
use math in their lives
to solve the problems

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:49.356
that they care about.

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:52.576
Any researcher of math
education can tell you

00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:55.516
that the big crisis starts
when fractions enter the scene.

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:58.306
Up to then it's just been
counting numbers: one, two,

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:00.696
three, four until you
get all these weird kind

00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:04.516
of relationships where one-half
is bigger than one-third,

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:06.056
is bigger than one-quarter
is bigger

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:07.836
than one-fifth even though
the numbers are going

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.156
up the fractions
are getting smaller.

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:11.286
Kids flip.

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:14.786
Kids suddenly lose a sense
of what these things are.

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:17.986
&gt;&gt;Ratio and proportion
are everywhere.

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:19.226
Even on my cello.

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:21.596
When you take a string, play it,

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:24.396
and then you halve it,
it's the same note.

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:31.276
What we need is to help kids
see the world mathematically.

00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:34.166
So our way of going about
solving this problem is

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.256
to develop what we
are calling the

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:37.086
Mathematical Imagery Trainer.

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:40.546
We've set this up so that
as long as the crosshair

00:02:40.546 --> 00:02:43.106
on the right is double-height
of the crosshair on the left,

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:44.546
it's going to be green.

00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:48.516
So if I move it this way,
it will keep being green.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.116
However, if I find a green spot

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:55.116
and I keep the distance
the same, it will go red.

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:59.316
That means we can struggle with
the core learning challenge

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:02.186
of ratio and proportion
even before we introduce a

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:02.956
single number.

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:07.996
In our lab we are creating all
these sophisticated devices.

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:09.446
But we count on teachers

00:03:09.446 --> 00:03:11.216
to bring these things
alive in their classrooms.

00:03:11.456 --> 00:03:15.026
All you need is to be creative
as all teachers are in figuring

00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:17.496
out how to make these
ideas come alive.

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:21.606
So just like with the
Mathematical Imagery Trainer,

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:24.306
kids saw how the distances

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:26.196
between their hands
keep on growing.

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:27.866
We can show that
just with blocks.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:33.146
We can show the same
idea instead of growing

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.006
up vertically, going
horizontally.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.626
Imagine you're leaving home
and you're driving one thing,

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:41.386
say a bicycle, and your
buddy is driving a car.

00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:45.146
As you're moving along, you're
each going at a constant rate

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:47.206
but the distance between
you keeps growing.

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:49.506
This guy is moving
two units at a time

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:52.906
for every one unit
this guy is moving.

00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:54.566
That's proportion.

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.676
You can use anything.

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:58.376
It's those images that
they'll be carrying

00:03:58.376 --> 00:03:59.366
out through their lives.

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:00.206
Not the numbers.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.356
They'll forget the procedures.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:05.646
We want kids to be masters of
their mathematical knowledge

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:12.246
so that they can solve
the problems of the world.
