00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.650
and it's focusing on stuff some stuff
that should be given a little bit more

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660
that should be given a little bit more
 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.900
that should be given a little bit more
time or at least spread out I should say

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910
time or at least spread out I should say
 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.700
time or at least spread out I should say
some stuff that should really be spread

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710
some stuff that should really be spread
 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.300

that's rush should probably have a
 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.630
that's rush should probably have a
little bit more time spent on it so I

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640
little bit more time spent on it so I
 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.810
little bit more time spent on it so I
don't know it's I mean I'm like I'm not
