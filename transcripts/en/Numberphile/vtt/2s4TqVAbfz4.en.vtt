00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
[PROF SEQUIN]: What do you make of this? 5, 6, 3, 3. What do you think comes next?

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.880
[BRADY]: I'm gonna go... 7!

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.760
[PROF SEQUIN]: 7. No, actually, it is another 3. Now you have a guess at what's coming next.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.160
[BRADY]: 3.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.360
[PROF SEQUIN]: Good! Yes. As a matter of fact it continues to be 3, 3, 3.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.220
And you wonder, this is really a strange sequence, you know, what are we going to do with this?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:35.720
Well, this is the number of regular polytopes that exist in 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and all higher dimensions.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.480
And that's what we are going to talk about today.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.980
Regular polytopes in N dimensions. A polytope is just a more general term that generalizes for

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.220
2-dimensional polygons, 3-dimensional polyhedra, and everything higher we call a regular polytope.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.880
That sounds a little scary, so let's start with something much simpler; the platonic solids.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.440
So here is a tetrahedron, that is the first platonic solid.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740
Next we have a simple cube.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.800
Third one — octahedron, made from eight equilateral triangles.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.560
Number four, twelve faces — the dodecahedron.
This one has twelve pentagons.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.660
And finally, the real jewel... —

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:19.860
Ahhh.... the icosahedron, made out of twenty equilateral triangles, and this is probably a Swiss crystal.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.840
[BRADY]: Of course.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.720
[PROF SEQUIN]: And here is another view of an icosahedron — this is a pattern by M.C. Escher.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.600
Could you show to a non-mathematician, in an intuitive way, why there are exactly five platonic solids —

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.180
not more, and not less...?

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.040
Well, one way to do it is to look at the surface of these objects.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.800
So this dodecahedron, for instance,
is made out of regular pentagons.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.120
And so all of these platonic solids
are made out of regular polygons.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.720
So probably we should step down a dimension
and look at what regular polygons are possible.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.740
Simplest one would be a regular equilateral triangle.
Then we can do a square. Then we can do a pentagon.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.360
Then we can do an hexagon, and so on, and if you go all the way to infinity, we end up with something that

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.440
looks like a circle.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.380
So there are infinitely many of these regular
polygons in two dimensions.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.860
So really, this sequence up here, it has another character before the five, if you go to 2 dimensions.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.740
And what's that?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.480
It's not an eight—it's infinity.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.220
And if you really wanna go to the extreme,
what about 1 dimension?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.640
Well, it's just a line segment — nothing else.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.780
What about 0 dimension? Well, it's just a point;
nothing else. But now, 1, 1, ∞, 5, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 -

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.460
that's a really weird sequence, you know, and, um,
I guess that would really confuse people.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.280
Okay, all of the platonic solids are made
from one of these regular polygons.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.240
And so, how many different ways can we use these regular polygons to make one of these solids?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.280
Start with the equilateral triangle, and ask 'how can we make a platonic solid out of that one?'

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.780
Well, we'll need a minimum of three of those
to be put around the corner in order to make a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.960
valid corner in three dimensions.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.340
And if we put three of these triangles around a shared vertex, then the bottom is also an equilateral triangle.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.540
That would give us a tetrahedron.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.440
Okay, so next we can try to put four equilateral
triangles around the shared vertex.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.720
And we can bring them together and make a four-sided pyramid. And, remember, to make it regular

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.120
all of the dihedral angles here have to be exactly the same.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.220
So that means that the bottom now is a perfect square.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.560
We can take this square pyramid
and match it with an identical square pyramid.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.920
So that makes the second platonic solid;
the octahedron.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.720
Now we can try to take five of those
and put them around a vertex.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.840
And this makes this five-sided pyramid —
so it's completely symmetrical.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.880
If we continue forming these kinds of corners,
and try to sort of wrap it around,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.720
will this actually get a closed surface?

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320
Will this actually end up in something,
something useful?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.820
Well, we know we have this icosahedron, okay?
But if you have to really figure out whether it works,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.540
it takes a little... thinking.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.920
You can see on top here — we will have
this five-sided pyramid.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.000
So we can take one of these five-sided pyramids —

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.980
we cannot put this one just up on a mirror — we can
take another one, but the two have to be rotated

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.360
against one another by 36°. And if we do that,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.160
then in between we can see there's a triangle strip,
with triangles going up–down, up–down, up–down...

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.820
essentially forming a five-sided anti-prism.
Adding ten more triangles,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.840
it's kind of beautiful that indeed this surface does close and result in number three platonic solid.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.080
[BRADY]: And what about six triangles?  [PROF SEQUIN]: Oh, good question! Glad you asked that.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.880
So, let's try to take six triangles, and put them together,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.400
and we get a wonderful nice hexagon, here.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.820
So, unfortunately, it's totally flat.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.480
And so this doesn't really curve and it doesn't
help you to make some kind of closed object.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.500
You can make a kitchen floor with that one.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.660
Now if we go to seven triangles,
they don't even fit into the plane –

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.320
it's kind of get the warped chip. And that is no good.
So we're done with triangles.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.080
For now we have to go to squares.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.680
Fold them up, so basically three squares around the shared vertex leaves off an opening of 90 degrees.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.360
And we forcefully try to close this opening.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.220
And now we have a valid 3D corner.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.480
If you take a contraption like that, and match it on the backside with exactly the same contraption,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.380
then you get a cube made out of six squares.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.020
Now I know what you're gonna ask next...

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.760
'What about four squares?'

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.600
Well... glad you asked.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.500
—Same problem...

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.500
—Same problem here. So we can put four squares together — and they make either a complete flat.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.520
Or if we were to somehow bend it in weird ways, then

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.280
(it'll) unknot all the dihedral angles
and all the edges would be the same;

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.680
and so it not would be a regular corner — that's unuseful.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.700
So we're done with squares.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.420
We can put three pentagons together,
and form a nice 3D corner.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.180
And again the question arises: does that really close if we continue the process?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.900
And the easiest way to see it is to take one pentagon and put five pentagons around it,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.740
completing five of these corners.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.600
And this makes this nice kind of salad bowl.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.880
And now if we put another salad bowl like that
on top of it,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.460
— again rotate by 36 degrees so it fits nicely together —

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.680
then, indeed, we can convince ourselves very quickly that that leads to yet another regular platonic solid.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.660
Trying to put four of these pentagons around the corner exceeds a total of 360 degrees,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.440
so you already get something that's
warped like a potato chip — and it's no good.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.620
We're done with pentagons!

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.820
Hexagons!
—Hexagons!

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.280
—You know what happens with three hexagons,
of course: three flat tiling. That's no good.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.420
What about heptagons?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.880
Well, they don't even verily fit into a plane. It's too much.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.040
So, from there on up, we're sort of done.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.500
Nothing new can happen.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.740
Now you know exactly why there are five platonic solids — and exactly five platonic solids.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.620
—Professor, is a sphere a platonic solid?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.920
—No, it isn't. Because even if you think about a very fine tessellation, you could not find a tessellation on a sphere

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.160
where all the faces would be exactly the same,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.360
and all the edges are all the same,
and all the vertices are the same...

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.140
So we're basically done with three dimensions...

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.680
And so, I must admit that for many of us
there is indeed a sixth platonic solid.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.340
And it is ... the Utah teapot!

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.960
For the people in the computer-graphics community,
this is such a famous object

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.000
which has been used again and again to test our rendering software and solid-modeling software.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.960
And it just shows up... it's just in about every single graphic paper in some form or another.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.700
So we like to think of it as the sixth platonic solid.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.680
Now these regular polytopes are made out
of regular polytopes one dimension lower.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.500
In the same way that we made platonic solids
out of 2D regular polygons,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:42.960
we can now try to make four-dimensional regular polytopes out of three-dimensional platonic solids.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.880
Each one of these four-dimensional regular polytopes is of an object that has, as a surface,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.440
a thick crust of three-dimensional platonic solids.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.880
And just like we made a cube out of squares, we're now trying to make a hypercube out of cubes in its surface.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.520
We used to take three squares, and then forcefully
try to close this gap of ninety degrees.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.060
And by closing it, we force this corner
to pop out of two dimension —

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.120
become a three-dimensional valid polyhedral corner.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.460
And that's the corner of a cube.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.320
Now, we're doing exactly the same thing, except —

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.280
think that behind each one of these squares, there is a complete cube.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.920
And these three cubes now are sharing a joint edge, perpendicular to this plane in that particular corner.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.480
So there's a ninety degree wedge of open space

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.480
and we're trying to forcefully close that.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.780
And we cannot close that in three dimensions if there are cubes behind each one of these four visible squares.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:45.820
But trust me, if we really do that and we can pop out
in the fourth dimension, we can close up, you know,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.520
these cubes — and we get a hypercube.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.220
[BRADY]: Those cubes behind these that I was being asked to imagine...

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.880
they've kind of overlapped with each other now...

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.160
[PROF SEQUIN]: No, because they pop out into four dimensional space,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.740
in the same way that when we took these two dimensional squares — and we force them to close.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.840
They didn't overlap; they just popped out
of two dimensions into three dimensions.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.120
And four-dimensional space is really much
bigger than three dimensional space,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.560
so there's ample room for these cubes to simply
pop out and form a true four dimensional corner.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.700
[BRADY]: But to my three-dimensional eyes,
he is sitting in 3D space... I'm like...

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.040
how did that happen? But if I had four-dimensional eyes, I'd be thinking...

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.340
[PROF SEQUIN]: That's correct. And now you're hitting on the real problem.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.480
So we can figure out that this must be possible,
but then... can we visualize that?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.840
I mean, how do we know what these thing looks like...?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:46.300
Well... for that, we have to use some kind of a shadow,
or a projection of a four-dimensional object

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.760
down into three-dimensional space.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.860
And I'm sort of torn between, you know, should we use a shadow or should we use

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.640
what I would call a 'wireframe'?

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.840
And you see... the trade-off between those two options.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.080
Just like if I showed you the wireframe
of the dodecahedron —

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.780
you can really see through it, and it tells you much more than if you just had a faceless shadow of this object.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:13.120
You can eventually start to get a feeling
by looking at three-dimensional wireframes

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.360
or projection of such wireframes —

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.700
what the four-dimensional object might indeed look like.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.160
And — doing this projection — we still have an option.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.980
We can project in various different ways.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.480
We're going from a two-dimensional square
to a three-dimensional object.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.440
And in an oblique projection, I start with the red square in front

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.120
and then the blue square is the ones off in the back,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.380
and the green lines essentially show me the depth.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.280
We can do the same thing by starting with a complete cube — the red cube is in front

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.560
the blue cube is in the back —

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.120
and then the green lines show essentially the extrusion of this cube in this oblique direction.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.640
Alternatively, we can use a perspective projection
— everything in the back would appear smaller.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.200
And we can look straight at the face.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.060
And by doing that, you know, the back face will be a smaller square (that's off) really behind the red square;

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.500
and the green lines show kind of the depth
going from the front to the back.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.720
And the same we can do with the complete cube.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.440
And we get, you know, in the back
a smaller cube shown in blue,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.080
and then the edges that go from
the front to the back are shown in green.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.900
So here is the oblique projection.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:17.240
You can see the fatter cubes being the ones in front,
and then the thinner cube in the back...

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.360
and then the slightly conical edges
leading from the front to the back.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.900
So that's a valid depiction of
a wireframe of a hypercube.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.760
And here is the alternative model —
a perspective projection.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:34.780
So the bluish cube is the front cube, and the yellow cube is the one in the back — which is here much smaller.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.440
The red edges that go from the front to the back.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.540
And this hypercube has a total of eight cubes:

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.380
the front cube in blue, the back cube in yellow,

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.340
and then some squashed cubes
here showing one on each of six faces.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.540
So there's a total of eight cubes making the surface
— or the thick crust — of the hypercube.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.460
[BRADY]: So that yellow cube isn't inside the blue cube...

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:01.340
[PROF SEQUIN]: No. In four dimensions, it would be up
in the fourth dimension (at) a certain distance.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.000
Because of perspective projection, what's
further up there gets projected into the back...

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.940
and appears smaller in this projection.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.600
Now, we're going to systematically look at all
the platonic solids;

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.500
see how many we can group around the shared edge, how much empty space there is,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.040
and then we push that one out and push that into a valid 4D corner.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.960
The simplest object to start with is the tetrahedron.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.500
The tetrahedron has a dihedral angle of 70 and a half degrees.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.340
We need at least three of these tetrahedrons
around the edge to make a valid corner.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.980
Three, of course, fits very easily.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.220
Four fits. Even five fits, but just barely:
we just have a few degrees left.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:44.200
And so, when we try to fit five tetrahedrons around this, we just get a little bit bending in four-dimensional space.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.740
And we will need  — as we will see — a whole lot
of these tetrahedra (to) make it actually work out.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.920
So we can start out with three tetrahedra

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.660
and ask what happens if we forcefully, you know,
bend that into a corner. Can we repeat it?

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.720
And the answer is we will get the 'simplex',
 or the '5 Cell'.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.480
So, because of the projection, you know,
it becomes just a three-dimensional object;

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.840
and it loses some of its symmetry.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.000
So we have five vertices, but the fifth one, — to me, to make it asymmetric as possible —

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.680
I put it here right in the middle.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.620
So we get the outer tetrahedron, and then we get the temples here on each side.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.800
They all represent additional four tetrahedra.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.700
And they don't look very regular,
and that's because of the projection.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.580
But, in four dimensional space, all five of these tetrahedra are completely regular.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.680
And so that's the 5 Cell or the simplex.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.880
That's what happens when you take
three tetrahedra around a shared edge

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.860
and essentially force out the empty space
and bend it into a true four-dimensional corner.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.480
Four tetrahedra around the corner,
you know, we get this object here, okay?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.120
It's called the 'cross-polytope'.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.960
And it's actually the dual of the hypercube
that we've seen before, okay?...

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.920
So that's the cross-polytope —
the second regular polytope in four dimensions.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:10.180
Five tetrahedra put around a shared edge — 
you get something that has a lot of tetrahedra.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.880
As a matter of fact, this thing has 600 tetrahedra.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.440
Most of them are so crunched up in
the middle here because of the projection...

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.280
and you just see one giant tetrahedra on the outside.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:29.000
And then, adjacent to each faces, you see smaller...
fairly much flattened-out tetrahedra...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.060
And you have to just believe me that, in there, there are essentially — in addition to this one out here —

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.660
another 599 tetrahedra.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.800
This is called the '600 Cell'.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.300
Six tetrahedra would exceed the dihedral
angle of three-hundred sixty degrees...

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.900
And that's like, you know, something warped
that, uh... is not regular. So that's of no use...

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.500
We have seen cubes; they have dihedral angles of 90°.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.180
Three of them will fit around an axis till it'll leave an open gap ...

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.040
and then we fold this one up — we've seen we get the hypercube.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.580
If we try to put four cubes around the joint axis
— you can readily visualize —

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.300
that would readily fill the space without any bending.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.160
And so we can tile all of three-dimensional space
with that, but it will never bend and make a regular

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.680
polytope in a higher dimension.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.460
So we're done with the cubes.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.540
The next platonic solid you may want to try is the octahedron.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.620
It has a dihedral angle of 109 and a half degrees.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.100
So that's less than a hundred and twenty degrees here.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.300
And that means we can indeed
fit three around a joint edge, and

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:36.080
still leave a little bit open space, which we can squeeze out and make this then pop into the fourth dimension.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.820
And the result is what I believe to be the most
beautiful four-dimensional regular polytope:

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.140
the '24 Cell', made out of twenty-four octahedra.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:54.980
You can see the outermost octahedron, because
I chose that to be, you know, preserved in the projection.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.960
But, then, you see these rather flattened octahedra:
this one triangle here...

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.540
another triangle, this small one here..., and sort of a...

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.100
distorted antiprism in between...

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.560
and then there are more on the inside.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.440
I really like this particular object the most,
because it's not too complex —

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.960
you can still see what's going on,
you can still look in the inside,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.500
see the innermost, very tiny little octahedron at the center.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:25.720
Now, it turns out this object has 1152 symmetries in four-dimensional space.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:34.160
And then you simply get that by multiplying the symmetries of an octahedron — which are 48 —

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.120
with the number of octahedra — twenty-four.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.100
You multiply this out — you get to 1152.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.540
Because you can take — in four-dimensional space — any one of the octahedron

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:52.220
and put it in the place — by suitable rotation — of any one of the other 24 octahedra,

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.920
in any one of the 48 possible positions.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:03.020
I live at the street address 11-52. And then I found out that this object has 1152 symmetries.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.320
I thought that somehow fate really meant
me to be, you know, into geometry.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.500
The next one on the list is the dodecahedron,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.560
with a 116 and a half degrees of a dihedral angle.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.700
That is still less than 120 degrees,
so we can still force three of them around an edge

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.800
and then join it into a valid four-dimensional corner.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.000
It's not bending all that much,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.980
And so we will need a hundred and twenty
of those objects in the crust

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.460
to form a valid four-dimensional regular polytope.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.920
So this is a model of the 120 Cell.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.420
Of course you can see the outermost dodecahedron.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:41.200
You can see kind of these flattened pancake-like,
you know, dodecahedra on top here.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.000
And each one of the faces has one of those.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.820
And then stacked on the inside there are a few more, adding up to a total of a hundred and twenty of those.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.840
We still have the icosahedron.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.340
Unfortunately it has a very shallow dihedral angle.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.680
It is more than 120 degrees; it is actually 138 degrees, roughly.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.420
And so even three of them would not fit around this edge without overlapping.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.800
And so we cannot form a valid corner.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.080
And, unfortunately, this is useless, as far as making a four-dimensional regular polytope.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.000
You basically can figure it out yourself, right?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
You know how to make five-dimensional regular polytopes.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.640
You look at the four-dimensional regular polytopes, look at their dihedral angles, and figure out, you know,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.160
can I fit at least three of them around
an edge so I can make a valid corner?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.240
Most of these regular polytopes in four dimensions are very round, and they're not very useful

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:39.060
There are really only two of them that actually have some hope of generating a new regular polytope in higher dimension.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.160
One of them is the simplex, or the 5 Cell; and the other one is the hypercube.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.600
[Brady]: The other ones have got too shallow ... ?

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.980
[PROF SEQUIN]: Yeah, the other ones have too shallow of dihedral angles,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.780
and they just don't make valid corners in the next higher dimension.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.820
And so, from five dimensions onwards,

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.920
there are really only just three regular polytopes in each one of these dimensions.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.180
One is the simplex series — you can always make a simplex.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.340
By taking a simplex in a particular dimension
— I'm starting with the tetrahedron —

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.880
and then I put another vertex at the center of gravity.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:15.700
And now I use the fourth dimension, and essentially raise this vertex up in the fourth dimension

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:22.960
until it has exactly the same distance from all the other four vertices. That makes a new simplex.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.740
And then I can take that particular simplex, put a new vertex at its center,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:34.820
raise it up in the next higher dimension until it is exactly the same distance from all the previously existing vertices

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.400
and make the next simplex.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.080
That always works.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:44.440
So I can work my way up to infinity by always
making an additional simplex in exactly that manner.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.320
The problem now is how do we depict those things.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.360
'Cause clearly projecting it down — you could do anything.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:57.220
So, it's better to figure out how do we make a model
that has the right connectivity, even though

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.320
the geometry really sort of bogus at this point because it's so much distorted from what we originally have.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.080
And I have make a few more simplices in higher dimensions.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.380
You just need to always add one more vertex,
and then figure out how to make a nice little graph

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.960
that will get the right connectivity.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:19.920
So, this one has six vertices.
I claim this is a projection of the 5D simplex.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:26.160
'Cause the simplex also is the complete graph; every vertex is connected directly to every other vertex.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.620
And you can see in this case — you start at any one vertex, there're five edges going off,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.700
one to each of the other vertices.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.260
So we want to make a 3D model, that has six corners, is reasonably symmetric, but not too symmetric.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:43.440
So we could start with an octahedron. But in the octahedron then, when you connect opposite vertices,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.940
those three edges will all intersect in the middle.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.940
That would be so nice. You wouldn't see what's going on.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:54.240
So you'd have to deliberately distort this octahedron, warp it a little bit, so that those three spaced diagonals

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.600
that go through the middle of the regular octahedron —

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.780
they have separated out. And now they
do not intersect with each other anymore.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:07.540
So the trick was really just finding six vertices
in a relatively symmetrical arrangement,

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.060
so we can connect every one with
every other one without any intersections.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.040
And that's the game that we have to play for every one of the dimensions that we want to build a simplex model.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.480
We already had this object that had
six vertices completely connected —

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.920
the warped octahedron — and that actually
has an extra free space in the center.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.200
It's so easy therefore to put a seventh
vertex right here in the center.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.560
This one can again be connected to all the other vertices.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.740
And so now we have a complete graph of seven vertices.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.780
And that would be a nice model of a six-dimensional simplex.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.600
There is a second sequence that works for all dimensions.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.420
And it's called the 'measure polytope' or 'hypercube sequence'.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.820
The cube is the object with which we measure
the volume of three-dimensional space.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.600
Just like the square is the geometrical element
that we use to measure two-dimensional space.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.980
Similarly, the hypercube would
measure four-dimensional space.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:06.540
So the measure polytopes are always the equivalent
of a cube in the higher dimensions.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.560
And the best way of visualizing what's going on
is essentially going in stepwise extrusions.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.480
So, we start with a line. And then we take this line,
and extrude it basically into a square.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.300
And then we sort of take that square and extrude it perpendicular to itself into a cube.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.020
And then, we're doing one more extrusion
of that cube into a hypercube,

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.780
to an extrusion of the hypercube into the 5D measure polytope.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.540
And you could continue that way.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.900
Or you can change the scale.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.000
So, what I prefer — maybe in six dimensions — would be to take a regular cube

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.780
and essentially sweep that in three different dimensions to make yourself a thickened cube frames

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:48.080
which is showing every edge as the
'sweep path' of one of those cubes.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.420
So this particular diagram would be
a depiction of a sixth-dimensional hypercube,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.900
which you get by extrusion.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.740
Another projection of the sixth-dimensional hypercube results in this 'Rhombic Triacontahedron',

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.700
which has thirty rhombic faces on the outside.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.680
But, on the inside, there's a whole lot of intersecting edges going on. And you may not like that.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.260
So it all depends on what you really
want to get out of your model.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.500
In some sense, this makes a very nice
sort of climbing structure for children.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.780
[Brady]: That's not very cuby though, is it? It's hard to see the cube.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.480
[PROF SEQUIN]: Yeah, for some angles, if you look at... here it looks like an oblique kind of squashed cube

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.100
that starts with one of the cube face.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:28.020
Or a very flattened cube, you know,
we have just like three faces here.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.020
And then on the inside there will be another three flat faces,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.080
but they of course already intersect with
edges from some of the other cubes.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.720
—We can go cubes all the way to infinity.
—That is correct.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.440
So, you know, we started out with five platonic solids.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.320
We went to the six regular polytopes in four dimensions.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.420
And after that I said 3, 3, 3, 3, 3...

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.920
I have shown you two of those three series;

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.160
the simplex series, and then
the measure polytopes series.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.520
So there must be another one.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.680
We've seen that we can make a series of measure polytopes through all the dimensions.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.220
In each one of these dimensions we can also form the 'dual'.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.460
Just like in three dimensions we have the cube,
and then we have each dual which is the octahedron.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:12.520
By holding it that way, you can see the top and bottom vertex in my right hand

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.280
correspond to the top and bottom face
in this particular cube.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.060
For each of the six faces in the cube,
I now have a vertex.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.320
And for each of the vertices in the cube,
I now have a face.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.620
[BRADY]: Like its evil twin...
[PROF SEQUIN]: Yeah. Oh, nice twins actually...

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.120
[BRADY]: Yeah.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.300
[PROF SEQUIN]: So they're duals of one another.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:36.780
We also have the models that show the same relationship — not quite as obvious — in 4 dimensions.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.320
So here we have the measure polytope — the hypercube.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:47.360
And, if we take the eight cubes in the crust of
the hypercube, and replace them by eight vertices,

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.460
we get the corresponding measure polytope, which is the dual to this hypercube.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.400
[BRADY]: Evil twin!

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.520
[PROF SEQUIN]: And the same principle goes on.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:59.320
It gets, you know, near impossible to kind of visualize in higher dimensions, but again,

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:07.340
every measure polytope in d-dimension is made out of measure polytopes of d-minus-one-dimension.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:12.560
You replace each one of those cells with a vertex at its center, and connect them properly,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.820
and you get the 'cross polytope', which is the dual to the measure polytope in any one of these dimensions.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.000
And that's the third series that we can form.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.060
Um, here is again our sequence.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.560
You know, we have infinitely many polygons in two dimensions.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.460
We have five platonic solids in three dimensions.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.080
Six polytopes in four dimensions.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.860
And from there on, it's just always
only three regular polytopes.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:39.720
So, in conclusion, I think I can say we're sort of lucky that we live in one of the two dimensions

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.100
where it's really interesting — and we have a variety of  different regular polytopes.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.540
[BRADY]: We don't live in the most interesting dimension though. We live in the second most interesting...

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:53.960
[PROF SEQUIN]: Well, if you think that we live in space-time continuum, which is four-dimensional, so we live in that one too.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:03.700
So, what, I'm inside, a four-dimensional polytope right now?

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:10.360
Yes, you're inside the 120 cell space is entirely filled with dodecahedra because

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:16.660
in this spherical space, dodecahedra tiled space. It's non-Euclidean...
