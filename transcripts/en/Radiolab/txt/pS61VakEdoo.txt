Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Okay. Yes. Listen to this. Yes, for a second.

Speaker 3:          00:29          Is that Johnny Cash? Yes. It's Johnny Cash and he's singing a song about the deep importance of mathematics in your life. It's no math here. What are you talking about? You know there's a lot of math here because you see what he's doing is he's, he's moving to his extinction it seems, but he's being very careful to calibrate. Oh my God, we're going to go all the way to one later. The scene, this song for three hours already and numbers are making it TD. I would. I would, if I were him, I'd lose the numbers. Blue blew the numbers. Yeah. You can't lose that address. You cannot lose the numbers because numbers create order in your life. Could lose the numbers. I could. I could survive an entire, well, my whole life without them. That's just completely ridiculous. Easily. No, try me. Try me. All right. Let me just ask you something very simple. Yeah. You go to buy some m and m's and you have $5 bills in your hand and you'd give it to the vendor and the vendor gives you back the m and m's and what? No numbers required if hand him the bill. He hands me some change. I just go by trust. You go by trust? Yeah. He asked you how old you are. What do you say? I'm middle aged. I tell him.

Speaker 3:          02:01          Okay, listen to that. You hear that? Suppose that you're late for an appointment or something like that? Yeah. So you call up and you say, I'm going to be three minutes late, five minutes late, 10 minutes late. How easy. Just wait for the call before I leave. I know that you know it's true. I know it was true. So yeah, don't eat them. Don't eat your test. You're taking the test in school. You get in 98 you get a 52 you don't care. Pass, fail. How much gas is in your card yet? I wait for the light to come on.

Speaker 1:          02:29          At what? What did you want to call me? Right?

Speaker 3:          02:32          Yeah. And you can't remember my phone number. [inaudible] News. How many words?

Speaker 2:          02:42          Yeah, you gully use numbers.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Hi. Hello.

Speaker 3:          03:09          Is that how it ends? Yeah, that's a great ending. Ending made possible all thanks to the discipline use of [inaudible] and that's going to be our hour. What do numbers do to us and for a don't to for us get the, what do we have? We have a to have a detective story. I love stories. Some Nazis add lots of numbers. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Stay with us.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Okay,

Speaker 3:          03:53          so Chad, do you want to introduce the some this person? And this is a, this is a little Ameel. He's Emile. So how old is he? He's hungry right now. He's about 30 Carla, how old is he? 36 six at the time of this recording he is 36 days old. Well I've, you must have wondered, do you think he has any sense at all of numbers or quantities or do you mean like thing? Can he count as I'm asking you, you count. But like do you think he has a, I don't know, a numeric sense at all? Do I think he has a numeric? No. No, I don't think he knows that he uh, that, that that is his hand that he's chewing. I don't think there are any numbers in there. In fact, I'm pretty sure there aren't. No.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Whoa.

Speaker 3:          04:45          Lulu [inaudible] you should introduce yourself to a meal. A meal. This is our producer, Lulu Miller. And by the way, Jed, while you were on paternity leave, we, we shouldn't Lulu on a little mission to ask, where does a number since come from and how soon does it arrive in a person?

Speaker 4:          05:03          Hello? So this is the first guy I spoke to. His name is Stanislas de hen speaking. Who is he? He is a neuroscientist in Paris. We've been brushing up my English for a few minutes currently. He's like the Godfather, this research really? He wrote a whole book called the number sense that talks all about what babies understand. Yeah. And he said that for a long time people thought that babies came into the world just empty Piaget and many of the sinkers so that there is with people, I've called the blank slate that we could only learn numbers if we were taught them. Yeah, that's what I think. Good. No, we know it's just completely wrong. And how do they know this? Well, experiments, right? Well lots and lots of baby experiments. The equipment we have is a set of little sponges, uh, which contain a very small electrode that you can place on the head of the baby. It's ready to net

Speaker 3:          05:56          and these babies are old. Um,

Speaker 4:          05:58          in this case it was a babies of two or three months. So he plunks the baby down front of a computer screen and on the screen are a bunch of little pictures. Uh, you know, liter ducks for instance. It's always a set of eight of the same object. So you do eight ducks feet, Dax Eight, ducks patriarchs eight. And what he sees is that at first the baby's brain is a little excited about getting to see ducks. And then it slowly, the firing just kind of fizzles out. Another eight darks and then at some points underneath he changes it to trucks and he sees a spike in brain activity in the call. [inaudible] meaning the baby can notice that change. Yeah, but that's not number. No, no, no. I know he's just getting started because Dan runs the whole thing again starting out the same way. Great darks eight dogs, eight but then instead of changing to trucks, he just changes the number eight dogs, eight dogs, 16 dogs.

Speaker 4:          06:59          And once again the baby notices the chain change, but now it's in a different part of the brain which we call the palliate or lobe. So the suggestion is according to Stan, that they're noticing that this is a different kind of change that in some sense they're noticing this is a change in quantity, which is very important because it means that even in newborns they have in their minds and in their brains and intuition of numbers, sure. That they're seeing numbers or maybe they're just seeing a change in the pattern. Some, some, some, some more. We'll share what they're good at. Is making these gross distinctions like eight versus 16 let's say 10 and 20, you know, and as the difference in number gets smaller and smaller, then they're not so good. There is no baby, uh, that will ever know the difference between nine and 10.

Speaker 4:          07:48          These numbers are too close together, but it's not quite as simple as you might think. According to Stan, which is most Xtandi know you. I think the way that they're actually experiencing quantities is not just a dumb down version of what adults do. It's a completely different version of what adults do. They seem to care about the [inaudible] of the number. The what? The logo [inaudible] of the number you means logarithm. Yes. Sorry, my English is getting really bad at logarithms. I don't know if the Swedish scare that purely listens to this show, but it's actually not that bad. You can think of it in terms of ice shows, everything about you meaning us, how we think about numbers and imagine in your head the distance between one and two. Okay. What is that one right now? Imagine the distance between eight and nine one. Also they feel like the same distance from each other. Yeah, but that's because we think of numbers in these discrete ordered chunk. One, two, three, four frog. But now if you were to think about it logarithmically like the baby, the distance between one and two is huge.

Speaker 2:          09:03          Okay?

Speaker 4:          09:03          It's this vast space and the distance between eight and nine tiny. Why is that? Well, because one to two is doubling, but eight to nine until you show off close to one, I need one point something [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:19          okay.

Speaker 4:          09:23          Now, here's the spooky thing about this. You might think what must happen is that eventually as we grow up, we just naturally switch from logarithmic thinking to the numbers. We all know now. But this is not true. According to Stan. If left to your own devices, you'd never switch. What do you mean you would stay in this logarithmic world forever? So we've done this, Eh, very funny experiments in the Amazon, uh, with people from the Amazon. We do not count basically in their culture, they do not have number words beyond five and they don't recite these numbers. So, um, uh, what we found is that these people still think of numbers in a low guide way. Even the adults. What that means is that, uh, if you give them a line and on the left you place one object and on the right you place nine objects.

Speaker 4:          10:23          You got that [inaudible] and he asked them what number is exactly between one and nine. Okay, so you'd say five exactly. But would they put in the middle is three. Three. Oh wait, help. Help me here a little bit. So the, uh, the property of [inaudible] miss that each time you multiply the number, you move by your constant displacement. Okay? So this is a bit tricky, but the gist is if you're thinking in ratios and you're starting at one, then you multiply by three to get to three, right? And then, hey, hey, you multiply by three again to get tonight. I see. So those are equal jumps on either side. This leads to one as nine is two, three, get it. Yeah. Well, that's such a sophisticated way to go about thinking about it yet to us, but not to them. That feels intuitively, simply like the middle dozens of people did this without hesitation. I mean this experiment gives me chills. These are the numbers that we all for want of a better word, naturally feel. At least that is, that has been my, uh, [inaudible] go to claim for many years. Hmm. And I don't, I don't quite know how to phrase this question, but is there some, does it almost like the way we think about numbers with, with an equal distance between one, two, three, four, five, six, seven is wrong.

Speaker 2:          11:53          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          11:54          You know, I wouldn't go too far. But then I talked to Susan Carrie, I'm professor of psychology at Harvard University and she said that numbers as we think of them today are certainly made up. Those are human constructions and even somewhat at odds with how we feel numbers intuitively. That's right. They are. So there is the problem then. How do we ever come to understand the numbers we know now that's a, that's a $64,000 question. She says it happens gradually. Can you don't dish the microphone over a couple of years? Can you count one more quick introduction that is little luck who you might remember from the last year show. Yes. You've met marina before and her mother, producer, Amanda Aronchick. She will be two in a week. Yes, it's her birthday and we've called them in today because of an experiment, credibly simple set of tasks that Susan told me about. If you have a two year old at home, you can do these tasks.

Speaker 1:          12:51          We're gonna play a game. Okay, so you put a bunch of pennies on the tape. I'm going to give you some pennies in just a second note that let me get them for you. And you say to the child, can you give me one penny? And I have one penny and the child very carefully picks up one, enhance it. Gee, that's right. That's one penny. Thank you. Young two year olds almost all can do that. Then you ask for two pen. Can I have two pennies? No, no, please can I have two? And it doesn't matter what you ask for, they just pick up a handful and hand them to you when the two pennies you have like one, two, three, four and so they've given you four pennies and you say is that too? And they say, yeah right and then you say, can you count how many pennies? What can you count? And make sure how many pennies is that?

Speaker 1:          13:42          So they go one, two, three, four and you say, is that too? She's they say yes and sometimes they count. How many pennies does that one, two, two, two. So like Tom. Now note that all of their other words contrast with one in meaning that is there, they're giving you a number and they're giving you a number of more than one, but they haven't the slightest idea what two is or three years or four years or five is and they don't know what to means for nine months and they're in that stage for several months and then they become 300 hours and then they become four knowers. That process takes a year and a half. In other words, even though it sounds like getting understands numbers like we do, she's probably still living in the land of that baby man. But there does come a moment when they finally step away. Can you sing that song? And it happens, right? When the kids about three and a half years old, what they do, I think this is speculative, but after years of everyone around them saying, count, can you count how many pennies you have? This is something parents

Speaker 4:          14:52          do one too.

Speaker 1:          14:54          Discounting with with children. Can you count to ten one, five, six, two, four, five [inaudible] and three even though the kid is baffled by the numbers, five or six or seven board, five, eight the line, the last one, that some point, fair enough. And they just sort of throw up their hands, believe the phone. That's an a very bold leap that children must make. And so now what five means for the child is one more than four. Knowing what six means is one more than five but now you've got integers. We're all sort of like relying on this song, like yeah, one, two, just that one day decided, okay, that means something. That's right. So this is a trick. What does she mean by that trick? Sounds almost like a dirty word. She will, she doesn't use it like a dirty word. She says it's a wonderful trigger point is once you have that trick, you build on it

Speaker 4:          16:30          and that opens up the whole world of mathematics to you. And we can build buildings in launch rockets into space and no other animal has invented that trick. But I can't help feeling there's something about this that's a little bit sad. Why? Well, just the idea that to step into this world of numbers, we all have to leave something behind. We do. We're born with, yeah, but don't look what you get on the other side though. You get, you get to play and have remarkably interesting. If you like math, you get to play with deeply abstract and beautiful thoughts. So yes, yes, and that's great. But you feel sad when somebody's good at trapeze work? No, that's just something that they're good at and they practice it and they learn it. It's just like different talents. That's what Robert F I think I know what Lily's talking about. I mean it's refreshing somehow to know that the numbers that we use day to day are somehow made up because sometimes the numbers for me at least feel like these hard, fussy foreign things that don't feel real. They feel actually the opposite of real. But you're sure sure. That

Speaker 5:          17:34          really isn't just unfamiliar or a little strange. I mean foreign. Yeah, sure. Cause when you, before you could walk, when you were just a crawler, you know toddling was kind of unusual and then toddling became kind of an adventure and then that became kind of usual and then eventually you do walk.

Speaker 3:          17:50          But if there's something about numbers where I feel lit personally, I never learned how to walk. And I think there was a lot of people listening right now who probably feel that way about numbers. So maybe what does that mean? They'll just logarithmic people. Come on.

Speaker 6:          18:01          It's five three five eight (979) 323-4626 yeah. Thank you very much for that lesson. Lily. Stay strong in your opposition to integers. Paul. One nine seven one six nine three nine we'll be right back. Seven five 0582097494 five nine (230) 781-6406

Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. We're still talking about numbers and now we're going to switch though it may be, it may fatigue. Some of us, if you think about them a little differently, if you learn to embrace them and give them a bit of a hug, wonderful things can happen. I'm going to introduce you to a, um, well, a nosy man named Mark Nigrini. I'm an associate professor at the school of business at the College of New Jersey. Has a really heavy New Jersey accent, but what he really likes to do, what kind of accent was that was kind of a, I originally grew up in Cape Town. South Africa. South African? Yes. Oh, he likes to play detective and the clues. He looks for distinct numbers. I, I can't walk past the number without just wondering about it.

Speaker 7:          20:17          I went into that number. How did it get there? For example, after I finished filling up at a gas station, sometimes I would just walk around and look at the dollar amounts on the pump. So he peaks in at the pump right next door and it's rather amazing. You can almost tell who's been there before. If you see a number like a dollar 40 then you know, oh teenager with no money. Why wait, explain that. Cause that's all the kid can afford. Quite right. Sometimes I'll see $10 and 4 cents

Speaker 3:          20:48          and I'll say, oh you meant to be $10 but you were a bit slow today. So you'd go to the gas pumps tell you all little short stories. Yes. And his favorite story that numbers tell actually starts back in 1938 so imagine an office in Schenectady, New York at the GE research laboratories. And in that office is a man and he's sitting at his desk, Mr. Frank Benford and Mr. Frank Benford is a physicist. So he's doing some difficult calculations and hunched over a book, probably actually the one of the most boring books you could imagine. This is a book of logarithmic tables. And what a logarithmic table. So a lot locked tables where a very convenient way of doing multiplication in the early part of the last century. So remember this is before there were calculators. So if you want it to multiply something like 145 times 3,564 you could just go to this book and look it up.

Speaker 3:          21:47          So it starts with numbers. You might want to multiply by one new a hundred on the first page and then 101 and two up to 200 and 300 and the back of the book is like nine hundreds the further you go, the higher and higher the numbers you use to multiply that trade. So our Benford fellow, he's sitting there doing miscalculations and he's looking at the numbers flipping to the bone. They staring at the pages and this something clean. You notice that the first few pages were more worn than the last few pages, meaning were smudgy and darker oily as if he was using the front of the book more than the last few pages. Any wonder why is this happening? Dreams. We're favoring one part of the book over the other. Am I doing something a little? Huh? Where? Maybe it's something and that's when it hit him.

Speaker 3:          22:37          He thought maybe in this world they are more numbers with loafers digits. Then with heifers, digits. What more numbers that start with one or two. The numbers that start with seven, eight or nine just because his book is more, that's where, that's what started him thinking, so here's what he did. He compiled some tens of thousands of statistics that Steve Strogatz mathematician at Cornell University, just anything he could think of that was numerical molecular weights of different chemicals, baseball statistics, census data, revenues of all the companies listed on the main stock exchanges in America and everywhere. He looked in all these different categories. It seemed, guess there were more numbers beginning with one in twos, that eights and nines wait, really? Oh yeah. This has been checked out again and again and again and it's true. It's eyes of rivers, earthquakes and things like that. Populations or a number of deaths in a war, areas of counties, stream flow data.

Speaker 3:          23:34          What if you were to say, get all the people in New York together and look at their bank accounts, bank account balances, follow benfits loan Uri perfectly meaning that if you just look in it amount of money that people have, matter of fact being all the bankers you'll find they begin with one more often than they begin with too. Perfectly. Yes, so actually they begin with one 30.1% of the time. They'll begin with a to 17.6% of the time they'll begin with a three 12.5% of the time. That's a, that's a big difference. Why was three Eby I'm sorry I keep going and the poor nine would any occur as a first digit 4.6% of the time, which actually would make the one approximately six times as likely as the mine and he just quite amazing. That is more than quite amazing. That's deeply suspicious. I mean, this is crazy what I'm telling you and I can't give you good intuition why it's true. But Steve and mark and many, many, many mathematicians would tell you despite what you may think, there is a preference, a deep preference in the world. It seems for number sequences that start with ones and then twos and then threes. I'm Robert [inaudible]. Mm. So what?

Speaker 3:          24:52          Well, this is not just a mathematical curiosity, jazz noon. I know there is something you can do with this information. Right? Well, when Mark Nigrini first ran across Benford's law,

Speaker 2:          25:03          he thought, [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          25:06          maybe I can use this law

Speaker 2:          25:09          to bust people

Speaker 3:          25:10          for payroll fraud tax return for you thought, hey, we can use this to catch a thief. That's right. Huh? How willingly Nigrini figured if you look at a bunch of numbers that they

Speaker 8:          25:21          bank statements or expense reports and so on, and you see that the numbers in the business do not match the natural pattern of Benford's law. So the numbers don't begin with ones more than two's moving with twos, one with threes and so on

Speaker 3:          25:35          could say, hey, this is not natural. This may not be true, this may be

Speaker 2:          25:42          fraud.

Speaker 3:          25:43          So we started giving lectures on the idea that Binford is a way to catch these. The only problem was they didn't quite believe Benford's law, which means the rest of my talk isn't going to go anywhere. It is now my great pleasure to introduce you, one of the most fabulous people I've ever had the name to say, Daryl d Doro [inaudible] look [inaudible] definitely, totally, definitely lead illiterate to literally of heaven. It's like palindromic. Yeah. Itch Gerald Darell. Oh Wow. And um, but I should say Daryl is a, what did you call it? They calls it, I'm a forensic accounting forensic accountant. [inaudible] which means his job is to examine numbers and figures to see if someone is stealing. It's an investigative process. And while at first he was unsure about Benford's law, but skeptical. One day I

Speaker 8:          26:39          happen to talk to one of my neighbors who was a, uh, retired professor

Speaker 5:          26:44          and he said, Oh, Benford's I have my students do that proof every year. He actually wrote out the proof for me. And it's just, it's immutable mathematical law. And now it's one of his favorite tools of history. We have a case right now underway, relatively small company, family shareholders there four of them. One of them feels like she has been misrepresented as a shareholder. Meaning she thinks these other three guys may be stealing [inaudible] yes, I yes. And I know you can't tell us what this business is doing, but is it a, it's a, it's a, a regulated business. Uh, it's a business that each of you purchase on a regular basis through your local governmental authority, trash collection or Su Ranger. Anyway, this one woman thought that she was being cheated, so she got an attorney involved. The attorney requested data. So we have seven years of income tax returns and that's all he had.

Speaker 5:          27:47          Just tax returns. [inaudible] yes. So he edited them all into the computer, aggregates them, run Benford's and clicked on the graph. We instantly saw Vango for a couple of the years. Coincident with when the dispute began, the way they've reported their taxes violates Benford's very suspicious. Yes. Blew out the Benford's pattern. You mean like there are too many nines on the tax returns? Meaning. If you look at the tax returns at this company, you will see a pattern that isn't natural. Exactly. Not enough ones and too many sevens, eights and nines, but now you have to convince detectives and then lawyers and then judges. This is real evidence of wrong doing, but they've not heard of this thing. Benford's don't know about it. As a practical tool has probably been around maybe 10 years, maybe 15 at the outset.

Speaker 5:          28:40          I'm at a conference now. What about 700 to all of you here? I've spoken four times and each time I've asked about Benford's, who's heard of it? Who's familiar with veterans law? Maybe, maybe 5% of the people. Can you just look at pennies? Couple observations to meet doesn't make sense to exclude the community. Use Ben for your same result and they're asking you, judges allow Benford's in as evidence suggest that someone's committed a crime case law out there that actually cite the use of Benford and Daryl tells them, oh yeah, yes, you can use this evidence in court. Yes, federal, state and local from the experiences we've had. And then he tells them stories like the case of the CEO stealing money to buy automobile firearms, wear jewelry in Benford's and then you shoot you, you're still in federal prison or the case of the dentist and his wife, she began having an affair with a guy who turned out to be a meth dealer. The dentist suspected her of having dipped into the till run Benford's and boom, busted. She eventually pled or the guy with a $40 million Ponzi scheme run Benford's well almost boom. I mean, benefits was an element in all these cases. It wasn't the clincher, but still it is a very compelling argument and then 10 years from now it'll be the equivalent of a fingerprint.

Speaker 1:          30:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          30:13          that's it. Huh? W you still having addressed the central mystery here, why in the world, whether it be more ones than nine, shouldn't they be equally, uh, equally coincident? Yes. Well, the answer is actually very complicated in deeply mathematical. The simple answer is, is there an answer though? Yes, there is an answer and it has to do, do you understand the answer? No. I mean, I understand that it has to do with logarithms and the, and the business of doubling and the culture of numbers. But if you were to sit me down and say, explain it to me carefully and, well, I mean, no, it's just too new metrics for me to explain it to you. Okay. All right. But I will now take a little sidestep to a group of people who would be able to explain it to us if they were in this room.

Speaker 5:          30:59          But we didn't find them in this room. We found them in, in other rooms. We're rarely in the same room that they are. Yeah. So let's go with our reporter Ben Calhoun and meet a crowd of mathematicians. Ben. Yup. You decided to, I don't know what some kind of a busman's holiday you want, right? They go to a math conference. I did madly. And what happened? Well, I went to CUNY, which is the City University of New York, and it was a math conference called, it was on Combinator burial and additive number theory. Oh, a good time. Had by all, yeah. It goes by the optimistic acronym. Can't. So I had heard that if I went to this room, no tables, there was going to be a bunch of mathematicians from all over the place. [inaudible] from Sweden attending and they would be able to tell me where they condoms college, what their name was, but they would have this other way of identifying themselves.

Speaker 5:          31:54          Right. They had this number, my numbers, two, three, two, three, three, two minus three actually. Oh, nice. Yeah, I'm really excited about it. What, what is the, what does it mean? Right too? I'm with three. Well, it's an air dish number. What's an ear dish? Ear dish is a guy. Oh, so your air dish number is how many steps away you are from this Guy Paul air dish. So you're going to tell me his story. Yup. Hey, you ready? Okay, let me turn off my cell phone so we don't ruin the best cake. That's Paul Hoffman. He wrote a book about Paul Air Dish. So we start out in Budapest, Hungary in 1913 at spring, two math teachers have a son named Paul and he had two sisters. They were three and five and they had scarlet fever and they died

Speaker 9:          32:40          the day he was born. I mean, imagine that his mother loses her two daughters and gains a son. Oh my God. Yeah. She was so terrified after that that Paul would get a fatal disease and die, that she didn't let him leave the house pretty much for the first 10 years of his life. She didn't let him play with other kids. Really didn't let him go to school, didn't let him go outside. Also, when he was wanting to, half his dad was captured and put in a Soviet prisoner of war camp for six years of his life. So here's this kid at home without other children around. His mother is out teaching mathematics, all the books in the house for math. And he taught himself basically to read by looking at these math books. And he also said to me, the numbers became my best friends. So I mean, here's a kid who's, you know, whole life is mathematics from the beginning. But let's fast forward. Paul Erdish gets his phd in his early twenties this is in the early 1930

Speaker 1:          33:42          he's [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          33:45          Paul Air dish is Jewish, which means he knows that he's got to get out of Hungary, that he managed to get to the United States, but he has to leave his family behind.

Speaker 1:          33:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          33:57          when the Nazis moved into Budapest, four of his mother's five siblings were killed. His father died as they were hurting Jews and trying to move them into the ghetto, and he only had his mother left, but she was in Hungary and in 1941 Paul [inaudible] was at Princeton University. He was just 27 years old, completely cut off from his family. He was lonely and he was homesick. I mean, this guy had no conventional friendships. He had no sexual relationships. His only contact with the girl was the people he worked with.

Speaker 1:          34:34          [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          34:34          I mean, there's, what's remarkable to me is other people who had been through this kind of life experience might have ended up in a mental institution or worse, but he didn't. He turned this sort of inwardness into making mathematics a joyous and social occasion. He started connecting with people, I don't get this. Like, what do you mean? Well, he started traveling. He would hear about somebody who was working on something interesting and he would find a way to get there, show up at their door, and he had this phrase that he would say, my brain is open. And he was there to work with them on whatever it was that they were working on and he just kept moving, made a circuit of 25 different countries. Eventually he gave up almost all of his possessions and he became essentially homeless. He had no home, he had no home.

Speaker 9:          35:27          So everywhere he went people had to put him up. And as a house guest, the man was an acquired taste. He didn't know how to do basic things. He couldn't cook, he couldn't even boil water for tea, could barely change his clothes, didn't know how to tie his own shoes until he was 11 he had some kind of skin condition, so they only wore silk, silk clothes. You had to wash. I mean he went through life this way and there was the schedule. He did mathematics 20 to 22 hours a day. He'd bang pots and pans around in the kitchen at 4:00 AM because he wanted you to come downstairs and do more math. So why would anybody want a visit from this guy? This sounds like a walking nightmare. You have to cook for him or stay with him and wash his clothes regardless of your shoes, regardless of all of it.

Speaker 9:          36:10          You wanted him to come see you. Why? Because he was just that good. This was like God coming to visit you. He knew your strengths, he knew how you thought and it was fascinating to watch him. I mean there were times like I went with him to a math conference, aims there in his hotel room and at one point there were like 10 or 12 mathematicians in the room. Some are sprawled on his bed, some are sitting on the floor and he'd be working with one for a few minutes and then he would turn to another and then he'd go back to a third and he was working simultaneously with all these people in different problems. Paul Air Dish wrote more papers and collaborated with more people than any other mathematician who's ever lived. He did mathematics with anybody, even if the person was a dim bulb,

Speaker 5:          36:57          well did mathematics. Now let me just, what's this people do? This is Paul Arish on his 80th birthday. That's the only dovish by an old man you can say is no easy cue of the incurable disease or fly surrounded by a lot of the mathematicians who loved him and put him up in their house. We want to express our deep, warm feelings to you and I want to raise this stones for you.

Speaker 10:         37:31          He was a saint, I think a saint.

Speaker 9:          37:36          That's Joel Spencer. He's a mathematician. He was also friends with Paul air dish.

Speaker 10:         37:41          Now that he is is gone. I think of him sometimes in a religious context because he, he gave this faith to those of us that are doing mathematics, which after all is if you look at it from the outside, it's a little bit of a strange activity. While you put this enormous effort into finding these, these statements,

Speaker 9:          38:05          mathematicians will spend years of their lives trying to prove these things that you know from the outside look totally obscure and pointless.

Speaker 10:         38:16          And yet it was clear working with him that what we were doing was we were trying to find truth with the capital t truth that transcends our physical universe. I think that's the reason why we like to about our connection to Paul because our feeling of mathematics, the feeling for what we want mathematics to be Paul Erdish was the embodiment.

Speaker 5:          38:52          Somewhere along the way, mathematicians started keeping track of their connection to Paul air dish and that's what air dish numbers actually are. If you published a paper with polarity, your erudition number is one. If you published a paper with someone else and they published a paper with Paul Air dish, then your erudition numbers too and so on and so on. So this is like all the people that Paul air additions some way has touched all the people who are connected to him through their ideas.

Speaker 11:         39:20          There are about 500 people with editors, number one and about 8,000 people with their address number.

Speaker 5:          39:27          This is professor Jerry Grossman at the University of Oakland in Michigan. And what he did was he took each ring of erudition numbers and he charted it out.

Speaker 11:         39:37          Heritage number three has about 34,000 people in it, uh, about 84,000 with their addition number four, then they start decreasing.

Speaker 5:          39:45          What are you done for the house? And that's a lot of people. If you go ring upon ring upon ring in you and you do the whole deal, like how many people did this man in the end influence?

Speaker 11:         39:56          I think it's about 200,000 mathematicians,

Speaker 5:          39:58          200,000

Speaker 2:          40:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         40:03          200,000. Picture that for a second. It's like a solar system with more than 200,000 mathematicians all orbiting around Paul Air Dish

Speaker 2:          40:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         40:20          and your air dish number is one one. Yes. Dennis Eichorn is a number two and the edition number is two. I wrote a paper with uh, my advisor and the other students and she had written a paper with mathematician who had written a paper with parents. My oldest number is three. Your air number is one and everybody with heritage number one knows that they've got that host. Everybody in this room knows their number. I would be very surprised if Kara

Speaker 2:          41:03          [inaudible],

Speaker 13:         41:04          Ben Calhoun's erudition number is oh 0.5778 dash p minus one Gallico six coming up, a story from our friend Steve Strogatz, the mathematician from Cornell who tells about a friendship. He has a very precious friendship with his math teacher. So it's all about mathematician, but this is a very unusual friendship and Chad have, I'm Robert Krulwich stick around.

Speaker 5:          41:28          This is Christine Stone from Maplewood, New Jersey. Radiolab supported in

Speaker 8:          41:34          part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 14:         41:50          okay. Okay. I'm Jana. Boom. Rod. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Our topic today is mathematics, mathematics, and mathematics. I suppose that is our topic, but actually we do have a gripping story for you coming up now from our producers, Soren Wheeler. Hey, sarin pate. And this is about math, right? Yeah. Well math and friendship really. And I heard it from Steve Strogatz. He's a mathematician at Cornell University and he's been on the show once or twice. Okay. And we sat down in the studio and he told me about why don't you back up and tell me a little bit about high school and about his high school math teacher, Don, Joffrey. Well, there were several striking and peculiar things about him. I mean, probably the first thing is that he was physically incredibly impressive when would hold the chalk between his enormous fingers and right on the board. The chalk would pulverize with each stroke so that there'll be this cloud of chalk dust all over him and his big sweater. And um, another thing that was very unusual about him, he'd be in the middle of the calculation standing at the board, jock dust all over him as usual. Then he would space out, let me get a look in his eye, a kind of far away look, and then he'd say, Oh, this reminds me with the hush tone. Oh, this reminds me of the time Jamie Williams calculated the formula for the end of term in the Fibonacci sequence, and he gave me Jamie Williams with a student.

Speaker 14:         43:22          He was just a couple of years ahead of Steve and Mr Joffrey's class, and that was part of the Mystique, you know that now he was graduated and it was as if the secret was, was lost to the ages, but the point was that he would talk about a student with reverend. With Reverend, yeah. What was very thrilling about that is that there was this kind of chain that we were now becoming part of. Yeah. So then I'm off to college and it was, it started very early. I started to write to him, it was like an annual tidbit or dear, Mr Joffrey, here's the gym that I learned this year in math. So Steve would write to him, Mr Joffrey would write back, add something, ask them a new question. And that went on like that for awhile with Steve kind of still being like a student and Mr Joffrey still like a teacher.

Speaker 14:         44:15          There was one moment though where something new happened where he wrote to me asking for help. He said a question came up in his class about an elliptical swimming pool. So you know, picture a swimming often there's a little border on the edge of the swimming pool, like a piece of concrete that lines the pool. You stand on that part before jumping in. And so the question was, if you had an elliptical swimming pool with a one foot border around it, is the outer edge of the border also on the lips. Something about that really appealed to me. It was a very nice math problem. Probably there was a little bit of a show off in me. Like I thought if I could do this, he's gonna say something Nice. You'll become part of the, yeah, maybe I'll enter the Pantheon. They'll start talking about me.

Speaker 14:         45:04          Like they used to talk about Jamie Williams. So I, I stopped whatever I was doing and I worked hard on that ellipse lips problem and I figured out two or three different ways to turns out it's never an ellipse if it cannot be an ellipsis. He sat down and wrote back to Mr Joffrey about this puzzle, but I didn't just show him the answer. I wrote the answer in a very loving and gentle way that was meant to be empathetic. That is, I know where you're coming from and I'm going to just start from scratch to lead you from where you are to where you need to be to solve this problem. In other words, Steve acted like he was the teacher and Mr Joffrey played along and this was such a generous thing. In retrospect, the humility, the modesty, the kindness in playing the role of a student. It's like he knew that that's what I needed and man, I loved it. I would, I couldn't wait for the next question and his, Steve went off to graduate school to become a math professor himself. He and Mr Joffrey kept writing to each other. In fact, they were writing to each other quite a lot. There was one sequence in March of 1989 where we wrote to each other almost every year.

Speaker 1:          46:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         46:14          he sent me a puzzle. I worked on it. I showed them a really beautiful answer. He expressed kind of ecstasy and seeing this answer

Speaker 1:          46:24          [inaudible] it was kind of a mathematician's dream correspondence of puzzles and equations and Steve loved it. But every so often

Speaker 14:         46:35          Mr Joffrey would break the routine a little bit. He would say things about that. He was doing some jazz piano gig. You would sometimes write about, he had three sons. He would talk about them a little bit and you know, I feel embarrassed I, it feels mean, but I remember not liking those parts of the letters and I didn't write about that. I mean, I would say maybe I was playing some tennis or, but I, I have lines in some of my letters that say after a few of those sentences, okay, enough stalling, here's the math problem. But then in later years he would almost pointedly ask me things like, there was a time when he said that rumor has it that you're engaged, we wish you the best. If this is true.

Speaker 14:         47:19          And guess what? In my letter back to him, I didn't say anything. Do you remember like thinking not to respond or just, well, I, I can tell you what was going on, which is that I was already, uh, in couple therapy with my fiance, you know, like in that time the letters were kind of refuge from all that. That is, we could go into this pristine world of math where things are simple and logical and well-ordered there may have been part of me that felt like I'll come on, this is the one place where it's all perfect. But over the years, that perfect world got a little less perfect because his oldest son died. Marshall died, Marshall died when he was only 27. And uh, I didn't ask about it. Can you believe this? I feel so sick about this when I think about it now.

Speaker 14:         48:19          So you would just write back, oh I've got another plug, got another math problem for you. Look at this. Um, yeah. And then more than 20 years into this relationship letter writing, Mr Joffrey retired and now that he couldn't teach anymore, he'd write to me, he'd show me these beautiful math problems that he would make up from self, usually about hawks flying over the earth and you know, how much severe Brickell area can the Hawk see if it's at such and such altitude. Um, and what is happening at this time is that now I have just gotten married and we've started having kids and I'm not answering his letters anymore. They're sitting in our envelope stacking up. He's riding them faster than I can answer them a lot faster. And then at one point I got one more letter from Mr Joffrey, except as soon as I looked at the envelope I could see that something was really very wrong. His handwriting didn't look normal. The, my address, my name was written in a craggy like shaky, shaky. And I knew what that looked like cause my dad wrote like that when he had Parkinson's. So I thought, what, what's this? And I opened the letter and the first sentence is [inaudible] I just had a mild stroke. I didn't write back to him right away. I didn't call him.

Speaker 14:         49:41          And then just a couple months later, my brother died very suddenly in and he heard about it from someone else and immediately wrote to me how, you know that he was fair. He and his wife had heard and they were very sorry to hear that my brother had died. That to me was um, you know, I still had never said I'm sorry about Marshall all those years ago and uh, it kept nagging at me. I want you to talk to him beckoning and obviously care about him. It's sort of like in math, there's this concept of bifurcation, which really means a fork in the road, a splitting. When the forces on a system get too large, there can be a moment when the dynamics of that system change abruptly.

Speaker 15:         50:30          Qualitative

Speaker 2:          50:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         50:32          this was a moment of bifurcation. We should've just said how sorry I was to hear about about Marshall. So I, I thought I got to go talk to him and ask him, can I come to your house? You know, he seemed a little reluctant about it, but you know, okay, fine. So I bought a little pocket tape recorder, just a cheap thing. Drove up route 95 to his house in Connecticut on the shore and knock on the door, hear the piano that was playing inside stop. He comes in, rushes to see me and we give each other hugs. Take out a big plate of cold cuts and say, let's sit out on the porch. So that work. Hello? So we're, we're eating and recording. Then he takes out his German.

Speaker 15:         51:19          I decided that I would keep a journal since I was retired where he's drawing pictures of all kinds of birds and there's a picture of me doing an ego watch out in the Connecticut River and there's a lot of stuff about [inaudible] and his typical way, I don't know, like this is a bird that's moved up from the south too. You never saw these one. What some people call buzzards. Yeah, they've moved up here. And uh, this is one of my favorite birds. It's a marsh hawk and the flies low over the meadows. Uh, more about that. Hank says, ah, I'm going to take you over to see a rough legged hawk now. He didn't say we're gonna see if we can see a rough Leggett hawk. Yeah, he produced [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         52:02          and I'm thinking to myself, I don't, not really interested in this. I want to talk about him, about all these things that are, that we never talked about that are emotional hard things. Like what happened? How did your son die? Yeah,

Speaker 15:         52:14          a lot of work. They're just trying to make guys put in extra hours to pay guys extra hours.

Speaker 14:         52:20          There was a fidgeting feeling inside me and benefits and other stuff and um, there was a pause. My heart was beating fast

Speaker 15:         52:36          then I thought I'm going to ask them now. I don't think we ever talked about Marshall, but I want it at night. I did. I asked what, I didn't really know him either, but he, I know that he died very young and I what, what happened? No, what happened to Marshall? Well wait, you know, that's helpful. You don't really want to talk about that. And I think he's going to say that's something we don't talk about well was if he had ever met as a star,

Speaker 2:          53:08          did he?

Speaker 15:         53:11          He did. He had a wonderful 27 years.

Speaker 14:         53:17          Music was gone. It was so beautiful. And so, um, and so uplifting and sweet. He'd be at home and we'd sit around the piano

Speaker 15:         53:26          and I'll get out the Cole porter song go can just turn to a page, something that he'd never seen. He could sight read it, play it, and sing it all in one time with us. And I thought, God, this guy's got a multichannel nine that I wish I had. You know, he talked about what a great, what a great life he had in his 27 years. In his waning moments, he'd stay up all night long playing the piano, just the house, which is filled with beautiful music. And he had made plans to get a job at the New England conservatory and things like that. But the faiths were wrong before. Oh yeah, we miss it.

Speaker 16:         54:22          Was, was that, I mean in that moment did, did it

Speaker 15:         54:28          changed the way you see him or will it change? I have to tell you how that day ended. So we talked more and I asked him at one point, do you think Marshall had a religious feeling? And he said he didn't think he felt close to having the come to terms with somebody out there. Yeah, that was a good thing that, that I think he went peacefully. Then actually conversation drifted to easier things like calculus problems and we talked to more about math and then he said, how about a swim or let's go to the beach, go out to the beach and I could do something where I get outdoors a little bit. So we did go to the beach and um,

Speaker 5:          55:07          it was a beautiful evening and there were waves coming in from long island sound. In fact, we were talking about a math problem about waves, about fourier analysis, which is really about, well infinity in the fact that if you take an infinite number of simple waves, you can create any shape of wave you want as long as it's a wave that repeats. But then Mr Joffrey asks, how do you create waves that don't repeat waves that change? Sometimes waves don't exactly repeat. They can grow or die out. And Steve told him that to deal with those kinds of waves, you need a different kind of infinity, not the kind where you just keep adding and adding and adding numbers. But the kind that sits in the space between two numbers, this higher kind of infinity than don had thought about before.

Speaker 2:          56:15          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          56:20          thanks. Juicer and wheeler, because you interviewed Steven produced that story. Thanks to Steve Strogatz who has the book out now, which tells this very story called the calculus of friendship. I'm Jad Abumrad meaning seconds to do. You are Robert Goldberg. Bye.
