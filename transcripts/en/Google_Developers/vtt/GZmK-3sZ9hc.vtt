00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:05.900
MANI DORAISAMY: My
name is Mani Doraisamy.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.320
I'm the founder of Guesswork,
a machine learning startup.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.150
We help CRM companies to
build predictive intelligence

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.180
in their product.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.690
There's a lot of buzz around
machine learning and big data

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.480
nowadays.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.080
I want to talk about how
it impacts ordinary uses.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.020
If you think about
successful products,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.380
they have three elements working
together very well-- software,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.020
infrastructure which
runs that software,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.365
and then the users
who make it useful.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.720
If you think about CRM,
for example, Salesforce

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.820
disrupted the CRM
market by combining

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.890
two of these elements, the
software and the infrastructure

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.830
portion of it.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.090
And thus, SAS was born.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.980
Software as a service was born.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.840
We think the next
big CRM will be

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.740
the one that combines
user intelligence along

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.960
with software as a service.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.690
Think about how sales people
interact with software today.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.390
That kind of intelligence will
be built inside the software.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.080
This is something that
every business software

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.090
will have in the next decade.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.120
This predictive intelligence
that machine learning offers

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.372
will augment human
intelligence and make

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.455
software more intelligent.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.330
If you think about CRM, CRM
records every interaction

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.770
about customers.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.140
But even with a wealth
of data, it still

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.396
doesn't understand
what customers want.

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:25.020
But on the other
hand, think about what

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.860
Google does in
Search and AdWords.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.890
It understands
customer intention

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.700
with a few keywords
they type in search box.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.860
And that makes it the largest
business in the world.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.450
Now it's time that CRM learns
from what Google does, and then

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.450
does the same kind
of customer intention

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.710
prediction inside CRM.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.870
With the launch of
Google Prediction API,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.430
Google has opened
up that secret sauce

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.090
as to how it predicts customer
intention to the developers.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.900
At Guesswork, we have taken
Google Prediction API,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.760
and we have simplified
it just for one use case,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.530
for one vertical-- to
predict customer intention

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.950
for CRM type of applications.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.525
Also, we have
built a rule engine

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.050
on top of Prediction API.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.180
Because most of these
predictions about customer

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.440
intention are kind of a
combination of both rules

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.160
as well as machine learning.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.030
So we have built that rule
engine to improve accuracy

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.200
on top of Google Prediction API.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.000
So I'm going to show you a demo
of how you can use Guesswork

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.660
to predict customer intention
and also personalize

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.720
customer interaction.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.590
So let's take an example
where a customer sends you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.810
an inquiry or a feedback.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.470
And then we want to understand
what that inquiry is all about

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.400
and automatically respond
to those inquiries.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.290
So by doing that, you
can make the sales people

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.220
more productive.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.590
But at the same time, by
understanding what customers

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.939
are asking, you'll
be able to understand

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.230
what the customer intention is.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.510
So you will understand what
kind of products he likes,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.940
or if he's most likely to
stay with your company,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.527
or is he going to churn out.

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:06.360
So that's the demo that
we're going to show.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.790
So here is our dashboard.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.210
So I'm going to
click on New Project.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.070
So once I click on
New Project, you

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.024
can select one of
these three templates

00:03:16.024 --> 00:03:16.940
that you already have.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.720
So let's name this
project as Autobot.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.805
And let's select the
auto-response engine template.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.080
And once you click Next, you
can see the design screen.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.750
Here, you get the customer's
feedback as the input.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.840
And we're going to
predict three information.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.740
So for example, let's
say a customer gives

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.270
a feedback saying,
the food was good.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.140
Now, in that case, we
predict that the category

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.040
of this feedback is food.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.400
And the property is quality.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.840
And the type of the
feedback is praise.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.810
So based on these
three predictions,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.570
we're going to
say, what should be

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.590
the feedback that the customer
representative or the sales

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.250
person should do?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.440
So let's click on Next.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.700
So this gives you
a screen where you

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.720
can upload the training data.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.420
In this case, you're
going to leave it

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.490
to the default training data.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.740
So Guesswork
automatically comes up

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.000
with a sample set of training
data to populate the project.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.910
So once I click on Publish
in the fourth screen,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.750
Guesswork automatically
creates the machine

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.470
learning project underneath.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.440
So it uses Google Prediction
API and then creates

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.380
the classification algorithm
that's needed for it,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.330
and also creates the
rule engine that's

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.740
needed to automatically respond
to these enquiries or feedback.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.750
So now that this is published,
I can go and click on Test.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.085
So let's see how that works.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.720
So I'm going to click on Run.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.200
So now you can see
the try it out screen.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.310
Here, I can give a feedback
saying, food was good.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.500
And when we click on test, you
can see that it automatically

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.550
predicts that the category
is food, property is quality,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.960
and type is praise.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.750
And it automatically comes
up with a response saying,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.660
we're glad that you
enjoyed the food.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.250
Hope we get an opportunity
to serve you again.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.260
So that's the demo.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.980
So what you saw was the ability
to automatically respond

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.270
to the inquiry and improve
the productivity of the sales

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.890
staff or the customer
service representative.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.000
But at the same time,
by understanding

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.720
what the customers
are speaking about,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.630
which product is
he talking about,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.300
and whether he is
praising the product

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.990
or complaining
about the product,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.610
you know exactly
what the customers

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.170
want so that sales people
can upsell or cross-sell

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.630
new products to the
customers from the CRM.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.792
I want to conclude
with two predictions

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:03.625
about the future of
predictive intelligence.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.020
Now, RelateIQ
acquisition by Salesforce

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.870
has caused huge interest in
machine learning in CRM space.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.280
We think other business software
verticals will follow suit,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.405
be it health care, HR, law, or
any other software verticals.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.320
The second one we
think will happen

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.200
is that as machine
learning infrastructures

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.820
like Google Prediction
API flourish,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.050
vertical services like
Guesswork will emerge.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.290
Because there is a lot of need
to fulfill machine learning

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.410
needs in business
specific verticals.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.260
So we think that will
happen in future.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.380
Thanks for listening.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.160
This is Mani Doraisamy
from Guesswork.
