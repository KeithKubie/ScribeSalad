00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.033
interviewer: All right, so can
you start off by giving us

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.901
a little introduction

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:09.601
to your applications
and your company?

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.534
de Halleux: Sure. My name
is Sebastien de Halleux.

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:13.901
I'm one of the founder
of Playfish,

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:15.501
and we are
a social games company,

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:18.033
so we make games for friends
to play together

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:20.033
in a social context.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:23.234
So what we're here
to announce today

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:24.701
is one of our most popular game,

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.467
which is a top-ten game
on Facebook,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:28.767
called
"Who Has The Biggest Brain?"

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:30.667
released for the first time
on Android.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.834
And this is very exciting,
because, for the first time,

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.634
you can play
with your real-life friends

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:36.734
on your Android phone.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:37.968
So you start the game,

00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:40.200
you're given
four 60-second tests,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.334
which spits out, you know,
how big a brain you have

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.534
in cubic centimeters
in a very unscientific way,

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:47.734
and then the fun starts

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.501
by comparing that score
with your real-life friends

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:54.400
on Facebook via a Facebook
connecting permutation.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000
And that's really exciting,
because you see

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.868
pictures of your friends
on your Android phone,

00:00:57.868 --> 00:00:59.501
and you can play
anytime anywhere.

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:03.300
Um, so this is the first title
that we're announcing,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.434
but we have a range of titles
that are coming on Android.

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:09.067
Overall, Playfish has around
30 million monthly active users

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:12.100
playing our games, so, you know,
there's a huge community

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.868
that really wants to extend
the experience from the web

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:18.067
onto their Android devices.

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:20.767
interviewer: All right.
So, can you tell us a little bit

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:24.601
about your decision to use
the Android platform?

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:25.767
de Halleux: Absolutely.

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:28.334
So, you know,
the Playfish founding team

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:30.501
has really deep roots in mobile.

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.701
We've been doing games on
mobile phones since about 2001,

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:37.000
and one of the key reasons
why we sort of moved away

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.300
from the mobile platform
and onto the web platform

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.634
was for distribution.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:44.000
And now that Android,
you know, comes into being

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.434
as an open platform on mobile,

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:48.767
we are incredibly excited
to bring back, you know,

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.234
some of the best of the web
when it comes to distribution,

00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:54.834
marketplace, and connectivity
on the internet,

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:57.534
allowing to connect
to third-party APIs,

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.200
something that's
always been very hard to do

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.834
in a standard mobile ecosystem.

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:04.701
So, you know, those
distribution decisions were key

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:06.901
you know, for us to move
on to the Android platform.

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.834
In addition, you know,
the great interface,

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:13.234
the touch screen, and
the relatively high-end device,

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:15.534
are making
for great gaming experiences.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.767
And our game have been designed
with touch screen in mind,

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:19.033
so it makes it--

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:20.968
It makes a very compelling
end-user experience.

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:24.100
I think, the third aspect
is the business model.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.234
So, you know, one thing is
you have great distribution.

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:28.868
The other one
is to be able to monetize

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:31.167
and build a business, you know,
on the mobile platform,

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.801
and traditionally,
carriers have been famous

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:36.767
for really, you know,
squeezing the publisher

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.667
and getting really high
revenue share for themselves,

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:42.000
and with Android as a platform,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.901
the ecosystem has
been rebalanced, so to speak,

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.601
with, you know,
the revenue share

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.701
that's publicly
been announced as being 70%

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.934
for the developer,
and that's great news for us,

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:53.133
because that means that, rather
than spending time and money

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.534
negotiating agreements
with every single carrier,

00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:56.801
you know, four per country,

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.033
we can focus
all our energy and budgets

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:00.300
on the product quality

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.033
and benefit
from the Google infrastructure

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:07.267
and the Android marketplace
to monetize our games.

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:11.200
interviewer: All right, uh,
what's the biggest challenge

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.367
you've had
on the Android platform?

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:16.267
de Halleux: I think, you know,
the biggest challenge is

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:17.767
that the platform is new,

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.767
and with new platforms come
unforeseen challenges.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.267
You know, some are technical,

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.701
and I think, you know,
games are usually very hungry

00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.133
in terms of device resources.

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:30.133
We've pushed, I think,
the OpenGL current capability,

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:31.567
you know, to their limit
in terms of getting

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:34.234
a high frame rate,
getting a smooth experience,

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:37.067
and similarly,
you know, getting audio,

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:38.834
getting really
time-based mechanics, you know,

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:40.300
that feel right for the user.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.968
It has been
a learning experience for us.

00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:44.701
The good news
is that what we've learned

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.868
is reusable in terms
of framework for our next game,

00:03:47.868 --> 00:03:50.868
and so, you know, the game
which we're already working on,

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:53.534
is being developed, you know,
at least twice the speed,

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.267
if not more.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.968
interviewer: All right. What's
the biggest differentiator

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:02.834
of Android versus
other platforms?

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:05.701
de Halleux: Well, you know, it's
the openness of the platform

00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:07.167
is really
the true differentiator.

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:10.267
For us, you know, our web view
is around 1.5 billion people,

00:04:10.267 --> 00:04:12.667
who are using the web
on any given day,

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:15.033
and there's 3.5 billion phones
out there, right?

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:17.634
And there's no open platform,

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:19.801
so I think Android
is really addressing a need

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:24.534
that is very, very strong for us
of offering an open platform

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.701
cheaply
to handset manufacturers.

00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:28.300
And with the announcement,
you know, today

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.234
of the number of new handsets
that are coming,

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:31.767
we'll see Android
getting more traction,

00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:34.033
and we want to be part
of that wave, you know.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.601
We want to be one of the reasons
why people, you know,

00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:39.634
move to Android,
and making them realize

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:41.067
that there's
great content available

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:44.033
for those open platforms.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.234
interviewer: Uh, are there
any tips or tricks

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:50.000
that you were able to do
on the Android platform

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.801
that you weren't
on other platforms?

00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:55.934
Anything fun
or interesting?

00:04:55.934 --> 00:05:01.100
de Halleux: Um, I think,
you know, one of the great,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.868
uh, realization of Playfish
and "Who Has the Biggest Brain?"

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:07.501
has been that social connection,

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:11.634
so the ability to create
a very, very transparent

00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:14.367
end-user experience that,
within two clicks,

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:16.234
you know, connects you
to your social graph,

00:05:16.234 --> 00:05:18.033
wherever it might be,
in this case Facebook,

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:20.100
you know, is
a really powerful experience,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.734
because, suddenly, you see
your phone in a different way.

00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:25.133
You see your phone
as a window onto the real web,

00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:28.167
and you should see people,
when they first experience this,

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:29.767
there's a big "aha" moment,
going,

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:30.868
"Oh, you know, all my friends

00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:32.367
who don't have
an Android device,

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:34.934
but are part
of my group of friends,

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.200
are suddenly invited as part
of the experience on my phone."

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.367
And that's a really cool moment.

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:40.367
interviewer: Right, right.

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.434
Um, what's your favorite aspect

00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:46.067
of the Android
development process?

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:47.267
de Halleux: I think
it's definitely been

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:48.834
the development program.

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:51.334
You know, the team has been
incredibly supportive.

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:54.267
Our development has been
spread across continent,

00:05:54.267 --> 00:05:56.534
and from London
to Mountain View.

00:05:56.534 --> 00:05:58.100
We've had, you know,
fantastic support

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.334
to answer some
of our technical challenges,

00:06:00.334 --> 00:06:02.200
some of which
were platform-related,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.567
some of which were, you know,
our learning experience,

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:05.734
and addressing those together

00:06:05.734 --> 00:06:08.400
has been really
a tremendous experience.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.767
interviewer: So you have a game

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:12.234
that's about to be released
on iGoogle?

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.501
de Halleux: That's right.
As a matter of fact,

00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:15.367
it is the same game
we just released on Android,

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:16.634
"Who Has the Biggest Brain?"

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:20.000
which is now available
in the sandbox of iGoogle,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.501
using your Google friends,

00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:25.667
so that's another social graph
we're trying to tap into.

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:27.901
And for people
who are using the iGoogle page,

00:06:27.901 --> 00:06:29.400
they'll be able to find
"Who Has the Biggest Brain?"

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.934
as a gadget on the web,

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:34.033
um, and then they'll be able,
when they leave their PC,

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.601
to take their Android phone
and continue the experience,

00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:38.767
and this is the exactly
same application,

00:06:38.767 --> 00:06:40.667
so they can practice
and train their brain

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:42.501
and share scores
with their friends, you know,

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.133
on their phone
or on iGoogle.

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:45.300
interviewer: All right.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.501
Well, I want to thank you
for your time

00:06:46.501 --> 00:06:47.701
and sharing
your story with us.

00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:49.367
I hope you have
a great rest of your day.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.767
de Halleux: Great, thank you.
