00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.390
Let's do the practice
question with speed.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.890
Let's say I drive 160 miles in 3 hours.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.070
What is my speed?

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.020
Be careful 3 doesn't
divide evenly into 160,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.780
so please round to one decimal place.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.060
Enter your answer here, a unit rate
with one hour in the denominator.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.400
I've already given you
the denominator and

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.470
don't forget to include
your unit in the numerator.
