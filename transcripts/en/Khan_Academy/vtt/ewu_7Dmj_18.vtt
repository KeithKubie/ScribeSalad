00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.260
The idea of a Nash equilibrium
is important enough

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.896
that I think it
deserves its own video.

00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:07.270
And you may or
may not know, it's

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.700
named for John
Nash, who was played

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.440
by Russell Crowe in the
movie "A Beautiful Mind."

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.940
And it's a game
theoretical concept.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730
And game theory
sounds very fancy,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.791
but it really is just
the theory of games.

00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:20.790
And this prisoner's dilemma
that we talked about

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.631
in the previous video
really is a game.

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:25.630
The different players
have different strategies,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.830
and based on their
interacting strategies,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.390
you end up in different states.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.280
You end up with
different outcomes.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.354
And here's a definition of Nash
equilibrium from Princeton.

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:36.270
And that's a good place
to get the definition,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.419
because that's where John Nash
spent a good bit of his career.

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:41.210
And it is defined, or
this definition says,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.610
it's a stable state
of a system that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.770
involves several
interacting participants--

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.630
in our prisoners' dilemma,
we had two participants--

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.410
in which no participant can
gain by a change of strategy

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.510
as long as all the other
participants remain unchanged.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.260
So let's think about the
different states of this system

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.640
right over here and think
of whether any of them

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.620
meet this criteria.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.590
So let's say, let me
number this one-- let's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.000
say that is state 1.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.340
This is state 2.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.690
This is state 3, and this
is state 4 right over here.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.460
So if we are sitting, if
we are sitting in state 1,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.890
can any of the
participants change

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.490
their strategy-- can gain
by changing their strategy,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.970
assuming the other
participant is constant?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.810
So if we are sitting here in
state one right over here,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.390
so Al is denying and
Bill is denying-- well,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.990
Al can improve his situation
by changing his strategy.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.160
He can go from denying,
which is the scenario here,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.450
to confessing.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.337
So Al can change his
strategy and gain.

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:52.420
Or you could go the other.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.110
Assuming Bill was
constant in the denial--

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.360
or you could go the other way.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.880
If we're sitting here in state
4 and we assume Al is constant,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.170
Bill can improve his situation
by going from a denial

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.870
to a confession.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.770
He can go from two
year to one year.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.480
So for both of those reasons--
if either of those were true,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.095
this would not be
a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:15.220
But both of those are true.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.350
So this is definitely
not a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.960
I gave two examples in
which a participant can

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.250
gain by a change of strategy as
long as the other participant

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.960
remains unchanged.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.200
This move was one example,
and this was a move by Al,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.340
with Bill's denial constant.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.340
This was a move by Bill,
with Al's denial constant.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.410
Not a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.900
Now let's think about--
let's think about state 2.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.360
If we are sitting in state
2, assuming Bill is constant,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.670
can Al change to
improve his outcome?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.560
So can Al change to
improve his outcome?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.820
In state 2, Al was
only getting one year.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.520
If Al goes from a
confession to a denial

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.230
he's going to get two years.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.740
So Al cannot change his
strategy and get a gain here.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.250
So far it's looking good.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.780
But let's think of it
from Bill's point of view.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.370
So if we are in state 2, if we
are in state 2 right over here,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.060
and we assume Al is
constant, can Bill

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.000
do something that
changes things?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.430
Well, sure, Bill can go
from denying to confessing.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.480
If he goes from denying
to confessing he

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.200
goes from 10 years in prison
to three years in prison.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.470
So I've given an example
of a participant who

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.320
can gain by a change of
strategy as long as all

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.190
of the other participants
remain unchanged.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.930
Both of them don't have
to be able to do this.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.370
You just need to
have one of them

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.400
for it to not be a
Nash equilibrium.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.110
Because Bill can have a
gain by a change of strategy

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.220
holding Al's strategy
constant, so holding

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.220
Al's strategy in the
confession, then this

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.360
is not a Nash equilibrium.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.160
So this is not Nash,
because you have

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.640
this movement can occur to a
more favorable state for Bill

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.480
holding Al constant.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.210
Now, let's go to state 3.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.850
Let's think about this.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.940
So if we're in state 3,
so this is Bill confessing

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.070
and Al denying-- so let's first
think about Al's point of view.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.339
If we assume Bill is
constant in his confession,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.550
can Al improve his scenario?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.480
Well, sure.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.230
He can go from
denying, which is what

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.750
would have to be in
state 3, to confessing.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.990
So he could move in this
direction right over here.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.700
And that by itself
is enough evidence

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.516
that this is not a
Nash equilibrium.

00:04:36.516 --> 00:04:38.140
We don't even have
to think about Bill.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.980
And it's symmetric.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.521
There's actually nothing that
Bill could do in this scenario,

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:43.530
holding Al constant, that
could improve things.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.680
Bill would not want to
go from here to here.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.100
But just by the fact that Al
could go from here to here,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.140
holding Bill constant,
tells you that this is not

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.300
a Nash equilibrium.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.985
Now let's go to scenario 4.

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:57.360
And you know where
this is going,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.964
because you watched
the last video.

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:00.630
But it's a little--
I'm going through it

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.860
in a little bit in more detail.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.990
In state 4, they
are both confessing.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.320
Now let's look at it
from Al's point of view.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.130
And we're going to
hold Bill constant.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.589
We're going to hold
Bill unchanged.

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.505
So we're going to have
to stay in this column.

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.880
We're going to say that,
assume that Bill's confessing.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.720
From Al's point of view,
if we are in state 1,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.907
can he change his strategy
to get a better outcome?

00:05:21.907 --> 00:05:24.240
Well, the only thing he could
do is go from a confession

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.897
to a denial.

00:05:24.897 --> 00:05:26.230
But that's not going to do good.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.146
He's going to go from
three years to 10 years.

00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:32.120
So Al cannot gain by
a change of strategy,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.965
as long as all the
participants remain unchanged.

00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:37.090
Now let's think about it
from Bill's point of view.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.910
We're in this state
right over here.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.710
We're going to assume
that Al is constant,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.990
that Al is in the
confession mode.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.080
So Bill, right now, in
state 4, is confessing.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.990
His only option is to deny.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.470
But by doing that, he'll go
from three years in prison

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.570
to 10 years in prison.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.020
So he's not going to gain.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.960
So he, too, cannot gain.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.790
So we've just found
a state in state 4

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.860
which no participant can
gain by a change of strategy

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.300
as long as all other
participants remain unchanged.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.870
And this part is important.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.020
Because we're not saying that
both can change simultaneously.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.280
You are not, in
this payoff matrix,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.270
allowing a diagonal move.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.910
And so no participant can
gain, neither Al nor Bill,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.540
holding the other one constant.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.596
This is a Nash equilibrium.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.500
This one right here.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.840
And this is a stable state.
