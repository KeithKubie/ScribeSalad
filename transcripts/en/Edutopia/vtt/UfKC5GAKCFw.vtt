&gt;&gt;Jill Levine: At Normal Park,

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:07.296
we believe that learning should
not be bound by the front

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:10.066
and back covers of a textbook or
the four walls of our building.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.176
We did a lot of thinking
to figure out,

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:15.736
what is a museum magnet school?

00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:18.976
Every week, our students go
to a museum or on some type

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.186
of learning expedition.

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:22.366
That's where the learning
really comes to life.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.226
As a museum school, we're
connected with seven museums.

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:27.366
We have a contract
with the museums

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.686
which basically gives
us unlimited access

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:31.046
on a certain day of the week.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.696
Every student has a museum
passport, so they can go

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:36.656
for free back to the museums on
the weekends or in the evenings

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:38.946
and then, the museum
educators plan

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:40.796
with our teachers
once each quarter.

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:44.266
We really try to figure out
how we can enhance the content

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.966
learning that's going
on in the classroom

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:48.566
by teaching art concepts
at the same time.

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:52.666
We opened the school
in 2002, and in 2005,

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.676
we were named the top
magnet school in the nation

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:55.946
by Magnet Schools of America.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.846
We've received the John F.
Kennedy School of Distinction

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:01.316
in Arts Education, which
is a national award.

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:05.276
And we've been designated as a
State Reward School in Tennessee

00:01:05.326 --> 00:01:07.726
for having some of the highest
test scores in the state.

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:14.446
The Normal Park way is basically
a list of strategies that we use

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:17.856
that everyone on the faculty
agrees these things are best

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.456
practices for students.

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.466
So, it includes exhibit
building,

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:24.956
planning with understanding
by design, guided reading,

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:28.746
teaching problem-solving in
math using the Singapore math

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:30.246
model-drawing approach.

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:33.306
It includes collaboration
and organization.

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:37.086
The two keys to our success as
a school in our transformation

00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:39.346
and then our ongoing
success in terms

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.646
of student achievement are, one,

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:44.496
that I hire the best
possible teachers and, two,

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:47.176
that there's this consistency
of instructional program,

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:49.436
that what happens in a
first-grade classroom happens

00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:51.006
in a third-grade
classroom and happens

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:52.326
in a seventh-grade classroom.

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:56.116
Our whole curriculum for science
and social studies is organized

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.346
into nine-week blocks that
we refer to as modules.

00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:02.816
To plan those modules, we use
"understanding by design."

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:05.216
People often refer to
this as backward planning.

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:07.666
We first think about
the big ideas, you know,

00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:10.246
what do students have to
know and be able to do,

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:13.476
and then what are the big
understandings that can carry

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:16.406
over from one content
area to another?

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:19.156
So, for example, where you
live affects how you live.

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:22.066
Then they look at, how are
we going to assess that?

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:24.366
For us at a museum
magnet school,

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:26.556
those assessments
are our exhibits

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:27.766
and also the travel journals.

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:31.776
Every nine weeks, the whole
school turns into a museum.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.656
The halls will be filled
with parents and children

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.986
who are all here to celebrate
what their children have

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:41.136
accomplished in the past nine
weeks, the students' writing,

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:43.856
the students' problem-solving,
the students' thinking,

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:46.296
and it really is a
great way for students

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:48.146
to share their learning
with their parents.
