00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:06.250
MICHELE TURNER:
I'm Michele Turner.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.990
Welcome to Smart Home 101.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm the director of product
for the Smart Home ecosystem.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.795
I am here with my
colleagues, Vera Tzoneva,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:20.920
who runs all of business
development for the Google

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.070
Smart Home ecosystem and our
technical lead, David Schairer.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.240
We are super excited to have
you guys here this morning.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.870
So let's talk a little
bit about Smart Home.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.940
We've seen the
evolution of technology

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.460
over the last 30 years,
starting with the PC moving

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.283
to the internet to smart home.

00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:40.450
And now we think we're at
the beginning of the stage

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.060
of ambient computing.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.430
It's interesting if you
look back at the mobile era,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.850
mobile went on for a long time
before it really just became

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.750
very dominant.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.210
And it took the advent
of the smart phone

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.200
to be able to do that.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.960
What we're seeing
with ambient computing

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.290
and smart home is smart home
has been long for a while.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.260
I imagine in fact, I know
that there are some of you

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.560
out there in the audience today
that have X10 systems at home.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.980
But it did not actually
start to become something

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.150
that mainstream users started
to use until the advent of voice

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.190
in ambient computing.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.500
We really believe that the
next leap in technology

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.110
in the hardware space is going
to come from the application

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.750
of AI to hardware and software.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.750
So to achieve the
vision of where

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.790
we're headed with smart
home, two years ago,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.710
we launched the
ability for developers,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.962
like yourselves, to leverage
the actions on Google Platform

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:36.170
to integrate their smart
home devices with the Google

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.490
Assistant.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.380
For smart home
integrations, we focused

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.790
on making sure
that we could have

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.290
simple and seamless interfaces
within the AOG console.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.050
This also allows
developers to leverage

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.390
contextual understanding
that drives

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.540
the intelligent interactions
with their users.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.120
To ensure that this
contextual understanding was

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.580
available to developers,
we created the Home Graph.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.220
The Home Graph is
our technology that

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.200
understands the
contextual relationships

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.220
between structures, users,
and devices and rooms.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.160
So if you take a look, this is
a super simple representation

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.910
of the Home Graph.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.670
Within the structure, we
have the structured names.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.750
So I might have Ramona
as the name my structure.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.720
We have the address, we have
the managers of the structure.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.050
In my house, it's
myself and my husband.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.550
We have all the rooms that are
in the structure, the devices

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.400
within those rooms, and we also
have a knowledge of presence--

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.340
is the room occupied or not?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.370
We have knowledge of the room.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.250
So we have the name of
the room, living room.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.792
And we have the
devices in that room.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.780
I might have a speaker and a TV.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.400
And then we have
an understanding

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.200
of the devices
themselves-- so the name

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200
of the device, the type of
the device, is that a camera,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.300
is it a light bulb?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.403
The traits associated
with that device,

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:54.320
so if it's a light bulb,
we would have on/off,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.510
we'd also have colors.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.760
In more advanced bulbs,
we have sleep/wake,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.880
so lots of different types
of traits and attributes

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.660
that were evolving with these
different devices these days.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.220
And finally, the
state of the device,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.290
is that device on or off?

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.660
All of this information
in the Home Graph

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.080
enables us to have
apply context to what's

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.040
going on in your home.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.890
And this is what makes
homes truly smart.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.180
This also allows us to do
some interesting things.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.140
So like in my home
today, if I say, OK,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.080
G, turn off all the lights,
all the lights my home go off,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.500
which is great at night
when I want to go to bed.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.880
But if I'm standing in the
master bedroom and I say,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.750
OK, G, turn on the lights,
only lights my master bedroom

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.090
go on, because it
understands what room

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.550
I'm in when I'm
making that request.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.690
So being able to do more
intelligent interactions

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.180
like that is what the context
behind Home Graph enables.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.400
So our smart home API
does all the work for you.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.680
It's really simple
to get integrated.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.340
And I don't know how many first
time smart home developers are

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.850
in here today, but you can get
going with Our Smart home API

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.780
very quickly.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.270
There's only one API that
you need to implement.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.640
We send you the queries
and the commands.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.430
You send us your device
information, the state

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.580
information, and any out
of band notifications,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.230
and the Assistant
does all the rest.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.930
You don't have to
write any grammar,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.880
you don't have to do any
internationalization,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.899
we take care of all
of that for you.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.480
And we have ample documentation
and reference implementations

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480
to help you get started.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.855
In fact, if you're interested,
go check out the code labs

00:04:27.855 --> 00:04:30.470
later on today.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.610
So we've grown a lot
in the last two years,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.600
and we now work with over
3,500 brands globally.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.330
We would love to have you
as one of our developers

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.910
if you're not already
started with us today.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.740
We work with developers of
all sizes, from Ali Baba--

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.310
who you've probably
heard of them.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.420
They're a very big is
a platform in China,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.580
and they provide their
own smart home platform

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.910
as well that help developers
integrate with the Assistant

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.360
over in China, FLO by Moen
which is a leak detection

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.930
system and a valve that
helps consumers save water,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.480
the Panasonic Home Energy
Management System that's

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.200
in Japan.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.270
Energy management
is a big area where

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.600
smart home can play a prominent
role in our environment.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.470
And finally, the TELUS smart
home devices in Australia.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.770
So over the last year, we've
really spanned it globally.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.370
And we're very excited to see
how this expansion plays out

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.480
over the next few years.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.360
But we're also seeing
a really big shift

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.200
in how consumers expect to be
able to control their homes.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.760
When we think about
the helpful home,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.740
it needs to be intelligent,
personal, and predictive.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.150
Consumers want a whole home, not
just a collection of devices.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.360
And those of you who have smart
devices in your homes today,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.790
you know what I mean.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.140
They don't interact as
well today as they should,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.910
and we need to fix that.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.445
They also want simple
pairing and device

00:05:56.445 --> 00:05:59.258
to device integrations
that just work.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.050
One of the things that's
really challenging

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.090
is getting these devices online.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.860
It's just too hard today still.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.313
So later on today at 4:30
right here on the stage,

00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:08.730
if you're interested,
you can come

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.130
learn about how we're
doing local integrations,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.470
local execution,
and seamless setup

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.000
through the Google Assistant.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.430
It's going to take care of a
lot of these simple pairing

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.280
and seamless integration issues.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.070
They also want a platform
that works for them

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.123
but always ask permission.

00:06:25.123 --> 00:06:27.540
One of the things that's really
important about smart home

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.640
is that we give users control.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.560
We can never do
this without making

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.240
sure users feel
like they're totally

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.860
in control of their homes.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.200
But we have a lot of
contextual understanding

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.640
where we can enable
things to happen for them.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.220
So if we want to be able to
do predictable tasks for them,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.800
like if somebody leaves the
house and the garage door

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.530
is not closed, you want
to probably notify them

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.320
that their garage door isn't
closed before you just go ahead

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.972
and close it for
them automatically.

00:06:54.972 --> 00:06:56.430
But there are a
lot of other things

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.070
that are predictable,
like things

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.360
at bedtime or certain alarms.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.340
And within user's
control, we can

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.400
start to program those to just
happen for the modern magically

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.780
to make the smart home a whole
lot smarter and more helpful.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.320
Finally, we've a lot of sensors
that we are collectively

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.580
putting into people's homes.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.640
And this is going to enable
a lot of new services

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.790
that together, we're going
to be able to create services

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.610
around security, around
energy management,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.290
and around elder
care and wellness.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.880
And this is a
growing trend that I

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.860
think is really
exciting for consumers.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.200
So we started back in 2016.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.530
And we started out with
just a handful of devices--

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.800
lights, plugs,
thermostats, and switches.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.010
And we've grown pretty massively
over the last few years.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.460
And this year in 2019,
you can connect everything

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.480
from your fireplace to your
pergola and pretty much

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.530
everything in between.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.530
If you have a device
that you're developing

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.950
and it's not on here, please
find one of us over the Sandbox

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.510
a little later, because
we can help you with that.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.600
So let's talk about the
basic smart home with the AOG

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.890
platform.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:13.260
We have a really simple core
model with our smart home API.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.320
We use device types to represent
the taxonomy of the devices.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.310
A light is a light,
a vacuum is a vacuum.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.710
And even if you created
all kinds of cool features

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.460
within your device, they're
just a basic device type to us.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.300
Device traits is where we
start to differentiate.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.880
The device traits give us
a lot of functionality.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.280
And they're the building blocks
for the new device types,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.030
as we'll see more in
the demo that Dave is

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.289
going to give you in a minute.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.440
And finally, as I talked
about the Home Graph

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.679
is where this all comes together
and allows the assistant

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.750
to help make the smart
home truly smart.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.910
We've really focused a
lot on developer tools

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.690
and ease of use.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.440
And in fact, we've added
a lot to the AOG console

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.410
this year for smart home.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.340
The devices that we're doing
now, like appliances and home

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.630
security, in many ways are a lot
more complex and the devices we

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.130
were starting with in 2016.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.920
However, we've made
developing with a smart home

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.130
API a lot easier, and it's
also a lot more process driven.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.990
In fact, one of the
things that we've done

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.270
is we've enabled a self
certification program

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.432
that we just recently
launched that will help

00:09:20.432 --> 00:09:22.140
you get through the
certification process

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.350
more quickly and get your device
in market with the Assistant

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.150
a lot faster.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.240
Our cloud to cloud APIs are
lightweight and easy to use.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.830
And the majority
of our developers

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.975
integrate very quickly.

00:09:32.975 --> 00:09:34.350
In fact, most of
the integrations

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.517
are up within six weeks,
but we've actually

00:09:36.517 --> 00:09:38.850
had some developers be able
to get their integrations up

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:39.550
in a day.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.670
So it really just
depends on what you have,

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.740
your past experience, and the
complexity of your integration.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.840
So let's talk about some of the
new things we have coming out.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.170
We have a lot more functionality
coming out this year.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.280
We have a bunch of new traits,
including Dispense, new app

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.740
capabilities, account linking,
and some expanded languages.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.080
So traits, traits
are the behaviors

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.210
of devices that are invoked
through the smart home

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.140
grammars.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.690
Lock and unlock is a pretty
simple example of that.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.670
We have a lot more
complex traits

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.830
that are coming out this year.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.930
The traits, like
lock and unlock,

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.750
can apply to multiple devices.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.290
So something like unlock and
a lock can be used for doors,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.320
but they could also
be used for windows.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.195
And they're invoked
through grammars such as,

00:10:27.195 --> 00:10:28.980
OK, G, lock the front door.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.310
What's interesting is that our
trait model is not specifically

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.620
matched to a device.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.000
They can be applied to a
lot of different devices.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.030
Take zones for an example,
which we released this year.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.070
We originally developed
the zone trait

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.430
to work with robot vacuums.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.240
There are new
robot vacs that can

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.950
go understand and map
an open floor plan house

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.740
and mark off a living
room or a kitchen.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.020
And you can just say,
OK, G, clean the kitchen.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.360
And even if you're an
open floor plan house,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.080
the robot back knows
exactly what area to clean,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.820
because it knows
what zone that is.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.470
It's pretty cool.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.720
Then we started working with
some sprinkler developers

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.830
like Rocio and Rain
Bird and they said, hey,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.780
we have zones too.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.660
So the zone trait is now
used for sprinklers and robot

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.480
vacs, something that's just
pretty obvious when you think

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.892
about it but not something
that you would necessarily

00:11:17.892 --> 00:11:20.100
be aware of when you're
first thinking about "traits"

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.830
relative to devices.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.070
You could check out the Sandbox
for examples of our new traits

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.700
we have.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.830
Most of these new
traits that we have

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.760
are being shown in
the sandbox today.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.270
You also get touch for free.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.860
And we are seeing while
voice is awesome for most use

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.690
cases for the smart home,
touch is being used a lot.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.910
Consumers have an option
of using the Google Home

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.470
app, the Google Assistant,
app or the Google Home Hub.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.850
And with the Google Home Hub,
we have the Home View on there.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.900
The Home View
actually you can see

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.300
looks very much like
the interface that's

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.410
on the Google Home
app today, making

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.448
it a really consistent user
experience for yoour consumers.

00:12:03.448 --> 00:12:05.740
And because your devices are
integrated inside the Home

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.160
Graph, all of this information
is pulled out of the Home Graph

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.650
and into the UX on our
displays and our apps

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.770
so that is just
completely mirrored,

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.583
and you don't need
to do any extra work

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.000
to have your devices show up
in any of our touch controls.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.470
Next slide.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.030
We've also expanded the
functionality in the Assistant

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.750
app to show the home's summary.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.870
So you can see it's
72 degrees at home

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.580
and the living
room lights are on

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.170
and the backyard camera is on.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.270
We've added a lot
of new functionality

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.770
into the Assistant app to really
represent the smart home well.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.990
So Vera's going to get
a lot more into this,

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.260
but one area that we're
super excited about this

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.030
solves a big problem
for smart home users

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.670
is improved account linking.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.950
For those of you that
are partners today,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.650
we know that we struggle
getting consumers

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.880
to link from your device into
the Assistant from your app

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.962
into our app.

00:13:04.962 --> 00:13:06.170
This can be a real challenge.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.820
So we've added two things.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.630
One is seamless setup
through the local home SDK.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.300
And the other is something
calling Google account linking,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.350
or App Flip.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.740
And App Flip is really easy.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.700
I'm going to let Vera tell
you more about it in a second.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.180
But it essentially
just lets you go

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.690
from the Home or the
Assistant app into your app

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.190
and back through
the OAuth process,

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.162
making it significantly easier
and streamlined for consumers.

00:13:29.162 --> 00:13:31.245
We're also doing a ton of
international expansion.

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:34.270
And I think this is a
great area where Google

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.640
can leverage a lot
of our core strengths

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.350
around internationalization.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.170
We added 18 different
languages in 2018.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.330
We're adding another
18 this year,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.350
bringing this up to over 36
countries by the end of 2019.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.990
And just by integrating
with the smart home API,

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.472
you get language
support for free.

00:13:51.472 --> 00:13:53.180
You don't have to do
any additional work.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.510
So if you want to expand
into a new country,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.630
you're pretty much assured
that the languages, the grammar

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.670
will work for that country
that you're expanding into.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.620
And finally, I want to
touch on Report State.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.980
Last year at I/O, we
announced Reports State,

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.430
and you guys have been awesome
about providing State reporting

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.470
into the smart home API.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.630
But one of the things
that I wanted to touch on

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.880
is we've gotten a lot of
feedback from our developers,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.470
from you guys, about how
we could do this better.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.860
So we've added a few things.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:32.350
If you have multiple devices
that you want to OAuth through,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.890
you can now let your users
choose which devices they

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.385
want to provide State to Google
through the OAuth process,

00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:40.010
which is great.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.860
It gives users more
control over their data.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.500
Another thing to remember is
that State data is ephemeral.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.690
We don't hang on to this data.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.970
And finally, this data is
only used in Home Graph.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.450
We get a lot of questions
about, well where do State data?

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.190
The data is only held
in the Home Graph.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.837
It doesn't go into any of
Google's other systems.

00:14:56.837 --> 00:14:58.420
So you can rest
assured that that data

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.030
is really protected
and used only

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.160
to help the contextual
understanding,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.890
because it is an odd experience
if we don't have State data

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:10.660
and somebody says, OK, G, lock
the door and then they go up

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.377
and they look on their app or
they look on one of the Home

00:15:13.377 --> 00:15:15.460
Hubs and they go away, oh
wait, I locked the door,

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.377
why is it not showing
that the door is locked,

00:15:17.377 --> 00:15:19.710
it's a really confusing
experience for consumers.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.090
So State's super important,
but so is privacy.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.100
So we are doing our best to
apply both of those things.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.220
All right.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.900
That's it for me.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.960
I am going to hand it
over to David right now.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.430
And he is going to show
you, among other things,

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.195
how to protect your cookies

00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:38.320
Thank you so much, Michele.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.860
So when we talk in terms of
features of the smart home

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:50.140
ecosystem, we break this down
into four categories in fact--

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.310
lights and switches-- pretty

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.180
obvious.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.150
On/off color
brightness-- integration

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.370
with [INAUDIBLE] and
[INAUDIBLE] and so forth.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.210
Entertainment devices,
much more complex.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.500
Media initiation,
media control--

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.090
lots of complexity around
targeting and understanding

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.170
five smart devices in one
physical stack of media

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.310
devices.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:14.410
Home security, security systems,
cameras, alarms, sensors,

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.400
doorbells.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.380
And then energy
comfort and control,

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.620
that's everything else.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.960
It's your appliances.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.610
It's your vacuums.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.895
It's your bathroom utilities.

00:16:24.895 --> 00:16:27.040
Sort of all the things
that make your home

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.370
be not that box, but
actually a lifestyle.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.190
The nice thing is that all of
these four things, these four

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.760
verticals, are really the
same API, the same ecosystem.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.870
And you can build
one integration

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.500
and then add in all the
devices that you support.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.270
And increasingly, as
we add new features,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.373
as you add new features,
grow your ecosystem

00:16:45.373 --> 00:16:46.540
and our ecosystem over time.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.388
We talked a lot about commercial
products in the marketplace.

00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:54.180
And you've seen lots
of commercial products

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.030
on store shelves using
the Google Assistant

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.910
and using Smart Home to
integrate their devices.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.020
But there's a lot more that can
be done for individual users,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.680
for makers, for
developers, for education,

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.020
all using the same ecosystem.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.599
In fact, we have several orders
of magnitude, more developer

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:17.490
accounts and developer
setups in the system

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.210
than we have
commercial partners.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.754
And if you're a maker, if
you're using this stuff at home,

00:17:22.754 --> 00:17:25.994
if you're doing hacker
projects like this,

00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:27.930
this whole ecosystem
is available to you.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.280
I was visiting a friend's
house a few weeks ago,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.170
he has 700 Smart Home devices
all set up in his house.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.060
He's all done
individual integrations

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.870
using his own on prem
implementation of our APIs

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:43.650
to do a really, really
personalized implementation.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.150
He has more time
than I do, clearly.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.420
But he's done a significant
job to make all voice control,

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.170
all assistant touch for an
entirely custom home build.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.960
If you're are a developer, if
you have a prototype product,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.350
you can use our developer
APIs to prototype

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.260
you the entire experience, have
everything available for demo,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.270
do your drive up and
down Sandhill Road,

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.493
hardware in hand with
full voice integration.

00:18:05.493 --> 00:18:06.660
We don't need to prove that.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.952
It's just all available to you.

00:18:07.952 --> 00:18:10.080
And likewise, we have
a tremendous number

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.210
of STEM projects in the system.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.780
College, high school, even
some junior high folks

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.400
that are learning
how to code, very

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.930
easy to take some
of the open source

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.250
platforms they already
have, like Home Assistant,

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.690
integrate it with a Raspberry
Pi hardware project.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.795
And for anyone who's
learning how to program,

00:18:25.795 --> 00:18:28.170
have full voice control, full
touch control over whatever

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.320
device they happen to make.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.323
As Michelle said, we have
two innovation paths.

00:18:33.323 --> 00:18:34.740
I'm going to demo
the cloud today.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.080
The cloud is what we've had
since the start of time,

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.330
which for us is late 2016.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.313
Very easy to build.

00:18:40.313 --> 00:18:41.730
Very easy to deploy
if you already

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.960
have cloud infrastructure.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.550
And then, later today, we'll be
launching our local Home SDK.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.130
It uses exactly the same
design language, same type,

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.470
same traits, same API
representation of things,

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.907
but you can actually run your
controller on our hardware.

00:18:56.907 --> 00:18:58.990
You don't need to run all
your stuff in the cloud.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.782
It's much more scalable
for you because you

00:19:00.782 --> 00:19:04.380
don't need to deploy your
cloud at the scale of events.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.660
[INAUDIBLE] devices
for onboarding.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.890
And performance, of course, is
inside Google, and improved.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.950
So please, come by, if you
can, 5:30 on this stage,

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.300
with my counterparts
[INAUDIBLE] are

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.472
going to be presenting that.

00:19:17.472 --> 00:19:18.930
If you're watching
this on YouTube,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.013
you should be able to see
that talk somewhere over

00:19:21.013 --> 00:19:23.730
there, or possibly down
here, because I'm sure it'll

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.940
be related to this one.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.360
Again, the Local Home SDK
works the same as the cloud.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.060
You can integrate with the
cloud to get your device sync

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.000
and query, and then
use execution and state

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.030
management directly on the local
network with the Google Home

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:39.568
Devices.

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:40.860
You don't need a Google device.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.100
The Cloud still works.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.730
But you have the local
path available to you

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.060
for that high performance,
highly scalable infrastructure.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.970
Now, I'm going to turn it
over and do some demos here.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.510
We have-- log-in--

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.612
we have here a little
hacker smart device project.

00:20:00.612 --> 00:20:02.070
This is the same
cookie jar that we

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.430
have over in the sandbox
in the assistant tent

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.040
two buildings over.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.020
It is-- it's logged
me out, of course.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.550
This is basically a permanent
electromagnet on the lid.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.530
Right here I have a
Raspberry Pi controller

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.240
that connects to the cloud.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.230
I have a cloud instance
running on our little Debian 9

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.590
instance that has the cloud
controller this connects

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.390
to and implements our API.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.440
So I have already built
over here in the Actions

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.810
on Google Console a Smart
Home project, that's

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.750
this cookie jar project here.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.410
And I have set it up with OAuth.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.190
The basic stuff.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.700
All the instructions on this
are in the documentation

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.700
that was linked earlier.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.160
It'll be in the final slide.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.870
So I can see I have set up OAuth
already with some client keys

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.780
that you shouldn't copy--

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.150
and you don't need that.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.920
And then down here, I have
an action I have set up.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.100
This here is my cloud instance.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.492
So that's the OAuth.

00:21:10.492 --> 00:21:11.670
Where'd I go here?

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.060
Build, Actions-- Actions--

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.870
here we go.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.230
There is my execution path.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.730
Both

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.960
Of these point to the instance
I'm about to show you.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.790
And went on with
that, I now over here

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.920
have a Node.js instance running.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.000
The Node.js instance, which
I'm going to now restart,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.280
is running the command
and control software.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.790
It is running Nginx
in front of Node.js.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.030
That connection is the
Raspberry Pi here connecting

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.870
to the cloud controller.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.810
So now, if we can cut
over to the phone.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.860
Can we cut to the phone?

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:50.360
Perfect.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.822
I'm going to go in.

00:21:53.822 --> 00:21:55.030
I'm going to set up a device.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.670
This is using the
standard build.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.170
Whoops.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.490
I've already connected that.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:05.850
Let me disconnect that and make
sure that this has good states.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.860
I'm going to to restart that.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.040
I'm going to connect again here.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.000
And I have a login screen.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.990
I have a login screen.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.480
There we go.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.230
I log in.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.647
I've got the
password saved there.

00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:28.340
Don't do that in
production, obviously.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.520
Now I have a cookie
jar device hooked up.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.545
And I should see it
right down there.

00:22:33.545 --> 00:22:35.670
Cookie jar showing us a
lock, because that's how it

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.250
was implemented in that code.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.680
Now, if I go back
to the Assistant--

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.210
open the cookie jar.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:47.480
Ca va.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.492
Cookie jar has opened.

00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:49.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.870
Now, unfortunately, we
were not allowed by legal

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.128
to actually do
real food on stage,

00:22:56.128 --> 00:22:58.670
just like Michelle said earlier,
but my wife and her friend--

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.750
my wife, Nina, and
her friend [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.250
made all these
cookies last night,

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.950
and I said I'd give them a shout
out, so shout out for cookies.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:09.200
I will now consume and talk
with my mouth full on stage.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.300
Snickerdoodles are awesome.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.870
Contact me later for the recipe.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:19.080
The problem is that cookie
jar is openable to anybody.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.060
They'll have to come
over and take a cookie,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.973
and we don't want
that to happen.

00:23:22.973 --> 00:23:23.940
VERA TZONEVA: What?

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.370
DAVID SCHAIRER: Sorry.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.090
So--

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.780
VERA TZONEVA: Wait a second.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.720
DAVID SCHAIRER:
Sorry-- not sorry.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.660
So what we're going
to do here is--

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.510
lost my windows.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:42.380
Here is the execution code
that runs that first version.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.400
So without a pin, it simply
responds and executes

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.150
the open command.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.910
That's the open command
that's returned--

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.950
the response is returned
and it passes through

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.220
and it sends a command down the
pipe to this, the Raspberry Pi,

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.950
which, actually, it's a
pin, which pops the magnet.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.940
However-- I've already
got the code here,

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.640
so I'm going to
change this to true.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.260
Now, we're going to
go down to this code.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.102
And when this executes,
when the request has no pin,

00:24:06.102 --> 00:24:08.060
we're going to send a
pin challenge right here.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.640
So instead of opening
the jar, we're

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.240
going to send an error
that says we need a pin.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.630
And if we have a
pin, but the pin

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.730
does not match the constant
that's up at the top--

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.070
again, in real code you'd
do that from a database--

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.440
then it's going to
generate a repeat pin.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.780
So now I've written that.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.030
It's now pin needed.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.630
I go back to my other window.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.980
I'm going to restart my
little node instance.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.220
Up it comes.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.970
There is the connection
from the device.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:38.140
And now-- open the cookie jar--

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.722
1759.

00:24:48.722 --> 00:24:49.222
Whoops.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.320
1805.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.630
So now we've implemented
a true FA feature--

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.250
you saw was about
20 lines of code.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.625
And the nice thing about the
second-- for the true factor

00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:13.380
authentication is you as
the partner can decide

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.977
when and how to challenge.

00:25:14.977 --> 00:25:17.310
So if, for example, you wanted
to make a cookie jar that

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:21.360
was locked before dinner
but available after dinner

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.780
because you don't want your kids
eating cookies before dinner,

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.760
you could absolutely do that.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.098
If you had a cookie jar with
an NFC, so you had a dongle,

00:25:30.098 --> 00:25:32.640
and you waived it, and you said,
open, you could do that too.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.390
With a second factor,
we don't know about.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.155
So you have that
in your control.

00:25:36.155 --> 00:25:38.280
And the true FA feature is
available on pretty much

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.490
all of our traits.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.000
So if you want to have
a cookie jar-- obviously

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.620
it's designed for
security systems,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.870
door locks, and so forth,
where it's really mandatory

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.180
to have that second
factor of security--

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.920
but it's also available on
whatever interesting devices

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.252
you might happen to make.

00:25:52.252 --> 00:25:53.460
Can we go back to the slides?

00:25:56.454 --> 00:25:58.450
Perfect.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:03.480
So everything I just did was
available with all developers,

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.030
all makers, educational
projects, what have you.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.460
No approval, no launch needed.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.960
You put it, you do your project,
you can share that project.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.450
Anybody that you share
it with can run it.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.510
It's very much like with
any App Store or Play Store,

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:18.090
having a feature that
you can share internally.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.890
If you want to launch
it to the masses,

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.830
we have a process Vera
will talk about more.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.220
You go through the same portal.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.040
You have self-testing tools.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.930
And it's usually pretty
fast, the partners,

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.850
to get these into
full launching, which

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.990
is what I'm going to
hand over for Vera to do.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.907
VERA TZONEVA: Awesome.

00:26:32.907 --> 00:26:34.260
DAVID SCHAIRER: With my cookie.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.910
VERA TZONEVA: All
right, all right.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.397
I seriously can't have one?

00:26:37.397 --> 00:26:40.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.970
Cool.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.880
You know when you get
home exhausted from work,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.250
all you really want to
do is set the thermostat

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.760
to heat up your freezing house,
start doing all of the laundry,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.220
start preparing a big
meal for your family,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.850
then do all the dishes, then
prepare for the next morning?

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.740
No?

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.240
We just talked about
how we're going

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.190
to solve for a lot of this
with the Connected Home.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.600
And once we solve these
problems for users,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.470
they're going to start
expecting it, which is really

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.660
good news for all of us here.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.420
From the thermostat developer,
to the oven developer,

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.780
to the dishwasher developer,
to the device we didn't even

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.820
know we need a
developer, we're all

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.200
going to grow the Smart
Home ecosystem together.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.160
Look at the data.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.990
The number of connected
homes in the next 5 years

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.580
is set to grow 10x.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.500
That's amazing.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.490
And of those homes, the number
of connected devices already

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.500
today in those homes is
10, and over 50% of users

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.780
are using connected
devices every single day.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.965
That's amazing.

00:27:44.965 --> 00:27:45.840
But what's different?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.040
What's changed?

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.790
Well, incredibly,
over 44% of users

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.980
have used an assistant to
control a connected device.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.470
How do these trends benefit you?

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.480
And how are we here to help?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.690
Well, number one, we can
help deepen user engagement.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.970
Number two, we can help
increase your device sales.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.490
And number three, we
can drive brand value.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:14.435
So let's walk through each of
them, starting with engagement.

00:28:14.435 --> 00:28:15.810
Let's remember
that the assistant

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.180
is live on 1 billion
devices, so we

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.500
want to help enable your reach.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.980
Two, we want to solve for
the device discovery problem.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.550
It's been a problem that's
been plaguing our industry

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.780
for a very long time.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.230
And then the third is we
really want to help with setup.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.450
It's still way too
full of friction.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.300
Let's start with reach.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.480
Remember that the assistant
is live one 1 billion devices.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.530
That's on mobile phones, it's
on speakers, it's on displays,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.130
it's on cars, it's
on TVs and much more.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.570
So remember you're a user,
he or she is driving home

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.230
and wants to preheat the
oven or set the thermostat.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:59.760
Now, you as a developer have
access to that user on the go,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.400
and you have to do nothing else.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.310
Let's also remember
that the assistant

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.290
is live internationally.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.230
And the connected home
market, your customers

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.350
are also growing
significantly internationally.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.830
So when you build for
the smart home API once,

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.750
you get access to
all those users

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.140
across different locales,
countries, languages

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.430
entirely for free.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.700
We need-- we're doing
a lot to actually solve

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.350
for discoverability as well.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.290
Remember, I mentioned
that on average a user

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:39.060
has 10 connected devices
in his or her home.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.780
What we've already launched
is an ability for a user

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.100
to discover the devices directly
in the Home app in the feed

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.320
through something
called Suggestion Chips.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.210
When an user taps
on that, they can

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.090
start connecting the device.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.730
The next thing we're doing
with discoverability,

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.800
and I'm especially
excited about this one,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.600
remember the reach
that the assistant

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.130
has on mobile devices.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.670
We're going to be
sending notifications

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.980
to users on Android and iOS.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.320
We'll have a third
party app downloaded

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.230
encouraging the user to
connect and set up the device.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.440
But that's not only
going to be it.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.770
We're also, through
those flows, going

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.410
to start educating the user
on the benefit of connecting

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:23.730
the device.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.160
So think about everything
that you do every single day

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.960
to make your device connected.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.460
You think about all
the new features

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.377
you're going to launch,
all the functionality,

00:30:31.377 --> 00:30:33.810
all of the smarts,
things like this

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.602
are going to help bring your
features to the forefront.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.820
We need your help.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.180
We're doing a lot of work across
our ecosystem of developers

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.520
to help with this
discoverability.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.770
So our partners are doing
things like launching

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.680
badging on boxes, or putting
inserts in packaging.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.330
They're also doing a lot
within the UIs themselves,

00:30:55.330 --> 00:31:00.038
so the UIs within a TV, or
within a third party app.

00:31:00.038 --> 00:31:01.580
And they're doing
a ton across things

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.060
like email, press,
and other campaigns.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.420
We actually did a
program with Vizio

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.440
where the partner launched
a education flow directly

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.390
on the TV on the
benefits of connecting

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.630
to the assistant, that
discoverability of features,

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.610
and they saw a 10x
increase in the number

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.485
of connected devices.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:24.800
All right.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.440
So we've talked about reach.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.730
We've talked about
discoverability

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.800
with an engagement.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.440
Now, let's talk about setup.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.840
How many horror
stories have you heard

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.845
of your customers struggling
to set up a connected device?

00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:40.690
I am embarrassed
to say I sometimes

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.580
have a problem setting
up a connected device.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.320
I know my team does as well.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.300
I'm legitimately worried
that our industry is

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.020
going to change the sentry
old joke of how long does

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.813
it take to screw in a light
bulb into how long does it take

00:31:52.813 --> 00:31:54.730
to set up a connected
device, and I don't want

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:55.938
to be here when that happens.

00:31:55.938 --> 00:31:57.620
We want to prevent
that from happening.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.650
So we're doing a few things.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.230
Yesterday we announced that
we're opening up the local home

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.250
SDK.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.540
This is the first step.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.490
It enables local execution.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.130
It allows things like the
Home Hub or the speaker

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.210
to be able to identify
devices nearby.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:16.160
The second thing we're doing
is Google account linking.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.020
So if a user starts within
the assistant experience

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.350
and then goes to your app to
accept the terms of service,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.230
they can then flip back to
the assistant experience

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.630
without having to re-enter
username, password,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.130
credentials, which we know is
a significant friction point.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.420
All right.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.045
So we've talked a
lot about engagement.

00:32:37.045 --> 00:32:38.230
We've talked about reach.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.380
We've talked about the ability
to solve discoverability.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.100
We've talked about set up.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.160
Now, let's talk about sales.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.020
We know that the
reasons users are

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.900
buying connected devices are for
convenience and cost for value.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:58.990
An incredibly 89% of customers
are influenced by compatibility

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.880
of their assistant
when considering

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.680
which connected device to buy.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.530
So what are we doing there?

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.920
Unsurprisingly, a lot of people
are starting their purchase

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.140
process directly on search.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.320
So we've launched a Works With
Google Assistant attribute

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.480
on shopping on
search to encourage

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.630
users to be able to
find which devices

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.800
work with their assistant.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.980
To be eligible, make sure
you register your devices

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.780
in the Merchant
Center, and then add

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:31.350
Works With Google Assistant in
the title and the description.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.880
It's not just on search.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.520
We're doing a lot
across other channels.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.570
So we work very closely with
our retailers across things

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.550
like promotions,
fixtures, displays.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.540
We're doing a ton
to train installers

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.280
and our retail partners.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.770
We're doing a lot with above
the line marketing, brand

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:50.680
marketing, et cetera.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.290
But the point here
is, you don't have

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.900
to be a big company to benefit.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.360
Make sure you launch
a quality integration

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.797
with a great use case, and we'll
do our best to showcase you.

00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:04.310
All right.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.610
Now, let's talk
about brand value.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.310
Remember that for users
Home is a sanctuary.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.630
It's where they go to
find comfort, care,

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.620
and to be in control.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.400
This is the best
place for your brand.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.790
Once the vision of the helpful
Home becomes a reality,

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.719
the brands, your brand,
will be at the center of it.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.300
Users will use
your devices daily.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.995
You'll be the new
household brand.

00:34:30.995 --> 00:34:32.620
I mean, look at some
of these examples,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.130
some of these brands
we didn't even

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.110
think about or use
just a few years ago,

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.580
and now we think about
and use them daily.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.889
Now, think about this new world.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:50.960
You get home, your house is
warm and toasty when you arrive,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.739
the laundry is
already done, the oven

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:56.719
is preheat heated
for that pasta dish

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.180
that you've been dying
to make your family,

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.070
and the dishwasher is
set to run at night

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.010
to save you energy and money.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.340
And yet, you think about
none of those things,

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:10.200
you simply take off your
shoes and hug your family.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.510
So when we achieve this as
an ecosystem of developers,

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.580
users are going to be
using your device daily.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.410
It's why they went
and bought it.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.780
And that's why they
know your brand.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.800
The benefits to you across
deepening user engagement

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.050
across increasing your sales
and across driving brand value

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:29.800
will all be there.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.120
To recap, make sure you
launch the Smart Home API.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.240
That's the cloud to
cloud integration.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.440
Also, launch the Local Home SDK,
which we announced yesterday.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.530
That's what enables
local execution.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.600
Also, implement Google
Account Linking.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.810
It's what really helps
with what is today a pretty

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.020
friction full set up process.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.600
Register your devices
in the Merchant Center

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.120
and add Works With Google
Assistant in the title

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.620
and description.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.810
And then check out
the Marketing Hub.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.430
Once you launch, we
want to make sure

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.800
that we're educating
our mutual users

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.330
on the benefits of
your connected device

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.378
and connecting to the Assistant.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.350
We have a few upcoming sessions
to deep dive into these topics.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.690
Local Technologies for
a Better Smart Home

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.120
is later this afternoon.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.280
It'll also be recorded
and streamed live.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.160
And then Tools for Building
Better Smart Home Actions

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.420
is tomorrow.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.730
Also will be recorded
and streamed live.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:33.810
Thank you so much.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.160
