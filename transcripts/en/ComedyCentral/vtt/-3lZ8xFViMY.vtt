00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.700
You never have this problem
with dogsleds.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.730
Gun it. See if it'll go
all the way around.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.180
Every year more people are eaten
by snowmobiles than sharks.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.990
Fact. Half man, half machine,
it's SnowmoCop.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.770
Looks like that son of a bitch
Jack

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.220
Frost turned this neighborhood

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.920
into one big game
of shuffleboard.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:35.840
Look out lady. Watch out.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.700
Just like a Taylor
Swift relationship.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.940
This is actually
kind of soothing and beautiful

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.790
if you put
the right music behind it.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.669
To be fair, putting on tire
chains is a real hassle.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.230
You want to steer
into the wreck.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.670
Okay that one wasn't
the ice's fault.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.370
That driver was Asian.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.500
Luckily the Happy Honda
Day sales event just started.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.870
My contact fell out.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.620
There's no way we're going
to reach the summit tonight.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.650
I'm left with no other choice.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.710
I'm going to have to give myself
elective LASIK eye surgery.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.240
Why don't you just wear
your prescription ski goggles?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.940
I look stupid in these.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.850
They should really make
the font bigger in this book.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.450
We're only 50 feet away
from our car.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.220
I can hold your arm
and we can just walk back.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.520
Why do you have
all of that?

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.220
You've got to come prepared.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.730
One. Two.
One. One.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.540
One.
You only get one shot at this.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.799
Just got to stay still
for a few days.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm going to see the mountain
like never before.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.920
In two to three weeks.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.490
Wouldn't you know it,
after all I found my contact.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.030
It was on my cheek.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.710
A person's body should
never end up in a suitcase.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.660
Unless she says
something really crazy.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.790
And there aren't any witnesses.
And they can't prove motive.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.140
Giving this a thumbs up.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.340
Bob, just go.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.830
Okay, there is not
a snowballs chance in hell

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.950
this is going to work.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.799
It'd be quicker just to put him
straight into a body bag.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.970
Dragging someone behind
pickup truck in the winter

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.869
even makes hate crimes
seem whimsical.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.360
Sometimes it's safer just to
stay inside and do drugs, kids.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.190
They should take the suitcase
to the airport and switch it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.390
with one that doesn't have
a dead boy in it.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.650
Lay lay lay. Lay down.
What hurts? What hurts?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.460
He's crying because he's crammed
against the collapsible handle.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.200
He's talking and he's awake.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.430
Ouch.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.640
Suck it up.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.180
Your tears are going to freeze
into I'm being a pussy-sicles.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.180
We need to get him
out of the briefcase.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.849
I'm starting to think these guys
might not be smart.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.720
One, that's not a briefcase.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.700
Two, you're not supposed
to unpack someone

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.340
with a spine injury.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.410
You guys need to chill out
with this hospital bullshit.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.110
Yeah. No hospitals.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.670
You don't want anybody
to know about this attempted

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.310
manslaughter you're about
to put on YouTube.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.760
Okay is there anything funnier
than giving your friend

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.650
pneumonia?
No.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.350
Josh, do it now.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.220
Yeah, keep laughing
but his ghost will get you back

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.070
when you go water
skiing next summer.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.370
Here try this.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.400
His perfect teenage body
will be preserved for eons.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.660
This is what that
Phil Collins song is about.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.490
Would you know my name-
