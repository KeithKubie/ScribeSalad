00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:07.207
(relaxing harp music)

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:16.449
(harp becoming dissonant)

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:25.458
- [Natalie] Myra!

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.760
That was amazing.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.227
- Oh, thank you.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:30.897
- It was just so... Wow!

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.698 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Well, thanks for coming.
- Yeah

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.200 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's really nice to see you
- Great to see you.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.701
- [Grandpa] My boy.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.903
My boy.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.738
- Hi, Grandpa, you came.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.373
- How could I not show up

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.441 align:start size:88% position:13%
at my favorite
grandson's performance?

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.076
And I have to say,

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:48.114 align:start size:88% position:13%
the performance tonight
was interesting.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.915
- Thank you.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.117
- Yeah.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.453 align:start size:81% position:19%
Anyway, look, I've
got a meeting.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.753
Got to go.

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:57.290
But before I go, just
give Grandad a kiss.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.459
(Myra sighs heavily)

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.261
- Myra.

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:03.662
On the lips, Myra.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.564
- Grandpa, we talked about this.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.067
- I know, come on.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.439
(suspenseful music)

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.775
- Is that it?

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.411
Is that all I get?

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:24.517
(music intensifies)

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.753
You must be Natalie.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:28.788
- Yeah, hi.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.423
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:33.126
(car door slams)

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.296
- So, what was that

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.466
with you and your Grandpa?

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.433
- What?

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.469
Did you notice something weird?

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.038
- A little, yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:48.541
- I guess I have
this little fear

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.144 align:start size:88% position:13%
that maybe I'm
attracted to my Grandpa.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:54.614
My grandfather made all
of his grandchildren

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.149
kiss him on the mouth.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.784 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think it's because he
wasn't a good communicator

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.686
and that's how he
expressed love.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:03.823
So, when I was 14, he made
me kiss him on the mouth,

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.058
and it moved.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.226
Why did my cock move
when he kissed me?

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.328
Is it because maybe
I'm attracted to him?

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.196
And I can't stop
thinking about it?

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:12.398
It got super hard.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.633 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's never been that
hard ever since.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.667
Why did my cock move?

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.668
- You were going
through puberty.

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:18.371
- I can't stop picturing things.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.672
- What kind of things?

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.574
- Like licking his balls.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:22.675
- Uggh.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.710
- I just see two giant balls

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.712
and I wanna put em in my mouth.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.314
- [Natalie] You want to?

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.250
- More than anything.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.219
(bird chirps)

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.522
(breathing heavily)

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:37.357
- No.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.229
- I said stop.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.364
- God, what?

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.865
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.934
I can't stop picturing my
grandfather's big cock.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.702
What's up with you?

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:50.537
- Fine.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.377
- No!

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.046
(Natalie sighs)

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.749
(phone vibrates)

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.585
- It's your Grandpa.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.388
- Pappy?

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:12.559
(playful lounge music)

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:18.864 align:start size:84% position:16%
(diners chat softly
in background)

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:21.267
- [Grandpa] Come on
Myra, say something.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.535
- What?

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.403
- Tell us a little
bit about your work.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:26.806
How's your work going?

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:27.740
- It --

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.375
- [Grandpa] There it is.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.210
The face to break
a thousand hearts.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.812
- So handsome, right?

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.881
- [Grandpa] Runs in the
family, really does.

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.316
- [Grandpa] Myra?

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:38.651
I think he's choking.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.252
Myra, are you okay?

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:43.589 align:start size:84% position:16%
Come here, come here.
Let me do it.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.825 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Natalie!
- I don't know the Heimlich!

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.927
(Myra grunts)

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:50.430
(Myra groans)

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.069
(suspenseful music)

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.174
(Myra gasps)

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:03.108
- Grandpa!

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:04.310
- You okay?

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.847 align:start size:81% position:19%
Yeah, yeah, you're
okay (laughs).

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:11.250
(Natalie gasps)

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.587
(playful lounge music)
