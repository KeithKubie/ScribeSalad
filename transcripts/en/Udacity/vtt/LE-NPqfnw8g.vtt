00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.240
And the answer is that Y1 should be and
Y2 should be 2.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.090
&gt;From the solution for

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.390
X, we can tell that the basis
is the first two columns here.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.024
So we'll go ahead and call that B.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:15.020
And we want to perform row
operations on this, so

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.530
that we hit this part of the objective
value, exactly, and achieve equality.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.350
We'll call this portion of
the objective coefficients, CB.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.810
Setting up the linear equations,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.920
we have that Y transpose B
should be equal to CB transpose.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.380
And by simple back substitution,
we achieve the right answer.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.310
We can check the answer by making
sure that it gives us the same

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.620
objective value.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.592
So substituting in here, we have 2
plus 4 times 2, which is equal to 10.

00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:49.935
And for the dual,
our solution is 10 as well.

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:55.253
We have 1 times 6, which is 6 and
2 times 2, which is 4.

00:00:55.253 --> 00:00:58.375
And adding them together,
we also get 10.

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:02.296
We should also check the feasibility
of our dual solution by checking that

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:05.459
the bound on the coefficients for
the objective function,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.250
behave themselves for
these coefficients as well.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.320
And indeed, they do.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.640
We get 1 here, and -2 here,
for a total of -1,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.272
which is indeed greater than negative 2.

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:21.910
And regarding X4, we have 1 times 2,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.194
which is 1 minus 1,
times 2, so that's 0.

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:29.820
And 0 is indeed greater
than the -1 here.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.010
So our choice for Y,
was indeed feasible.
