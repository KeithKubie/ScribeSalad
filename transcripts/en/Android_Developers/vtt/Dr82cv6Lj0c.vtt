[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.410
SUZANNE: Hello all, and welcome
to this deep dive on Play data.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.370
Have you ever been
in a situation

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.240
where you released an app,
and realized only days later

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.940
that you had to replace it?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.510
Do you appreciate that the
console has great acquisition

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.330
reports for in app
purchases, but doesn't

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.230
offer a lot of insight
for other business models?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.980
And have you ever wanted to take
a deep dive into your own data,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.450
but felt that our statistic
pages were not powerful enough?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.256
If you're thinking
yes to any of these,

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:41.630
we have some great
news to share.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.980
We recognize that
every business,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.320
and every role
within the business,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.160
may have different data needs.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.440
And we want to make our
data work for all of you.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.150
In this talk, you
will learn what

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.580
we've done to help you monitor
your production releases,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.470
explore new ways to
dig into your own data,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.140
and gain new business insights.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.870
My name is Suzanne, I'm a
product manager on Play,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.270
and I'll be talking you through
the new release dashboard

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.430
that we launched yesterday.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.867
But first, a few introductions.

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:20.950
TAMZIN TAYLOR: Hi there,
my name is Tamzin Taylor.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.180
I work for Google Play
business development in AMEA.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.430
DARIO FRENI: Hi, I'm Dario,
I'm one of the engineering

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.000
leads on the Play console.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.690
I focus on making our analytics
metric timely and useful

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.540
to our developers.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.710
SUZANNE: So, let's start
with your app releases,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.630
and how we're helping
you ensure that you

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.670
don't leave a bad
release in production

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.630
any longer than needed.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.970
With our new low latency metrics
and release specific break down

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.540
into your data, we're giving
you an hour-by-hour view

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.360
into your app release
health, out of the box,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.259
without a need for an SDK.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.800
This will allow you
to make decisions

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.510
about the roll out
of your release

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.070
sooner, and with
more confidence.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.680
We've always been ahead
of the curve with tools

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.900
to prepare great releases.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.700
We have the
pre-launch report, we

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.740
have the alpha and
the beta channels,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.920
but we haven't yet given you the
data to monitor your production

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.830
release as it happens.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.870
We now give you a
product that allows

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.210
you to look at the core
release metrics in one

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.630
view, the release dashboard.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.850
Within a couple of
hours of your release

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.800
entering the
production track, you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.880
will see data for that
release on the dashboard.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.120
So, when you push a new
release, you obviously

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.190
care about crashes.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.500
The crashes that we
used to show were

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.580
those where a user
proactively reported a crash.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.090
But we also now have
device reported crashes,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.850
and that's the metric
that you see here.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.270
Unless a user opted out during
the set up of their device,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.770
all crashes are
reported automatically,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.680
which should mean a
lot more data for you.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.240
The other metric you
should really care about

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.470
is ANRs, application
not responding.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.870
These are events where
the Android operating

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.650
system reports that your app
becomes unresponsive for five

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.350
seconds or more.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.430
Now, if on the crash card
you click on View Clusters,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.200
or on the ANR card you
click on View ANRs,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.870
you'll be able to see if
your release introduced

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.020
any new crashes or ANRs
you should care about.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.885
And you can explore
the new crash

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:39.440
and ANR metrics there as well.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.340
So to learn more about the
new crash and ANR metrics,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.840
and to learn exactly 10 secrets
about health metrics, please

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.030
come back to this
same stage at 5:30

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.410
PM today to see Fergus,
Riccardo, and Joe talk.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.980
Now, back to the
release dashboard.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.700
So, I showed you
crashes and ANRs.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.030
Releases aren't all
about app health, though.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.750
You also want to see ratings and
reviews specific to your latest

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.850
version.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.090
When the average rating
for your current release

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.397
is well below that of
your overall rating,

00:04:18.397 --> 00:04:20.730
you may want to start looking
into your one and two star

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.877
reviews to see
what's going wrong,

00:04:22.877 --> 00:04:24.960
and possibly even move on
to halting your release.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.240
But what if you could also
see low latency install

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.160
and uninstall events that
are specific to your release?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.760
And what if you could
know how many uninstalls

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.470
came from updated devices?

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.420
Are you losing
existing customers

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.750
because your new
version doesn't perform?

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.420
Installs broken down by
new installs and updates

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.120
can tell a powerful
story too, though.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.400
Have enough users
updated it for me

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.425
to push my stage rollouts
to the next stage?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.860
As I've started hinting, it's
not all about a single metric.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.240
Your crash tool may warn
you if you get a huge spike,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.850
your PM may tell you if
your ratings suddenly drop.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.400
But what about subtle
but significant changes

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.077
across the board?

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:17.910
Would you ever notice
if you didn't see them

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.920
all in the same place?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.870
Maybe your crashes
go up, but not

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.870
to a point where you would
halt your release just yet.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.050
But your ratings are down,
and if you look further,

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.230
your uninstalls are starting
to trend above average.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.810
The combined data may tell you
that this is not early stage

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.150
noise, but actually
a real problem

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.870
that you need to investigate.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.970
So the context provided
by this holistic view

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.920
is precisely how Play data will
help you make decisions sooner,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.490
and with more confidence.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.830
So far, you've seen
a bunch of metrics

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.200
that tell you a lot about
your production release.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.520
Both are looked
at in isolation--

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.980
what are my ratings doing?

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.080
And together-- So, what are my
ANRs doing to my uninstalls,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.690
or to my ratings?

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.520
I've kept one of the
most powerful features

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.700
from you, though, and
that's comparison.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.940
During user studies we ran
for the release dashboard,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.150
we noticed that virtually
every participant mentioned

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.600
that the success of a
release is measured relative

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.270
to the success of
a previous release.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.980
Everybody has their
own idea of what's

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.750
an acceptable number of crashes
and an acceptable rating.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.690
So release dashboards, when
you open it later today,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.030
has a selector at
the top that allows

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.430
you to pick a past
release to compare

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.915
your current release against.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.670
So, here's what comparison would
look like for uninstall events

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.450
and for crashes.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.220
The power of
comparing is that it

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.420
gives you even more signals
to increase your confidence.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.280
You don't only
have your crashes,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.770
you don't only have the impact
that your ANRs are having

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.510
on your ratings,
but you can also

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.420
see how these metrics compare
against a previous successful

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.920
release.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.730
And Jam City, developer of big
hits like Panda Pop, Cookie

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.740
Jam, and Genies and Gems,
confirms exactly those notions.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.280
Quicker insight into
success or problems,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.410
and comparing crash
and ANR metrics

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.291
against the previous
release to see

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.790
if they need to start looking
into newly introduced crashes.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.430
And Wish, a very
popular shopping app,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.670
say that they can now ramp
up their releases faster

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.770
and with more
confidence, and respond

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.350
to issues more intelligently.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.300
The head of product
also specifically

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.550
mentions that comparing
ratings across releases

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.320
gave very important
qualitative feedback, which

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.300
ties back to what I mentioned
before about not focusing

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.300
on app health alone.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.400
Right, that's a release
dashboard that makes Play data

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.680
work for you in low latency.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.960
So, go look for it in the
Play console when you next

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.550
push a new version out.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.360
It is the new top most item
under release management.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.430
You'll be confident
sooner, and you'll

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.731
have fewer users spending time
looking at a bad app release

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:19.230
version.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.560
TAMZIN TAYLOR:
Thank you, Suzanne.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.670
So when we think about the
app development lifecycle,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.460
clearly the release
is a critical point.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.559
I don't think anyone disagrees.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.840
But, once you have
your app in production

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.669
and you're happy
with it, you probably

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.409
want to drive lots of new
and valuable installs, right?

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:45.650
Now, given that you've all
heard about the new release

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.990
dashboard, I have
confidence when

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.200
you leave I/O you'll
be able to have

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.930
a great release of your app.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.044
And once you have
your app live, what

00:08:57.044 --> 00:08:59.210
are the four questions you
should be asking yourself

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.126
to grow your business?

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.430
You should be asking, which
marketing channels are

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.910
driving my most valuable users?

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.220
Which countries are
they coming from?

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.500
Are my install and buy
conversion rates actually good?

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.880
And which channels are bringing
me my most loyal users?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.570
So why is this important, and
what am I going to tell you?

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.250
Well, I'll get onto
that in a second.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.510
So in my role, I talk to
developers every single day--

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.010
probably some of
you in the audience

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.080
who I speak to regularly.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.480
And what I hear
you say is that you

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.570
need to know how effective
your marketing channels are

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.130
for attracting and retaining
new valuable users.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.140
I hear you say that
you need more data

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.140
to make the right decision on
where you spend your money,

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.390
and where you spend your
time and effort to optimize

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.180
your growth strategies.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.820
Now, you may already know
this, but, in case you

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.420
don't, a couple of years ago we
launched the user acquisition

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.980
report.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.260
To remind you, the
user acquisition report

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.600
shows you how many
people are going

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.110
to your place or
listing page; of those,

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.390
how many people
install your app;

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.200
and of those, how many
people buy, and buy again.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.210
You can cut this report by five
main channels: the Play Store,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.830
Google AdWords, Google
Search, third party referrers,

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.780
and track channels.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.330
Now, since last I/O we've
launched two improvements

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.480
to this report just to make
it more useful for you,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.550
and help you with your
growth strategies.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.670
But first, I want to
touch on track channels,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.150
and why you should really
be using these today.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.380
So one of the most powerful
features of the user

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.380
acquisition report
is the ability

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:52.600
to track and see acquisition
broken down by UTM tag.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.790
Now, UTM tag lets
you identify a link

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.330
you've used to drive traffic
to your Store listing page.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.380
Any link can use UTM tags.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.110
Your social shares, your
web sites, even other apps.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.400
And by tagging
these links you can

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.960
see all of your traffic broken
down by a unique identifier.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.500
Why is this important?

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.220
Well, if you're going to
spend money on a campaign,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.920
you probably want to
know how it's performing.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.780
And this allows
you to see exactly

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.600
which link is contributing
to your most valuable users.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.720
It's really powerful.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.600
You can apply this
link to anything

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.160
you create to track
the contribution

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.720
that that specific link has
had to your growth success.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.240
So UTM tags are great
for planned campaigns,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.700
but when I speak to
developers a lot of them

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.890
tell me that majority
of the traffic

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.160
actually comes organically
through the Play Store.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.200
I can see some nodding.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.200
Now, you may remember I told
you we'd made two improvements

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.550
to the user acquisition report.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.200
So the first one is we've added
country breakdown to the user

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.860
acquisition traffic report.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.910
And this is really
helpful because,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.020
as you may have
heard earlier today,

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.870
or yesterday, we now have two
billion Android active devices

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.440
across the world.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.830
So, this report
helps you identify

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.440
where your unrealized
opportunity is

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.190
for international
expansion and domination.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.010
Now, let me share with you a
case study of a partner who's

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.340
used this to their benefit.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.830
Concrete Software
is a Minneapolis

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.750
based games company.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.590
Perhaps, like you in the
audience or on the live stream,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.370
they run a really
lean operation--

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.470
they've got about 30 people.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.020
So getting the right
information about their business

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.800
quickly so they can act
on it is pretty crucial.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.690
About a year ago,
Concrete Software

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.520
were using the user
acquisition reports

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.770
for their game Arctic Cat, which
is a snowmobile game, obviously

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.530
set in a snowy landscape.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.720
And they could see that
their install conversion

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.380
was a little bit lower
than what they'd expected.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.420
When we launched
country breakdown,

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.590
instantly they could see
why this was the case.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.110
What they saw was that countries
in cold climates with snow

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.270
had a five times greater
install conversion

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.640
than warmer climates
that did not have snow,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.140
such as Brazil,
Indonesia, et cetera.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.190
So suddenly they realize
they should be concentrating

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.430
their optimization on these
cold climate countries, which

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.460
you can see that they've
done by increasing

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.170
their install 25%
for these countries

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.960
by using store
listings experiments.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.250
So now they know where
to target their spend

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.120
to get the best
return on investment.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.150
So, one thing you've told us--

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.419
and I heard this quite
a lot from partners--

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:50.710
was that while you think the
user acquisition report is

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.190
great for understanding your
business, I kept getting asked,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.220
but is this actually good?

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.980
How much opportunity exists
to drive my acquisition

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.930
even further?

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.510
So late last year we
launched peer benchmarks.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.100
Peer benchmarks help you
see how your app compares

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.820
to similar apps in the
same category who use

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.870
the same monetization model.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.990
So these peer benchmarks can
be seen in the user acquisition

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.380
channel, and in the
country breakdown channel.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.270
And this is really
helpful for three reasons.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.510
Number one, it shows
you exactly where

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.130
you need to focus
your improvement

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.410
efforts for your conversion.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.500
Secondly, it can show you where
you can make the business case

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.410
to invest more in acquisition.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.960
And thirdly, it can show
you where you can simply

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.480
celebrate your team's success.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.700
So let me share with you a
couple of partners who use

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.250
this data for their advantage.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.000
Now, you may be
familiar with Viber.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.170
They're a communications
app, and they operate

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.360
in a pretty competitive market.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.940
So it's really important
that they use all the labors

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.060
at their disposal to increase
the top of the funnel,

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.910
and get more users
to install their app.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.190
Once we launched
peer benchmarks,

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.510
Viber could finally
see what good is.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.180
And they knew what goals
to set themselves to reach

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.460
for their in-store conversion.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.550
Using this report, Viber were
able to identify countries that

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.710
were below the peer benchmark.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.920
One such example was
the UK and the US.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.860
Similarly, they seemed like
sister countries, right?

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.630
They both speak English.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.570
But as Viber discovered,
in fact, user behavior

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.280
was quite different,
and they saw

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.200
that the UK install
conversion was

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.260
much lower than the peer set.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.970
This immediately allowed
them to jump on the problem,

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.160
and resolve it using store
listening experiments,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.700
testing the image logo,
descriptions, to bring it

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.350
back up to par.

00:15:49.164 --> 00:15:51.330
Now, I'm sure you're all
familiar with the Star Wars

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.940
franchise, and you may also
be familiar with the EA game

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.620
Galaxy Heroes which
launched a while ago.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.270
What they noticed
was that there were

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.910
lots of people coming to
their page store listing,

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.960
but not as many were installing
the app as they expected.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.030
Once we launched
peer benchmarking,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.000
EA were able to see that,
actually the problem was not

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.230
the game, but that the
category that the game sat in

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.170
had a lower conversion
than other categories

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.690
in which EA has games.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.550
And this led them
to think, if they

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.010
could change the perception
and the display of the game,

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.980
could they increase conversion?

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.260
So peer benchmarking
gave EA the ability

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.730
to think not only in terms of
category, but also country.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.400
And has prompted them to
pivot the position in the game

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.680
to increase conversion.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.540
It's had a profound
impact on the way

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.210
that they approach top
of funnel marketing.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.040
With this, they're
able to create

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.990
unique assets for
different categories

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.540
and different countries
to increase conversion.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.720
So, if you're a games company
or you use in-app purchase,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.005
you might be thinking--
this is fantastic.

00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:02.930
I'm going to go home,
and dive into my data,

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.730
and find ways I can improve.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.680
But how many of you
here in the audience--

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.471
and you can put your
hand up if you're also

00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:10.800
watching the live stream--

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.079
have a subscription
model, or an ad

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.740
funded model, or an
e-commerce model?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.740
Fantastic, so there's
quite a few of you.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.290
Version one of the
user acquisition report

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.930
was really useful for
everyone, but perhaps

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.236
geared more towards developers
with in-app purchase model.

00:17:29.236 --> 00:17:31.610
But, like you here in the room
today, the majority of you

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.680
put your hand up, we know there
are other really successful

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.140
business models
where you really care

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.490
about building long-term
user relationships, right?

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.820
So today, I'm very
excited to announce

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.100
the launch of version
2 of the funnel, which

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.280
has been built specifically
with businesses like yours

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.270
in mind, who care
about user retention.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.000
The first report shows
retention periods,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.520
which is a critical
metric for understanding

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.780
which channels are bringing
in your most loyal users.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.640
These retained
installers are people

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.570
who have your app installed on
at least one of their devices.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.090
This is your retained
install base.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.700
So this-- and you can see the
percentages-- will show you

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.430
what the opportunity is
to increase your user

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.370
retention using techniques
like notifications, e-mail,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.440
or just increasing your quality.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.280
Better yet, one of my
favorites, is the ability

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.130
to export this data via CSV.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.890
So now you'll be able to
extract your retained user--

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.639
I can see people
clapping, it's great.

00:18:37.639 --> 00:18:40.055
You'll be able to extract your
retained user, your install

00:18:40.055 --> 00:18:42.570
and buy conversion, and
your peer benchmarks,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.390
to help you manage your
business better and look

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.910
for ways to improve.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.690
Now, I work a lot with
subscription partners

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.490
from the news industry
through to health and fitness,

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.630
and they are always
asking me for more data.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.210
And since subscriptions are a
growing and important business

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.130
model, I'm really
happy to let you

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:07.110
know that we've built a report
specifically for your business.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.610
Now, as much as I
would like to, I'm

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.274
not going to ruin the surprise.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.690
If you'd like to learn more
about the subscription report,

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.480
come back here 10:30
AM tomorrow morning

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.400
to hear more about that.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.575
So in summary, I know from
today you're going to go away,

00:19:23.575 --> 00:19:25.200
and you'll look at
your app, and you'll

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.020
be able to see which
channels are driving

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.891
your most valuable users, which
countries they're coming from.

00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:33.390
And you'll be able
to say, where are

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.100
the opportunities to increase
my install and buy conversion,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.460
and how can I increase
my user retention?

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.950
All of these reports are here
to help you optimize your growth

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:45.870
strategies.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.970
Not just for installs, but for
long term value and business

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.640
success.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.530
Regardless of the
way you monetize,

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.350
we believe the acquisition
reports are there for you

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.520
to help grow your business.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.240
DARIO FRENI: Thanks, Tamzin.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.220
So, in addition to
the release dashboard

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.720
and the user acquisition report,
which give you unique insights

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.020
into your data, as you
know, in the Play console

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.880
we also have more
specialized dashboard

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.780
for specific use cases like
crashes, or Android vitals,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.160
or revenue, and so on.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.670
But we understand that not
all businesses are alike,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.740
and each of you might care
about different metrics,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.520
and might care about
doing analysis in ways

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.170
that we can not predict.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.580
So we know many of you know
use our statistics page.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.620
But, we also know
that sometimes,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.340
for certain analysis, you have
to download the CSV export

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.250
and then craft your own
analysis using spreadsheets

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.350
or other external tool.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.850
And we understand why.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.810
How, for example, could you
understand whether W last year

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.420
Black Friday sales went
better or worse than this year

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.880
Black Friday sales, right?

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.710
Or how could you compare,
or find correlations,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:04.580
between two different metrics
such as ratings and crashes?

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.440
So, if I take a step back and
think about our old statistics

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.130
page, there were a number
of issues you raised and you

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.690
asked us to fix.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.950
It was sometimes slow
to load, the date

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.880
ranges you could
pick were inflexible,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.890
there was no possibility of
selecting multiple metrics,

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.210
and also, and this was
an important point,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.030
the latency of the
visibility of the data

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.907
was often insufficient.

00:21:29.907 --> 00:21:31.990
So we listened to your
feedback, and we brought it

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.470
into our product with a bunch of
the launches we had yesterday.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.381
It begins with the
new statistics page,

00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.380
and I would like to
introduce this to you today.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.210
So here is how it looks.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.830
At the first glance, you
can see that the interface

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.190
is much nicer and more
polished than before.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.880
It has been designed from the
ground up from our material

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.730
design specifications.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.150
With this launch, we are also
including some new metrics

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.070
in the statistics page,
such as, for example,

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.230
the revenue metrics.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.570
And also the install,
update, and uninstall

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.150
events, which are also available
on the release dashboard

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.700
that Suzanne present before.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.150
Let me walk you through some
exciting features of this page.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.460
First, you can now
choose any date range you

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.470
want to visualize your data.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.080
A nice date picker is
available on the top right

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.700
corner of the page.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.610
There are some
pre-selected time ranges,

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:34.840
but you can also pick a custom
one you want to visualize.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.440
Previously, we only had three,
if I remember correctly,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.580
date ranges fixed that
always ended at today.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.040
By being able to
choose any date ranges,

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.540
you can do some analysis
such as look at Q4 of 2016,

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.520
or January of last year.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.810
In addition, when you
select the date range,

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.360
the new statistics
page, by default,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.740
will also overlay a
comparison of that date range

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.910
with its most recent history.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.976
So for example, if you
pick the previous week

00:23:10.976 --> 00:23:12.600
of the last week of
data, you will also

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.390
see data relative to the
previous week overlaid

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.240
on the chart as a dotted line.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.540
If you hover that on the
chart, a useful tool tip

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.570
will give you more data
about specific data points,

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.510
such as the exact
date, but also,

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.800
how they compare numerically.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.379
So this feature
will allow you to do

00:23:31.379 --> 00:23:33.420
one of the comparisons
that was mentioned before.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.760
For example, you could
compare last year Black Friday

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.130
sales to this year very easily.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.660
So our partners at Expedia told
us that they love this feature.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.680
They were actually able to do
very quickly, and at a glance,

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.710
year-over-year or
quarter-over-quarter comparison

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.900
analysis real quick.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.180
And they said that there
is no other app analytics

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.020
tool that they know of that does
this so easily and seamlessly.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.220
Another cool feature
is the ability

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.740
of compare to different metric.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.530
If you configure your report by
clicking the Configure Report

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.440
button, you can now select
an additional metric

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.682
to compare it to, so that you
can spot correlation, or lack

00:24:15.682 --> 00:24:17.390
of correlation, between
different metrics

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.406
such as installer and revenue,
or as you can see here, crashes

00:24:21.406 --> 00:24:21.905
and ratings.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.050
On the chart, the
two different metrics

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.600
would be plotted with
two different colors.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.390
And as you can see, the
date range comparison

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.610
will still be available,
and the tool tip

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.970
will include information about
both metric and different date

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.110
ranges.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.520
So this feature will
allow you to spot quickly

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.800
correlation, or
lack of correlation,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.970
between different metrics.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.070
We've spoken to Move,
Inc. That had early access

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.670
to the statistics page for
their apartment and home rental

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.120
search app.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.500
They were able to spot
correlation between crashes

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.060
and uninstall, effectively
showing the impact of app

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.350
quality on the audience.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.870
So now, think about this.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.810
Maybe many of you have
a hard time prioritizing

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.210
fix and technical depth over
building new features, right?

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.012
But once you have
this data in hand,

00:25:18.012 --> 00:25:19.720
you can now build a
case to work on that.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.370
So, this is how you
can use this data.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.830
Next, for some of our
metrics available,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.580
such as install, update,
and uninstall still event,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.490
you can now select to see
hourly data instead of daily

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.850
when visualizing these.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.250
Now, reducing the
latency of our metrics

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.697
has been one of your
loudest concerns,

00:25:42.697 --> 00:25:44.280
and we've taken that
really seriously.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.800
We've worked really
hard on that.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.650
And I'm happy to announce
that for the metrics that

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.040
are available hourly, you
should expect them to be

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.140
updated within a few hours.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.570
In fact, if you log on
the Play console right

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:58.640
now, for this metric
you should already

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.240
see data for this morning.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.230
The hourly data will allow you
to observe hour-by-hour trends,

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.520
and also to do
analysis that were

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.950
more difficult to do before.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.780
For example, in case
of offline events,

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.460
like a TV ad, and
understanding how

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.480
this affects your installed
metric, for example.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.860
As you can see here,
the comparison feature

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.250
are still available
also when you

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.221
look at the data at
an hourly granularity.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.360
Last, but not least,
if you remember,

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.450
the previous stats
page used to show you

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.630
the top 10 results for
certain breakdowns,

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.580
such as countries and device.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.770
If you wanted to
dig deeper into data

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.670
you had to download the CSV
export and observe those.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.685
Well, we improved the
situation significantly

00:26:48.685 --> 00:26:50.210
in the new statistics page.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.070
You still have the
top 10 results,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.290
but you can now search
for any breakdown.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.450
And as you can see,
the table will also

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.120
show a numerical comparison
between different metrics

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.610
if you have selected so.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.960
And in addition, you can select
specific breakdowns, up to 2,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.100
and see them plotted
on the chart.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.400
And again, as before,
all the comparison

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.010
features I described
before are still available.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.160
So, you can do comparison
between multiple metrics,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.220
between multiple date ranges,
at an hourly granularity,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.930
for specific breakdowns.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.400
So Jakob, the CEO of Play
Lab, who should be in the room

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.360
today--

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.580
OK.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:35.390
So they are game developer
company from Thailand.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.550
And he told us that
he loved to have

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.250
the possibility of comparing
multiple metrics at a glance,

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.260
and without going
through a spreadsheet,

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.320
and also seeing per device
or per country comparison.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.410
So the new stats
page allows you to do

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:53.300
more sophisticated analysis
much more quickly than before.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.110
So to summarize, the
new statistics page

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.120
is a powerful and versatile
tool to analyze data,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.130
and to achieve quickly what
you could only achieve before

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:09.190
by downloading the data and
using our external tools or ad

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.990
hoc analysis.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.280
We are publishing new
metrics, such as revenue,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.810
and install, update,
and uninstalled events.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.560
Some of these metrics
will be available hourly,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.330
and for these metrics
you should also

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.460
expect a much lower
latency than before.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.760
So I hope you will enjoy
using these features

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.510
for your business as much as
we enjoy building them for you.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.746
Thank you, and back to Suzanne.

00:28:31.746 --> 00:28:33.678
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:36.017 --> 00:28:37.600
SUZANNE: Well, thank
you for taking us

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.770
through the new
statistics page, Dario,

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.690
and for the business reporting
walk through, Tamzin.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.370
So I'd like to wrap up
with some final words.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:49.150
We were very pleased to announce
all these features here today.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.890
With the release
dashboard, we give you

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.530
feasibility into the
health of your release.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.450
With the acquisition
reports, you

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.610
can see how efficient your
marketing channels are

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.000
for additional business models.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.400
And finally, with the
new statistics pages

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.650
we're giving you a
much more flexible way

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.960
to look at your own data.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.000
Together, these
features make Play data

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.370
work even harder
for you and help you

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.350
build successful apps on Play.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.941
So thank you very much.

00:29:15.941 --> 00:29:20.558
