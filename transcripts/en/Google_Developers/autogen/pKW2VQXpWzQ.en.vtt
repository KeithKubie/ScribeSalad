00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 align:start position:0%
engine for yourselves and now actually
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
engine for yourselves and now actually
we<00:03:02.360><c> use</c>

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 align:start position:0%
we use
 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.210 align:start position:0%
we use
much<00:03:04.540><c> 3gs</c><00:03:06.400><c> after</c><00:03:07.400><c> this</c><00:03:08.290><c> which</c><00:03:09.290><c> is</c><00:03:09.500><c> pretty</c>

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 align:start position:0%
much 3gs after this which is pretty
 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.900 align:start position:0%
much 3gs after this which is pretty
awesome<00:03:10.340><c> already</c><00:03:11.560><c> and</c><00:03:12.560><c> I'm</c><00:03:12.680><c> way</c><00:03:12.830><c> for</c><00:03:13.370><c> the</c><00:03:13.490><c> for</c>

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 align:start position:0%
awesome already and I'm way for the for
 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
awesome already and I'm way for the for

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 align:start position:0%
example in lake time we had physics and
 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
example in lake time we had physics and
then<00:03:15.860><c> we</c><00:03:16.010><c> used</c><00:03:16.220><c> the</c><00:03:16.730><c> few</c><00:03:16.910><c> years</c><00:03:19.030><c> library</c><00:03:20.170><c> and</c>

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 align:start position:0%
then we used the few years library and
 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
then we used the few years library and
the<00:03:21.380><c> branch</c><00:03:21.620><c> with</c><00:03:22.010><c> a</c><00:03:22.250><c> camel</c>

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 align:start position:0%
the branch with a camel
 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
the branch with a camel
then<00:03:24.470><c> we</c><00:03:24.680><c> went</c><00:03:24.800><c> from</c><00:03:24.950><c> that</c><00:03:25.190><c> one</c><00:03:25.550><c> okay</c><00:03:25.940><c> awesome</c>

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 align:start position:0%
then we went from that one okay awesome
 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
then we went from that one okay awesome
okay<00:03:26.840><c> cool</c><00:03:27.080><c> um</c><00:03:27.490><c> so</c><00:03:28.490><c> obviously</c><00:03:28.850><c> with</c><00:03:29.030><c> something</c>

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 align:start position:0%
okay cool um so obviously with something
 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.030 align:start position:0%
okay cool um so obviously with something
like<00:03:29.480><c> this</c><00:03:29.630><c> you've</c><00:03:30.080><c> got</c><00:03:30.290><c> a</c><00:03:30.560><c> lot</c><00:03:30.770><c> of</c><00:03:30.860><c> moving</c>

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.150 align:start position:0%
like this you've got a lot of moving

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 align:start position:0%
there's imagery just a name like a few
 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's imagery just a name like a few

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 align:start position:0%
of these things what was the actual
 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.860 align:start position:0%
of these things what was the actual

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 align:start position:0%

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.810 align:start position:0%
experience because as I say it's real
it's<00:03:46.910><c> a</c><00:03:46.970><c> complex</c><00:03:47.360><c> beast</c><00:03:48.040><c> and</c><00:03:49.040><c> it</c><00:03:49.370><c> has</c><00:03:49.490><c> to</c><00:03:49.640><c> run</c>

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 align:start position:0%
it's a complex beast and it has to run
 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.340 align:start position:0%
it's a complex beast and it has to run
well<00:03:50.030><c> so</c><00:03:50.390><c> how</c><00:03:50.510><c> did</c><00:03:50.660><c> you</c><00:03:50.750><c> actually</c><00:03:50.870><c> kind</c><00:03:51.260><c> of</c>

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 align:start position:0%
well so how did you actually kind of
 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.500 align:start position:0%
well so how did you actually kind of
build<00:03:52.070><c> up</c><00:03:52.250><c> to</c><00:03:52.400><c> what</c><00:03:52.520><c> we</c><00:03:52.640><c> had</c><00:03:52.790><c> what</c><00:03:53.000><c> we</c><00:03:53.330><c> actually</c>

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 align:start position:0%
build up to what we had what we actually
 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.930 align:start position:0%
build up to what we had what we actually
get<00:03:53.780><c> to</c><00:03:53.930><c> see</c><00:03:54.580><c> well</c><00:03:55.580><c> I</c><00:03:55.640><c> think</c><00:03:55.930><c> it</c><00:03:56.930><c> it</c><00:03:57.290><c> all</c><00:03:57.440><c> it's</c>

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 align:start position:0%

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.670 align:start position:0%
get to see well I think it it all it's

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 align:start position:0%

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
through middle-earth on desktop but I
 

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.230 align:start position:0%
through middle-earth on desktop but I
can<00:08:29.030><c> also</c><00:08:29.180><c> do</c><00:08:29.419><c> it</c><00:08:29.540><c> on</c><00:08:29.660><c> phones</c><00:08:30.140><c> and</c><00:08:30.530><c> tablets</c>

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
can also do it on phones and tablets
 

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.450 align:start position:0%
can also do it on phones and tablets
which<00:08:32.240><c> is</c><00:08:32.419><c> frankly</c><00:08:33.020><c> awesome</c><00:08:33.440><c> and</c><00:08:34.070><c> this</c><00:08:34.219><c> is</c><00:08:34.339><c> one</c>

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:34.460 align:start position:0%
which is frankly awesome and this is one
 

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.670 align:start position:0%
which is frankly awesome and this is one
of<00:08:34.490><c> the</c><00:08:34.610><c> first</c><00:08:34.760><c> times</c><00:08:35.030><c> I</c><00:08:35.330><c> think</c><00:08:36.169><c> I've</c><00:08:36.260><c> seen</c><00:08:36.409><c> an</c>

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
of the first times I think I've seen an
 

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.969 align:start position:0%
of the first times I think I've seen an

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:38.979 align:start position:0%
experience of this quality available
 

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:43.029 align:start position:0%
experience of this quality available
across<00:08:39.979><c> platforms</c><00:08:40.550><c> so</c><00:08:41.530><c> suppose</c><00:08:42.530><c> the</c><00:08:42.740><c> the</c>

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
across platforms so suppose the the
 

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
across platforms so suppose the the
obvious<00:08:43.370><c> question</c><00:08:43.729><c> for</c><00:08:44.120><c> me</c><00:08:44.210><c> initially</c><00:08:44.810><c> is</c><00:08:44.900><c> how</c>

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
obvious question for me initially is how
 

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.610 align:start position:0%
obvious question for me initially is how
did<00:08:45.620><c> you</c><00:08:45.710><c> find</c><00:08:46.130><c> the</c><00:08:46.430><c> process</c><00:08:46.610><c> of</c><00:08:47.180><c> building</c><00:08:48.110><c> a</c>

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:48.620 align:start position:0%
did you find the process of building a
 

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
did you find the process of building a

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:54.850 align:start position:0%
genuinely multi device experience yeah
 

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
genuinely multi device experience yeah
it<00:08:55.850><c> was</c><00:08:56.000><c> a</c><00:08:56.030><c> journey</c><00:08:57.700><c> it's</c><00:08:58.700><c> been</c><00:08:58.820><c> a</c><00:08:58.910><c> learning</c>

00:08:59.079 --> 00:08:59.089 align:start position:0%
it was a journey it's been a learning
 

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:01.050 align:start position:0%
it was a journey it's been a learning
process<00:08:59.300><c> for</c><00:08:59.839><c> us</c><00:08:59.930><c> as</c><00:09:00.110><c> well</c><00:09:00.290><c> as</c><00:09:00.410><c> the</c><00:09:00.560><c> company</c>

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.060 align:start position:0%
process for us as well as the company
 

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
process for us as well as the company
because<00:09:02.060><c> we</c><00:09:02.150><c> haven't</c><00:09:03.010><c> been</c><00:09:04.010><c> too</c><00:09:04.310><c> much</c><00:09:04.580><c> into</c>

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
because we haven't been too much into
 

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:13.420 align:start position:0%
because we haven't been too much into
that<00:09:05.300><c> before</c><00:09:06.190><c> but</c><00:09:07.190><c> I</c><00:09:11.380><c> mean</c><00:09:12.380><c> from</c><00:09:12.920><c> beginning</c><00:09:13.310><c> it</c>

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
that before but I mean from beginning it
 

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.820 align:start position:0%
that before but I mean from beginning it
was<00:09:13.550><c> a</c><00:09:13.580><c> big</c><00:09:14.030><c> hurdle</c><00:09:14.270><c> to</c><00:09:14.600><c> decide</c><00:09:15.350><c> what</c><00:09:15.530><c> to</c><00:09:15.680><c> do</c>

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:15.830 align:start position:0%
was a big hurdle to decide what to do
 

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.340 align:start position:0%
was a big hurdle to decide what to do
with<00:09:16.160><c> platforms</c><00:09:17.030><c> that</c><00:09:17.180><c> didn't</c><00:09:17.570><c> support</c><00:09:17.810><c> WebGL</c>

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:18.350 align:start position:0%
with platforms that didn't support WebGL
 

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
with platforms that didn't support WebGL
for<00:09:18.830><c> example</c><00:09:19.780><c> how</c><00:09:20.780><c> to</c><00:09:20.839><c> handle</c><00:09:21.320><c> that</c><00:09:21.610><c> how</c><00:09:22.610><c> to</c>

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:22.870 align:start position:0%
for example how to handle that how to
 

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.579 align:start position:0%
for example how to handle that how to

communicate with all different kinds of
 

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
communicate with all different kinds of

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:30.290 align:start position:0%

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
experience from that point I think we
 

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.699 align:start position:0%
experience from that point I think we
found<00:09:36.410><c> it</c><00:09:36.910><c> pretty</c><00:09:37.910><c> similar</c><00:09:38.240><c> to</c><00:09:38.470><c> normal</c><00:09:39.470><c> web</c>

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:39.709 align:start position:0%
found it pretty similar to normal web
 

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:42.730 align:start position:0%
found it pretty similar to normal web

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.050 align:start position:0%
the website and of course there are like
 

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
the website and of course there are like
limitations<00:09:49.210><c> to</c><00:09:50.210><c> it</c><00:09:50.680><c> that</c><00:09:51.680><c> you</c><00:09:51.830><c> have</c><00:09:51.980><c> to</c><00:09:52.600><c> abide</c>

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
limitations to it that you have to abide
 

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
limitations to it that you have to abide
to<00:09:53.870><c> well</c><00:09:54.320><c> that</c><00:09:54.680><c> was</c><00:09:54.770><c> actually</c><00:09:55.010><c> gonna</c><00:09:55.100><c> be</c><00:09:55.190><c> my</c>

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:55.370 align:start position:0%
to well that was actually gonna be my

to well that was actually gonna be my
next<00:09:55.580><c> question</c><00:09:55.700><c> so</c><00:09:56.390><c> kind</c><00:09:56.990><c> of</c><00:09:57.050><c> there</c><00:09:57.530><c> are</c>

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:57.590 align:start position:0%
next question so kind of there are
 

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.990 align:start position:0%
next question so kind of there are

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
decided what to include where and and so
 

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.850 align:start position:0%
decided what to include where and and so
on<00:10:25.030><c> yeah</c><00:10:26.030><c> I</c><00:10:26.060><c> guess</c><00:10:26.870><c> the</c><00:10:27.020><c> biggest</c><00:10:27.230><c> hurdle</c><00:10:27.680><c> was</c>

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:27.860 align:start position:0%
on yeah I guess the biggest hurdle was
 

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.210 align:start position:0%
on yeah I guess the biggest hurdle was
the<00:10:28.160><c> memory</c><00:10:28.520><c> consumption</c><00:10:28.910><c> and</c><00:10:29.860><c> because</c><00:10:30.860><c> you</c>

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:31.220 align:start position:0%
the memory consumption and because you
 

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.950 align:start position:0%
the memory consumption and because you
you<00:10:31.520><c> can</c><00:10:32.230><c> pretty</c><00:10:33.230><c> much</c><00:10:34.420><c> hit</c><00:10:35.420><c> the</c><00:10:35.570><c> roof</c><00:10:35.720><c> and</c>

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
you can pretty much hit the roof and
 

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
you can pretty much hit the roof and

the frames keeping going on so I guess
there<00:12:19.649><c> is</c><00:12:19.680><c> much</c><00:12:20.100><c> more</c><00:12:20.399><c> forgiving</c><00:12:21.470><c> if</c><00:12:22.470><c> it's</c><00:12:22.740><c> not</c>

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:22.950 align:start position:0%
there is much more forgiving if it's not

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.220 align:start position:0%
is the ratio between amount of pixels
 

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.190 align:start position:0%
is the ratio between amount of pixels

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.810 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.470 align:start position:0%

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
too many pixels for their own good they
 

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
too many pixels for their own good they
look<00:14:28.630><c> amazing</c><00:14:29.170><c> but</c><00:14:29.290><c> they</c><00:14:29.470><c> don't</c><00:14:29.890><c> they</c><00:14:30.130><c> don't</c>

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:30.370 align:start position:0%
look amazing but they don't they don't
 

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.850 align:start position:0%
look amazing but they don't they don't
they're<00:14:30.760><c> not</c><00:14:30.790><c> as</c><00:14:30.970><c> forgiving</c><00:14:31.570><c> I</c><00:14:31.810><c> guess</c><00:14:32.170><c> when</c><00:14:32.830><c> it</c>

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:32.860 align:start position:0%
they're not as forgiving I guess when it
 

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
they're not as forgiving I guess when it
comes<00:14:32.980><c> to</c><00:14:33.190><c> performance</c><00:14:33.670><c> yeah</c><00:14:33.910><c> okay</c><00:14:35.460><c> so</c><00:14:36.460><c> what</c>

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:36.610 align:start position:0%
comes to performance yeah okay so what
 

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.850 align:start position:0%
comes to performance yeah okay so what
are<00:14:36.640><c> you</c><00:14:36.790><c> looking</c><00:14:37.510><c> back</c><00:14:37.690><c> over</c><00:14:37.990><c> this</c><00:14:38.230><c> project</c>

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:38.860 align:start position:0%
are you looking back over this project
 

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.450 align:start position:0%
are you looking back over this project
now<00:14:39.690><c> what</c><00:14:40.690><c> would</c><00:14:40.750><c> you</c><00:14:40.900><c> say</c><00:14:40.930><c> you're</c><00:14:41.560><c> most</c><00:14:42.160><c> proud</c>

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:42.460 align:start position:0%
now what would you say you're most proud
 

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.570 align:start position:0%
now what would you say you're most proud
of<00:14:42.610><c> from</c><00:14:43.090><c> the</c><00:14:43.690><c> whole</c><00:14:43.930><c> thing</c><00:14:44.290><c> I</c><00:14:44.590><c> guess</c><00:14:45.430><c> both</c>

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:45.580 align:start position:0%
of from the whole thing I guess both
 

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
of from the whole thing I guess both
from<00:14:45.910><c> a</c><00:14:45.940><c> creative</c><00:14:46.810><c> point</c><00:14:46.990><c> of</c><00:14:47.200><c> view</c><00:14:47.580><c> but</c><00:14:48.580><c> also</c><00:14:48.640><c> a</c>

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:48.910 align:start position:0%
from a creative point of view but also a
 

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.610 align:start position:0%
from a creative point of view but also a

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:50.620 align:start position:0%
technical point of view you can yeah go
 

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.270 align:start position:0%
technical point of view you can yeah go
go<00:14:50.950><c> crazy</c><00:14:51.220><c> whatever</c><00:14:51.640><c> you</c><00:14:51.730><c> like</c>

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
go crazy whatever you like
 

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
go crazy whatever you like
yeah<00:14:54.300><c> I</c><00:14:55.300><c> think</c><00:14:56.050><c> my</c><00:14:57.510><c> I'm</c><00:14:58.510><c> most</c><00:14:58.750><c> proud</c><00:14:59.020><c> of</c><00:14:59.110><c> is</c>

00:14:59.400 --> 00:14:59.410 align:start position:0%
yeah I think my I'm most proud of is
 

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
yeah I think my I'm most proud of is
that<00:14:59.440><c> we</c><00:14:59.620><c> managed</c><00:15:00.190><c> to</c><00:15:00.220><c> make</c><00:15:00.400><c> the</c><00:15:00.550><c> experience</c>

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
that we managed to make the experience
 

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
that we managed to make the experience
feel<00:15:01.180><c> very</c><00:15:01.390><c> tight</c><00:15:02.140><c> like</c><00:15:02.590><c> you're</c><00:15:04.620><c> an</c><00:15:05.620><c> app</c><00:15:06.310><c> that</c>

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
feel very tight like you're an app that
 

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.410 align:start position:0%
feel very tight like you're an app that
isn't<00:15:07.240><c> glitchy</c><00:15:07.990><c> that</c><00:15:08.650><c> is</c><00:15:08.770><c> you</c><00:15:09.730><c> really</c><00:15:10.060><c> went</c>

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:10.420 align:start position:0%
isn't glitchy that is you really went
 

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.190 align:start position:0%
isn't glitchy that is you really went
that<00:15:10.960><c> extra</c><00:15:11.110><c> mile</c><00:15:11.560><c> to</c><00:15:11.590><c> try</c><00:15:12.340><c> to</c><00:15:12.750><c> even</c><00:15:13.750><c> though</c><00:15:13.930><c> we</c>

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
that extra mile to try to even though we
 

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that extra mile to try to even though we
have<00:15:14.440><c> to</c><00:15:14.770><c> unload</c><00:15:15.370><c> each</c><00:15:15.760><c> section</c><00:15:16.390><c> for</c><00:15:16.420><c> bit</c>

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.050 align:start position:0%
have to unload each section for bit
 

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.190 align:start position:0%
have to unload each section for bit
between<00:15:17.980><c> sections</c><00:15:18.760><c> and</c><00:15:19.120><c> load</c><00:15:19.540><c> the</c><00:15:19.690><c> next</c><00:15:19.870><c> one</c>

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
between sections and load the next one
 

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.770 align:start position:0%
between sections and load the next one
so<00:15:20.980><c> on</c><00:15:21.100><c> to</c><00:15:21.930><c> keep</c><00:15:22.930><c> memory</c><00:15:23.620><c> consumption</c><00:15:24.130><c> low</c><00:15:25.030><c> I</c>

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:25.780 align:start position:0%
so on to keep memory consumption low I
 

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.770 align:start position:0%
so on to keep memory consumption low I
think<00:15:26.470><c> we</c><00:15:26.770><c> managed</c><00:15:27.070><c> that</c><00:15:27.790><c> by</c><00:15:28.240><c> really</c><00:15:28.750><c> putting</c>

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:28.780 align:start position:0%
think we managed that by really putting
 

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
think we managed that by really putting

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:45.550 align:start position:0%
like it's a gap and then you have to

like it's a gap and then you have to

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
discussions but we actually could do and
 

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
discussions but we actually could do and
I<00:17:47.680><c> mean</c><00:17:48.250><c> we</c><00:17:48.490><c> need</c><00:17:48.640><c> to</c><00:17:48.670><c> have</c><00:17:48.790><c> super</c><00:17:49.420><c> simple</c>

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:49.810 align:start position:0%
I mean we need to have super simple
 

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
I mean we need to have super simple
version<00:17:50.380><c> for</c><00:17:51.130><c> mobile</c><00:17:51.490><c> devices</c><00:17:52.030><c> but</c><00:17:52.540><c> then</c>

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.050 align:start position:0%
version for mobile devices but then
 

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
version for mobile devices but then
gradually<00:17:53.380><c> we</c><00:17:53.800><c> could</c><00:17:54.010><c> add</c><00:17:54.190><c> more</c><00:17:54.790><c> and</c><00:17:54.940><c> more</c><00:17:55.030><c> and</c>

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:55.330 align:start position:0%
gradually we could add more and more and
 

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.790 align:start position:0%
gradually we could add more and more and
more<00:17:55.510><c> and</c><00:17:56.880><c> I'm</c><00:17:57.880><c> personally</c><00:17:58.480><c> pretty</c><00:17:59.380><c> amazed</c>

00:17:59.790 --> 00:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
more and I'm personally pretty amazed
 

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
more and I'm personally pretty amazed
what<00:18:00.100><c> you</c><00:18:00.130><c> can</c><00:18:00.220><c> do</c><00:18:00.460><c> with</c><00:18:00.640><c> devices</c><00:18:01.090><c> these</c><00:18:01.270><c> days</c>

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:01.770 align:start position:0%
what you can do with devices these days
 

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
what you can do with devices these days
right<00:18:02.770><c> now</c><00:18:02.830><c> it</c><00:18:03.130><c> takes</c><00:18:03.160><c> really</c><00:18:03.970><c> long</c><00:18:04.090><c> time</c><00:18:04.510><c> to</c>

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:04.810 align:start position:0%
right now it takes really long time to
 

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
right now it takes really long time to
to<00:18:05.530><c> make</c><00:18:06.040><c> it</c><00:18:06.310><c> site</c><00:18:06.610><c> like</c><00:18:06.850><c> this</c><00:18:07.030><c> but</c><00:18:07.420><c> I</c><00:18:08.430><c> think</c>

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:09.430 align:start position:0%
to make it site like this but I think
 

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
to make it site like this but I think
that<00:18:09.670><c> in</c><00:18:10.090><c> in</c><00:18:10.990><c> a</c><00:18:11.110><c> very</c><00:18:11.140><c> short</c><00:18:11.470><c> future</c><00:18:12.100><c> we</c><00:18:12.610><c> will</c>

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:12.790 align:start position:0%
that in in a very short future we will
 

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.150 align:start position:0%
that in in a very short future we will
take<00:18:13.660><c> this</c><00:18:13.810><c> for</c><00:18:14.020><c> granted</c><00:18:14.170><c> that</c><00:18:14.740><c> we</c><00:18:14.950><c> used</c>

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
take this for granted that we used
 

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
take this for granted that we used
mobile<00:18:15.520><c> in</c><00:18:15.850><c> this</c><00:18:16.000><c> way</c><00:18:16.210><c> and</c><00:18:16.780><c> when</c><00:18:17.770><c> making</c><00:18:18.100><c> sites</c>

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:18.370 align:start position:0%
mobile in this way and when making sites
 

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.210 align:start position:0%
mobile in this way and when making sites
like<00:18:19.000><c> this</c><00:18:19.210><c> I</c><00:18:19.480><c> think</c><00:18:20.290><c> one</c><00:18:20.590><c> thing</c><00:18:20.860><c> for</c><00:18:21.100><c> example</c>

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.220 align:start position:0%
like this I think one thing for example
 

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.570 align:start position:0%
like this I think one thing for example
is<00:18:21.640><c> the</c><00:18:22.630><c> 3d</c><00:18:23.020><c> models</c><00:18:23.350><c> were</c><00:18:23.950><c> used</c><00:18:24.190><c> in</c><00:18:24.340><c> WebGL</c>

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:24.580 align:start position:0%
is the 3d models were used in WebGL
 

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.810 align:start position:0%
is the 3d models were used in WebGL
experiments<00:18:25.680><c> from</c><00:18:26.680><c> the</c><00:18:26.800><c> beginning</c><00:18:27.160><c> we</c><00:18:27.370><c> really</c>

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:27.820 align:start position:0%
experiments from the beginning we really
 

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.410 align:start position:0%
experiments from the beginning we really
set<00:18:28.600><c> the</c><00:18:28.780><c> aim</c><00:18:28.900><c> on</c><00:18:29.140><c> on</c><00:18:29.380><c> using</c><00:18:29.770><c> much</c><00:18:30.000><c> lower</c><00:18:31.000><c> all</c>

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:31.420 align:start position:0%
set the aim on on using much lower all
 

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
set the aim on on using much lower all
accounts<00:18:32.520><c> less</c><00:18:33.520><c> complex</c><00:18:34.090><c> models</c><00:18:34.900><c> but</c><00:18:35.490><c> that</c><00:18:36.490><c> is</c>

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:36.610 align:start position:0%
accounts less complex models but that is
 

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.990 align:start position:0%
accounts less complex models but that is
something<00:18:36.880><c> that</c><00:18:36.940><c> we</c><00:18:37.240><c> check</c><00:18:37.780><c> tracing</c>

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
something that we check tracing
 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%

for<00:18:40.000><c> some</c><00:18:40.210><c> arts</c><00:18:41.280><c> that's</c><00:18:42.280><c> a</c><00:18:42.430><c> trick</c><00:18:42.640><c> that's</c>

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:42.910 align:start position:0%
for some arts that's a trick that's

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.030 align:start position:0%
under the same roof and yeah use them
 

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
under the same roof and yeah use them
