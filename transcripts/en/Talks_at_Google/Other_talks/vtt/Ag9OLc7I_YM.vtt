00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:04.360
MALE SPEAKER: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.610
And welcome to another
Talks at Google event.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.050
And this event is very, very
near and dear to many of us

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.910
here at Google, the idea of
preserving cultural patrimony,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.030
digitizing
manuscripts, organizing

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.670
the world's information.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.260
In today's instance,
Joshua Hammer

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.950
is here to talk to
us about "The Bad-ass

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.750
Librarians of Timbuktu."

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.420
Now I do want to preface this
entire conversation by saying

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.540
that I personally think
that all librarians are

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.010
bad-ass in their own right,
but these in particular.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.400
Joshua traces the
story of many heroes

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.020
who worked to preserve the
written legacy of Timbuktu

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.880
as the library was rent
ransacked during civil strife.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.550
And so he will go
into that story.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700
He's also the author of
the numerous other books

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.010
and articles, including
and "Yokohama Burning."

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.200
And we'll have time for
some questions at the end.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.500
So please join me in
welcoming Joshua to Google.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Thank you.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.041
JOSHUA HAMMER: Thank you.

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.644
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:06.141
Thanks a lot.

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.475
What I thought I
would do, and I've

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:11.926
honed this after a couple
of book talks in New York,

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:16.190
is give you a little rundown
of the arc of this story

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.660
and how I happened
to come to it.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.710
And then I will accompany
that with some pictures

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.040
so you can get a sense of what
this very unusual, desolate,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.789
but somehow beautiful
part of the world

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.830
is all-- what it looks
like, what it's all about.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.245
And then I would read
a couple passages

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:33.870
and then ask if you
have any questions.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.960
So Timbuktu-- how did
I come upon this place?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.380
I was "Newsweek's" Africa bureau
chief in the '90s and kind of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.060
had carte blanche to travel
all across sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.560
basically doing whatever
I wanted to do in the days

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.790
when that kind of
journalism was still--

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.690
when news weeklies and
other media organizations

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.490
had deep pockets and could
let their correspondents just

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.710
wander the world.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.190
So a couple of colleagues and
I in 1995 went to Timbuktu.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.630
We chartered a small plane
in Bamako, the capital,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660
and flew up there for two hours.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.029
Because it was expensive to
charter your own airplane.

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.320
And they weren't that generous.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.550
So we flew in, and we
wandered the streets

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.750
of this ancient
town, desolate town.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.730
There was a war going on.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.500
The nomadic people known
as Tuaregs were in revolt.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.340
And so there was basically--
there were no tourists.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.692
There was basically no
transportation in or out.

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:33.400
We managed to get in
there, and wandered,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.930
and saw the mud huts
where the explorers

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.360
from the early 19th
century had stayed

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.390
when they managed to get
into Timbuktu back then

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.150
and where one of them had
been executed after it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.090
was found he was not a Muslim.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.470
So it was a desolate,
kind of depressing place.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.290
But also obviously had
this incredibly rich,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.890
legendary history behind it.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.180
And I was definitely hooked
right then and there.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.130
Then 10 years later,
I left "Newsweek"

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.340
and went freelance and
began looking around

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.790
for ideas, always on the search
for ideas to keep working.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.730
Came across a small item
about these manuscripts

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.750
from the Middle Ages that
had been rediscovered

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.960
in and around Timbuktu.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.050
And the article went on to say
that there was an effort led

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.300
by a couple of librarians
to collect them--

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.890
I don't think the
digitization was yet part

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.160
of the process at that point.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.600
But it was simply collecting
them and restoring them,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.320
building libraries and trying
to show them to the world.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.150
It definitely
caught my attention

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.060
given my previous
trip to Timbuktu

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.220
and my interest in literature,
and the preservation

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.900
of manuscripts, and
cultural patrimony.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.740
Called an editor at
"Smithsonian Magazine,"

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.467
which does that kind
of thing-- exactly

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:54.550
what would appeal to them.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.650
And within a week, I was on
another plane up to Timbuktu.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.790
This is what I confronted.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.460
This is the Sankore
mosque, which

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.340
was built in the 14th century.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.510
The typical architecture
of that period,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.850
when it was really a
unique architecture that's

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.190
sort of influenced by
the Egyptian pyramids

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.959
but given its own kind
of North African motif.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.952
Streets look like that-- mix
of mud brick and limestone.

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:25.300
And better houses were made
of these limestone bricks,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.200
as you see.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.460
Mud alleys-- not the
kind of grand city

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.900
paved with gold that
had lured the Europeans

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.080
in the early 19th century.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.410
Another shot of the oldest
neighborhood of Timbuktu--

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.840
Sankore, it's called.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.440
During that trip, I met this
gentleman, Abdul Kader Haidara.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.920
He was the most
charismatic figure

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.750
in Timbuktu in this
manuscript effort.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.440
What he had done
single handedly,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.760
practically, was to rediscover
this incredible tradition

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.120
of manuscript writing that
had flourished in Timbuktu

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.650
in the 15th and 16th centuries.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.580
This desolate place
had 500 years ago

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.380
been at the center
of the commerce

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.860
and cultural life of that
period in Northern Africa.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.830
It was a place where the
river met the desert, where

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.680
the highest bend
of the Niger River,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.830
the third longest river
in Africa, met the Sahara.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.150
So you had this constant
stream of transport,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.860
of commercial transport,
coming from across the Sahara

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.860
Desert from as far away as
Europe, bringing textiles,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.690
clothing, whatever they
could-- whatever came out

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.940
of that part of the world.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.050
Then river traffic coming
up from sub-Saharan Africa

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.485
bringing everything from
kola nuts, to slaves-- it

00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:52.920
was a big slave
trading port-- to gold.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.930
So over the centuries,
this outpost

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.250
at the very edge of the Sahara
became an incredibly wealthy

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.370
place.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.160
At the same time, under a
couple of enlightened rulers,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.390
it became a center
of intellectuality,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.260
of scholasticism.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.810
Universities were founded in
the 15th and 16th centuries.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.580
Thousands of students
came to Timbuktu

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.570
from all across the Arab world.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.433
An industry creating manuscripts
it was founded around 1400,

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:25.970
or 1500, or so.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.520
In between that period, you had
hundreds of scribes turning out

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.940
using beautiful calligraphy,
and beautiful colors,

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.460
and beautiful
pattern and designs,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.450
works that range from Korans,
the Hadith, the sayings

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.520
of the prophet, to
secular works including

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.220
works of astronomy,
works of medicine,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.510
poetry, guides to orgasm.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.290
You name it, everything
could be found

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.020
in Timbuktu-- how-to books,
I should say-- how-to books

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.170
about sex.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.090
That was a real popular
seller in about 1550.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.790
So this incredible trade
flourished for 100 years

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.930
or so during this
golden era of Timbuktu.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.860
It showed a kind
of Islam that was

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.240
tolerant, open, cross-cultural,
multicultural, open to ideas,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.380
able to synthesize both religion
and science in a unique way.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.820
It lasted, as I said,
for about a century.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.500
And then in the late
16th century, about 1591,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.900
Moroccan invaders swept across
the Sahara, conquered Timbuktu,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.350
took many of these scholars
and scribes into captivity.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.760
A lot of them were
resistant-- became

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.290
members of the resistance
against the colonial occupiers.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.400
So they were either
killed or enslaved

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.590
and dragged across the
desert back to Morocco

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.280
where they spent either the
rest of their lives or years

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.250
in captivity.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.840
That pretty much
ended Timbuktu's reign

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.440
as the center or scholasticism
of this part of the world.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.230
At the same time,
cultural-- sorry,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.010
trade routes were changing.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.440
This whole desert trade was
no longer that important.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.900
And as time went
on, Timbuktu kind of

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.740
faded into insignificance of
became this, as I have said,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.040
this desolate outpost that
the Europeans stumbled

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.280
into in the 19th century.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.880
And they got there,
as I said, having

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.860
heard these legends
about this city of gold

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.730
and stumbled upon this place
that was pretty much-- well,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.750
you saw the pictures
before-- just a dusty,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.790
poor, monochromatic,
pretty insignificant pace.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.330
So there was tremendous joy
at having reached Timbuktu,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.490
but at the same time
great disappointment.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.919
Abdel Kader Haidara had a unique
story, a pretty extraordinary

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.480
story.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.600
This gentleman was the son
of a scholar in Timbuktu,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.830
became interested in Timbuktu's
lost literary tradition

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.700
as a young man, as a teenager.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.900
And I should also point
out that not only did

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.970
Timbuktu become a desolate
place, poverty stricken place,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.220
but the whole tradition
of literature,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.870
of learning was lost to the
point where enlightenment

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.460
philosophers in Europe-- Hegel,
Locke, Kant-- wrote articles,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.100
wrote books saying that the
Africans have given us nothing.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.330
The Africans have given
us-- have no civilization,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.710
have no written traditions,
were illiterate savages.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.370
The Enlightenment
philosophers' views

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.640
were instrumental in
justifying the slave trade.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.300
Because they
propagated this idea

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.675
that Africans were sub-humans.

00:09:29.675 --> 00:09:31.540
And therefore, taking
them into captivity

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.900
was perfectly acceptable.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.330
It should be pointed
out of course

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.880
that the people in Timbuktu
back then also participated

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.710
in the slave trade.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.690
So this wasn't the specific
to the European point of view.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.470
But anyway, Abdel
Kader was determined

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.510
to rescue this lost tradition.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.760
So he was hired in 1984 by
the Ahmed Baba Center, which

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.710
was a government owned library
funded by the royal-- governed

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.955
by the royal families of
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:03.330
He was hired to go out-- he
was a bit reluctant at first.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.180
He said to me, I want
to go into businesses.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.670
His father had actually
become a fairly wealthy man

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.210
trading livestock and grain
as well as maintaining

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.780
his own private library.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.520
Abdel Kader kind of leaned
towards the money-making side

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.550
of his father's career
but was persuaded

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.570
by the chief
librarian, who appealed

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.510
to his sense of national
duty and his love of books

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.060
to go out hit the road.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.780
And this guy really
did hit the road.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.270
He went out, spent
the next 12 years

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:36.520
of his life traveling by
camel, on foot, by riverboat

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.140
through desert along
the Niger River.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.859
Let's just-- I
actually forgot to just

00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:43.900
give you a little sense
of these books look like.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.399
So let's quickly
flip through these.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:49.100
And then I'll continue Abdel
Kader's story very briefly.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.310
So this actually appears as
the end-piece in my book,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.080
because I think it's one of
the most beautiful pieces.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.350
I believe this is a Koran
from the 16th century.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:04.050
And you can see gold leaf, earth
colors derived from minerals,

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.250
from insects, from plants.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.890
Because of the prohibitions in
Islam against representations

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.840
of the human form, they
resorted to, instead,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.560
these incredibly
intricate patterns

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.590
that were meant to
kind of demonstrate

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:23.920
the universality, the harmony
of existence under God.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.310
And you have-- this is a book,
I believe, a diagram possibly

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.250
of poetry.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.875
One of the things
about the manuscripts

00:11:31.875 --> 00:11:34.333
is that very few of them have
been translated into English.

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:36.130
So unless you could
read classical Arabic,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.550
you're kind of lost.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.370
But you know, you
can still appreciate

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:45.880
the beauty these books, some
really extraordinary works.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.400
I mean, and we're talking
thousands and thousands

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:48.900
of these.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.233
So back to Abdel Kader-- this
is the kind of landscape--

00:11:51.233 --> 00:11:53.830
this is the road to
Timbuktu if you could even

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.180
imagine there's a road there.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.721
It's basically just
a sand track that

00:11:56.721 --> 00:12:00.750
runs for 100 miles to the
very edge of the Sahara

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.400
from southern Mali.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.980
Well, he was traveling for years
across this kind of landscape

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.895
getting clues about books.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:15.610
You know, hey, I hear there's
a Qadi, a traditional judge,

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.240
in a village on the Niger
River 100 miles from Timbuktu

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.750
who has a box in a hidden
storage room which has

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.000
a Koran from the 12th century.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.625
He would get these
clues, and then he'd

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:27.350
head off on these incredible
journeys that sometimes lasted

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.870
a month carrying lots
of cash, bargaining,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.990
developed a keen sense the
worth of these volumes.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.180
Again, more of kind of landscape
of this part of the world--

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.400
this is called La Dune
Rose, the pink dune,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.770
along the Niger River,
a 90-foot sand dune

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.160
towering over the stream.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.120
Traveling by riverboat-- a
little bit better than this.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.080
I mean, they had motors
at least-- along the Niger

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.190
for days and weeks--
and managed to amass

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.030
an incredible collection--
by the end, personally

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.590
probably about 100,000 works
for the Ahmed Baba Center.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.500
After that, he developed
his own library

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.810
based on the books that had been
in his family for generations.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.430
By this point-- an
it was incredible,

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.700
the ultimate networker.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.810
He had managed to
establish great connections

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.800
with European, Middle
Eastern, American foundations.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.090
Money was rolling in.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.780
Libraries were being founded.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.820
By 2001, the sort
of golden age--

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.050
he had really recreated,
to a modest extent,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.390
the golden age of Timbuktu.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:44.040
There were 50 libraries,
377,000 volumes recollected

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.250
by Abdel Kader and other
librarians who emulated him who

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.950
he helped to acquire
funds from, as I

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.195
said, from Dubai, from
Kuwait, from Belgium,

00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:53.700
from the Netherlands.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.880
People were kind of excited
by this idea, you know.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.770
Cultural, at this
time, was a time

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.160
to-- when people were
sort of rediscovering

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.800
the cultural bounty of Africa.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.920
And so people were only
too happy to bring in,

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.145
to encourage this
the Renaissance.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.100
Next stage in the story-- 2012.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.660
Actually, let's take
it back to 2011.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.620
There had been, simultaneous
with this Renaissance

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.910
in the desert, cultural
Renaissance, which also

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.257
included a musical Renaissance.

00:14:27.257 --> 00:14:29.590
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with the music

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.420
of Mali, but it was
exploding not only

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.320
across Europe and to some
extent the US at this time,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.360
but within Mali.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.590
There was a festival
that had been created

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.220
in 2001 called The Festival
in the Desert to which

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.570
people like Robert Plant of
Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Buffett,

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.580
Bono were coming and playing.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.030
And so this was
getting publicity.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.020
And people were coming
from all around the world.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.550
When I visited 2009,
5,000 Westerners

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.550
descended on this outdoor,
three and a half day festival

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.160
in the dunes west of Timbuktu.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.020
I mean, it was an amazing
time in this desolate place

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.470
that I had visited
1995, completely cut off

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.120
from the world, transformed
in the course of less

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.010
than a decade into
this happening

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.210
town on the edge of the Sahara.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:25.780
2011, the Arab Spring happened,
including the downfall

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.210
of Muammar Qaddafi.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.940
In the years before
that, you had

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.900
this Islamic, Islamist movement
percolating in the Sahara

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.570
as Islamist movements tend
to do in parts of the world

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.212
where there is poor government,
where there's a lot of poverty,

00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:41.920
where there's very
little infrastructure,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.340
very little security.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.480
Islamist extremists
love a vacuum.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.220
And that's what the Sahara
and the area around Timbuktu

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.520
offered.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.380
So in addition to
the fact that you

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.150
had Saudi money
pouring into this area

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.740
to try to encourage
the spread of Wahabbist

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.380
Islamist philosophy.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.060
So that had begun to take hold.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.560
Then you had a lot of
radicals from Algeria,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.360
who had fought a
very nasty, bloody

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.400
civil war in the 1990s
coming into Mali,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.160
kidnapping Westerners,
selling them for ransom,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.650
making big bucks.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.440
$116 million earned
by this group Al

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.610
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
in between about 2004,

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.480
let's call it, and 2011.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.670
That, in turn, allowed them to
buy weapons to recruit fighters

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.860
from across North Africa
and the Middle East.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.060
All this was going
on simultaneous

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.140
with this cultural
flowering in the desert.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.580
So you had these two
different dynamics

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.220
happening simultaneously.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.470
What changed the whole
dynamic completely was 2011,

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.380
was the Arab Spring.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.850
Getting back to that--
Qaddafi's regime fell.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.450
You may remember in
the-- Qaddafi was killed,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.119
I think, in July
or August, 2011.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.274
The armories were
opened-- chaos.

00:17:07.274 --> 00:17:09.690
NATO had been in there and
bombed the hell out of Qaddafi,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.579
but nobody kind of thought about
what the consequences would be.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.869
I think Obama said recently that
his biggest regret as president

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.420
was not foreseeing what
happened post-Qaddafi.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.829
Well, this is what happened.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.040
This was one of the many
unintended consequences

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.630
of the fall of Qaddafi, which
is that you had Islamists

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.950
flooding into Libya,
grabbing these weapons that

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.500
were basically free for
the taking in the armories.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.730
And you also had these Tuareg
rebels, the nomadic rebels

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.830
who had been fighting
for generations

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.400
for their own independent
state in Northern Mali.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.330
They got involved
in the act too.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.500
These were secular
rebels, but they

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.460
found a commonality of
purpose with Al Qaeda--

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.660
all grabbed guns and
then in rapid succession

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.860
took over the North of Mali.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.670
The government fell.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:02.080
Timbuktu fell on
April 1st, 2012.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.610
This is a photo of
a Sufi shrine, which

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.180
was destroyed by
Al Qaeda in July,

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.580
2012 as a foretaste of what
was going to happen in this.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.790
As they declared
Sharia law, they

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.430
begin amputating hands
and amputating feet,

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.910
stoning people to death--
let me go back there--

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:30.410
and making life
extremely difficult

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.400
for the residents of Timbuktu
and across the north.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.540
At this point, this is when
the final act of my story

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.810
unfolds, which is the
incredibly elaborate though

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.720
low-tech smuggling operation
that Abdel Kader Haidara then

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.140
engaged in, because he
believed that at some point--

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.420
although they had not
specifically threatened

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.520
to destroy these
manuscripts, he was

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.190
all but certain that the
jihadists at some point

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.420
would target them.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.970
Because he saw what
they stood for, as well

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.470
many other people saw, as
anathema, as heretical,

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.100
as antithetical to everything
that is in accordance

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.940
with Wahabbist philosophy.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.810
So Abdel Kader then embarked
upon this incredibly elaborate

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.640
effort using a network of
smugglers, volunteers, fellow

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.990
bad-ass librarians,
relatives, et

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:31.300
cetera to smuggle these by road,
by boat along the Niger River

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.120
to the safety of Bamako.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.680
The last stages of this
period were in early 2013

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.070
when the French military
invaded the country.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.320
And then the whole
North became a war zone.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.250
So the final act
was the continuing

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.220
the smuggling operation
as French troops

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.070
and French aircraft were bombing
the hell out of the North,

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.420
destroying the jihadis, but
also putting these manuscripts

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.880
in grave, grave danger.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.330
These are some shots I
took about four months

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:07.020
after the French invaded
and swept the jihadis out.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.420
In their final act of vengeance,
exactly what Abdel Kader

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.770
foretold or feared what
happened in fact happened,

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:18.380
which was that the jihadists
grabbed every manuscript

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.580
they could find that was left
in the city and burned them.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.120
And this is a picture
I took, again,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.650
about probably-- let's see.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:29.490
Let's say August,
2013, so about six

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.430
months after the
war in the North

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.040
ended and the jihadis had been
thrown out of Timbuktu and out

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.030
of the cities into the desert--
many killed, some still around.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.640
But in their final act, this
is what they left behind.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.410
This is the Ahmed
Baba Institute,

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.100
the government
owned library, which

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.355
they attacked and gathered
every manuscript that

00:20:48.355 --> 00:20:51.400
had been left behind, that Abdel
Kader had been able to save,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.560
and destroyed.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.130
And this is the
aftermath of all this.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.400
This is what happened.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.940
This is what's basically
keeping Timbuktu safe right now

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.650
are these guys.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.020
This is a West African
peacekeeping force

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.220
under the United
Nations umbrella.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.396
These guys were leaving
Timbuktu in August, 2013

00:21:10.396 --> 00:21:11.520
after serving a few months.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.311
They were going on.

00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:14.830
I think these guys are
from the Burkina Faso.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.220
And I was heading
across the Niger river

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.310
to visit Timbuktu to start my
reporting on this book project.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.301
And you can see-- kind
of an interesting shot.

00:21:26.301 --> 00:21:28.550
Guy over here thinks he's
storming the beach at D-day.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:32.500
But they basically
were and continue

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:38.410
to be the only security
that this desolate city has

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.470
protecting it.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.280
That essentially is
the arc of the story.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.770
Now I just thought I'd
give you a little bit

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.710
of a sense of the book.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.100
I'm going to read a
couple-- I've been

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.224
going for about 33 minutes.

00:21:47.224 --> 00:21:52.240
So let me read two passages
from this book that

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.460
will kind of give you
a taste of Abdel Kader.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:02.630
And the first one is, which I've
found has had a good response,

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:08.720
gives us a sense of
his bargaining efforts.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.360
So Abdel Kader would
go out into the bush.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.380
And he would bargain
with the locals.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.930
As I said, he would
get these clues

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.080
about the existence
of these manuscripts

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.480
and would track them down.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.431
And then he'd have to enter
into these negotiations.

00:22:25.431 --> 00:22:26.680
It was a very difficult thing.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.929
The first thing, people--
and I should point this out.

00:22:28.929 --> 00:22:31.880
I don't think I mentioned in my
talk that people were fearful.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.770
These manuscripts had,
over the centuries,

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.320
been disbursed through families.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.040
There had been a succession
of attacks on Timbuktu

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.130
by 19th century jihadists.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:47.175
The French colonizers had
come in and captured the area

00:22:47.175 --> 00:22:49.480
and held it for 70, 80 years.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.740
Manuscripts were highly
sought after by the French.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.560
The French had grabbed and
stolen many beautiful works,

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.630
whisked them off to libraries
in Paris and then elsewhere

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.570
in France.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.045
So by the time Abdel
Kader came around--

00:23:04.045 --> 00:23:08.630
and I neglected to tell you
this part of the story, what he

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.800
was doing in the first place.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.060
They had been dispersed
throughout the desert.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.650
They had left their
original home in Timbuktu.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.100
As I said, families
would pass them down

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.310
to generations of
sons and daughters.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.310
So they would be dispersed
through the families.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.720
And then because of this
fear of losing them,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.300
they would be further dispersed
and buried in the sand,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.510
and hidden in storage
rooms in villages and towns

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.890
all through the Niger, all
through upper Northern Mali.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.420
So by the time Abdel
Kader came and had

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.781
to try to find these works,
there was a lot of fear

00:23:42.781 --> 00:23:43.280
out there.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.810
People were extremely
reluctant to surrender

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.300
what they viewed as
their family heirlooms

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.520
and valuable collection.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.170
So he had a great
amount of difficulty

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.340
at first getting a
hold of these things.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.160
But his techniques improved.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.510
And he was able to
get more and more--

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.970
he was able to figure out
ways of encouraging people

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.560
and became more and
more successful.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.350
So this is a typical scene
of Abdel Kader at work.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.860
"People also sensed that
Haidara was playing fair.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.810
After nearly being run
out of Gorma Rharous,

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.240
the first town he
visited, Haidara

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.605
returned there a year later.

00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:22.200
On his first afternoon
back in town,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.340
a Tuareg nomad in
his 40s, a gaunt man

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.060
in a ragged turban with
half a dozen children

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.910
playing around him in the
sand, called out to him

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.420
in greeting as he
passed by his tent.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.000
'Come inside,' he cried.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.530
Haidara entered the traditional
dwelling stitched together

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.460
from goat skins and sat on the
ground in the semi-darkness.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.210
He noticed a metal
chest at the rear

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.950
of the tent, the type normally
used to whole manuscripts.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.260
'You come from where?'
said the Tuareg.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.760
'I'm from Timbuktu,'
replied Haidara in Tamasheq,

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.480
the language of the Tuaregs.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.110
In addition to his
native Songhay,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.290
he was conversant in
Peul and Tamasheq,

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.960
the two other main
languages of Mali's north,

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.690
as well as French, and
thus had no problem

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.860
negotiating with manuscript
owners across the region.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.200
Haidara made small talk.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.590
And seeing that the
Tuareg was too poor even

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.370
to offer his visitor
a cup of tea,

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.930
he offered to purchase
some food and drink

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.480
for him and his family.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.750
Haidara ran out to the
market and returned

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.780
with half of slaughtered lamb
and a kilogram bag of tea.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.110
The Tuareg grilled the
lamb outside the tent.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.140
And as they sat eating in the
sand with the man's family,

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.900
Haidara gently broached the
subject of the manuscripts.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.020
'I don't have any of
those,' the Tuareg said.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.790
'I only have printed books.'
'Can I take a look?' asked

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.540
Haidara.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.780
'Why not?' Haidara opened
the trunk and poured through

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.460
the volumes.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.380
Buried among the
printed material

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.770
was one work that
caught his eye,

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.550
a Koran from the 17th century.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.560
He looked through it carefully,
noting the delicate Maghrebi

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.110
letters, the fragile gilt
that caught the late afternoon

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.500
light filtering
through the tent flap.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.980
It was, Haidara
realized, a masterpiece.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.600
'How much do you want
for this?' asked Haidara.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.860
'Whatever you want to give
me,' the owner said, shrugging.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:12.280
'You have to name your price.'
'Give me 5,000 CFA,' or about

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.180
$10, the nomad said.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.100
It was a pitifully low sum.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.620
Haidara could not accept it.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.870
They bargained, but
this time the buyer

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.231
was bidding up the price.

00:26:22.231 --> 00:26:22.730
'No, no.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.370
This treasure has a
huge value,' he replied.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:30.290
'10,000 CFA.' 'No,'
Haidara said. '20,000.'

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.440
Haidara gave him 100,000 CFA.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.690
The man received
the money wide-eyed.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.090
'If I've got more books like,
will you pay for them?' he

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.620
asked. 'Of course.'

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.270
At five o'clock the morning
after that, in total darkness,

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.370
Haidara heard a
knock on his door.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.390
'Who is that?

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.195
Haidara said.

00:26:46.195 --> 00:26:49.800
The Tuareg entered his room
carrying a large camel skin

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.560
sack.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.090
Wordlessly, he dumped a pile
of manuscripts on the ground.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.140
In the murkiness before
dawn, Haidara could barely

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.740
see what was lying there.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.780
But at six o'clock, golden light
filtered through his window,

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.300
illuminating
magnificent treasure.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.700
When Haidara stepped outside
the hut later that morning,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.480
he stared in astonishment.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.750
Tuaregs from across
the region had

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.420
formed a long line in front
of his door, bearing cattle

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.250
and sheep skin sacks
stuffed with manuscripts.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.680
Many had been hidden in caves or
holes in the sand for decades.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.100
Haidara handed
out the equivalent

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.270
of thousands of dollars--
Kuwait and Saudi

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.370
Arabia had subsidized
the effort--

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.020
and left with more
than 1,000 manuscripts.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.820
He had paid the
seller's everything

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.610
they had demanded an even more.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.070
He had taken
everything they had.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.660
Haidara headed back
up river to Timbuktu,

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.850
his boat riding
low in the water,

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.970
weighed down with foot lockers
and piles of camel skin sacks.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.980
In Timbuktu, Mahmoud
Zouber, the library curator,

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.790
looked on with astonishment.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.030
'You found all that?' he said.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.060
In his first year of work
at the Ahmed Baba Institute,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.150
Haidara managed to acquire
as many manuscripts

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.540
as the previous team
of eight prospectors

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.460
had collected in a decade."

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:09.220
So I'm going to read one
more section, I think,

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:14.240
that will give you another look
at Abdel Kader and his methods.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.670
Basically, after 12
years of doing this,

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.030
he had gotten a bit tired.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.120
It was grueling work,
obviously-- well paid

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.439
for Malian standards,
but grueling.

00:28:24.439 --> 00:28:25.480
He wanted to get married.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.940
He wanted to settle down.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.890
He was spending three
quarters of his life

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.050
on the road in these
incredibly treacherous

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.500
and grueling journeys.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.059
He wanted to create
his own library,

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:37.100
as I'd mentioned earlier.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.190
His family had been collecting
these for centuries.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.140
So he informed the
curator, who he'd

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.300
become very attached to, that
he wanted to go out on his own.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.700
They began casting
around for money.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.340
He needed money,
obviously, to do this.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.130
Wrote to about 100 different
organizations across the world

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:03.980
and got absolutely nowhere until
Henry Louis Gates of Harvard

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.050
University came along.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:12.410
Now Gates, of course, was one
of America's foremost scholars,

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.210
had spent much of
his life trying

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.670
to show the world-- trying to
move American and the world

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.710
away from a Euro-centric
literary outlook

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.720
and show the Africa
actually had been

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.750
a center of literary tradition
that was completely lost.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:33.220
And so he set out in 1996 to
make a documentary with PBS

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:40.040
and BBC backing about Timbuktu,
about African culture,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:46.100
and arrived in Timbuktu in
1996, and began hearing stories

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.930
about this collector
in this town.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:57.349
And this is how a fateful
meeting between East and West,

00:29:57.349 --> 00:29:59.390
between Africa and the--
actually, the developing

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.900
world and the developed
world took place.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.984
So Gates gets to Timbuktu, and
shows up with a certain plan,

00:30:07.984 --> 00:30:09.900
has never heard of
Haidara, has a certain plan

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.996
of going to the mosque
and filming there.

00:30:11.996 --> 00:30:13.370
"But when they
reach their hotel,

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.860
their translator guide, and
acquaintance of Haidara,

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.190
approached them with
a different proposal.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.270
'If you want to see a
real library,' he said,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.364
'these books are held
mostly in private hands.

00:30:22.364 --> 00:30:24.780
And there is a man I know who
might be willing to show you

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:25.900
his collection.'

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.300
Gates, intrigued,
changed his itinerary.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.440
And he and the film
crew follow his guide

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.330
through the back alleys
to Haidara's house.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.370
Haidara, meanwhile, was
growing despondent the library

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.390
he had dreamed of creating for
five years was going nowhere.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.500
More than 100 foundations
had turned down his proposal,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.070
and he had run out of ideas.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.874
A big delegation of Americans is
here in Timbuktu,' Gates' guide

00:30:47.874 --> 00:30:49.790
informed Haidara on the
morning of the Harvard

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:50.927
professor's arrival.

00:30:50.927 --> 00:30:51.760
'They want to visit.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.343
You they want to see
your manuscripts,

00:30:53.343 --> 00:30:56.140
so be ready.' Haidara sensed
that the visit could be

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.530
an opportunity for him.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:58.630
'Fine,' he replied.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.340
'I'll prepare something
for them.' Haidara lay down

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.280
a carpet and gathered the best
manuscripts in his Timbuktu

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.210
collection.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.980
Gates and the film crew
arrived later that day.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.290
As the crew filmed, Gates
leafed through a treatise

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.330
on astronomy, a ledger
book that recorded slave

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.641
transactions, and other works.

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:18.890
'These are books written by
black people?' Gates asked

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:21.010
Haidara in a scene
captured on camera.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.390
Haidara, a bushy haired and
youthful 33-year-old nods.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.120
'When I was growing
up,' Gates replies,

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.700
shaking his head in amazement,
'the school books said that

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.720
Africans couldn't read and write
and didn't have any books.'

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.760
For hours, Haidara
gave Gates a tutorial

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.400
on Timbuktu's literary
heritage, describing

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.270
the rise of the
University of Sankore

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:42.380
and its illustrious roster
of biographers, jurists,

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:46.250
and historians, enumerating
the 12 important families that

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.920
had accumulated most of
Timbuktu's manuscripts

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.440
during its golden age,
chronicling the invasion

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.450
by Morocco that drove most
of these volumes underground,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.720
and explaining the role
played by descendants

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.220
of Timbuktu's collectors,
who had protected

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.510
the works for 400 years.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.120
It was one of the most moving
days of my life,' Gates

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.940
recalled. 'I was so
emotional holding these books

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.580
in my hands.' Not a word was
spoken about Haidara's stymied

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.610
plans to build a library,
but Gates left his encounter

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.030
convinced that he had to
do something to preserve

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.090
the manuscript.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.810
Unprotected and neglected
storage rooms-- many

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.750
we're turning to dust or
being devoured by termites,

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.660
and some had already been lost.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.710
It was a bone dry climate in
Timbuktu, so he was lucky,

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:29.560
Gates said.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.830
If they had been stored in
the humidity of Nigeria,

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.700
they would've turned
to mush long ago.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.360
When he returned to
the United States,

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.500
Gates informed the project
director at the Andrew W Mellon

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.575
Foundation in New York City
of the amazing discovery

00:32:42.575 --> 00:32:44.600
he had made in Timbuktu.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.150
All of these books still exist.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.160
This guy has them.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.250
And they're not even
in a library,' he said.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.780
Three months later,
on the strength

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.440
of Gates' recommendation,
the Mellon Foundation

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.880
awarded Haidara grant
of nearly $100,000

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.410
for the creation of a new
manuscript center in Timbuktu.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.940
The money came with
strings attached.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.230
Mellon required the collector
to create a digital archive

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.300
before moving ahead with
the physical construction.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.800
'I know you want
to build a library,

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.490
but the cataloging and
digitization have to come

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.990
first,' Gates emphasized.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.160
Haidara expressed his gratitude.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.840
Then he hired an architect
and construction crew

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.790
and built the library anyway.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.290
'What?' Gates said when Haidara
informed him several months

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.130
later that the
library was complete.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.280
'I told you that you needed to
catalog first.' 'We can't do

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.844
that without first having a
building,' Haidara replied.

00:33:33.844 --> 00:33:35.260
He argued that the
manuscripts had

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.540
been exposed to the
elements and imperiled

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.770
in their dusty storage rooms
and that his first priority

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.220
was to protect them.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.590
Exasperated and
fearing a scandal,

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.150
Gates reported the
misuse of the grant money

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.680
to the Mellon Foundation.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.030
They grumbled about it, but
the attitude, says Gates,

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.870
was, what's done is done.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.120
A few months later, Haidara
again called Gates at Harvard.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.960
'What is it?' asked
Gates, still annoyed

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.870
by Haidara's high-handedness.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:04.530
'I need another grant to build
another library,' Haidara said.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.654
'What?' Gates
exclaimed once more.

00:34:06.654 --> 00:34:08.570
'It's amazing that you've
got a grant to begin

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.780
with.' 'I know,' Haidara
said, 'but there was a slight

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.080
miscalculation.' 'What are you
talking about?' 'We built it

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.230
in the floodplain.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.949
We have to rebuild it.'

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.060
As Haidara explained
it, after many years

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.380
of little or no
rainfall in Timbuktu,

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.760
he and his construction
team had taken for granted

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.550
that the building
site was secure.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.650
But that year, a
once-in-a-generation series

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.850
of rainstorms had
struck the region.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.090
Rainwater had deluged the
rooms, cracked the cement,

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.310
and caused the roof to collapse.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.310
'Everything is filled with
water,' he told Gates.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.630
Luckily, Haidara
had not yet started

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.960
moving is manuscripts
into the new library.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.870
And they had all been spared.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:50.130
Gates, mortified, went back
to the Mellon Foundation.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.070
'You remember that library in
Timbuktu that was built without

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.080
your authorization with your
money?' he asked the program

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.220
officer.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.720
'Yes,' he replied.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.780
'Well, we've got
to build it again.'

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.830
The program director
just laughed.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.150
The whole situation was so quote
'absurd' unquote, said Gates,

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.190
and Haidara's demand for
more money so audacious

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.780
that it evoked more
amusement than outrage.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.230
The Mellon Foundation decided to
come through the extra funding,

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.150
and the Ford Foundation
contributed money as well.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.170
A new building soon rose
on the site, this one built

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.300
with reinforced concrete and
with its foundation raised

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.010
several feet off the ground.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.320
On January 13th,
2000, in a ceremony

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.630
attended by many luminaries,
the Mamma Haidara Commemorative

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.910
Library officially opened
its doors to the world."

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.660
Well, that was in 2000.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.910
And of course, that was
a high point for Haidara.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.930
And the next few years
would be glory years for him

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:51.070
as he watched this culture
kind of rise out of the desert

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.800
and begin to attract
more and more money

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.725
and generate more
and more interest.

00:35:55.725 --> 00:35:58.800
And it became sort
of an avalanche.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.060
Tourists begat more
media interest,

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.550
which begat more money.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.122
All, of course, came
crashing down in 2012

00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:07.640
with the takeover of Timbuktu.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.400
And I'm going to save
the smuggling operation

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.380
for your own reading.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.170
But of course, that
forms basically

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:23.100
the last 40% of the book as this
elaborate, dangerous operation

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.500
to remove the books under the
noses of the Al Qaeda occupiers

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:31.660
unfolds with a
still-- well, I would

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:36.790
stay with a happy, tentatively
happy result, but somewhat

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.230
ambiguous given
everything that's

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.430
going on in that part
of the world right now.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.210
So at this point,
48 minutes, I'd

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:49.730
be happy to take some questions
from anybody who's got one.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.329
AUDIENCE: How long were
you developing that book?

00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:55.620
JOSHUA HAMMER: So I had been
traveling to Mali just out

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.320
of my own interest
over, you know--

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:02.080
so I visited in '95 on a
lark, as I said, then 2006.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.225
2008 I went there to do
a whole bunch of stuff.

00:37:05.225 --> 00:37:06.550
I was there for three weeks.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:11.090
I did a story on the
festival, on other projects,

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.292
went back to Timbuktu.

00:37:12.292 --> 00:37:13.750
Couldn't find
Haidara at that time.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.310
He had just-- but I
went and saw his library

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.690
and saw how that had
developed, and then

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:27.490
came back again in 2013
when the French invaded.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:31.330
Because I knew so many people
that when the jihadists took

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:33.360
over, of course I was
then thinking, well,

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.430
what has happened to those-- I
wondered what would happened.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.596
It was hard to get any
information out of the North,

00:37:37.596 --> 00:37:38.280
you know?

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.890
So it was just like a vacuum.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.400
So I guess it was
around that trip in 2013

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.120
then I started to begin
to think about a book.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.730
But it wasn't
necessarily this book.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.510
It was just a book about
this dramatic takeover

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.760
of the North in Mali.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.140
And maybe I would follow some
of the characters I knew,

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.880
the head of the music festival.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.290
You know, it was all vaguely
formed at that point.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.527
And then I found out
about the manuscripts,

00:38:03.527 --> 00:38:04.610
what had happened to them.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.360
I managed to track
down that story.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.420
And then that became sort of
the most interesting element

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.810
of the any book idea.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:16.280
So and I actually then
went back in August, 2013

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.600
to write for Smithsonian
about that rescue effort.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.770
And by then, that
was when I said,

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.730
yeah, this story, with all the
background, and Haidara's life,

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:33.100
and the rise of jihadism in
North Africa, I said, you know,

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.040
all these elements have
the makings of a real tale.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.770
So the book really
began to form then.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.320
And then two more
trips followed to Mali

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.870
to kind of both piece together
Abdel Kader's biography

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:48.420
and then to go up to the North
and find out what had happened.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.710
Because that story was also
pretty much unknown, you know.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.800
Some people had gone up
with the French-- brief blip

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.874
on the new screen.

00:38:56.874 --> 00:38:59.290
But I wanted to go up there,
and spend like a couple weeks

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:04.350
there, and meet people, and just
get that whole account of what

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:08.840
it was like to live under
Islamist Al Qaeda occupation

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.690
for almost a years,
you know, where they

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.390
were building this caliphate.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.160
Because I thought that was an
important part of the story

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.520
so you could kind
of understand what

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.790
the dangers that the bad-ass
librarians were up against.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:26.080
So it needed to be made
as visceral and concrete

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.151
as possible.

00:39:27.151 --> 00:39:28.330
Yeah.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.580
AUDIENCE: So I had a question.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:29.910
JOSHUA HAMMER: Yeah.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.720
AUDIENCE: So for the
families that are

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.640
preserving these manuscripts--

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:32.800
JOSHUA HAMMER: Yeah.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.800
AUDIENCE: --you
mentioned a lot of them

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.847
are in classical Arabic.

00:39:34.847 --> 00:39:35.680
JOSHUA HAMMER: Yeah.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.265
AUDIENCE: So did
they, you know, know

00:39:37.265 --> 00:39:39.600
the contents of the
manuscripts, or just the fact

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.825
that they were historic,
or what they had?

00:39:40.825 --> 00:39:41.410
JOSHUA HAMMER: Most didn't.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:42.870
Most of them didn't
know, actually.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.119
Because Arabic had been kind
of-- although at one time

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:47.580
it was the lingua franca
of that part of the world,

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.440
the French conquerors came in.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.330
Arabic fell by the wayside.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:52.890
French became the
language the people

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.810
had to learn in
high schools, those

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.510
who went to school, which
especially up in the North

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.855
is not a great number.

00:39:58.855 --> 00:40:01.890
You know, I think it has one
of the highest-- ironically,

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.860
this region that's produced
some of the greatest

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.530
literature in Africa now has
one of the highest illiteracy

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.660
rates on the continent.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.550
So yeah.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.800
I mean, there was scholarship.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.360
There were people.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.735
But the people
who learned Arabic

00:40:15.735 --> 00:40:19.220
tended to be those who-- it
was kept inside the family,

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:19.910
passed down.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.195
Or they traveled
abroad, maybe learned it

00:40:22.195 --> 00:40:23.154
in Cairo or whatever.

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.070
It was a very small
percentage of who actually

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.880
knew what they had, you know?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.170
Yeah.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.100
Yeah?

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.840
AUDIENCE: What's
it like there now?

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:37.440
Is any of that culture
from the early 21st century

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.595
been resurrected?

00:40:38.595 --> 00:40:40.940
Do the libraries still exist?

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.840
JOSHUA HAMMER: The
libraries exist.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.484
And the Ahmed Baba Center,
where those-- is still

00:40:48.484 --> 00:40:50.900
a pretty impressive-- I mean,
the South African government

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.460
built that.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.660
It's like a $8
million structure.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.870
And I think there are a
couple of curators, you know,

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:01.040
trying to basically just keep
the building from falling

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.680
completely to pieces.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.140
But I'm sure that Abdel
Kader's library, which is also

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.290
a really impressive-- more
modest building, but impressive

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:08.790
still.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:12.590
I know he's got a curator
on hand, you know,

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.240
keeping it in shape.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.690
The manuscripts are in-- the
are no manuscripts in there.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.820
Well, the Ahmed Baba Center may.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.530
There were about 10,000 books in
the-- the big Ahmed Baba Center

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.870
was taken over by
the jihadis early

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:27.820
on and turned into a barracks.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.952
So that when the
smugglers went to work

00:41:29.952 --> 00:41:31.535
trying to sneak books
out of the city,

00:41:31.535 --> 00:41:32.618
they couldn't go in there.

00:41:32.618 --> 00:41:34.260
Basically, they
figured everything

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.760
in there was going to be lost.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.310
And in fact, that's where they
torch those 4,000 that I showed

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.080
some pictures of the scraps.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.540
But 10,000 of them were in
the basement in a climate

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.020
controlled room, locked doors.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.180
And the jihadis, even
though they lived there

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.480
for eight months, they
never found out about them.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.970
So those were all preserved.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.000
But again, like 99% of those
manuscripts are down in Bamako

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.880
now.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.850
And the libraries are
standing, but they're empty.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:05.040
And probably, you know, some
of them are falling apart.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.860
But the idea is that one day
when things are safe enough

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.345
in Timbuktu, they'll be able
to bring all the books, all

00:42:11.345 --> 00:42:13.610
the manuscripts back
and reopen the libraries

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:14.360
[SPEAKING ARABIC].

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.365
Who knows when that
day will happen?

00:42:16.365 --> 00:42:17.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.323
JOSHUA HAMMER: Well, the
Ahmed Baba Center's books

00:42:19.323 --> 00:42:20.160
have been digitized.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.320
All those manuscripts have.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.120
There had been a big program
funded by the South Africans

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.590
not only to restore the actual
works but to digitize them.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.790
But that Ahmed
Baba Center really

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:35.500
comprises a small percentage
of this overwhelming 400,000.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.700
And I think the majority of
those have not been digitized.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.110
There's a plan intact now.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.540
They're all kind of
sitting in storage rooms,

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.880
in climate controlled rooms.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.380
But there's no laboratory-- just
storage facilities, you know?

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.930
And I don't know if
there are laboratories.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:54.110
I really don't know what's
going on in that regard.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.240
Abdel Kader was supposed to
be getting money together.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:03.080
I did read it there is this,
interestingly enough, a monk,

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.900
a Minnesota based
monk, who has been--

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.310
and I may even go off and try
to do something about him.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.680
There's a piece in "The
Economist" about him.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.750
He's had a long
interest in manuscripts

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:14.640
from the Middle East.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:20.020
He did preserve the masters of
Homs and Aleppo before the war.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.970
And he has made contact
with Abdel Kader Haidara.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.900
And I think that has certainly
begun this digitization

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.400
process.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.460
He's visited Bamako a few times.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.470
I think I heard that he's
on his way there now.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:36.500
So he might be the only
one actually actively doing

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.090
this now.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:41.850
But his specialty is in
fact digitization of works.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:46.910
He's got into it through
medieval Italian Catholic

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:50.421
manuscripts and then kind of
gradually expand its interests.

00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:50.920
So yeah.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.130
I'd be interested to
find out what he's up to.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.900
MALE SPEAKER: Having said that,
thanks a lot for speaking--

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.280
JOSHUA HAMMER: Thanks.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.090
MALE SPEAKER: --with
us today and sharing

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.370
the inspirational story.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:58.150
Thank you.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.400
JOSHUA HAMMER: You're welcome.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.910
[APPLAUSE]
