00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.800
One of the most important insights that evolution has into the nature of

2
00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:09.550
patients is that patients are bundles of tradeoffs.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.570
They are not machines with replacement parts that can easily be switched out

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.060
anytime one intervenes to change.

5
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:24.061
One thing there will be consequences in other things in the patient because

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.940
their traits are connected through tradeoffs

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.390
tradeoffs required two connections.
One is a connection between the traits.

8
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.320
The other is a connection between the traits and fitness.

9
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.740
Now each of these connections can be either positive or negative and the trade

10
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:48.741
off only exists when a change in one trait that increases fitness is associated

11
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:54.130
with a change in another trait.
The decreases fitness.

12
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.430
<v 0>One Way to conceive of trade offs is his energy allocation,</v>

14
00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:04.810
so that is a physiological way of looking at trade offs within a single

15
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:05.441
individual.

16
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.100
The idea of being that there was a limited amount of energy which is coming in

17
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.430
that's represented here by the diameter of the pipe are and then a fraction of

18
00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:17.710
it see is being allocated to one function.

19
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.320
In this case fee come to d and the rest of it,

20
00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:24.670
one minus C is being allocated to another function in this case survival.

21
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.060
That's called the y allocation model and it was developed by Nord and the young.

22
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.640
It has some surprising outcomes.

23
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.230
<v 0>Basically what is going on here is that if the variation is mostly in how much</v>

25
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:46.280
energy is acquired,
then this would be little energy acquired here.

26
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:50.150
This would be a lot of energy acquired here,
lower line,
little energy,

27
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.620
the upper line,
a lot of energy.

28
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.250
Then the variation and acquisition produces a positive relationship between

29
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.700
reproduction and survival.
If however,

30
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.610
the variation is mostly an allocation,

31
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.450
then there's not too much variation in acquisition and most of the variation

32
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:18.821
then is in this region here leading to a negative association between

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.620
reproduction and survival.

34
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.630
This analysis makes clear why it is that rich people have big houses and Nice

35
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:29.570
cars.
That's a variation and acquisition.

36
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.120
If everybody were acquiring about the same amount of money overall than what we

37
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:39.440
would see is that people can either have big houses or big cars,

38
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.453
but not both.

39
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.810
This is also a reason why we think that tradeoffs are expressed under food.

40
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:52.130
Stress in organisms are under other kinds of stress,

41
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.420
which tends to shrink the variation in acquisition,

42
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.660
leaving the variation in allocation exposed is the source of the trade off.

43
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.610
<v 0>Now,
tradeoffs can occur with an individuals are among members of a family or a</v>

45
00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:08.444
group.

46
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.190
So in kestrels clutch size trades off with age and maturity and clutch size of

47
00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:14.024
offspring.

48
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.180
<v 0>And her Sophala Malana gastar old females lay eggs that have higher juvenile</v>

50
00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:22.760
mortality than do eggs laid by young females.

51
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.300
So something in the mother is trading off with something in the offspring.

52
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.970
The same thing in some sense happens in red deer where the effect on the

53
00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:33.440
mortality of the mother

54
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.410
is greater if she has a daughter than if she has a son for the sun moves away

55
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:40.244
sooner.

56
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.030
Whereas the daughter stays closer to the mother and then competes for food.

57
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.060
So the gender of the offspring determines the reproductive tradeoff.

58
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.770
To some extent in red deer in general,

59
00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:56.771
tradeoffs can occur within any set of interacting individuals whose interactions

60
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.033
affect fitness

61
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.470
tradeoffs can be measured by phenotypic correlation or by genetic correlations.

62
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.870
Phenotypic correlations can exist for many reasons.
Not all of them are genetic.

63
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.810
They can be for reasons of environmental variation.

64
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.811
Phenotypic plasticity contributes to them only connections among traits that

65
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:20.680
have a genetic basis.

66
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:25.420
We'll produce tradeoffs that have evolutionary consequences.
Therefore,

67
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:29.770
the most convincing way to measure a genetic tradeoff is as a correlated

68
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:31.480
response to artificial selection.

69
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.610
The idea here is that one selects on one trait and then sees how the other trait

70
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:41.611
responds and if an improvement in one trait leads to a decreased performance

71
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.210
through the other trait,
then you've demonstrated a trade off.

72
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.650
Here is an example of measuring tradeoffs is correlated responses to artificial

73
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.760
selection.
It was done in fruit flies.

74
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.890
Now this is a summary of a tremendous amount of information.

75
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:04.891
It's 14 studies done in five labs involving about a hundred man years of work in

76
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.940
the boxes.
Here on the left you can see some major life history traits such as

77
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.580
developmental time,
body size,
longevity,

78
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:16.720
early fecundity in late fee committee and in the boxes on the right and you can

79
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:20.710
see some underlying physiological traits such as desiccation,
resistance,

80
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:24.550
ethanol resistance,
you'll protein messenger,

81
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:28.210
RNA meeting speed with young and things like that.

82
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.670
What I would like you to do is follow the arrows and what you can see here is

83
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:38.671
that if you select for increased development time than the consequence,

84
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.910
the trade at the other end of the Arrow is a larger fly.

85
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.970
If you select for larger flies,

86
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.860
then the result of the other end of the Arrow is longer development time and

87
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:54.700
those are indicated by these plus signs.
However,

88
00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.120
if you select for early fecundity is to increase number of eggs laid early in

89
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:04.430
life.
That reduces lifespan.

90
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:08.750
It reduces longevity and if you select for longer life that reduces early

91
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.300
fecundity.
That's indicated by these negative signs.

92
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:14.390
Here it is a complex diagram,

93
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480
but the important point that it carries is that organisms are bundles of

94
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.380
tradeoffs that are connected to each other and that are not free to evolve

95
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:29.381
independently of each other and that things that we see at the level of major

96
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.951
life history traits like development time or fecundity are underpinned by

97
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:41.750
corresponding changes in physiological traits.
That make a lot of sense.

98
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.510
<v 0>Let's take a look at the phenotypic tradeoff in women.</v>

100
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.590
Here are the number of women for whom fecundity was observed in Framingham,

101
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.170
Massachusetts.
Those are the blue bars,

102
00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:02.171
so you can see that ranges between about 600 and about a thousand these are the

103
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:07.070
number of children that they had per lifetime that Ceb,

104
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:09.950
children ever born or lifetime reproductive success.

105
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.250
This is their relative mortality risk here.
Okay,

106
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.120
so the first two children,

107
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.690
these to decrease the risk of death and it then increased linearly with the

108
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:28.850
third,
fourth,
and the fifth child,

109
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.960
and when we use the pedigrees of the Framingham population to estimate the

110
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.580
genetic component of the variation,

111
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.390
the genetic correlation between children ever born and lifespan was negative.

112
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:49.700
It was minus 0.88 which is a very,
very strong negative genetic correlation.

113
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.043
In other words,

114
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.930
there was a u shaped relationship for the cost of reproduction for women in

115
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.931
Framingham and the estimated genetic correlation was negative and strong and the

116
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:07.460
negativity of this correlation is dominated by this portion here of the

117
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:08.330
phenotypic graph.

118
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.880
We then did a genome wide association study looking for genes that affect the

119
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:21.881
relationship between children ever born and lifespan and we found two single

120
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:26.660
nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated with that relationship.

121
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.920
<v 0>One is near a gene called a Yomis.</v>

123
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:35.030
It's a master regulator that's also implicated in bladder cancer and in multiple

124
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:40.031
sclerosis and another is near a gene that's associated with brain development in

125
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:41.390
vaccine response.

126
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

127
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.720
<v 0>In both cases,
the variants that increased lifetime reproductive success,</v>

128
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.920
decreased lifespan,
so they were associated with higher risk later in life.

129
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:53.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.770
<v 0>Others have also found that increase fertility early in life while increasing</v>

131
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.270
risk of chronic disease late in life.
For example,

132
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.260
LDLs in the p 53 pathway.
Here.

133
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:12.261
Mutations are probably more frequently involved in cancer than any other gene

134
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.470
and here the benefit early in life has to do with implantation success,

135
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:24.201
so that's an extremely early event and or embryos that implant better into the

136
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:29.880
endometrium are at increased risk of cancer later in life.

137
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.681
Similarly,

138
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:36.681
the early onset breast cancer gene brick a is associated with shorter birth

139
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:42.300
intervals and increased reproductive success in some samples.

140
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.250
The April he fora Leo is a gene that improves cholesterol metabolism but it

141
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:54.981
increases risk of Alzheimer's so you can see that these are all places where a

142
00:09:55.501 --> 00:10:00.501
gene is conferring enhanced reproductive advantage or enhanced survival

143
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:03.840
advantage earlier in life,

144
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.870
but is also a gene that confers greater risk for either cancer or a

145
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:11.880
neurodegenerative disease late in life.

146
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.770
These are cases of antagonistic pleiotropy that support the evolutionary theory

147
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:20.400
of aging.
Now what about hormones?

148
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:24.930
Hormones are mediating lots of responses and bodies and they are are arguably

149
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.260
our priori involved in tradeoffs.
Well,

150
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.960
those tradeoffs differ a bit in males and female

151
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.353
and males,

152
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.380
testosterone and other androgens are regulating the allocation of energy between

153
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:41.550
reproduction and immune functions during infections.

154
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.110
Energy is switched from maintaining skeletal muscle red blood cells and bone

155
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.270
density to increasing the immune response,

156
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.300
and it does so more in males than it doesn't females in uninfected males,

157
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:58.500
the normal maintenance of secondary sexual characters by androgens diverts

158
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:02.970
energy away from immune function and increases susceptibility to disease.

159
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.680
For example,
men who receive a few a flu vaccination experience,

160
00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:12.480
a drop in testosterone levels for two weeks compared to a somewhat comparable

161
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:15.420
control group in brief,

162
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.920
macho can make you sick or it can at least leave you susceptible.

163
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.430
On the other hand,
in females,

164
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.800
Leptin is the hormone mediating tradeoffs between reproduction and survival,

165
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.450
or at least it's one of the important hormones that mediates that relationship,

166
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.390
left and regulates energy intake and expenditure through effects on appetite and

167
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:40.224
metabolism.

168
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.530
It's secreted by fat cells and it reflects overall fat storage in the body.

169
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.150
It's a signal of body fat content.

170
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.800
It binds to that part of the hypothalamus that's known as the satiety center

171
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.470
where it signals that the body has eaten enough.

172
00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.900
It inhibits neurons that stimulate eating and it stimulates neurons that inhibit

173
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.763
eating.

174
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.370
<v 0>When women come under nutritional stress,</v>

176
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.240
some reproductive traits respond sensitively and some do not,

177
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:15.070
and these reactions are mediated by Leptin.
Ovarian function,

178
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:19.630
duration of gestation and final birth weight are sensitive to energy balance,

179
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.680
but the rate at which energy is supplied to the embryo by the mother is much

180
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.514
less sensitive.

181
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.450
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

182
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.170
<v 0>pregnant and nursing mothers are strongly stressed by poor nutrition,</v>

183
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.130
which causes the early birth of underweight infants and increases inter birth

184
00:12:34.131 --> 00:12:36.980
intervals of their mothers.
However,

185
00:12:36.981 --> 00:12:41.981
milk production is relatively insensitive to stress and this is why even in

186
00:12:42.891 --> 00:12:46.820
starving populations you will see mothers whose bodies are shrinking,

187
00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:49.820
continuing to lactate and continuing to circle their infants.

188
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.240
There is an interesting trade off at the population level and we're going to use

189
00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.080
this concept later on,

190
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.860
which is why I'm introducing it in this introductory lecture on tradeoffs

191
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.640
deviations from normal,

192
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.730
which is something you might think of as being the adaptive center of a

193
00:13:10.731 --> 00:13:15.260
distribution are often unavoidable and they have costs.

194
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.610
Any complex process that's composed of components.

195
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.020
Each of which can vary will be expressed as a range of phenotypes that has a

196
00:13:24.021 --> 00:13:27.500
central peak and it has rare extremes,
so it has,

197
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.090
it's a distribution that has a frequent center and rare tails.

198
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.750
If the center is selected,

199
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.780
then this is the condition to which individuals in the population are adapted.

200
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.000
They are not adapted to the extremes.
However,
the extremes are unavoidable.

201
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.490
This is somewhat similar to the concept of recombination will load in population

202
00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:57.480
genetics,
but in fact it's produced both by genetics and by development.

203
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.010
It's produced by anything that causes variation in the components of conflicts,

204
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:02.844
traits.

205
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:09.570
Individuals here are functioning well.
They are one portion of the population.

206
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.200
Individuals in the tails are functioning poorly.

207
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.790
They are another rarer portion of the population and so this is really a

208
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:19.440
population level tradeoff.

209
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.680
A critical question is whether tradeoffs actually evolve more slowly than do

210
00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:32.570
other traits.
Sometimes,
in fact,
they evolved nearly as fast,

211
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.330
so in bacteria,

212
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.830
antibiotic resistance is thought to be costly.

213
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.830
It's thought to be bound up in a trade off.
In other words,

214
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.140
it's good when the antibiotic is there,

215
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:48.860
but it slows the bacteria down when the antibiotic is not there.

216
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.230
However,
if you ask,

217
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.530
how rapidly do the cost of antibiotic resistance disappear when bacteria are

218
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:01.700
selected in the presence of antibiotics,
the answer is,
well,
pretty fast.

219
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.630
This is called compensatory evolution and it can eliminate the cost of

220
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:10.400
antibiotic resistance in bacteria within about six months of selection.

221
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.380
Now,
what's the importance of that?

222
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:13.450
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

223
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.410
<v 0>well,
as soon as genes for resistance,
no longer have a fitness cost.</v>

224
00:15:17.411 --> 00:15:20.290
In the absence of the antibiotics.
When you pull out the antibiotic,

225
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.660
you're the bacteria.
They've evolved resistance,

226
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.640
but in no longer cost them anything.

227
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.440
The resistance sheets have become neutral,

228
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.190
and what that means is that they're much,
much slower to disappear.

229
00:15:32.191 --> 00:15:37.080
They persist in the population for a long time.
Now,

230
00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:42.081
this rapid evolution of a tradeoff makes the tradeoff disappear fairly quickly.

231
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.591
In this case,

232
00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:47.970
it was a fairly simple trait and it was possible for evolution to adjust it.

233
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.550
Evolution will act to reduce costs where ever they are consistently expressed

234
00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:58.110
and encountered and to Redo and where reduction is possible.
Now,

235
00:15:58.111 --> 00:15:59.190
in many cases,

236
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:04.430
tradeoffs persist because reduction is not possible.

237
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.300
And in other cases,

238
00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:11.280
they persist because the conditions under which the costs are expressed or also

239
00:16:11.281 --> 00:16:12.114
infrequent.

240
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:14.180
<v 1>Okay?</v>

241
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.200
<v 0>So to summarize,
tradeoffs are everywhere.
They're the default condition.</v>

242
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.770
All traits are bound up,
usually in some kind of trade off.

243
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.010
For traits in the patient that are involved in trade offs,

244
00:16:26.011 --> 00:16:29.640
a change that improves one condition could worse than another.
For example,

245
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.860
the negative side effects of many drugs.

246
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.690
So you have improved symptoms for the thing that drug is targeting,

247
00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:38.370
but you have negative side effects.

248
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.440
The tradeoff between testosterone and disease resistance in males,

249
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:44.791
and importantly,

250
00:16:44.791 --> 00:16:48.600
the tradeoff between reproduction and survival that shapes the evolution of

251
00:16:48.601 --> 00:16:49.020
aging.
