1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,880
This is the, the big one is immigration
to me because immigration to me,

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:08,800
when people take a hard line one way
or the other, I'm always like, man,

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,140
this is a weird one.
Immigration's a weird one.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,710
You don't want to diminish the quality
of life for everyone in the country,

5
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:17,950
but you don't want to not let people in
because that's what the country is based

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:22,270
on. And you see these fenced in
people and is it, is it El Paso?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,450
There was something that they had on the
news where they showed all these people

8
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:29,110
fenced in and what looks like a
dog Kennel and these, these, uh,

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,470
people that snuck across the
border and they captured him.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,950
So they just put them in this fucking
outdoor fenced in cage. Like, dude,

11
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:38,440
we don't even do that
too violent murderers.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,970
You'd have a violent murderer
who due process due process,

13
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:44,300
you put him in a prison man.
Right?

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,960
Like they don't have the facilities
to do what they're doing. Right.

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,430
And then people are like, whoa, they
shouldn't be coming across the border.

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,440
I guess so. But wouldn't you
almost like, who wouldn't you,

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,990
who cares? Like I, I understand,
yes there is sort of a,

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,270
but anybody who is up in arms about
immigrants coming into this country,

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,200
most of the time they're also on one
side of the political spectrum on every

20
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,690
other issue.
It's not like it's an independent thought.

21
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:14,220
It's like [inaudible] and everybody that's
on both sides, you know? And you know,

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,450
I just sort of,
I'm going to,

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,710
I have my own personal life philosophy
where I'm not going to solve the

24
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,990
immigration issue. And to be honest, as
we're talking about, I'm going to like,

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,180
I don't know. I, I have no
idea what the answer is here.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,910
People are obsessed with being right.
People always want to have an answer.

27
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,830
I don't fucking know. But I do know that
I have things in my life that, you know,

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,170
I can fix. I know they're, you know,

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,990
the things about my personality and
things about me and my own, you know,

30
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:41,070
my own issues that I need to fix. So
I'll sort of start there, you know,

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,770
and I think more people need to kind of,
you know,

32
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,540
before they started spousing opinions,

33
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,940
look at themselves and figure out why
they're coming up with these opinions.

34
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,460
Is that what you're saying? Yeah,
just sort of, um, I just like,

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,790
it pulls on your humanity.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,150
You see a bunch of people caged in with
their children and in some fenced in

37
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,120
area that literally looks like a
dog Kennel. Yeah. This is crazy.

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,850
Well, I'm not saying I don't
care about that. I just, I,

39
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:06,620
I don't care about people coming into
the country and going in these imaginary

40
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:11,180
lines. I, I, you know, it's just
sort of like, yeah, I think it's, um,

41
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,050
I, I think as a human being,
it's hard to see that.

42
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,960
And I look away from shit like
that a lot. You know, I don't look,

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,800
I don't like looking at videos like that.
I don't like watching sad things.

44
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:22,880
I don't watch any Gore Shit.

45
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:27,260
I didn't watch the video of the dude that
moved down those people in New Zealand.

46
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,540
Um, you know. Yeah. It is a sad thing
and I really don't know the solution.

47
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,374
Look at this shit.

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,250
It says they treated us
like we were animals.

49
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,170
A holding pen for migrant
families in El Paso. Shut down.

50
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:42,590
Shut down overnight I guess. Okay, because
people found out about it. It's crazy.

51
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,350
You look at that,
that's a dog Kennel.

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,800
That means people just sit
around waiting for what? I mean,

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,050
if that was murderers,
they wouldn't do so.

54
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,210
Let's say you're the guy in charge though.
What do you do?

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,910
What would you, I mean me, I wish that's
a good question. I'll go let him in,

56
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:56,170
but I don't know if
that's the right answer.

57
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,550
I don't know if it's the answer to either,

58
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:01,810
but I guarantee you all of our with your
relatives came from another country.

59
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:06,680
My relatives all came from another
country or the I'm third generation. They,

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,230
they knew that Europe sucked. They knew
that Italy sucked and say like, look,

61
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,640
I mean no disrespect Italy,

62
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,120
but they decided I've got to get the
fuck outta here and they got on a boat.

63
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,660
All of them, grandparents on both
sides. They both came over here.

64
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:23,080
When they were kids. Does
Italy suck? Seems awesome.
Everything I've seen about it.

65
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,540
Grateful. Well, the food is fantastic.

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,510
When I talked to a guy there that was
trying to get an understanding because he

67
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,550
wanted his kids to go
to college in America,

68
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,810
and what he was basically saying was
there was just not enough opportunity in,

69
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,700
in Italy. And that, uh,

70
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,470
he wanted his son to have more opportunity
and she was driving a cab. Actually,

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,040
they all speak two languages. They
all speak perfect English. Mike,

72
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,570
a good percentage of them are
there. You know, it's a smart place.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,630
The Lot in the art is insane.
When you're,

74
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,870
when you're going through Rome and
you go through, um, the Vatican,

75
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,340
you see their billions of dollars,
literally billions of dollars in artwork.

76
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,120
You're like, Holy Shit. Like this is
what a crazy culture, this culture,

77
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:08,830
all they wanted to do was create beautiful
architecture, create beautiful art,

78
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,020
make wine, make great food, have sex,

79
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,320
fuck like crazy and kind of
take over the world. I mean,

80
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,090
they took over the world
for a long ass time.
