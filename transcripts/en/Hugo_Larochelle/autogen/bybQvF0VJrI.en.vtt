00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 in this capsule we will see some 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.380
 definitions related to learning 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.380
 automatic 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.469
 so we said that learning 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.330
 automatic is interested in development 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
 of algorithms that will allow a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 agent adapt from data for 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.260
 improve its performance and data 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.390
 in fact, it will correspond to 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.150
 sets we see losers very 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.300
 coveted x an associated target 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.490
 sponsored then recommended what we 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.920
 will show them this data there we go 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 assume that our input x is going 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 finally match a vector of values 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.930
 where each of the values ​​is going to be 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 attributes corresponded real that describes 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.329
 a given object we have an example here are 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.670
 wanted to represent an image whose 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.559
 will represent by a vector that will 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.629
 actually contain attributes that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.449
 correspond each of the values ​​of 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.780
 the intensity of each of the peaks is therefore 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.969
 we have an image here of a character e where 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.460
 each of the pixels actually took a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 business value to heroes or a tax 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.200
 also to both languages ​​06 opodo and one 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.830
 fir tree in python could represent his 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.380
 share a table where we would have each 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.650
 pixels and during the peaks she who was 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 chosen here is an order where we pass 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.990
 tidy up after storage so we have plenty of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:28.200
 0.6 point 06.06.09 is 1.2 more 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 forgiveness so here one here correspond 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.479
 to the blacks here we would have 6 1 6 2 so we 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.250
 will assume 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.780
 for any problem that can be taken 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.479
 your objects he is represented under the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.310
 shape of a vector a vector of values 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.189
 who each have values ​​it's a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.860
 attribute associated with our object and 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.689
 now the desired exit made me the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.240
 representation that we will use with 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.210
 different depending on the problem to be solved 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.270
 and we are going to focus on a bonus 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.399
 classification in these classes 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.960
 different so big six meters the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.719
 number of classes that interests us 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.240
 we want to distinguish and in this case also 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.610
 well the value there is going to take a value 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.979
 who discreet who will belong to the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.210
 whole from scratch up to his means 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.600
 if we index the categories 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.990
 classes from zero to big his 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.610
 means 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.940
 so we will associate with each of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.650
 possible categories a value of 0.6 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.090
 what a great way her if we did the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.400
 character recognition but one 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.190
 would each take abcd characters 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.410
 up to z for example and then we 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.660
 some but making a computer unreliable 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.400
 would associate my heart with that 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.760
 could be the zero class 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.800
 bessat near the class an institute on 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.890
 could also by regression so 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.840
 in this case also in regression the target 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.570
 will match a real value so 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.850
 in a continuous way so 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.000
 general and on regression 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.410
 we will not see the next catches 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 but know that it's a problem too 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.820
 con to try to attack he has 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.030
 that can be solved with learning 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.030
 automatic 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.760
 now we said we will be interested 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.950
 especially at learning supervise there 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.630
 we will define a little more with our 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.670
 notation for entries and targets 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.930
 what do we mean by 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.270
 learning ferries and so after a 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.850
 learning supervise it's going maybe 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.850
 the problem of and gave a set 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.620
 great workout an example so 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.380
 having a set will contain the loses 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.810
 entry and convoy targets listed 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.820
 so etc without wearing our first 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.500
 example of training exist two greek 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.600
 2 our second training example 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.600
 up to x grant ny quarantine so to 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.900
 from 7 years training at the hague 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.550
 where we will assume that there have been 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.140
 generated by a function that we do not 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.440
 does not know an unknown function 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.750
 convince the pharmacies what we want 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.400
 it's an algorithm able to discover 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.990
 a new function h 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.700
 this official we will call him a 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.340
 perfect model say it's a 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.710
 hypothesis that is going to be a good 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.160
 approximation of our unknown function 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.520
 f 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.500
 so we're going to want that h2x that's going to be 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.660
 the prediction made by our model 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.470
 after loaned trained on our 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.780
 training data 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.130
 we were hoping we would want hdx 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.720
 as close as possible to f2 x is 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.760
 so in fact a welcome learning 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.260
 we will be able to 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.750
 it's like a function we're going 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.510
 call big to whom we give a 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.820
 wavy driving set that can 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.890
 to be an argument of the gold function that 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.190
 noted place of learning and seven 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.780
 officials will be returned a 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.270
 function that will be our model h 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.150
 our model driven on our data 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.590
 training that I benefit from 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.270
 to clarify some things in the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.720
 notation 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.540
 so firstly i'm going to use x in 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.540
 big so a big letter for 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.730
 denote either vectors or 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.860
 matrices elima sadly I'm going 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.100
 use a capital letter when 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.440
 is going to talk about matrix and I'm going to use 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.680
 rather italic when I'm going to do 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.010
 reference to a variable that corresponds 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.920
 in fact to a scanner then finally the 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.020
 function fdx did it's a function 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.630
 is known and this function can 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.910
 to match a little anything that 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.040
 could be a program that we try 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.950
 of proximity or it could be the one 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.130
 that typically makes it anyway a 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.900
 human being who if we take the example of 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.700
 character classification or 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.770
 character recognition a being 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.750
 human who would have seen an image x and who 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.920
 have identified that the identity of the 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.410
 character in the picture 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.810
 ok so function here it's not 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.460
 necessarily a function as a 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.990
 polynomial something like that it's 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.600
 really anything that takes a 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.490
 input and that provides an output that 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.930
 we are interested and in intelligence 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.870
 artificial more often than not 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.320
 the function in question is an expert 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.460
 or a human being we want 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.820
 model the behavior 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.110
 ok so that's going to be our definition 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.660
 more mathematical problem 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.950
 of supervising learning and of our 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.600
 definition for what is a 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.020
 learning algorithms so 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.020
 General
