00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.350
Welcome to Authors at Google.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.487
Today we are in London.

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:18.150
And I am very pleased to
introduce everyone to author

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.110
Susan Fletcher, who will be
discussing her latest book,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.560
"The Silver Dark Sea." Susan
is the author of the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.460
best-selling book, "Eve Green,"
and a winner of the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.950
Whitbread First Novel Award.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.070
She will be doing a reading,
and then we will be

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.860
discussing the book.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.635
So Susan Fletcher.

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:41.190
SUSAN FLETCHER: OK, hi.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.490
I'm only going to do
a small reading.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.670
I've chosen it because it comes
from the start of the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.830
book, so it stands alone and
doesn't need much of an

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.520
introduction.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.940
But also, I feel it gives
a strong flavor

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.170
of my writing style.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.760
Also, it sets up the novel
quite nicely in that it

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.300
presents the setting,
which is an island.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.930
And the narrator is a
woman called Maggie.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.370
And although she narrates the
entire novel, she very rarely

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.550
talks about herself.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.840
And this is one of the few
occasions where she does give

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.366
a little bit of information
as to her life.

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:16.250
So yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.950
"I was born inland.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.230
I grew up where the wildest
water was a puddle or a filmy

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.020
pond in a park.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.470
Stories were harder
to come by there.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.020
Trees bowed with the rain, and
I found sparks of beauty in a

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.260
flowerbed or a pigeon's
trembling iridescent neck.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.550
But it was not enough.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.750
I hungered for more always.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.220
I sensed there was something
more than this nice life that

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.460
I was living.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.490
And then I fell in love when I
thought I never would, and I

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.360
came to live on an island so
that the lines by my eyes

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.900
deepened and my hair thickened
with salt, and ghostly white

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.030
crabs flitted over my
feet and buried

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.640
themselves in the damp sand.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.570
And every sea was different
from the sea that had come

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.700
before it, pummeling or silent
or brown-colored and flat.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.420
And the man I loved would
tell me his stories.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.700
In time, others did.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.740
They poured whiskey into my
glass and settled beside me.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.800
They opened old books
and said, look.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.360
I have known people who believed
absolutely that a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.980
bird could talk our language,
and that the souls of their

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.200
drowned friends could be found
in the rattle and foam.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.980
They said, I heard her voice
in the water, I did.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.560
Or I felt his hand on my
hand on that board.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.800
You have my word.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.930
I do have their words, I do.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.420
I swagger with the weight of
my wordy priceless stash.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.090
And when I retell their stories
now, I know that some

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.840
people mock me or mock the
island, and they shake their

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.580
heads at the impossibilities.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.180
A fishman?

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.140
Half-fish, half-man?

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.025
OK, I understand that, for
I was briefly like them.

00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:55.460
I too had my private doubts.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.100
But so much has been
lost and found.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.100
So many things have come to pass
that have no explanation.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.660
And I half wonder if you cannot
believe in such stories

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.590
unless you have lived or stayed
in a house by the sea

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.990
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.080
washing to a sea breeze, or
been bruised by the rain

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.040
drumming on your anorak hood
whilst trying to guide a dingy

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.280
in, in the blackest of nights,
until you've waited for a boat

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.950
that does not come, or until
that boat is found but its

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.100
screw is not.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.010
It is another way of living,
and not all can stand it.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.070
There is the word 'salt
[INAUDIBLE].' It comes when

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.370
hope is lost.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.420
So no, you cannot trust the sea,
even now, even with our

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.170
satellites that tell us where we
are, even with our sonars,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.560
radars, and computerized charts,
even with our space

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.000
travel and vaccinations
and our atom

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.990
bombs and cloned sheep.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.960
And even though we can make a
new human life in a Petri

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.480
dish, we still cannot
breathe underwater.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.340
We cannot decode whale song.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.720
We cannot find a body when
it goes overboard.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.780
We may know that the human heart
has ventricles and can

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.040
be shocked into beating again,
but we do not have the words

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.800
for what immense and
extraordinary emotions it can

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.770
feel, what heights and
depths together.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.990
Love is too small a
word, too small.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.925
A woman called Abigail Coyle
used to tell me, we only know

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:26.540
the foam, the sweep of
her arm over the sea.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.870
And I'd walk home understanding
her.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.960
We do not know it all.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.810
tell myself when standing
waist deep in water.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.180
When I sat on a boat, I'd think
of what was beneath me,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.030
the deep, deep, chasms, the
secrets, and the dark."

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.730
That was lovely.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.160
This book has so many
different layers.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.855
I really enjoyed reading it.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:54.935
One of the things that struck
me was all of your

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:55.940
depiction of nature.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.110
I mean, it is a book
about stories.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.350
But the first thing that struck
me is you had so many

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.520
animals and wind and textures
and smells.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.240
Were you ever in this
part of the world?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.790
Or is this your own imagination
that's feeding us?

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.170
SUSAN FLETCHER: It's, I think,
that inclusion of nature to

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.910
the point when nature is almost
a character herself is

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.220
probably a good example
of me as a writer.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.390
My other books have been
quite similar to that.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.696
It's nature and landscape that
I feel most inspired by, that

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:35.410
I feel I need to be around in
order to get the ideas.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.370
I was living up in Scotland
for a long time in the

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.400
Highlands on the coast.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.580
And whilst, technically, this
book isn't officially set

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.370
anywhere, I was very keen to
make sure that the island was

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.170
a fictional island, and the
country that it was off the

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.940
coast of was a fictional country
and a fictional sea,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.190
it had to be based
on something.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.630
So when I was living on the
Scottish west coast within

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.410
view of the Scottish islands,
that probably was my

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.590
inspiration.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.320
I was really lucky.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.970
I lived in this little cottage
where there was a garden, and

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.810
then a gate at the end of the
garden, and then there was the

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.015
beach and the sea.

00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:16.500
So it was pretty easy to go
down in the morning and

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.225
actually pick up muscle shells,
and I would see seals

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.330
and otters in front
of my house.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.960
So something like that, when
you're as lucky as I was to

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.492
live somewhere like that it
has to go into the book.

00:06:25.492 --> 00:06:27.740
It gets infused and soaked up.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.980
And I went to lots of the
island as well, and kept

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.190
diaries when I was out there.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: So do we read
anything into the idea that

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.693
the island's name is
Parla, kind of

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:40.290
like a play on talking?

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.040
SUSAN FLETCHER: Exactly.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.400
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.350
The main theme of the book is
storytelling, and why we may

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.410
choose to tell stories, how
storytelling can be a very

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.920
powerful thing to do.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.420
So the fact that the island is
called Parla is exactly that.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.685
And various other islands have
names that also are a play on

00:07:01.685 --> 00:07:03.010
the different ways
that we speak.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.000
There's an island that features
called [? Merm ?],

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.150
and it's an island on which
life is cut short.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.260
The last few inhabitants were
lifted off and moved away.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.730
And [? Merm ?] felt--

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.583
you're one step away
from a murmur.

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.140
It's like you can
no longer talk.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.510
The island's stories are
virtually gone because the

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.410
inhabitants have gone.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.910
And there's very few people left
to tell the stories about

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.690
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.860
So I wanted the name to reflect
that, to be almost a

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.460
word that means to talk, but it
got shortened because the

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.660
stories are gone.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.590
So I have been playing
around with names in

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.300
that respect, yeah.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: And so when
you're talking about stories,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.870
the pivotal story in this book
is that a man washes up, and

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.820
how the inhabitants of this
island choose to view him.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.110
And one of the constructs in
your book that I thought was

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.850
fascinating is that you provide
a family tree of your

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.020
characters in the front
of the book.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.580
So you open up the book, there's
this family tree, but

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.150
then it's not until you've
actually-- or at least for

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.940
myself-- finished the end of the
book, you go back to kind

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.300
of see what the relationships
were.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.230
And then the entire tone of
the book changes when you

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.800
realize that it's two sisters,
or a boyfriend and a

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.140
girlfriend, or a widower,
or older folks.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.230
The story that you read
then transmutes.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.665
Was that on purpose?

00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:30.715
Did you do that?

00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:31.845
Or is that just something
that came out of

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:32.770
the art of the writing?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.330
SUSAN FLETCHER: No, that's
something that probably just

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.110
happened organically.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.609
For a long time, there wasn't
going to be a family tree.

00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:39.289
But I needed one to
write the book.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.710
I had my map of my fictional
island on the wall, with all

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.706
beaches and coves and who lived
where and where the shop

00:08:44.706 --> 00:08:46.540
was and where the school was.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.960
And then next to it, I had the
family tree so that I knew

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.730
everybody inside out.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.550
And it was only really when the
book was going forward to

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.630
the publishers that I thought,
there's 20-odd characters

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.240
here, and everybody's
interrelated.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.550
It's one of the important
aspects of the book and the

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.600
island, is that everybody is
linked in some way, if not by

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.390
blood, by feelings.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.295
It's a very tight community,
for better or worse.

00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:15.050
And I thought it's important
that there's no doubt in the

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.030
reader's mind who's who.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.385
So really, it was practical
reasons that the

00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:19.320
family tree went in.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.652
But I liked the sense that
gave the book, of being

00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:27.896
perhaps an older book than it
is, almost like a fairly tale,

00:09:27.896 --> 00:09:31.905
some weighty tome, the old
books, where you would sort of

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.520
creak the page open and there'd
be family trees, I

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.490
remember the ones when I was
little that you could sort of

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.150
pull out bits of papers.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.880
They unfolded.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.100
And you got a sense, I feel,
when you start a book that has

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.000
a map in the beginning
or a family tree, you

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.510
feel a sage is coming.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.600
It gives it a gravitas,
perhaps.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.145
So I actually was pleased when
we did decide the family tree

00:09:54.145 --> 00:09:54.760
was necessary.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.630
I felt it gave it
extra weight.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.505
FEMALE SPEAKER: Would you
ever put the map of the

00:10:00.505 --> 00:10:01.180
island in the book?

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.200
SUSAN FLETCHER: I thought
about it.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.680
I did think about it.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.150
But in the end, it was a
collective decision that

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.810
probably we wouldn't, and that
hopefully my language has done

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.110
enough to bring the
island to life.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.160
And I would like to think that
the reader has their own idea

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.630
of the island and can picture
it themselves.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.310
And in that respect, I wouldn't
want my map to go

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.920
against what they have conjured
up the island to be,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.460
because we're all different.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.740
We all bring ourselves
to a book.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.830
So it could be an island the
reader themselves [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.130
So yeah, we'll see.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.960
Could always put it
in later on, but--

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.115
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK,
the next edition.

00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:40.000
SUSAN FLETCHER: Next
edition, yeah.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: Another
aspect of this book is

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.985
the emotional content.

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:46.895
I know we've talked about
this earlier.

00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:49.872
Every time I read this book, I
cry, and to the point where I

00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:53.070
could only ever read it on the
subway, because that's a

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:53.870
20-minute ride.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.080
And so I could only have 20
minutes worth of emotion in my

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.050
head at any one time.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.440
And then I reread the parts of
the book in preparation for

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.680
this event, and I still cried.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.700
So are you doing that
on purpose?

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.330
Or is this something that the
reader brings to your book?

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.430
SUSAN FLETCHER: I don't set out
to think I really want the

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.480
reader to cry, because that
would make me mean.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.075
But I think it's a good thing
if I get emotional and if I

00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:26.540
cry during the writing
of it, and I did.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.590
There were parts that I found
really hard to write, and I

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.190
needed a cup of tea
and a good tissue

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.650
afterwards, have a good cry.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:39.030
And I think if I had been that
connected to the novel, I'm

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.880
doing my job.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.390
I don't think it's possible for
a reader to be moved by a

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.600
book unless the writer has
really believed in it.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.440
When I revert into reader mode
and I'm reading other people's

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.580
books, I feel I can tell quite
quickly their heart has been

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.820
in it, if they care about
the characters.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.180
And I just lived with these
people for nearly three years.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.900
So yeah, there were parts that
I did get very upset in.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.270
So in the nicest possible way,
I'm really glad that you

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.980
cried, because it makes me
feel that I've managed

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.190
to hand that over.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.510
I've managed to convey
my feelings.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:21.110
I've managed to make these
people real enough for you to

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.610
be upset by what they
feel and think.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.300
And yes, invariably, every
reader brings themselves to a

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.860
novel, and their experiences.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.080
And there could be things in
this book that the reader has

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.330
experienced themselves
firsthand.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.505
So obviously, to them that
would be an incredibly

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:40.220
personal experience, whilst
others probably just imagine.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.730
But yeah, it is always
good to know if

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.130
someone has been moved.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.190
I feel like I should always
apologize, but also a part of

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:53.670
me is very glad when I hear that
someone has cried at what

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.740
I've written.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: What is
interesting about that and

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.300
your explanation of it is, when
I read other reviews of

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.560
this book or of your work,
people hold you

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.270
to account for that.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:14.160
And then it kind of goes into
that strange discussion about,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.050
well, this is women's fiction.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.450
Women writers have an emotional
content that is

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.885
inaccessible or harder
to access than,

00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:28.610
say, a man's writing.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.190
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.300
SUSAN FLETCHER: I don't really
understand a lot of that

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.750
viewpoint, really.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.350
Women's fiction, I don't really
know what it means.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.136
There is the argument that women
are more likely to pick

00:13:43.136 --> 00:13:45.886
up a book written by a woman
and a man is more likely to

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:47.220
pick up a book written
by a man.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.390
But some of the most emotionally
intelligent books

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.100
I know are written by men.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.170
They can hold their weight
in that respect.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.170
Also, there are awful lots of
female writers who can write

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.410
thrillers, and something
that's fast-paced

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.980
and sexy and violent.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.000
The cross-over is huge.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.455
And I think pigeon-holing
is a mistake.

00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:08.920
And it confuses me.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.440
I certainly wouldn't want
to think that I

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.260
only write for women.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.972
When I think of who I write
for, it's gender-neutral.

00:14:19.972 --> 00:14:23.285
I'd like to think that I can
be enjoyed by both men and

00:14:23.285 --> 00:14:24.500
women in my writing.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.680
So it's not a label that
I care for much.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.260
And you hear it a lot, so
it's quite frustrating.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.600
I wouldn't want to have my book
just passed by on the

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.150
shelf because I happen to be a
female writer who's written

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.210
about relationships, and I don't
think that would not

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.934
appeal to men.

00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:47.174
Kind of tricky.

00:14:47.174 --> 00:14:49.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: It is tricky.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.520
You were almost selected
for an Oprah Book Club.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.180
And sometimes her book listings
have an emotional

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.950
content that you wouldn't
necessarily find in, like, the

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.720
"New York Times" bestseller
list.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.436
What was that like, being almost
selected for Oprah?

00:15:09.436 --> 00:15:11.570
I know it sounds like
a strange question.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.270
But did they approach you?

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.110
SUSAN FLETCHER: No.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.370
All I know is that there was a
review in "O Magazine," and

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.259
that that's what we'd
been hoping for.

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:23.600
We'd been hoping [INAUDIBLE],
as I'm sure any writers

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.090
published in the States
sort of hope to that.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.260
And the book that was
considered, "Eve Green, my

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.500
first book, that had been on the
Richard &amp; Judy Book Club

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.000
at that time, which was/is
sort of the British

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.490
equivalent.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.700
The advantage of things like
that is it just opens you up

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.942
to a far wider audience.

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:46.700
And that, really, I think is all
a writer can ask for, that

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.010
you get read and possibly
talked about.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.315
I mean, I can cope with
bad reviews and people

00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:54.250
not liking the book.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.365
That's what happens
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:56.365 --> 00:15:58.450
It's the nature of this beast.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.115
But the worst thing is if
something just never got read

00:16:01.115 --> 00:16:02.975
or talked about and
gathered dust.

00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:08.570
So really any outlet through
which your book can be pushed

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.550
so that other people read it
who might not normally have

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.770
done, that can only
be a blessing.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.732
So that's why I was particularly
grateful for the

00:16:16.732 --> 00:16:19.910
Richard &amp; Judy episode.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.910
And if Oprah had read it, that
would have been amazing.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.002
But no, I was just happy to
simply have been reviewed in

00:16:28.002 --> 00:16:30.790
the magazine.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:36.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: And so the
"Sunday Times" associated your

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.812
prose with that of
Sylvia Plath's.

00:16:39.812 --> 00:16:42.490
How was that day when
you read that?

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.985
SUSAN FLETCHER: That was
kind of amazing.

00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:46.432
And I had to sort of think, it
is just the writing, isn't it?

00:16:46.432 --> 00:16:48.376
It's not my life they're
comparing it to.

00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:50.780
I'm all right.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.000
No, that was great.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.310
I mean, somebody you grow up
reading and studying at

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.460
school, to think that there's
even one person out there who

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.280
finds that your work
echoes hers, you

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.430
sort of pinch yourself.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.405
It feels like it's a huge honor,
slightly frightening.

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:13.890
But ultimately it's one of these
things you put in a box

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.930
and come back to when you're
having a bad writing day, when

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.349
you think you can't do it
anymore or you've made a

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.940
mistake and you should
do something else.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.899
You think, actually, somebody
once compared

00:17:21.899 --> 00:17:22.769
me to Sylvia Plath.

00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:25.750
So to one person, at
least, I should

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.460
probably continue writing.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.570
I have little thought box like
that, where I keep the good

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.350
things, keep me going through
the dark days.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you have
a process when you write?

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.490
Do you, like, only write in the
morning, or only write--

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.400
SUSAN FLETCHER: I'm best
in the morning.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: Morning?

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.450
SUSAN FLETCHER: Yeah,
early-early.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.220
So sort of 7 o'clock onwards
is my best time.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.506
And then I hit the afternoon
slump, like I

00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:47.500
think most people do.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.360
You get to about 3
o'clock and, nn.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.865
And that's when I try to go out
and do something physical,

00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:55.310
or be with people, because one
of the huge downsides of this

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.700
job, there's nobody else
in it but you.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.480
So you can have hours, days,
just you and a laptop.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.660
And I choose, personally, not to
really talk about what I'm

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.340
doing with other people.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.770
I find it's such a personal
thing, writing a book, and

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.900
it's so delicate.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.700
Really up until the time it
comes out, it still feels like

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.270
one hard [INAUDIBLE] kick
and it would fall apart.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.720
It's only in the later stages
that I have any confidence

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.070
that it would survive a grilling
or a bad comment or

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.660
anything like that.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.320
I feel so protective.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.420
You know, I want everyone,
keep away.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.580
It's a little baby.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.010
No, so I'm really secretive
about what I do, the downside

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.760
of that being that nobody
gets involved.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.040
So it's a world of one
for a long time.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.740
And my easiest writing days, on
the days I'm writing best,

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.540
is when I do have an
outlet to be with

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.680
people, a social outlet.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.000
I've done lots of other work
on the side of writing, so

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.170
I've worked in pubs
and coffee shops.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.950
And that's actually the best for
me, the best routine I can

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.110
have, because it gives your
writing brain a compete rest.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.690
And you're surrounded
by people.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.267
You're stimulated.

00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:07.200
You can chat.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.815
You have colleagues.

00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:10.300
You're meeting people in
the job that you do.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.980
So that is, for me,
a perfect balance.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: It is
interesting that you say that,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.142
because one of the fascinating
things about "The Silver Dark

00:19:19.142 --> 00:19:23.120
Sea" is your spot-on
with how these

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.420
different characters talk.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.900
You have young men, you have
children, you have older

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.550
people, and they're not
the same voice.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.710
I mean, you really do have an
old man's voice when you're

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.920
writing about the old man, and
you have the child's voice

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.900
when you're writing about
the young girl on there.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.048
When you're working in a pub or
whatever, do you actually,

00:19:47.048 --> 00:19:50.000
I'm gonna listen to him, I'm
gonna pick up on him?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.280
I mean, you might not
necessarily grab the story,

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.015
but you might pick up
the presence, you

00:19:55.015 --> 00:19:58.125
might pick up the sense.

00:19:58.125 --> 00:19:59.690
SUSAN FLETCHER: I'm glad you
said that, because I actually

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.360
feel that dialogue is one
of my weak spots.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.360
The past three books, there's
been not much dialogue in my

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.500
other books because I don't
feel that I can

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.110
handle it very well.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.730
But this book, I knew
there would have

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.380
to be a lot of dialogue.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.310
A lot of very important
information comes out through

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.250
conversations.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.880
So really, for the first time,
it was something that I had to

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.810
really address.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.760
And I do think working in
bars and being in public

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.320
places a lot helps.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.750
You don't necessarily eavesdrop
deliberately, but

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.310
things do go in.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.250
The child's voice was easy.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.070
I've always been able
to do that.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.410
I think probably I still,
in my head,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.140
still talk like a child.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.880
So I just put that out.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.702
Writing as a man would
be very hard.

00:20:40.702 --> 00:20:43.455
You have to get inside
a male brain.

00:20:43.455 --> 00:20:46.370
How many women can do that?

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.220
So this, again, was the first
taster I've had at trying to

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.670
imagine how a man would respond
to certain situations.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:59.550
And I hope I've managed
to do that.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:04.040
I think, as with everything,
you just need to expose

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.920
yourself to as many experiences
as possible.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.370
And you soak up, knowingly or
otherwise, the information.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.990
So being in a male-heavy
pub probably helps.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.520
Hearing men talk all the
time probably helped.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
interesting.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.200
Not to give too much away
about the book.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:32.500
So the man who washes up has
lost all sense of who he is or

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.020
where he's from, or
even where he is.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.890
And until he gets his voice
back, the other characters

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.520
interact with him, and
he's a cipher.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.910
I found that thrilling, to have
a male character in a

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.120
book who doesn't talk.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.005
I mean, so the idea that you're
talking about, speaking

00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:54.405
in a male voice, to have a male
character pivotal to the

00:21:54.405 --> 00:22:02.640
plot who doesn't speak
was refreshing.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.610
SUSAN FLETCHER: Thank you.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: But then all
the characters kind of

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:11.890
imprinted on him what their
experience with the men in

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.555
their lives had been.

00:22:13.555 --> 00:22:18.560
So the widower, the people who
had lost sons or brothers saw

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.970
in him what they had lost.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:27.580
So the idea that he was a
stand-in for their loss or

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.680
what they felt was missing
from their lives was very

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.210
interesting.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:39.240
But then when he does recover,
he understands this.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.950
He understands what
they have done.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:46.270
But I do find it interesting,
there's one character in

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:52.100
there, when the man who has
washed up starts to become

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.590
communicative.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.760
An older man tells him--

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.050
what does he tell him?

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.070
What is it he says?

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:04.260
SUSAN FLETCHER: Don't say--
well, he advises--

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.090
basically, I should probably
just do a little summary, but

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.340
the book starts with a man being
washed up, as Kate was

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.990
just saying, on the beach.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.210
And he has no memory.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.605
And the beach he washes up on
is known in the island's

00:23:15.605 --> 00:23:19.400
folklore as being the place
where, many years ago, the

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.126
fishman was seen.

00:23:20.126 --> 00:23:23.420
And the fishman was a merman,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.180
effectively, half-man, half-fish.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.950
He lived up the waters, and he
would come ashore and grow

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.780
legs and live amongst
the people at a

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.310
time when he was needed.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.495
And he would restore hope.

00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:35.760
And then after a full moon's
turn, he would return to the

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.260
sea and be gone forever.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.770
So this man comes ashore
with no memory.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.800
The island is grieving.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.170
They've lost one of their
own several years ago.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.850
And no one's really recovered
from this loss.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.180
He drowned at sea and his
body was not found.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.450
So he is a catalyst.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.660
His arrival shocks everyone into
having to face up to what

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.430
they've lost.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.050
And it's a question of who
do they want him to be.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.980
Do people want him to be perhaps
some guy who fell off

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.495
a boat and knocked his head and
got washed up by chance?

00:24:05.495 --> 00:24:11.690
Or do they want him to be a
character out of folklore who

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.720
was come to make their
lives better?

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.716
So it's about projecting,
perhaps, your hopes and what

00:24:17.716 --> 00:24:19.650
you want from the world.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.985
But no, the scene, I know
exactly the scene you're

00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:23.320
alluding to.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.580
There's one of the islanders,
an old man, a blind man.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:32.860
He senses that this fishman
knows far more than he's

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.340
letting on.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.760
And the old man just says, don't
tell anybody anything.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.580
Let people make up their
own minds about you.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.670
Keep the truth to yourself.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.460
That's the scene [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.480
And that comes, I think, about
1/3 into the book.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.180
So by that point, you think,
right, we know that there is a

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.170
story here.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.250
And invariably, stories
can't stay untold,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.458
really, in a novel.

00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:59.375
So the climax of the book is
finding out if he is a fishman

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:02.545
or not and who he is.

00:25:02.545 --> 00:25:05.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you read,
or have you read, a lot of

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.680
fairy tales in your life?

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.160
Did you read them as a child
and then return to them?

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.810
Or is this just a structure
that you just always tell?

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.370
SUSAN FLETCHER: No, I've always
been interested in

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.630
fairy tales and how they
spun the world.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:24.090
Every culture has fairy tales
or its equivalent.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.060
And I think an island
community--

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.635
or from my experience, an island
community holds their

00:25:31.635 --> 00:25:35.790
fairy tales and myth closer
than perhaps we do on a

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.330
mainland, because it's a more
precarious way of life.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.360
You're more willing to be
slightly superstitious if you

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.240
live in a very hostile
environment, because you have

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.200
more to lose.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.475
So why not perhaps be
superstitious and have odd

00:25:47.475 --> 00:25:49.990
little rituals, if you believe
it may go some way

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.240
to keeping you safe?

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.890
So I knew that in my fiction,
island folklore and fairy

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.510
tales and strange beliefs would
have more weight and be

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.210
more credible, in a way.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.340
I just find them really
fascinating, and how often

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.270
they'll repeat themselves
in different ways

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.240
in different cultures.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.920
There'll be echoes.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.260
And I did quite a few readings
of fairy tales for this book.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.080
I wanted it to feel like
I fairy tale in itself.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.180
The way my structure is, there
is a chapter, and then a

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.930
little made-up-- on my part--

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.530
fairy tale from the island, and
then a chapter, and then a

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.401
fairy tale.

00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:33.640
And I wanted to suggest, too,
by doing this, that we may

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.010
think the idea of a half-man,
half-fish coming ashore and

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.000
growing legs is just impossible
and extraordinary

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.650
and obviously never going to
happen, but then similarly I

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.320
think the modern technology we
have these days is amazing.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.800
You could argue that how people
survive immense loss or

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.592
immense heartbreak and they
carry on and continue to be

00:26:55.592 --> 00:26:57.655
nice people might be just
as extraordinary.

00:26:57.655 --> 00:27:01.860
But yet in fact, we have
language and imagination, and

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.525
that our bodies work as
they do is amazing.

00:27:04.525 --> 00:27:07.230
And so towards the end of the
book, I just wanted to fuse

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.260
together what exists and is
real and what we might

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.530
consider mundane and what is
extraordinary and almost

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:19.540
magical, and actually blur the
two so that everyday life can

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.260
be seen perhaps with kinder
eyes, and we give ourselves

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.990
more credit than we
did previously,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.490
if that makes sense.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: It
does make sense.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.420
I was struck when I read the
book that the end of the fairy

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.680
tale of this story is not
the end of the book.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.890
And so did you reach a point
when you were writing this

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:51.290
where you go, do I end it here
or do I make it more--

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.180
I hesitate to say
modern or real.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.850
But the full moon comes
and then everyone's

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.420
expecting an event.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.190
And so the characters have to
decide what event they're

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.800
going to provide to the means
of the community.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.240
Tell me about that process.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.290
SUSAN FLETCHER: I knew
from the word "go"

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.180
who this man was.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:21.540
And I knew eventually what his
story would be and why he came

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.004
to the island.

00:28:23.004 --> 00:28:28.360
What I didn't know was what his
legacy would necessarily

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.610
be to the islanders that he ends
up leaving behind, who

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.360
reacts in what way.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.540
And I wanted the island to be a
better place for his arrival

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.540
and departure, but it was
difficult to know

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.940
where to end the book.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.450
And it was tempting to not have
everybody in a better

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:51.270
place for it, the majority,
but not all.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.065
But it's difficult.

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:54.662
I don't want to give
too much away.

00:28:54.662 --> 00:28:57.550
I'm skirting around
the ending.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:02.040
I feel that I have come to
the conclusion that's

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.190
right for the book.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.510
For a while, it wasn't going
to be a happy ending.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.150
But then I thought,
it has to be.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.795
I'm talking about fairy tales.

00:29:12.795 --> 00:29:17.200
I'm talking about beauty
of life, really.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.070
And I think if I was the reader
and this was somebody

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.440
else's book that I picked off
the shelf, I would want my

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:22.656
happy ending.

00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:24.030
I would want things to be OK.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.750
And that's not giving it away,
because hopefully, up until

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.030
the last page, the reader won't
be able to really guess

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.584
at what the happy
ending will be.

00:29:33.584 --> 00:29:37.430
But I feel that's
the ending the

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.340
characters deserved, actually.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.540
They deserved to have it
work out for them.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.680
They've been through a lot.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.800
I wanted it to be all right
for them in the end.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.427
But endings are always quite
difficult, because as the book

00:29:49.427 --> 00:29:52.920
progresses, you start to think
maybe it's not going to be as

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.275
you originally planned.

00:29:53.275 --> 00:29:56.400
But in this instance,
it mostly was.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: Many writers
talk about, when they finish

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:03.250
the book or they finish the
story, especially if they're

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.370
just originally imagining it,
there's a process of mourning,

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.050
because you're in this
community, although it's just

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.025
in your head.

00:30:12.025 --> 00:30:15.506
When you finished this book,
what happened to you?

00:30:15.506 --> 00:30:16.756
SUSAN FLETCHER: I slept a lot.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:23.620
The strangest part for me was
the final month of writing it,

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.990
because my deadline was the end
of September of last year.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.590
And it got to about
mid-August.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.220
And I remember thinking, I have
got to really work hard

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.490
to make this deadline.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.420
And I wanted to.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.920
I felt ready to hand it over.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.540
So I worked.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.790
I sort of cut out my social
life and went to ground

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.305
somewhat and just had six weeks
of intense work, where

00:30:43.305 --> 00:30:46.970
I'd really only have perhaps
five, six hours of sleep and

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:47.716
then an hour off.

00:30:47.716 --> 00:30:49.620
I mean, it was really--

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.330
and towards the end of
September, I just

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:52.870
thought they were real.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.490
I remember getting in the car
and going out to buy a pint of

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.570
milk and thinking I was on the
island, and thinking I was

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.820
going to the island shop.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:06.040
Someone needs to get out more.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.590
I went to the pub when
it was over.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.235
I handed it in and went to
the pub to have a drink.

00:31:09.235 --> 00:31:10.680
And I thought I saw one
of my characters

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.800
there in the car park.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.190
Oh, my god.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:15.640
Have a break.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.390
So it was an incredibly
intense experience.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.920
And then afterwards, when I
handed the book in, there is

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.070
relief, because you do feel
like you've lived with 22

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.590
people for three years.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.320
You want time away from them.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.330
But there is a mourning.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.400
You do miss them.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.860
I still miss characters that
I wrote in other books.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: Like who?

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.500
SUSAN FLETCHER: It's called
"Witch Light" here, but in the

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.995
States it's called "The Highland
Witch." The main

00:31:41.995 --> 00:31:45.525
character in that,
I missed her.

00:31:45.525 --> 00:31:47.030
I really liked her.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.160
I liked writing about her.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.570
And my ending for that book saw
her in the landscape which

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.070
I was living in.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.695
And I had a very definite idea
of where I was leaving her,

00:31:57.695 --> 00:31:59.390
out on the moor.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.100
And the road to go to the train
station kind of went

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.550
past where, in my mind,
I'd left her.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.672
So every time I drove to the
train station, I'd think

00:32:07.672 --> 00:32:10.550
what's where she is, even though
she's completely made

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.550
up mentally.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:17.030
But they don't feel fictional.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.150
Strange job.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: So "Witch Light"
is about 17th-century

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.750
Scotland and the role of women
in the community as well as

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.710
the waves of social change that
comes through with the

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:33.536
religion or governments or how
things are constructed.

00:32:33.536 --> 00:32:36.000
What was the genesis
of that book?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.250
Because it seems like your
fiction is rooted in a

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.700
geographic place, even though it
might not be a real place,

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.070
but you're writing about
the coast of Scotland.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.130
Were you living in Scotland when
you wrote "Witch Light"?

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.510
SUSAN FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.000
I'd always wanted to
see the Highlands.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.270
Went up the Highlands, and
it was [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.370
simply visiting that I heard
about this story of the

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.810
Glencoe Massacre--

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.996
Glencoe being this fantastic
glen on the

00:33:00.996 --> 00:33:02.830
west coast of Scotland.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:07.310
And in 1692, government troops
massacred a lot of the

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.415
population there.

00:33:08.415 --> 00:33:11.680
And I knew that much of the
story, but what I didn't know

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.980
was-- again, it's to do with
folklore, actually.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.730
They say there was a woman
living in the glen at the time

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.065
who was a witch, and she
predicted the massacre was

00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:20.720
going to happen.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.740
And she ran down into the glen
that night to warn the

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.680
McDonalds, who were
living there.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.510
And whether they heeded her
warning or not, the reality is

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.800
that there were probably a
couple of hundred McDonalds

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.740
living in the glen at the time,
but under 40 actually

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.830
died that night.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.730
So a lot fled.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.420
A lot did escape and get away.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.750
So I put two and two together
and thought, yeah, they did

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.680
heed her warning, and
she was real.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.580
And so I wanted to explore her
and the idea of witchcraft.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.620
And marginalized women, people
on the edge of society really

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.250
interest me, people who are a
bit kooky and different, and

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.310
area treated accordingly.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.000
So yeah, I enjoyed writing
about her.

00:34:03.167 --> 00:34:05.778
FEMALE SPEAKER: When I read
"Witch Light", I found it hard

00:34:05.778 --> 00:34:10.750
to breathe, because the one
character is incarcerated in a

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.659
terrible, dank prison.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:19.760
And her only contact with humans
for a very long time is

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.920
that-- it's like
an inquisitor.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.830
I mean, they didn't have
inquisitors in the UK, but he

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.794
has a religious background.

00:34:25.794 --> 00:34:30.273
And he comes up and he's very
anti-woman in a way that seems

00:34:30.273 --> 00:34:32.449
to fit with the times.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.035
But then he grows to appreciate
her intelligence

00:34:35.035 --> 00:34:38.463
and her capacity for survival.

00:34:38.463 --> 00:34:42.350
This capacity for survival is
also a thread throughout "The

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.670
Silver Dark Sea." People are
surviving beyond what they

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:51.190
thought they could, whether it's
loss or living on this

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.150
harsh island.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.710
Is that a theme that fascinates
you, the idea of

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.680
surviving life?

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.520
You're living it, but you're
also living through it.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.132
SUSAN FLETCHER: Yeah, digging
deep and finding reserves and

00:35:07.132 --> 00:35:08.550
having to carry on.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.080
I think I am really interested
in that.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.210
It's only now that I've written
a fourth book that I

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.680
can see, in all four books I've
written, that's a theme

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:22.210
that appears in all of them,
about people who experience

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.000
real difficulty at the very
least, up to tragedy and

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.740
heartbreak.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.760
And what choice, really, do you
have except to carry on,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.070
to find an inner reserve and to
continue to try and see the

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:41.180
good in the world and make a
difference to it and carry on?

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.210
I do find that a really
interesting topic, and

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:50.362
hopefully quite a uplifting
one for a novel, this idea

00:35:50.362 --> 00:35:52.136
that you can go through darkness
and emerge the other

00:35:52.136 --> 00:35:55.193
side, possibly even a
[INAUDIBLE] person than you

00:35:55.193 --> 00:35:59.262
were before the darkness
happened.

00:35:59.262 --> 00:36:01.821
I mean, it would be interesting
to write a book

00:36:01.821 --> 00:36:04.650
from the point of view of
someone who doesn't survive a

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.730
darkness in that way.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.650
But it might not be particularly
happy reading.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:10.770
It might not sell that well.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.810
But yes, it is a theme that
interests me, particularly as

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:20.812
to a woman's fortitude and
carrying on regardless.

00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:23.885
FEMALE SPEAKER: So "The Silver
Dark Sea," there are 22 people

00:36:23.885 --> 00:36:24.992
on the island.

00:36:24.992 --> 00:36:25.790
A lot of these are women.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.180
And it's interesting,
they all have

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.550
their own type of darkness.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.950
Sometimes you read a book and
it's one event, and it's

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:39.080
terrible and it's
dark throughout.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.720
The women on Parla have
different shades.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.020
There's several flavors
of unrequited love.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:51.210
There's several flavors of
being at the end of one's

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:56.330
life, wishing that someone had
either joined you or was still

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.190
with you at the end
of your life.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.620
Tell me about creating
that world.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.610
Was that something that
just came out?

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.610
Or is that a point that you
wanted to make, that the

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.470
darkness is not the same
color for everyone?

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.640
SUSAN FLETCHER: Yeah, it was
quite a difficult job I had,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.565
because I wanted everybody on
the island-- even though it

00:37:17.565 --> 00:37:19.230
was quite a few people--

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:22.860
to all to be as real as each
other, and to not favor one

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.840
person over another.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.830
And everybody's different.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.750
Everybody has experienced lots
on this island, mainly because

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.810
they were all related to or
friends with or loved the man,

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.630
Tom, who died four years before
by drowning at sea and

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:38.820
not being found.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.145
So everybody has lost a son,
or a brother, or a

00:37:43.145 --> 00:37:46.770
brother-in-law, or a husband,
or a child.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.420
He was so many things
to different people.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.620
And consequently, the different
relationships have

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.480
left different feelings
of loss.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.630
But then I wanted more than
just the loss of him.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:02.390
So there are people who miss
their youth, or feel they've

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.340
wasted it, or people who wonder
if they should ever

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.790
have got married, or people who
think, I wish I had done,

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.980
and people who have lost-- the
old man's lost his sight.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.370
So he mourns the fact
he can no longer see

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.835
his wife's face anymore.

00:38:17.835 --> 00:38:19.670
So everybody has
lost something,

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.425
from varying degrees.

00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:25.260
But yes, the idea of there being
different shades of loss

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.606
is lovely, because it
felt like that.

00:38:26.606 --> 00:38:29.210
There's some people who, when I
think of them as characters,

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.615
I feel they've got this
real black sense of

00:38:32.615 --> 00:38:34.370
loss, and very heavy.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:37.010
And they were the difficult
people to write about, There's

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:41.430
a more superficial layer that's
not necessarily a

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.510
lighter loss to carry, but one
that I can recognize more

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:46.900
readily, because I felt I was
more able to describe it.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:50.910
It was less of a challenge to
describe that kind of loss.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.080
It was trying to get the whole
spectrum, the whole range,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.845
from effectively the death of a
husband or a child, right up

00:38:58.845 --> 00:39:03.242
to just losing my [INAUDIBLE]
or something.

00:39:03.242 --> 00:39:05.647
[INAUDIBLE] the whole
gamut [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:10.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: The book
circles around a lot.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:14.420
So you hear the same story
throughout the book from

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.870
different perspectives.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:21.755
And I had the perception as I
was reading it of circular

00:39:21.755 --> 00:39:25.895
movement, almost like
a whirlwind, or a--

00:39:25.895 --> 00:39:26.370
SUSAN FLETCHER: Tidal.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Tidal pool.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.813
It went round and round.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.670
Was that a construct that
you sought to achieve?

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.240
Or is that just something that
came out as you told the story

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.100
from the different
points of view of

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.170
everyone on the island?

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:46.030
Did you say, here's a story, and
I'm going to provide all

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.560
different facets of the story?

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.760
Or it just kind of showed up?

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.390
SUSAN FLETCHER: A little
bit of both, I think.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:57.045
If you have one big event that
a lot of people took part in

00:39:57.045 --> 00:39:59.750
or witnessed, then they're all
going to see this from a

00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.950
different point of view.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.290
And I wanted, again, this idea
of being fair to the

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.470
community, and everybody having
their viewpoint and

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.500
their chance.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.870
I wanted to present all the
different ways this event

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.700
happened, and therefore, for
the reader, making it feel

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.900
like a real 3D event.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.390
They can see every corner or
facet of it, because everybody

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:20.740
is throwing in their
two pence worth.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.462
But after a while, it took on a
nature of its own, and this

00:40:24.462 --> 00:40:28.950
idea of this whirlpool image
that you described.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.270
That, I think, was more
organic [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:36.520
I think, yeah, that
came [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I know you
don't like to talk about what

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.125
you're working on.

00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:40.375
So what are you working on?

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.815
SUSAN FLETCHER: I feel like
I'm a chicken sitting on

00:40:44.815 --> 00:40:46.620
different eggs, seeing
which one will hatch.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:53.220
I've got several ideas that I'm
just starting to feel my

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.080
way around.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.670
And it's not just about the
ideas I have, but when the

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.665
time is right for one more
than the other, really.

00:41:02.665 --> 00:41:03.840
And it's difficult.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.110
You've got to work out how long
you think each book's

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:11.370
gonna take you, and one's
life trajectory.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:16.240
And I think the bottom line
is, the next book I write

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.720
would just be the one that I
feel most passionate about.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.340
I could over-think it
for a long time.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.830
Which one would see the
market the best?

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.130
Or which one do other people
want me to write?

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.840
Which one is most similar
to the books

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.990
that are selling well?

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.990
That kind of thing.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:31.680
But actually, I think you
write what you love.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.440
You write what you feel ready
for and you have the appetite

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.575
for, because it goes back to one
of the opening questions.

00:41:36.575 --> 00:41:39.746
That will translate through
to the reader.

00:41:39.746 --> 00:41:44.020
I don't think, really, that
books get written with that.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.910
I mean, invariable they do.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.430
But you have to really
want to write it.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:50.310
You have to put yourself
into the novel

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.100
and give it a heartbeat.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.005
Otherwise it just won't come
through to the reader that

00:41:55.005 --> 00:41:56.120
there's a heartbeat at all.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.516
And there's nothing worse
for me as a reader

00:41:57.516 --> 00:41:59.470
to have a cold book.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:04.000
So I just see what my instinct
tells me, and that's probably

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.680
what I'll write.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.595
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you ever
walk away from an idea?

00:42:06.595 --> 00:42:10.420
Do you say, I'm gonna do
this, here we go, and--

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:10.780
SUSAN FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.380
I have done really recently,
actually,

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.403
which is really hard.

00:42:14.403 --> 00:42:16.355
It's about six months
worth of work.

00:42:16.355 --> 00:42:18.300
And it's not been binned.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.480
I will go back to it.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.070
But it has been put on
the back burner.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.250
I looked at it and I thought,
I feel I've lost my way.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:29.870
I feel like I'm searching
around almost in

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.650
a panicky way now.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.870
And no good is ever gonna
come from that.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.745
So I'm putting it to one side,
looking at my other ideas, And

00:42:38.745 --> 00:42:43.480
it could be that just thinking
about other ideas takes my

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.535
mind from that, so that when I
come back to it, I'll have

00:42:46.535 --> 00:42:49.100
clear eyes again and I can
see where I went wrong.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.045
But it's hard.

00:42:50.045 --> 00:42:52.760
It's hard putting that amount
of time into a project, only

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.760
to think it's not
the right one.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.260
You feel you've wasted
those six months.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.200
The reality is, you haven't.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.292
Now, I will be able
to strip that for

00:43:00.292 --> 00:43:01.770
parts, if nothing else.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:05.110
And hopefully I'll be a better
write for having walked away

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.010
from something.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:09.180
But there was a couple of days
where I felt quite sorry for

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.374
myself on that one.

00:43:11.374 --> 00:43:13.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you do
other types of writing?

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.150
Like, sometimes writers will
clear the palette with an

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:21.760
essay, or they keep a journal,
or writing just long, long

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.360
letters to friends.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:23.630
What--

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.110
SUSAN FLETCHER: I love
writing letters.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.190
I'm still a big believer in
the actual letter, not an

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:32.200
email or a text, but the nice
writing paper with a nice pen.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.480
I write poetry that no one will
ever see, but it's good

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.700
for me [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.121
my palette cleanser.

00:43:39.121 --> 00:43:40.610
I don't tend to write essays.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:41.480
I keep journals.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.750
Particularly if I'm traveling,
I'll always

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:43.820
keep a travel diary.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.110
I do that almost more
than I take photos.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.360
I'm a big believer in
travel journals.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.740
So that's my outlet.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.630
It could well be that the time
will come for essays or

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.907
reviewing or journalistic work,
but I haven't got to

00:43:57.907 --> 00:43:59.120
that stage yet.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you return
to your travel journals?

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.748
Like, what's your oldest
travel journal?

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.440
SUSAN FLETCHER: The one that
springs to mind is when I was

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.872
20, and I went backpacking to
Australia and New Zealand.

00:44:14.872 --> 00:44:18.850
And you look back, and all the
things I was worried about at

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.890
age 20-- you know, for
heaven's sake, girl.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:25.250
But that's probably
the oldest.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.180
I have some diaries from school
days, [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:28.780
and things.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.792
At 15, 16, I kept diaries.

00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:32.680
When I went to sixth form
and discovered boys,

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.486
I was keeping diaries.

00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:38.920
Just kind of laughable now,
but I didn't write them

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.850
thinking one day they might be
useful for novel-writing.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:45.820
I just kept then because it made
sense to me to do that.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.430
But you look back and, yeah, I
could one day strip that for

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:52.672
parts and change names, and deny
all knowledge of it ever

00:44:52.672 --> 00:44:54.612
coming from me.

00:44:54.612 --> 00:44:56.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: So [INAUDIBLE]
journals are useful then?

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.040
SUSAN FLETCHER: They could be.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.110
Certainly the travel
ones are, yeah.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: And when you
do a travel journal, do you

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.075
sit down at the end of the day
and it's, dear Diary, today I

00:45:05.075 --> 00:45:06.180
went here, here, and here?

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.880
Or is it what you've seen?

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.810
Or just how do you transcribe
a journey into a journal?

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.700
SUSAN FLETCHER: Some of them are
just bullet points so that

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.410
I remember when I'm 95 exactly
what I did in that place.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:23.220
But there are ones, too, where
I will just pour out

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.720
homesickness or just
what takes me.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.865
I try not to think about
it too much.

00:45:28.865 --> 00:45:29.880
It's just what happens.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.170
The one that I kept when I was
20 is hilarious, because I'm

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.310
just writing about the sandwich
I ate and the number

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.335
of the bus I took.

00:45:35.335 --> 00:45:35.990
And then it's a bit--

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.000
right, I have to now write
like a proper writer.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.330
So I start being more
descriptive about my pages.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:43.670
And then I go back to how I
need a new pair of shoes.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:48.630
And actually, the interesting
part is the everyday frippery,

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.720
not this attempt at being poetic
about what the blue

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.696
mountains look like.

00:45:52.696 --> 00:45:54.270
It was the interesting bit--

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:59.440
here's about waiting at a bus
station, or riding the ferry

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.740
across Sydney Harbor.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.850
That's more interesting.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.620
The small observation of things
I think are the most

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.960
important bits to get down.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.870
And that's what I would do if
I was traveling tomorrow.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.456
I would just, the tiny
observations that I would

00:46:12.456 --> 00:46:16.245
make, I think bring a
place to life again.

00:46:16.245 --> 00:46:18.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you have
any plans to travel soon?

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.360
SUSAN FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.409
I think this year, I need to.

00:46:20.409 --> 00:46:21.160
I've got itchy feet.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.860
It's been four years
since I went far.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.570
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you
could go anywhere,

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.200
where would you go?

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.060
SUSAN FLETCHER: Actually,
I would love to

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.030
see more of the States.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.856
I would love to go
up into Canada.

00:46:30.856 --> 00:46:33.665
I would love to go up to Alaska,
so all that lovely

00:46:33.665 --> 00:46:35.710
ground, love to do that.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:36.090
India.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.660
My mother's come back
from India recently.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.380
I'd love to see India.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.560
And I've traveled quite
extensively in Africa.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.758
And it's not easy to
do, but I loved it.

00:46:47.758 --> 00:46:50.962
I felt I grew a lot as a person
there, so I'd like to

00:46:50.962 --> 00:46:53.074
go back there.

00:46:53.074 --> 00:46:53.775
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:46:53.775 --> 00:46:56.035
Well, thank you so much for
your time and coming.

00:46:56.035 --> 00:46:56.960
Thank you so much
for this book.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.010
SUSAN FLETCHER: Thank
you for asking me.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
all we have time for.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.510
Thank you, everyone.
