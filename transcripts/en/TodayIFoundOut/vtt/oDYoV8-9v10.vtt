00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.260
Nestled safely in the bosom of the Bear Lodge
Mountains of Wyoming is a large rock formation

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.080
known simply as Devils Tower.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.590
A popular landmark and the first recognised
United States National Monument (declared

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.480
such by President Theodore Roosevelt on September
24, 1906), the imposing rocky butte was at

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.590
the forefront of a bizarre media frenzy in
1941 when a parachutist became hopelessly

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.960
stranded atop it.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.140
That parachutist was a known daredevil called
George Hopkins who made a bet for $50 (about

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.850
$800 today) that he could parachute and land
on top of the butte.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.590
Said bet was made with an eccentric entrepreneur
called Earl Brockelsby who was known for,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.120
amongst other bizarre things, keeping a live
rattlesnake under his hat, which he’d reveal

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.760
and let people pet on occasion.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.010
(If you’re wondering how he came by a relatively
tame, presumably de-fanged, rattler, he owned

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.810
“Reptile Gardens” in Rapid City.)

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.150
Hopkins, along with wanting to win the bet,
was hoping to very publicly show that it was

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.500
possible for a skilled parachutist to land
on a precise target.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.920
The approximately one acre sized area of flat
rock atop the tower seemed like as good a

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.190
place as any to demonstrate this.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.750
It should be noted here that Hopkins was by
no means a slouch when it came to the burgeoning

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.200
sport of skydiving.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.500
In fact, one of the ways he made a living
was by leaping from burning planes for motion

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.500
pictures.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.350
In other words, he was fairly confident he’d
be able to make the jump despite random, sometimes

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.590
severe up and down drafts around the tower.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.640
However, he didn’t bother to seek permission
from the National Park Service to land atop

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.080
the rocky monolith, thinking that they’d
just say no if he asked.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.390
Instead, Hopkins told only a single newspaper
reporter from the Sundance Times that sometime

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.030
in the closing days of September he’d perform
the stunt, promising them exclusive coverage

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.770
of the event on the condition that they not
tell anyone until after he’d done it.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.560
With all the necessary preparations in place,
on October 1, 1941, Hopkins took to the skies

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.390
in a plane specially chartered for the stunt
and leapt from it, making a beeline for Devils

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.390
Tower.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.590
Problems began almost immediately as Hopkins
was nearly knocked off course by severe wind

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.590
gusts.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.959
He ultimately managed to get over his target
but was much too high, so partially collapsed

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.110
his parachute, plummeting to the rocky plateau
below.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.769
After a bit of a rough landing in which he
reportedly was blown several feet across the

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.840
rocks, hitting a boulder in the process, he
was down and mostly unharmed.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.409
george-hopkins-strandedWith seemingly the
hard part out of the way, Hopkins stood and

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.330
waited for his pilot, Joe Quinn, to throw
him a specially prepared pack containing everything

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.319
he’d need to descend the tower.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.590
Hopkins then watched helpless as the supply
pack sailed through the air and bounced straight

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.230
off the edge of the tower, stranding him without
supplies over 1000 feet (over 300 metres)

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.230
in the air.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.209
Before we get to what happened next, we should
discuss the contents of the pack that had

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.219
just dive-bombed to earth in front of Hopkin’s
eyes.

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.700
The pack contained nothing more than a sledgehammer,
an old car axle that had been sharpened on

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.730
one end, and 1000 feet of rope.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.450
Hopkin’s actual plan was to use the sledgehammer
to drive the axle into the top of the rock,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.430
attach one end of the rope to it, then climb
down.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.879
If you thought this plan was somewhat ill-conceived,
it should also be noted that technically the

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.930
1000 foot of rope was not sufficient to get
him to the bottom, but close enough where

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.310
he felt he’d be able to safely climb the
rest of the way down.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.480
However, after realising he was stranded,
another supply drop was organised, including

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.290
another 1000 feet of rope.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.060
This time, it landed atop the tower.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.150
Unfortunately, they didn’t bundle the rope
properly, so it unfurled while falling and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.169
landed in a giant mass of tangled knots that
quickly froze when a large blanket of fog

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.339
and snow rolled in.

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:42.680
Frustrated at his inability to untangle the
frozen rope, Hopkins threw a note off the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.949
end of the tower asking for a bottle of whiskey
for “medicinal” purposes, which was later

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:54.430
airdropped on his location along with various
survival supplies, though for whatever reason

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.340
they wouldn’t try dropping rope again.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.510
(It should be noted here that contrary to
popular belief, drinking alcohol in frigid

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.749
temperatures does not warm you up, it actually
makes you colder and more likely to suffer

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.269
hypothermia.)

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.269
The next day, news of Hopkins’ plight had
reached the wider media who descended on the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.010
park along with thousands of tourists to gawk
at him.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.690
Increasingly frustrated, Hopkins threw another
note off the edge stating he’d like to attempt

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.510
to parachute off, a proposal the authorities
quickly put the kibosh on according to contemporary

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.551
news reports, placating the daredevil by airdropping
supplies to keep his spirits up.

00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:28.551
For instance, in an effort to keep him warm,
this air drop included a “bear skin suit,

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:29.551
a megaphone” and, we’re not making this
up, but what was reported as “a medium rare

00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:30.551
steak”.

00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.551
No word on whether they put efforts into keeping
it warm for its decent, or if he had to eat

00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:32.551
it cold.

00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:33.551
If the latter, no doubt this fact was reflected
on his tip…

00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.551
devils-tower-climbOver the next few days,
several rescue attempts were made by experienced

00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:35.740
climbers, all of which were halted by ferocious
winds and snow, including in one instance

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.250
a climber slipping and falling, but being
saved by a safety rope.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.300
This forced the authorities to consider a
number of other, more unorthodox alternatives

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.010
to getting Hopkins down.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.400
These ideas included partially landing a plane
with skis atop the tower and having Hopkins

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.010
use his experience as a wing walker to leap
onto the aircraft as it passed by.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.320
(The summit was thought too small to safely
fully land on given the weather conditions.)

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.790
They also considered borrowing an experimental
Navy helicopter and using one of the Goodyear

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.030
Blimps to rescue him via dangling a basket
large enough to hold a human in.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.030
(see: The History of the Goodyear Blimp)

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.310
All of these ideas were abandoned due to the
increasingly hazardous weather conditions,

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.950
with the Goodyear Blimp plan coming the closest
to happening before the giant skyfaring advertisement

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.320
was grounded en route to the rescue.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.980
So how’d Hopkins ultimately get down?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.170
Did they finally wise up and simply go back
to the original plan of just dropping a lot

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.530
of rope for him?

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.530
Nope.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.400
A Dartmouth student by the name of Jack Durrance
notified the park service that he and a few

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.380
of his climbing companions were willing to
come try to rescue Hopkins.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.150
Just a few years earlier, in 1938, Durrance
was involved in only the second successful

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.770
free ascent ever to the top of Devils Tower
with one Harrison Butterworth,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.680
Durrance and co.’s journey to the tower
this time, however, was delayed by poor weather,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.710
resulting in their flight being canceled.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.030
Instead, they took a train to Denver and then
a car the rest of the way.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.831
When they arrived at the monument on October
5th, they noted that “When we got to Devils

00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:58.430
Tower, a sleet storm had gone through the
area.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.270
The tower was nothing but a sheet of glass.”

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.200
Despite the extreme conditions, the next morning
the crew, led by Durrance, began their slow

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.650
and slippery ascent, with Durrance hammering
pegs into the rock for the others as he went.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.810
After almost nine hours of this, they finally
reached the top.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.500
hopkinsOnce there, they found Hopkins in good
spirits and good health, despite his five

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.430
day ordeal at the top of the tower.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.130
They then showed him how to properly rappel
down the mountain.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.610
(The fact that they felt the need to do this
makes one wonder how Hopkins originally planned

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.930
to use a rope to climb down…)

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.530
After an uneventful descent to Terra Firma,
Hopkins casually walked towards the masses

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.770
and media seemingly no worse for wear and
in a jovial mood, joking with those gathered

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.660
that he needed a shave and a haircut, before
asking Brockelsby where his $50 was.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.700
In all, the park service recorded that over
7,000 people had visited the park to observe

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700
Hopkin’s ordeal.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.780
A little over a month later, the United States
would enter WW2, with Hopkins going on to

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.700
join the airborne infantry division as an
instructor in parachuting.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.910
Though most all of Hopkins’ former skydiving
records have since been broken, he still holds

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.600
the distinction of being the only man to parachute
onto the top of Devils Tower.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.650
Given significant advances in parachuting
technology since then making such a landing,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:24.530
while not trivial, not that terribly difficult
either for an experienced skydiver, we can

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.310
only assume the record hasn’t been broken
because the park service presumably won’t

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.630
allow such a landing today.
