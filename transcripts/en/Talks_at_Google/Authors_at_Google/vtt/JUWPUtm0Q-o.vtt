MODERATOR: Thank
you all for coming

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.030
to another Talks at Google
event this afternoon.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.040
Today, were extremely thrilled
to hose Professor Bob McChesney

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.120
and John Nichols.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.440
They're presenting a
talk today, a discussion,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.270
about their latest book,
which is called "Dollarocracy:

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.240
How Money and the Media Election
complex is Destroying America."

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.990
And I think, especially given
the events of recent news

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.620
and also the state of
the continual campaign

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.810
that's in American politics
today, the idea of media

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.340
literacy is very important and
the balance between free speech

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.259
and campaign contributions
and what role

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:41.550
the media plays in all of this.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.280
And so we're really thrilled to
bring this dialogue to Google

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.170
today.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.110
Professor McChesney is from
my alma mater, the University

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.560
of Illinois, where he teaches
in the communication department.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.220
And he's also the president and
co-founder of the "Free Press."

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.780
John is a journalist
and blogger and also

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.160
the associate editor of "The
Capital Times" up in Madison.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.460
So we have the Midwest
representation here.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.080
And so we will have some time
at the end for questions.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.380
We'll use this mic.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.860
So hunt me down if you
have a question at the end.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.030
Otherwise, please join me
in welcoming Bob and John

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.530
to Google.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.748
Thank you very much.

00:01:13.748 --> 00:01:17.477
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.810
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: Well,
thank you all for coming out.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.820
It's an honor to be
at Talks at Google.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.140
We've been in a tour
all over the country.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.660
This is our 35th or 40th talk.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.040
And we've got about
20 more to go.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.910
And the response to the book has
been extraordinarily positive.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.280
And as you'll see,
it's also surprising

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.140
because it's a very
depressing picture

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.270
we're about to paint
on what's going on

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.602
with our political system
and the corruption in it.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:46.060
But the reason why the response
has been positive, I think,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.185
on one hand is that
people recognize

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:50.810
the truth of what we're saying,
that the evidence points fairly

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.920
strongly in this direction.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.440
But the other reason is
that John and I both think

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.470
we're in the moment of change.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.321
That really this system
can't go on for much longer

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.820
and that the great crisis we
face in the United States today

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.380
is that our political system
is over here, very much

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.880
bounded by moneyed interests.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.160
But the great bulk of the
population isn't with that.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.910
They're over here.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.830
They want real solutions
to real problems

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.885
that our country faces.

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:16.010
And they know that our
government needs to provide.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.120
And this tension is growing
greater and greater by the day.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.860
And it's that
tension that's going

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.610
to create the birth, we
think, or the rejuvenation

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.990
of a movement to really
re-democratize this country

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.970
or democratize it much
more than it is at present.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.950
When we talk about
dollarocracy, what we refer to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.260
is fairly self-evident.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.520
Democracy means the rule of
the people, the rule of money.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.470
Going from the
Greeks, dollarocracy

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.280
means the rule of money,
not the rule of people.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.734
$1, one vote rather than
one person, one vote.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.150
Those with a great deal of
money have tremendous influence

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.510
over politics.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.220
Those with no money
have no influence

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.590
over politics whatsoever.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.560
Two recent studies published
by Princeton University Press

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.040
really encapsulated
this problem,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.820
one by Marty Gilens, another
by a team of scholars.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.075
They reached independently
the exact same conclusion,

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:10.450
which is if you look at the
Congress of the United States

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.950
today, none of the
decisions that are made

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.890
reflect the interests
of the great majority

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.560
of the voters of this country,
the values of their voters.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.390
Representatives routinely ignore
what their own constituents

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.370
want when they deal
with their decisions.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.740
The decisions are
made almost entirely

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.030
on behalf of the most
wealthy and powerful,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.380
self-interested
parties to the policy

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.420
or the law or the budget item.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.190
A month ago, we were
in Washington, DC.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.450
And we had a book launch party.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.580
And the person who wrote
the foreword to our book

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.970
graciously introduced us,
US Senator Bernie Sanders.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.090
Bernie has been in the US
Senate now seven years.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.670
Before that, he
served eight terms

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.790
in the US House of
Representatives.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.920
And he said, unequivocally,
unconditionally,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.450
that it is impossible
for anything

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.330
to pass the US Congress
if it is opposed

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.180
by either corporate America
or Wall Street-- impossible.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.150
They basically have veto
power over all legislation.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.420
And that, in a nutshell,
is dollarocracy.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.650
That's not democracy.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.330
Just this last summer, Jimmy
Carter, the former president,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.540
was meeting with a number
of dignitaries from Germany,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.850
talking about American
and global politics.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.100
It was supposed to be an
off-the-record meeting.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.670
Thanks to the
presence of an iPhone,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.960
it became an
on-the-record meeting.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.860
And Carter said,
the United States

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.920
is "no longer a
functional democracy."

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.420
No longer a
functional democracy.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.190
We are off the Democratic grid.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.400
We no longer have
the rule of law.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.360
We no longer have the
accountability one associates

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.170
at the base level with a
self-governing or democratic

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.241
society.

00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:45.740
And then to top it
off, in the book,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.425
we go through a lot of the
polling data and survey

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:50.800
data that shows that most
Americans are familiar with it.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.650
This is not something
that shocks Americans.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.270
They get it.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.700
They understand
the powerlessness

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.110
they have politically
that's frustrating to them.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.290
One survey that's most
striking was that almost half

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.640
of Americans think we would have
a better Congress if we simply

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.550
drew names out of a hat rather
than went through the election

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.050
process.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.260
That's a laugh line.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.213
But then people think
about it and say,

00:05:11.213 --> 00:05:13.360
you know, maybe that's
not such a bad idea.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.970
For those of you who know your
history of democratic theory,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.430
that's how the ancient Greeks
made most their decisions.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.720
It came through the jury
system, not through elections.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.680
So at any rate, dollarocracy
is the term we have for this.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.150
And it has immense consequences.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.483
The most obvious ones, the
ones we're all familiar with,

00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:29.440
is corruption.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.720
That the decisions that are
made in budgets and policies

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.450
and laws are dominated by
self-interested, large,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.440
profitable commercial interests.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.380
But it also has a lot
of other consequences.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.796
And they are the
consequences that

00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:44.257
really shape the
life of this country

00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:45.840
going forward until
they're addressed,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.080
until something is done
about dollarocracy.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.760
We have seen a massive increase
of an inequality in the United

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.100
States in the last 35 years.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.530
And this is what you would
expect in a dollarocracy.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.380
Those at the top rig the
system so the funds go to them.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.850
The benefits go to them.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.300
And the resources don't
flow towards the bottom.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.570
We've seen an enormous increase
in poverty in the last 35 years

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.030
in the United States.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.920
Virtually all the
gains we made, which

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.710
were enormous from the 1920s
to the 1960s to reduce poverty,

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.430
have been lost.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.435
We're back at poverty rates and
low income rates in the United

00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:20.510
States today equivalent to
where we were 80 years ago.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.920
We've lost almost all our
gains in the past generation.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.120
Economic stagnation.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.430
The certified range of
debate over economic policy

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.690
by the dollarcrats
in Washington, DC,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.430
is entirely comfortable with
high rates of unemployment

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.780
and lower real wages
for most workers.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.430
That's just not even debated
by either party, by anyone,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.160
in Washington.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.110
It's just a narrow
range of debate.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.389
That's not much of a future.

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.680
Basically, what we have now,
based on current policies,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.190
is what we're
getting going forward

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.440
for the great bulk
of American people.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.167
And then there's another point
here that's too often lost.

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:55.500
One of the great things about
America, one of the things

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.000
I think all Americans
treasure most,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.160
is our civil liberties-- freedom
of speech, freedom of religion,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.720
freedom of the press, right
to assemble peacefully.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.270
Well, when you lose democracy,
when it becomes a dollarocracy,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.780
your liberties, those
rights we cherish the most,

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.890
are on softer ground.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.960
You still have the right
to tattoo something

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.659
on your forehead or to have
a haircut of your choosing.

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:18.200
But when you start
challenging people

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.780
in power, what rights really
are all about, the ability

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.310
to stand up to those in power,
you're on softer ground.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.367
And we've seen, for example,
just this last week, a week

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:29.450
and a half ago, for the
first time in its history,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.754
the Committee to Protect
Journalists, an organization

00:07:31.754 --> 00:07:34.170
which defends freedom of the
press and journalists' rights

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.250
worldwide against autocratic
governments for the first time

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.440
issued a report on
harassment of journalists

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.170
by the US government--
first time in its history.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.160
And I'd submit that's what
you get in dollarocracy.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Under dollarocracy,
those rights,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.000
those freedoms that we once
took for granted to the extent

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.530
they mix with people in power,
suddenly are less secure.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.580
Well, the solution, in our
view, to dollarocracy is clear.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.920
It's democracy.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.770
And in this book,
what we argue is

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.940
that the election system, which
is the main way citizens have

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.090
a way to exercise democracy,
has been greatly corrupted.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.790
And that's really
where the problem is.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.740
And our book looks at
how it's been corrupted.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.120
So the ability of the
vote and the voter

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.880
has been reduced tremendously.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.790
And money has come to
rule it a great deal.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.370
Now, our book is
fairly depressing.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.780
You can always get
the vibe right now

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.071
where I'm going with it,
where we're going in the book.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.000
But American history is
not a constant series

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.900
of depressing outcomes,
quite the contrary.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.480
Between 1900 and 1970,
democratic forces,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.980
popular forces in
the United States,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.049
won a number of enormous
victories, huge victories.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.640
We won the right to
have trade unions.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.169
We won social security.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.169
We won Medicare.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.140
We established public education
for working class people

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.420
vastly superior to almost
anywhere in the world.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.340
We extended higher education
to a higher percentage

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.890
of the population than
anywhere else in the world.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.630
We reduced poverty dramatically.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.300
And by the 1960s, we had
less economic inequality

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.990
than we'd ever had since
the Industrial Revolution.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.450
We were really,
in many respects,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.900
moving forward rapidly.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.010
Now, it was up and down.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.760
There were fights.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.593
There were contests.

00:09:09.593 --> 00:09:11.300
It wasn't all wins.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.250
But it wasn't all
defeats either.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.280
By the end of the 1960s,
and I was a teenager then,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.440
they did a survey in 1970 of
all the teenagers in the world.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.610
And they found out
that American teenagers

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.040
were among the three most
optimistic groups of teenagers

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.581
in the world.

00:09:24.581 --> 00:09:27.150
The other two were
Israeli and Chilean.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.900
Chile fell off the
list a few years later.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.319
And America fell
off the list too.

00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:32.860
We're way down the
list now when they

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.890
do those surveys
in 40, 50, 60, 70.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.600
We're nowhere near the top.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.750
And I was a teenager then.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.208
And I remember the
optimism we had.

00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:43.580
We thought this country had the
capacity to solve its problems.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.127
We made all this progress.

00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:47.210
And we were within eyesight
of a much better world

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.530
with even less inequality, less
poverty, more opportunity, more

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.060
justice, less
militarism, and less war.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.240
But not everyone was
optimistic in the early 1970s.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.509
In particular,
the leading lights

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:01.800
in the business community
were deeply concerned by what

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.420
they saw going on in
America at that time.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.090
They were concerned
that America was not

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.298
sufficiently reverential
towards traditional business

00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:10.020
domination of politics.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.630
They were deeply concerned that
the most honored and respected

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.120
person in American life in 1970
across the political spectrum

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.600
was Ralph Nader.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.100
Ralph Nader, who's vision
was that public service was

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.170
the highest calling a person
could do to serve others

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.680
and that people
could work together

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.160
and democratically have the
government solve problems

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.520
effectively on behalf
of all the people.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.895
The government
did not have to be

00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:35.510
a source of
corruption or tyranny.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.660
That was Nader's message.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.243
And this scared the
business community

00:10:38.243 --> 00:10:41.410
to death, which saw its
stature in the country

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.340
probably at its lowest ebb in
generations by the early 1970s,

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.117
especially, interesting
enough, among middle class

00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:49.450
and upper middle class students.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.590
College students,
who traditionally

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.430
were the backbone
of business society,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.220
suddenly had a marked
increase in concern

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.040
that large corporations
weren't the best

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.380
way to structure an
economy for a free society.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.930
In the early 1970s, the
US Chamber of Commerce

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.310
commissioned a confidential
memo to be distributed

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:10.517
among five or six dozen
leading CEOs and investors

00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:12.600
to deal with what they
termed the political crisis

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.550
of our time.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.400
And they termed it the
crisis of democracy.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.260
And the crisis of
democracy to them

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.400
was that there was
too much democracy.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.850
The crisis of democracy
was that women,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.017
African Americans, young
people, young workers, who

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.100
traditionally had been
apathetic and not concerned

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.370
with politics, had gotten
too engaged in politics,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.660
were making demands on the
system the system really

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.700
couldn't accommodate.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.360
We had to get them back on the
couches, back in apathetic,

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.759
back and unconcerned
with politics.

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:38.550
And the US Chamber of
Commerce commissioned

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.258
the leading corporate
attorney in America

00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:41.810
at that time to write a memo.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.090
And this attorney's
name was Lewis Powell,

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.650
who made a vast fortune
representing firms, especially

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.280
in the US tobacco industry.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.477
And the Powell memo, you can
Google it after the talk.

00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:53.060
It's up there.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.930
It's six pages long.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:54.955
It was done in 1971.

00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:57.080
It was a blueprint, basically,
for how corporations

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.680
can take over the
government of the country

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.304
with the goal of
making it very simple.

00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:02.870
No matter who wins
the election, we win.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.740
Business domination
of society is never

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.270
in question
whichever party wins.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.800
That was the mission of it.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.530
And what Powell argued
was that business

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.870
needed to devote immense
resources to lobbying

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.010
and politics.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.100
And in the two decades
following the memo,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.940
there's was a tenfold increase,
10 times increase in lobbying

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.530
and political spending
by corporations.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.630
10 times increase in the number
of lobbyists in Washington, DC.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.650
The term K Street, which
didn't exist before 1971,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.230
became a term like Wall
Street or Madison Avenue

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.430
to signify an enormous industry.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.890
Washington, DC, which had
been a sleepy backwater

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.720
town without much
wealth, compared

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.000
to the Clevelands, or
the Bay Areas, or the New

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.620
Yorks, or the Philadelphias
of the world, suddenly,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.844
after the influx of corporate
money and the lobbying,

00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:45.260
became a very
different community.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.980
Today, four or five of the 10
richest counties in the United

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.040
States are the suburbs
ringing Washington, DC.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.390
And those aren't government
bureaucrats living there.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.830
They're the people of K Street.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.871
They're the corporate
people living there and all

00:12:56.871 --> 00:12:58.610
their ancillary people.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.720
So they've succeeded.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.900
Now, one thing that Powell
was insistent on in his memo

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.870
was they needed to
build groups that

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.770
would buttress the ideological
and political power

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.980
of corporations-- Heritage
Foundation, CATO, American

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.340
Enterprise Institute came
immediately following this.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.631
ALEC, a group that you've
been learning more about here

00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:19.010
at Google apparently, came
immediately after this.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.770
And then, most
importantly, we've

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.850
got to do something
about the Supreme Court.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.150
Even when we have
Republican presidents who

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.240
are pro-business, like
Eisenhower and Nixon,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.160
they're appointing these guys
like Earl Warren and Harry

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.795
Blackmun.

00:13:31.795 --> 00:13:33.295
And they get a
lifetime appointment.

00:13:33.295 --> 00:13:35.378
And they get carried away
with the First Amendment

00:13:35.378 --> 00:13:37.994
and the idea of
expanding democracy.

00:13:37.994 --> 00:13:40.160
We've got to get guys in
the court, when we put them

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.743
on the court, we
know they will always

00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:43.770
understand business
first, business always.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.140
Business has to dominate.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.390
So they set up something
called The Federalist Society

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.259
to be a training ground
for their attorneys,

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:51.550
so they could count on them
when they got in the court.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.030
And as fate would have it,
two months after this Powell

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.530
memo was distributed
confidentially and gendered

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.840
a great deal of discussion
internally in the business

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.240
community, there's an opening
on the US Supreme Court.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.390
And who should President
Nixon decide to appoint?

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.670
Lewis Powell.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.600
He became the next judge
in the Supreme Court.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.610
So he had a chance to
swing right into action

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.060
and implement his ideas as a
member of the US Supreme Court.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.995
And Powell's signature
issue from the moment

00:14:15.995 --> 00:14:17.370
he came to the
court was the idea

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.710
there should be unlimited
spending by corporations

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.740
and wealthy people on politics.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.980
That was his immediate issue.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.637
He was obsessed with that.

00:14:24.637 --> 00:14:26.970
He was never able to win that
fight on the Supreme Court

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.845
while he was on it,
because the Chief Justice

00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:30.510
at the time, William
Rehnquist, was

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.520
an old-fashioned conservative.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.240
He didn't believe
corporations were people.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.990
He didn't believe the
Supreme Court should

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.640
mess with the structure of
elections to play favorites.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.940
He opposed the efforts
to have unleashed money.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.740
But by the time John
Roberts replaced

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.360
Rehnquist in 2010,
all that changed.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.330
John Roberts was a
Federalist Society superstar.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.600
He was committed to
unlimited spending

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.390
by business and billionaires
and trade unions.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.859
And for those of
the younger people

00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:57.150
here, ask some of the old
people what trade unions are.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.690
They're these things we used to
have back in the '60s and '70s

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.800
that gave workers some higher
income than they have today.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.930
And the Citizens United
decision came on in 2010.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.080
And that's really what
drove this book, because

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.180
with Citizens United, what we
saw was businesses, unions,

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.185
and billionaires can
spend unlimited amounts

00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:18.310
on political campaigns, as
long as the money didn't

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.460
go officially to
the campaign itself.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.737
It went to a third-party
group that was not

00:15:22.737 --> 00:15:24.320
associated with the
campaign but could

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.800
be linked to it informally,
as we learned in 2012.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.015
And as a result, we saw in
the last election, 2012,

00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:34.250
in the United States,
we spent $10.3 billion

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.080
on all our elections,
double what

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.300
was spent in 2008
and all the elections

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.800
in America, 10 times what
was spent 20 years ago,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.540
even factoring inflation.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.540
We're way huge
increase in spending.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.612
Now, the Supreme Court argued
this huge increase in spending

00:15:49.612 --> 00:15:51.570
would be a good thing,
because there would just

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.660
be more civic virtue.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.720
More money is more speech,
more involvement by people.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.126
But there's a fundamental
problem with that argument.

00:15:58.126 --> 00:15:59.750
There's a big difference
between anyone

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.880
in this room giving
$50, $100, $200, even

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.320
$1,000 to a candidate
and someone giving

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.450
100 times or 1,000 times that.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.550
It goes from being
a civic contribution

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.600
to being an investment with an
expected outcome commercially.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.960
All the evidence has
always pointed that way.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.330
All the evidence continues
to point that way.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.476
Now, it's difficult to fully
get the evidence on that

00:16:20.476 --> 00:16:22.350
in the short term,
because most of the people

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.570
are dropping lots of money.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.110
And much of this money
is now anonymous.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.568
As we chronicled
in the book, there

00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:27.830
are no records that are kept.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:28.996
Don't want to be publicized.

00:16:28.996 --> 00:16:32.910
If you drop $50 or $100
million on a referendum case

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.624
on labeling of
foods in California,

00:16:34.624 --> 00:16:36.040
for example, you
don't really want

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.730
to necessarily
advertise who you are.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.063
You want to keep it on the
down low as much as possible.

00:16:40.063 --> 00:16:41.200
You just want to win.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.160
But fortunately for us
in doing our research,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.890
there was one major donor
who gave $200 million

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.490
in the last election cycle
who enjoyed the publicity

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.760
and reveled in it.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.170
He's from Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.780
His name is Shelly Adelson.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.100
You might have heard of him.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.785
Shelly dropped $200
million, as I said.

00:16:55.785 --> 00:16:58.160
And after the election, everyone
said, well, poor Shelly.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.490
He lost $200 million.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.420
He had a rough year.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.090
All his candidates lost.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.630
Well, not all of them.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.778
In Michigan, there
was a referendum

00:17:05.778 --> 00:17:08.319
on the ballot to make the right
to have collective bargaining

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.050
part of the Michigan
constitution

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.710
so the government couldn't take
away that right from workers.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.890
It looked like it
was going to win.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.089
Michigan, after
all, is the backbone

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.069
of the labor movement
in the United States.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.050
In the last few weeks,
Shelly took an interest

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.250
in that state in that race and
dropped a few million dollars

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.099
quickly to run
negative ads against it

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.254
and was able to defeat
it at the last second.

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.170
So he won some things.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.242
He didn't lose everything.

00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:31.200
Shelly Adelson had a very
interesting interview

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.422
after the 2012 election.

00:17:34.422 --> 00:17:36.255
He went to Washington
so all the Republicans

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:37.970
could kiss his ring.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.720
And "The Washington
Post" interviewed him.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.830
And the reporter said, what are
your politics, Shelly Adelson?

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.750
What motivates you?

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.150
He said, well, these
are my political values.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.720
I believe in
socialized medicine.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.320
I believe in stem cell research.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.946
I'm concerned about
the climate crisis.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.111
I think we probably have
to do something about that.

00:17:54.111 --> 00:17:55.100
I believe in science.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.270
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.090
I believe in gay rights
and gay marriage.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.634
The reporter is dumbfounded.

00:18:01.634 --> 00:18:04.050
Are you the same Shelly Adelson
who just gave $200 million

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.260
to Rick Santorum and
all these lunatics?

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.720
And I'm paraphrasing here.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.550
And he said, yeah.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.130
He said, I don't give money
to politics for those reasons.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.410
When I give money to politics,
I've got three basic concerns.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.980
Number one, I hate labor unions.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.040
I have a nonunion shop.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.810
I'm a billionaire.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.370
I don't want to have
the unions in my shop.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.500
So I'm for politicians
who are going

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.420
to make sure we don't have
to worry about labor unions.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.140
Number two, I'm
worth $30 billion.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.590
I don't like paying taxes.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.140
That's for the little people.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.970
I want politicians
to keep my taxes low.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.870
And for what I spend, I get
a 1% drop in my tax rate.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.620
It more than pays for whatever
I give any politician.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.530
And number three, I
run gambling casinos.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.821
You might know that that's
sort of a dubious enterprise

00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:41.800
to a lot of people.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.587
And some of the stuff I'm doing
in my East Asia casinos people

00:18:44.587 --> 00:18:46.170
are looking at as
maybe being a little

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.631
in the gray area of legality.

00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:49.130
I prefer to have a
government that's

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.730
not going to look
very hard at that.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.746
That's why I give $200 million.

00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:53.820
I'm worth $30 billion.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.730
I want to be worth $60 billion.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.090
I don't want to be worth
$10 billion or in jail.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.210
And so he laid it out.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.050
It's all about investment.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.995
And when the Citizens United
decision unleashed the money

00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:05.620
from the Shelly
Adelson's of the world,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.903
it had no effect on
the 99.99% of Americans

00:19:08.903 --> 00:19:11.486
who were in no position to give
more than $100,000 or $200,000

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:12.830
a year in elections.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.770
It was all about Shelly Adelson
and a few thousand other people

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.810
who can drop $200 million.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.114
It was their liberation
pact was for them

00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:21.280
to be able to buy elections.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.530
That's what that decision did.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.020
It had no effect on
99.9% of Americans, zero.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.044
But for Shelly, it was great.

00:19:28.044 --> 00:19:29.460
Now, let's think
about that money.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.040
So we outspend most countries
by a great deal of money.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.590
Germany, as you
might know, recently

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.552
had a national election.

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:40.010
Just a month ago, they reelected
their Christian democratic

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.291
government.

00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:42.790
And John Nichols
and I went through.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.410
And we did the math.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.490
We figured out how
much did Germany

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.640
spend on their campaigns.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.890
All their politicians, all
their candidates per voter,

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.740
how much did they spend on
the German national election

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.610
this year?

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.660
And how did that compare to
how much American politicians,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.670
parties, and third-party groups
spent on our election in 2012?

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.500
For every dollar they
spent in Germany this year,

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.360
for every dollar on campaigns
for their national elections,

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.880
we spent $32 on our
national elections,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.430
congressional and presidential
in 2012-- 32 to 1 ratio.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.130
And from our research,
basically, that's

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.213
pretty much the ratio
everywhere around the world.

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.410
It's sometimes down
to 8 or 9 or 10 to 1.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.540
But the larger the country
is, the more it gets up.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.010
Britain was 29 to 1
for the 2010 election

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.610
compared to us in 2012.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.590
We spend unbelievable
amounts of money

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.254
compared to these
other countries.

00:20:25.254 --> 00:20:26.670
Now, according to
Citizens United,

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.730
that should give us the
best elections in the world.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.610
We're outspending them.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.350
All that speech.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.220
All that public involvement.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.220
Well, let's think about that.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.880
Imagine we outspent
Germany 32 to 1

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.480
in elementary school
education in America.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.660
What would it be like?

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.550
Take what Germany spends to
educate a first grader and say,

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.884
we outspent them by 32 times.

00:20:45.884 --> 00:20:47.550
What would an American
elementary school

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.930
look like in Oakland today?

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.440
You'd have one teacher.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.470
You'd have four students.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.690
You'd have four
assistant teachers.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.540
You'd have a music teacher,
an art teacher, a gym teacher,

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.000
a personal trainer, a masseuse.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.370
You'd have this unbelievable
network of people

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.330
to educate our kids.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.610
Every kid in America
would get an education

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.770
equal to Bill Gates'
kid, if not better.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.690
32 to 1 spending
advantage over Germany.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.950
It would be unbelievable.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.230
So what happens when you
outspend a country 32 to 1

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.890
on elections?

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:16.690
Unbelievable?

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.380
Yeah, unbelievable but
in the other direction.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.580
We have the worst
elections in the world.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.950
Jimmy Carter has said,
again-- and the Carter Center

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.110
monitors elections.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.410
They've monitored 92
elections in the last 25 years

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.070
to make sure they're
on the up and up.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.770
Jimmy Carter said
that the United States

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.550
has arguably the worst
election system in the world.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.320
He said that if the
Carter Center was

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.250
asked to monitor an
American election,

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.291
they would refuse to do
so, because we don't meet

00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:43.610
the baseline credibility
level you have to have

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.520
that Venezuela meets,
that Ukraine meets,

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.500
the Belarus meets.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.159
We don't meet that
baseline criteria

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:51.200
that they would hold a
country to that they could

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.230
trust the outcome
of the election.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.550
That's what Carter said.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:58.000
Our elections are deplorable
by international standards.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.100
We get the lowest
turnout rate in the world

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.130
among major countries.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.220
Germany had a 72% turnout.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.440
Norway, three weeks before
their national election, 82%.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.520
We had just under 53% of
18-year-olds and older vote

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.580
in our 2012 election.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.560
People were ecstatic.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.020
53%.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.840
Unbelievable.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.760
We're very low.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.100
And where does the money go?

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.360
And this is really why
so much has been spent.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.490
The money goes
overwhelmingly to television

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.050
political advertising.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.960
And this is much of
what our book is about,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.820
because it's become the lingua
franca of American politics.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.250
In 1776, the book that
drove most Americans

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.560
to be willing to fight to
make this country independent

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.060
was a pamphlet by Tom Paine
called "Common Sense."

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.460
And it was the most widely
read book of its period,

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.540
perhaps even more
so than the Bible.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.610
And in the first sentence
of that book, it says,

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.690
a long habit of not
thinking something

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.291
wrong gives it the superficial
appearance of being right.

00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:53.540
And that's how most of us
are about American politics.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.960
We're so inundated in the
idea of political advertising

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.810
as the lingua franca, we think
that's what democracy is.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.090
That's what we think
democratic elections are.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.930
Wrong.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.680
It's not like that at all.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.000
Not like that at all.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.450
Political advertising
is outlawed

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.236
in all the countries
I just named.

00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:09.360
You can't do it in Germany.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.443
You can't do it in Norway.

00:23:10.443 --> 00:23:12.110
They don't allow it to be spent.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.690
That's where we spent $6 of
our $10 billion last time

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:16.320
on these political
ads, which are

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.462
of extraordinarily
dubious value.

00:23:18.462 --> 00:23:20.170
In other countries,
like Britain, they're

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.250
considered to political
campaigns what germ warfare is

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.000
considered to
conventional warfare.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.120
They're considered simply
outside the boundaries

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.490
of a healthy democracy
and unacceptable.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.560
But in this country,
that's what we have.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.690
And in this country,
increasingly what we have

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.880
are negative ads.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.930
Ads that, basically,
are all about attacking

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.990
the opponent in a
scurrilous manner

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.130
with a factual basis that is
laughable at the most part.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.260
I could go on and on.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.730
I think you get the hint
of where we're going.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.620
The good news though, we are
on a chance of changing it.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.120
The bad news though is that the
one institution that normally

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.662
would be at the front of leading
us would be our news media,

00:23:56.662 --> 00:23:58.870
our political journalism,
which would draw people in,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.934
make them aware.

00:23:59.934 --> 00:24:01.600
And the crisis we
talk about in the book

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.117
is not only of our
election system,

00:24:03.117 --> 00:24:04.700
but it's of the
collapse of journalism

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.033
as we know it in the United
States in the last 20 years.

00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:10.330
The resources going to
journalism have plummeted.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.460
In most communities we go
to, there are maybe 30%,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.990
35% the number of paid
reporters there were,

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.650
including digital,
from 1990 or 1992.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.560
In some communities,
it's much less.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.190
There's just not
much journalism left.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.790
The commercial
community has decided

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:24.760
you can't make money doing it.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.800
They're not doing it.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.760
Most people who go to vote
now, they have no information

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.959
whatsoever about most of
the races on the ballot.

00:24:30.959 --> 00:24:33.250
What little journalism you
get for the races at the top

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.990
is usually just regurgitating
the claims in the TV ads

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.600
and discussing them
and how effective

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.100
they are, very little about the
actual candidates or policies.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.140
So very much the
crisis of dollarocracy

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.420
is the crisis of the loss
and collapse of journalism.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.110
And the solution to
the crisis is not only

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.890
changing our election laws,
changing our Constitution

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:56.130
to guarantee the right to
vote, but also creating

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.365
a healthy, vibrant,
independent news media.

00:24:58.365 --> 00:24:59.990
And on that note,
I'd like to introduce

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.878
my co-author, John Nichols.

00:25:01.878 --> 00:25:09.348
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:09.348 --> 00:25:11.070
JOHN NICHOLS: Bob McChesney.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.100
Can everybody hear this well?

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.742
Bob's a little
taller than I. And I

00:25:14.742 --> 00:25:16.840
thought the microphone was
not particularly well set up

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.340
for him.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.900
And I'm hoping I will project
well enough so everybody

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.000
can hear you, because
we've come to Google to ask

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.490
you to work, not
merely to listen.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.469
And a huge part of
our research-- and I

00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:31.385
know this guy sitting
up front is saying, hey,

00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:32.676
I work all the rest of the day.

00:25:32.676 --> 00:25:36.620
I don't want to be
told to do more here.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.380
Look, you're a unique
bunch of people.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.340
Do you understand?

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.870
It's not every
corporation in America

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.300
where midday when you have
a lunch break you come out

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.690
and sit in the middle of the
operation and listen to people

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.070
pontificate about the
politics and the functioning

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.250
of democracy.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.200
So right off the bat, you
have self-selected yourself

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.960
into a unique grouping.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.820
You also created
the technology that

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.970
makes it possible
for Eric over there

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.140
to look up the Powell
memo and actually read it

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.840
as Bob talked about it.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.690
And that's a huge part of where
we are at as a democracy today.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.960
People rely on what you
do to get information.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.450
Now, that's a little bit tragic.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.950
That's not a perfect scenario,
because you understand

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:28.410
that in a functioning
democracy, information on

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.070
ought to come from all sorts
of different directions.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.680
And people shouldn't have
to work particularly hard

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.120
to find out about
what's going on,

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.410
because despite the fact
that Eric looked up the memo

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.000
and got all his information,
by and large, most people still

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.620
get their information about
democracy from local television

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.880
news.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.180
Now, I'm not going to ask you
to watch your local television

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.090
news.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.570
That would be an unreasonable
request of any functioning

00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.340
human.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:05.350
But just for an experiment
tonight, if you get a chance,

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.710
pop it on and look at
what most Americans get

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:14.630
as the input of information
as regard to democracy.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.660
They're not even getting
sufficient information

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:21.210
to get them to know what
to Google to find out

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.440
more about their democracy.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.180
When they watch
their local evening

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.790
news, what they get in
most of this country

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:34.500
is weather, a lot of weather.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.570
In fact, the fact
of the matter is

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.030
I don't even
understand how you can

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.970
have weather reports
in California.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.307
But I have watched it here.

00:27:43.307 --> 00:27:44.390
No, I come from Wisconsin.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.360
We have weather.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.060
It's going to snow tonight.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.760
But if you watch the
local evening news,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.730
it begins with-- I don't
care what's going on.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.660
The government is shut
down, debt ceiling crisis,

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.040
death, grief, hate,
sorrow, whatever.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.550
They'll tell you something big.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.730
And then they'll
say, but first, we're

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.560
going to let you know
about the weather.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.610
And they will go to a very
handsome or attractive person

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.670
who will sit there
and say, well,

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.530
today we had a lot of weather.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.169
And I'll be back to tell you
more about it after the break.

00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:19.710
And then they go, and they give
a huge amount of commercials.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:24.190
And then they do the
smash and grab news

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.160
of the day-- death, death,
grief, sorrow, robbery,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.860
car crash, traffic jam, death,
death, grief, sorrow, robbery,

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.150
car crash, traffic jam.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.124
Most newscasts have about
27 stories mentioned.

00:28:37.124 --> 00:28:39.290
When we ask people, they
often say, oh, a newscaster

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.840
will probably do
three or four stories.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.340
No.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.070
They do about 27 hits.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.900
But it's all just reading
one line after another.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.690
And it's invariably
something horrible

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.860
going on someplace that makes
you really dislike and distrust

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.990
your neighbors.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.900
And so once they've got done
with that though jamming that

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.870
in, not enough time to cover
the school board or the city

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.870
council or the state
legislature, mind you.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.380
Then they get back
to the weather.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.820
And that's where they let loose.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.194
That's where you're going to
get your detailed and useful

00:29:07.194 --> 00:29:07.860
information.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.850
They're going to tell
you that in Mountain View

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.570
it was 73 degrees today.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.970
But up in South San
Francisco, it was 70.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.394
And over in Palo Alto, it was
71, if you can believe it.

00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:22.560
And then they're going to
go all through the region.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.056
You know this,
because one time you

00:29:24.056 --> 00:29:25.430
watched the locally
evening news.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.920
And so they go all around
with all that stuff.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.330
And then they give you
the barometric pressure,

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.470
which I've covered journalism.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.186
I've been a journalist
for 30 years.

00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:37.060
I've watched the evening
news in every place,

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:37.720
not just in this country.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.511
I've been in 25 countries
around the world.

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:41.950
I have no idea what
barometric pressure is.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.650
But I understand it's important.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.630
And they tell you all
about it every night.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.900
And then what do they do?

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.640
This is the important part.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.490
In the seven to
eight minutes devoted

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:57.950
to weather, they go, well,
over here across the Pacific,

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.240
around Thailand, there seems
to be a storm stirring up.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.410
And if the wind
blows the right way,

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:07.520
it might come up across the
Pacific and, I don't want,

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.004
in a couple weeks, we
might have some rain,

00:30:11.004 --> 00:30:11.920
because they did this.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.800
They look across the whole.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.550
They tell you a weather
patterns as stuff.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.040
And you're like, wow, this must
be the most important stuff

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.380
in my life.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.260
This must be what
really matters.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.250
As a citizen, I have to know
this in order to function.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.454
And then they throw in a
bunch more commercials.

00:30:26.454 --> 00:30:28.120
And then after the
bunch of commercials,

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.744
because you're there
with baited breath

00:30:29.744 --> 00:30:32.180
to know what the weather
will be tomorrow,

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.750
they go around the
whole map again.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.250
And they say, in
Palo Alto tomorrow,

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:40.620
it's very likely to be 73 and
up in South San Francisco, 71.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.290
But take a look at this.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.360
Mountain View is looking like
it might get to 75 tomorrow.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.360
We're not sure.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.600
But we'll be keeping
an eye on that.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.840
And so they've done seven, eight
minutes of this, seven, eight

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.600
minutes of the central place
where the average American gets

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.800
their information about politics
and governance on the weather.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.340
There's only one problem.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.490
The weather is free.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.570
The weather doesn't
require any journalism.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.190
The weather is created
by the government.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.710
I know.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.740
You're like, hold it.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.120
They invited another
nut into Google.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.620
No.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.950
The weather comes from the
National Weather Service.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.940
You, the taxpayers,
pay for the collection

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.250
of all that information.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.350
And the TV stations
get it for free.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.850
They don't pay for it.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.290
And so they give you seven or
eight minutes of no journalism.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.419
They don't even go out
and check the thermometer.

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:33.960
And then at the end
of that newscast,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.240
they say, well, you know
everything you need to know.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.040
Go out there and decide who
should be the President, who

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.650
should be your
senator, how we should

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.000
run our local governments,
how you should feel

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.350
about major issues
in this country.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.840
We have a journalism
stand-down in America.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.610
It is a crisis.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.622
Local TV is the main source.

00:31:51.622 --> 00:31:52.580
But look at newspapers.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.100
Newspapers in this
country have laid off

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.830
22,000 employees since 2009.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.560
And every one of
them blames Google.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.470
So just be aware that they all
are like, it's the internet.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.110
But you know what
the problem was?

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.100
I've got good news for Google.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.980
They were laying
them off before.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.480
The fact of the
matter is the crisis

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.710
in newspaper journalism
started in 1950.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:19.280
And we have had a steady decline
in the number of newspapers

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.540
in this country since the '50s.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.180
And it was television much
more than the internet

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.530
that caused this crisis.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.230
What the internet did
was take the ads away.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.620
And this is a big deal,
because journalism

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.940
in America for a long
time was sustained by ads.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.850
And everybody thought,
wow, what wonderful people.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.080
All those big companies, the
car companies and the soda

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.870
companies, they just
give all this money

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:48.570
to newspapers and television
and radio to sustain journalism.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.286
Well, it turns out, ironically
enough, they didn't.

00:32:51.286 --> 00:32:53.310
They gave that
money because that

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.350
was the vehicle by which
they could get to you.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.610
And so you got a newspaper.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.550
You looked at it.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.470
You didn't want to look at
the ad for the diapers but OK.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.030
Sp then the next thing--
that's how they sold stuff.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.580
TV the same way.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.500
It doesn't happen
that way anymore.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.540
That's not how it works.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.290
I get my little phone here,
even when I'm on Twitter.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.360
I was tweeting about
this incredible event.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.410
And I've got little ads
coming on Twitter now.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.390
The ads find me.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.270
You know this.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.520
I don't have to tell you this.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.450
The ads follow people around.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:28.510
The bottom line is
the ads don't go.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.620
The ads don't go in
the newspaper anymore.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.020
They don't go, by and
large, on TV anymore.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.040
And so you have this deep
decline in journalism.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.960
There is one set of
ads that do come in.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.632
One set of ads do come in.

00:33:41.632 --> 00:33:42.840
And that's the political ads.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.190
And you know why?

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.492
You're just a screwed up bunch.

00:33:46.492 --> 00:33:48.200
We've got a couple of
white-haired folks.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.970
And I love you.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.230
But by and large, you're
too young to vote.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:57.690
In this country, the voting
class is old people, quite old.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.120
That's why we can't
talk about anything

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.860
but social security
in this country,

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.170
because the fact of the
matter is our voting class

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.395
is overwhelmingly old.

00:34:05.395 --> 00:34:07.520
And people think just about
presidential elections.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.020
No.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.210
You've got to go down that
food chain into local politics.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.550
Bob talked about a 52% turnout.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.860
Well, 52%, 53% of our
voting age population,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.310
that's the mountaintop.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.219
You go into state
and local elections,

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.520
you start creeping down to
numbers that are in, literally,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.320
20%, 18%, 17%, 16%,
15%, 10% turnouts.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.440
We just elected Cory
Booker to the US Senate

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.570
from New Jersey in a
20% turnout election.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.670
That means if you met
five people on the street,

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.010
four of them didn't vote.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.192
Well, roughly half of them
voted for Cory Booker.

00:34:39.192 --> 00:34:41.650
That means he's going to the
United States Senate, the most

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.870
elite club in the
world with the support

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:47.969
of 10% of the electorate in the
state he's going to represent.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.929
So we've got this
huge stand-down.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:52.610
By and large, the people
who do vote are much older.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.420
They still watch that
television evening news.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.130
And so what do they get?

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.990
All the weather
they can possibly

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:04.660
use and then $6
billion worth of ads.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.740
I don't think I have to explain
to people as smart as you

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.290
that what that leaves us with
is in the ideal propaganda

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.060
circumstance, right?

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.330
No information.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.830
No information for
the voting class

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.700
that's of any
particular consequence

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.780
but a massive inflow of ads.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.020
And what do those ads do?

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.860
What do they tell people to do?

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.860
Don't vote.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.540
Imagine that
political ads are put

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.100
on TV to get people to vote.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.830
That's not the point,
because remember,

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.970
we have a small voting class.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.990
We have depressed our
voting class down.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.630
And as we talk about in
the book, in many races,

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.140
as much as 90% to 95%
of the ads are negative.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.560
And ask yourself this.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.860
I'm going to take
this guy right here.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.620
I'm going to say, you're
a sophisticated urban

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.580
intellectual, right?

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.584
You vote on a variety of
issues that concern you deeply.

00:36:01.584 --> 00:36:03.250
I'm going to make
assumptions about you.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.100
And I probably am wrong.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.790
But I'm going to assume you
believe that people have

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.530
the right to make
choices at what

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.920
they do with their own body.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.900
You believe that social
engineering by the right wing,

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.330
I don't want that.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.499
I'm not going to vote
for some right wing

00:36:19.499 --> 00:36:21.540
Rick Santorum for President
of the United States.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.415
That's just not where
I'm going, because I've

00:36:23.415 --> 00:36:24.460
got the cool glasses.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.340
That's not who I'm going to be.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.070
All right.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:27.570
Cool.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.800
So you see a negative
ad about the candidate

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.610
you decided to vote for.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.120
You're going to vote for
this progressive candidate.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.490
They're thinking liberally
on a whole bunch of things.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.370
You see a negative ad
about that candidate.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.280
And you're like,
well, that's it.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.630
I'm voting for the
social conservative.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.660
I'm going to vote
against everything

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.650
I believe in, because I saw a
negative ad about my candidate.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.349
That's not what happens.

00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:51.390
You see enough negative
ads about that candidate,

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.920
you say, a pox on
all their houses.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.360
I'm just not going to vote.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.810
And you stand down.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.390
We talk a lot in this country
about voter suppression,

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.360
about voter ID laws,
and about other efforts

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.730
to make it hard to vote.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.810
The number one voter
suppression in America

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.140
is negative ads, because
negative ads tell

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.460
tens of millions of Americans in
the primary place where they're

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.895
getting information about
politics still, don't vote.

00:37:17.895 --> 00:37:20.270
Don't vote for the candidate
that you wanted to vote for,

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.686
because it turns
out that they are

00:37:21.686 --> 00:37:25.440
the most evil
person in the world.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.260
We actually did
this for the book.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.950
We watched these ads.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.030
California, right?

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.700
They don't campaign
in California anymore,

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.290
because you guys have
figured things out.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.780
So bottom line is they go
to the handful of states

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.800
where they're like this
incredible creature,

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.090
the undecided voter.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.210
Many of them live in the
Midwest where I'm from.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.168
There are the kind of
people that can't decide.

00:37:47.168 --> 00:37:47.950
I don't know.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.320
Should I get up this morning?

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.420
And so the end result
is they pour these ads

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.290
into these states.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.500
They are really awful.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.290
They are unbelievably
troubling things.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:01.130
Slasher films.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.790
Nothing compared to this stuff.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.910
And so people are
inundated with this.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.610
And it tells them to
stand down from politics.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:08.780
It's a really serious issue.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.470
And this issue gets more
serious by the minute,

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:16.870
because in this country, we
have a bigger and bigger divide

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.940
between the handful of
engaged people, the people who

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.549
do-- they're like
Eric over here.

00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:22.590
They're looking stuff up.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.720
He's probably looking up the
turnout numbers right now.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.490
And so we have a handful
of hyper-engaged people.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:33.040
But then we have a growing
disconnect in this country.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.020
And it's why it is
possible for people

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.830
to shut down the government.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.750
It is why it is
possible for us to have

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.520
huge crises in Washington
about things that--

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.410
and you're a relatively
young guy here.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.660
I know this is
going to shock you.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.560
Old people like me,
when I was growing up,

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.780
I never knew there was such
a thing as a continuing

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.210
resolution.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.570
I never knew there was such
a thing as a debt ceiling.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.540
I didn't know about
government shutdown.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.010
I've covered politics forever.

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.480
I didn't know that.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.870
That never happened.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.180
Now, it's all we talk about.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.090
Why is it all we talk about?

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.150
Because when we
have depressed down

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.050
our political
participation, when

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.190
we have squeezed
information out of the game,

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.300
we create a game for
a handful of people,

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.290
a tiny number of
people, who participate

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.300
in gerrymandered
political circumstances.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.520
Remember, now, in
America, it's the opposite

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.360
of what we think about.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.180
Generally, voters
choose the candidates.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.220
In America, the candidates,
the politicians,

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.540
choose their districts.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.290
They choose their set of voters.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.294
So if you're a certain
Democrat, here's

00:39:41.294 --> 00:39:42.710
how we're going
to draw the lines.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.980
The legislature
of California has

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.146
tried to break some of that.

00:39:45.146 --> 00:39:47.240
But most of the country,
that's what they do.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.500
So the end result is
across this country

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.650
when you have a
Congress-- and remember,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.520
this Congress didn't
win, by the way.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.228
This is an important
thing to understand.

00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:59.600
Last year, 1.7
million more people

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.350
voted for Democrats for the
House of Representatives

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.684
than voted for Republicans.

00:40:03.684 --> 00:40:05.100
But because of the
gerrymandering,

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.630
because of structural flaws
in how we do our elections,

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.380
the Republicans have
control of the House,

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.320
not because more people
wanted them to, but because

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.040
of the structures of
how we do our politics.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.520
The end result is that those
people who are there, everybody

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.972
said, well, why don't the
Republicans stand down?

00:40:21.972 --> 00:40:22.930
Why don't they realize?

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.620
This is incredibly unpopular.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.680
The Gallup Poll just showed
that the Republican Party

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.150
has a lower approval
rating today

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.530
that at any time since
Gallup started polling

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.190
on the approval
of major parties.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.950
It's unbelievable.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:40.650
Ted Cruz is still saying,
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.490
And why?

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:46.620
Because they don't fear
November elections.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.020
They don't fear
the mass turnout.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.187
They've drawn the districts.

00:40:50.187 --> 00:40:51.394
They've structured the money.

00:40:51.394 --> 00:40:52.730
They've structured the politics.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.650
So the only problem they've
got is their primary.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.520
They don't want to be
challenged by somebody

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.920
who is more extreme
than they are.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.480
And so as a result, you
end up with a situation

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.380
where your entire politics,
the governance of the nation,

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.340
is defined by people
who are afraid of people

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.710
who are crazier than they are.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.650
That, I want to tell you,
is not a healthy democracy.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.060
Amazingly enough, this is not
what Jefferson and Madison

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.980
imagined back in 1787.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.050
And so as we approach
all these issues,

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.860
we realize we're not at
the full crisis point yet.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:32.970
We are moving rapidly toward
it, because this next election

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.440
cycle, we had $10 billion.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.020
And by the way, here's a little
something for Google to do.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.690
When we started the research
on this-- one of you

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.070
could do this, because I
have such reverence for you.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.250
One of you could do this.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:46.900
Do know that there's no
agency in America that

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.100
charts all the
money that's spent?

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:49.810
It's independent.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.950
The Federal Election Commission
doesn't begin to do it.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.366
Independent groupings do it
at the federal or state level.

00:41:54.366 --> 00:41:56.490
Nobody does it nationwide
what all is spent.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:57.860
We did it for our book.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.840
It was incredibly hard.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.000
It took the better
part of the year.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.240
We went state by state,
community by community.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.870
What we saw was huge amounts of
money flooded into local races,

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.390
where you get the most power,
where you decide on zoning,

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.250
where you decide on delivery of
services and things like that.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.980
A San Jose race where they
spent half million dollars

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.820
for a city council seat.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.400
California referendums.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.750
Last year in
California, $550 million

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.722
was spent on referendums in
California, these initiatives,

00:42:22.722 --> 00:42:24.180
particularly that
tell you that you

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.190
don't want to know whether your
food is genetically modified.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.950
And so the end result
of this is that we

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:33.670
come into this situation in a
very troubling point, the point

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:36.620
where it could get a lot worse.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:42.060
And what we propose is to think
like you folks think I hope.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.360
I hope I'm not making too
much of an assumption.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.460
And that is you don't
look at a problem

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.840
from the standpoint of
what everybody's done up

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.700
to this point to
solve the problem.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.620
You don't narrow your options.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.080
You say, how do
we fix the crisis?

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.660
What we need to do in America
is do massive interventions

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.990
in how we communicate.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.850
We have to figure out
how to democratize

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.680
the flow of information,
so that working

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.420
class people, the mom who
works at a Wendy's window

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.560
and then has to go
home and put three kids

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.550
to sleep and then has
to go out that night

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.190
and work at the
McDonald's window,

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.770
how she gets enough
information to be

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.610
a participant in
our democratic life,

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.650
how it is not cut
off from her and all

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.170
she sees is negative ads.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.022
So we have to think
a lot about that.

00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:28.730
But we also have to
think a lot about how

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.590
to renew our democracy.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.500
And this is big deal stuff.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.300
We have to amend
our constitution.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.850
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.380
I know when somebody says,
amend the Constitution, you say,

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.160
that's impossible.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.560
It's never been done.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.150
The Constitution was written
in stone, handed down

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.980
on tablets to Michele Bachmann.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:50.580
And it's never been altered,
well, except for 27 times.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.360
27 times we've amended
our Constitution.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.680
The founders amended it
10 times in the first four

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.470
years of the Republic.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:00.470
And then about a decade later,
when the vice president shot

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.110
the secretary of
the treasury, they

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:04.000
decided to amend
it again to pick

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.100
a different way of
getting vice presidents.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.050
And so we've amended
the Constitution

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.960
throughout our
history as a country.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:15.540
We have amended it most often
to make our democracy work.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.770
Everybody loves the New Deal.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:18.110
We talk about Roosevelt.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.600
One of the lost realities
of the New Deal era

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.142
was at the start of
the New Deal era,

00:44:22.142 --> 00:44:23.933
they did two amendments
to the Constitution

00:44:23.933 --> 00:44:25.260
that no one ever talks about.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.480
Eric can look them up.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.280
And the one amendment said that
when a president is elected,

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.800
instead of being sworn
in in the spring,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.310
he's sworn in in January.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:35.534
That moved the process down.

00:44:35.534 --> 00:44:37.950
Remember we talked, some of
the older folks will remember,

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.810
the story of Roosevelt's
first 100 days.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:44.050
We made possible the
meaning of a first 100 days

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.192
by collapsing in the
time between the election

00:44:46.192 --> 00:44:47.400
and when he became president.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.160
That was huge.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.743
The other thing we did was say
that the Congress of the United

00:44:50.743 --> 00:44:54.450
States met immediately
in January, rather than

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:55.769
deep into the next year.

00:44:55.769 --> 00:44:57.810
Previously, before that,
the way the Constitution

00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:59.660
was structured,
Congress was elected.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.270
The people who were
elected did not

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.900
come in to sit until
well into the next year.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.680
As a result, those who
had been defeated actually

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.920
governed for the better part
of a year after the election.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.310
We changed these things to
make our democracy work.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:14.280
And we did a lot
of other changes.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.999
We gave women the right to vote.

00:45:15.999 --> 00:45:18.040
After the Civil War, we
gave African American men

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.510
the right to vote.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.680
We gave Native Americans
the right to vote.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.540
In 1962, in the lifetime of
some people in this room,

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.534
we struck down the
wealth barrier to voting

00:45:26.534 --> 00:45:27.200
in this country.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.320
We banned the poll tax
constitutionally in 1962.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.350
1970 we said that people
who are 18 to 21 years old,

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.120
who go off and fight
in wars, get drafted

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.620
to die in foreign
lands, ought to be

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.740
able to vote in the elections
that would determine

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.320
whether we fight those wars.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.420
We have amended our Constitution
again and again and again

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.370
in this country to repair the
problems of our democracy.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:54.900
And the great gap today is that
because our media is so bad,

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.050
because it doesn't
cover politics,

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.010
our media covers Washington.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.200
It covers dysfunction
in Washington.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.930
Most people don't
know that we are

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:04.930
in another
constitutional moment.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:08.830
16 American states have
formally petitioned the Congress

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.700
of the United States to overturn
the Citizens United ruling

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.470
and to say corporations
are not people.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:16.674
Money is not speech.

00:46:16.674 --> 00:46:18.340
And we the citizens
of the United States

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.430
have a right to form elections
in which the vote matters more

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.230
than the dollar.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.530
16 American states
have already done this.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:28.829
500 communities across the
country have done this.

00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:30.370
Los Angeles did it
earlier this year.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:31.540
San Francisco has
already done it.

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.720
I wouldn't be surprised if
Mountain View has done it.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.261
But the fact of the
matter is there's

00:46:35.261 --> 00:46:39.060
this huge cry across this
country to make the change.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.070
And the interesting
thing is it's not just

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:42.690
Democrats and liberals.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.852
The fact of the matter
is everybody gets this.

00:46:44.852 --> 00:46:46.810
Last year, they put a
referendums on the ballot

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.100
in Montana and in Colorado.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.760
Colorado was an Obama state.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.370
Montana was a Romney state.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.140
They had a referendum on a
Constitutional amendment.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.610
Each state voted roughly
73% in favor of doing it.

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.320
Republican members
of legislatures

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.320
across this country have
worked with Democrats

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.340
to encourage this.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.840
Recently we got the
first Republican

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.190
in Congress, Walter Jones, a
deep passionate conservative

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.100
from the Carolinas,
to sign on and say,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.910
we need this
constitutional amendment.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:16.540
Because if we don't
make democracy changes

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.840
to our Constitution, as hard
as it is with all the barriers

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.510
that are out there, we cannot
begin to structure the money

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:26.427
out, and to structure
the people in.

00:47:26.427 --> 00:47:27.510
So that's the bottom line.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.841
I come and ask you think
of yourselves as founders.

00:47:30.841 --> 00:47:32.215
Think of yourselves
as people who

00:47:32.215 --> 00:47:34.870
want to shape an actual
democracy in this country.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.200
And then because of
your special genius,

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.830
think of yourselves
as people who

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.530
can help to form a communication
system in this country that

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.700
makes sure everybody
can vote and everybody

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:45.980
can cast an informed vote.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:46.640
Big deal stuff.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.650
We're glad to be with you today.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:48.400
Thank you so much.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:55.252
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:55.252 --> 00:47:56.820
MODERATOR: Mic
here for questions.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.420
AUDIENCE: Madison native, former
writer for the "Simpson Street

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:00.935
Free Press."

00:48:00.935 --> 00:48:01.695
JOHN NICHOLS: No way.

00:48:01.695 --> 00:48:02.500
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.160
JOHN NICHOLS: All
right, brother.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.330
How old are you?

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.115
AUDIENCE: I'm 28.

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:08.069
JOHN NICHOLS: So you probably
were wandering around the "Cap

00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:09.610
Times" newsroom
sometimes trying to--

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:10.240
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.047
Evjue Foundation.

00:48:11.047 --> 00:48:11.880
JOHN NICHOLS: Evjue.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.931
AUDIENCE: Evjue, sorry.

00:48:14.931 --> 00:48:16.950
I actually first saw you
speak at the Fighting

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:20.270
Bob Fest in Baraboo
12 years ago.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:23.140
JOHN NICHOLS: The rest
of you can leave now.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.500
AUDIENCE: This is Wisconsin
progressive trivia for you.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.150
My question centers
more around media.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:31.400
So with Bezos purchasing the
"Washington Post" and it's

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.060
been an onset Pierre
Omidyar is launching

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:38.200
this huge $250 million
project in conjunction

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.134
with some former
"Guardian" reporters--

00:48:41.134 --> 00:48:42.550
JOHN NICHOLS: With
Glenn Greenwald

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.814
who did the NSA stuff,
perhaps with Jeremy Scahill,

00:48:44.814 --> 00:48:46.980
my colleague from "The
Nation" and some other folks.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:51.050
AUDIENCE: So a lot of what you
guys just spoke about centers

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.210
around what has
happened to media,

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:56.870
how newsrooms have been gutted.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:59.400
Folks that rely on
their 5 o'clock news

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.300
aren't getting the news that
we would like them to get.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.162
How do you see media changing?

00:49:04.162 --> 00:49:05.370
You guys have an inside view.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.240
And I'm really
curious to see what

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.980
do the next 5 to 20
years of media look like?

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:15.570
And what do you think,
especially a long-term tech

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.430
vision, can bring
to an industry that

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.922
has been so depleted
by market forces?

00:49:21.922 --> 00:49:23.630
JOHN NICHOLS: I will
let Bob do this one.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:27.350
But before I do, you've just
asked, literally, the top media

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.474
scholar in the world to do like
a minute on the future media.

00:49:31.474 --> 00:49:32.890
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY:
Real quickly.

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.110
John talked about this.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.630
The reason why Jeff Bezos was
able to buy "The Washington

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:40.454
Post" for $250 million when Hedy
wanted to buy it 10 years ago,

00:49:40.454 --> 00:49:41.870
it would have cost
him $6 billion,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.210
is that the market
has determined

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.730
that commercial journalism
is no longer profitable.

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:49.188
And the reason for that is what
John started talking about.

00:49:49.188 --> 00:49:51.370
Advertising online no longer
has to support content.

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.703
It's been detached from content.

00:49:52.703 --> 00:49:54.590
And journalism for
the last 100 years

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.520
received between 50% and 100% of
its revenues from advertising.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.840
Well, online you place
your ads through networks.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.130
The website gets far less
percentage of the revenue

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:03.180
than it used to.

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.970
In 2003, a newspaper website
got 100% of its ad revenue

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:07.900
from its advertising.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.050
By 2010, it was down to 20%.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.325
Today it's under 10%.

00:50:11.325 --> 00:50:13.640
And it's approaching
0% like a parabola.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.490
So there's not a
commercial market left,

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.740
which is why Bezos got
it for such little money.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.100
In our view, to sum
up really quickly,

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.250
this is a fundamental political
issue for this country.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.700
How are we going to have the
resources to have competing

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.540
independent newsrooms covering
our communities drawing us

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.390
into public life?

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.320
And it's a political issue,
because the market has voted.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.920
And the solution,
in our view, is

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.520
by looking at how other
democracies address it,

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.620
in Europe and East
Asia, and also

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.180
how the United States addressed
it the 100 years before we

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.855
had advertising provide
the lion's share of support

00:50:43.855 --> 00:50:46.230
of journalism, when we had
the greatest free press

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:47.530
system in the world.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.850
And what we had then were
massive postal and printing

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.402
subsidies which spawned this
incredible press system.

00:50:52.402 --> 00:50:53.860
And what we find
in other countries

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.720
is enlightened policies in
places like Germany, Denmark,

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.790
Norway, and Sweden that spawn
an independent, uncensored free

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:04.544
press and also supports diverse
newspapers in communities too.

00:51:04.544 --> 00:51:06.460
I'm not saying we should
adopt their policies.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.930
But we have to start
having that discussion,

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:10.612
because the market
will not generate

00:51:10.612 --> 00:51:11.570
independent journalism.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.462
That has been voted by the
marketplace emphatically.

00:51:14.462 --> 00:51:16.170
JOHN NICHOLS: And let
me just to come off

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.320
that for one other thing.

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:22.750
And I'm going to go whack job
libertarian on you here, OK?

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.300
Because in our book,
we talk about a lot

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.544
of different fixes for media.

00:51:26.544 --> 00:51:27.710
And I do recommend the book.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.440
It makes a fun holiday gift.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.440
But to cut to the chase, one
of the best ideas we've seen

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.680
came from an economist
named Dean Baker.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.635
And he said, look, the
underpinning of democracy

00:51:40.635 --> 00:51:41.790
is information.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:43.810
An informed vote
is what matters.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:47.270
It's not just a vote to make
you just rubber stamping stuff.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.172
That's not the point.

00:51:48.172 --> 00:51:49.380
You have to have information.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:54.710
It's so important that we ought
to give every American $100

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.770
credit or tax write-off
that they can direct

00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:59.930
to any independent
not-for-profit media

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.990
at the local, state,
or national level.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.990
And they can make the choices.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.292
They can sustain media.

00:52:06.292 --> 00:52:08.500
Other countries actually
experiment with this, Sweden

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.769
and others, where they
look at some of these tax

00:52:10.769 --> 00:52:12.810
credits, other models
where you can support media

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:14.219
that you regard well.

00:52:14.219 --> 00:52:16.260
At in fact, the United
States experiments with it

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.410
all the time.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:21.920
We allow billionaires
and stock speculators

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.860
to write off their subscription
to the "Wall Street Journal,"

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.020
because it's considered
vital information

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.380
for your economic life.

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.690
You can write it right off.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:31.860
Academics can write
off the journals

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.840
that they read for
their academic work.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.200
Citizens can't write off
their support for media.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.650
We think an idea
like that, which

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:43.010
we build a left-right
coalition, we would hope,

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.650
would be a good way to start.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:47.000
And then you ask us.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.470
We actually were thrilled
to come to Google,

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.280
because we want you
people genuinely

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.070
to start to think
about how to do this.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.810
But we will tell you there
is a political part to this.

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:58.390
You have to recognize that.

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:00.980
And one of the best ways, one
of the best models for it,

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.150
is to say, why don't you
create great ideas for how

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:08.310
to do all this and let us create
a model where citizens can then

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:12.444
sustain, in a very open free
way, the journalism they like?

00:53:12.444 --> 00:53:14.110
You're sitting, by
the way, down the row

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:18.230
from Craig Aaron, who is the
president and CEO of Free

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:19.920
Press, the group
that we co-founded.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.070
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: He's
working on these issues.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:23.319
JOHN NICHOLS: And Free Press
works on all these issues

00:53:23.319 --> 00:53:24.070
all the time.

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:27.520
And so I would recommend
check out their website.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.210
Throw out the things
you don't like.

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:31.040
Don't buy into the
things you don't like.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.460
But explore these ideas,
because we genuinely

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.320
need a lot of smart people
in the mix of figuring out

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.890
how we create a communication
system that sustains democracy.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.610
AUDIENCE: So many
fascinating issues.

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.050
We could talk for hours
about all of them, I'm sure.

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:45.716
The one I wanted to
ask you about though

00:53:45.716 --> 00:53:48.620
was the 28th Amendment
that you're proposing.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.650
I totally share your values
and objectives there.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:54.820
Yet I do remain a little bit
skeptical about the limitation

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.450
on using money.

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:59.530
This is the way that people
speak in this country

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:00.200
oftentimes.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.090
And there were
issues where I agree

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:05.840
with the funding, a
billionaire coming in,

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.100
whether it's Larry or
Sergei funding something

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.300
on a carbon tax.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.660
So I'm wondering why
not have a thing where

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.850
you do the first part
of it, where you say,

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:18.950
only entities that can vote in
this election can contribute.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:21.790
Any person who can vote
can contribute unlimitedly

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:22.457
with disclosure.

00:54:22.457 --> 00:54:24.040
And I know the Supreme
Court is trying

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.530
to fight some of the
disclosure parts of this.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.400
What would be the
problem with that?

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.140
It seems to me that that
preserves free speech, as well

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:34.340
as freedom of association,
that I think are very vital.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:38.900
And footnote, our values
are winning actually.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.390
If you read things
like "Victory Lab,"

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.640
we can spend the money better.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.310
So why would we want
from a utilitarian point

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:46.477
of view unilaterally disarm?

00:54:46.477 --> 00:54:48.434
JOHN NICHOLS: Let me take
a quick piece of that

00:54:48.434 --> 00:54:49.610
and let Bob take it.

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:51.630
Eric, I love you.

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:52.301
You're the man.

00:54:52.301 --> 00:54:54.050
You were looking up
the Powell memo there.

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:54.790
Come on.

00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:58.410
And you're doing exactly
what we want you to do.

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.641
When we come out, we don't
specify a specific amendment.

00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:03.766
We actually think there
are several amendments that

00:55:03.766 --> 00:55:04.500
ought to be done.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.410
We think a Supreme
Court that tells you

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:08.760
that money should flow
easily into politics,

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.970
but it should be hard to vote
is wrong on several counts.

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:13.980
So we would like to not
only do an amendment

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.170
as regards to the
money, we would also

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:16.190
like to do an
amendment that says,

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:17.898
everybody has a right
to vote and a right

00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:19.290
to have that vote counted.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:21.830
But what you've just done
is exactly what we want.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:25.480
You are talking about how you
would sculpt that amendment.

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.730
And the fact of the
matter is every amendment

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:30.330
to the Constitution of
any consequence has not

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:33.540
come about wholly
formed at the beginning.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:37.136
It ends up with people starting
to think about the idea,

00:55:37.136 --> 00:55:38.760
thinking about what
they want to render

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.400
and what they want to defend,
and making something real.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.750
And so I don't disregard
a lot of what you say.

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:46.870
Although Bob may toss
you off completely.

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:49.970
But what I will tell you
is that kind of engagement

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:51.010
is where we have to be.

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:53.980
Our problem in America is we're
not having those discussions.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.350
We're not talking about
how to structurally make

00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:57.260
this thing work.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.210
And a final thing
I'll tell you about

00:55:58.210 --> 00:55:59.293
constitutional amendments.

00:55:59.293 --> 00:56:00.750
This is a big deal.

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:03.050
When you talk about a
constitutional amendment,

00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:05.950
you don't always have to
get it to fix the problem.

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:07.630
This is the interesting thing.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.342
When we had the Equal
Rights Amendment,

00:56:10.342 --> 00:56:11.800
the women in the
room will be aware

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.960
that it's not been enacted.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.940
We don't have an Equal Rights
Amendment to our Constitution.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.870
But the multi-year fight to
get an Equal Rights Amendment

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:22.270
helped to open the
door for Title IX,

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:26.380
for workplace protections for
women, for Lilly Ledbetter Act,

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.560
and a host of other
breakthroughs.

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.050
On the right and the left,
a constitutional amendment

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:34.630
strategy does not have
to be completed in order

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:37.460
to begin to address the
crisis along the way.

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:40.519
But if you don't shoot big,
if you don't go for something

00:56:40.519 --> 00:56:42.060
to say, this is such
a serious issue,

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.470
we have to talk
about it in this way,

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.511
you don't possibly get to
the incremental changes

00:56:45.511 --> 00:56:46.344
along the way.

00:56:46.344 --> 00:56:47.760
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY:
Well, I think

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.969
the problem with
unlimited spending

00:56:49.969 --> 00:56:51.260
is what I talked about already.

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:51.930
I won't repeat it.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.340
There's a difference
between a small spending

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.560
and a large spending.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.960
And the other problem is that
it also reinforces the idea

00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.600
that politics is
for billionaires

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.970
and really wealthy people.

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:02.477
And we get to be spectators.

00:57:02.477 --> 00:57:04.560
If you have money, you can
buy in and be a player.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.760
If you don't, you just
hope that your team wins.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.052
You root for the billionaire
you most agree with.

00:57:09.052 --> 00:57:10.760
And I don't think
that's a healthy thing.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.030
I think that we look at
how other democracies that

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.790
are much more successful by
all the criteria, whoever

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:19.950
makes them, wealthy people have
a lot of influence in society.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:23.190
They don't need
to buy elections.

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:24.220
They can start groups.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.780
They can do education campaigns.

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.850
There's lots of ways they
can influence politics

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:29.060
if that's their goal.

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.634
The election process should
be kept, as much as possible,

00:57:31.634 --> 00:57:32.550
a level playing field.

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.100
That really is
mandatory for democracy

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.240
to be credible and succeed.

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.232
And that's what we've
lost in this country.

00:57:38.232 --> 00:57:40.440
Now, your other point though
I completely agree with.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.984
The premise of our book
is that this is not

00:57:42.984 --> 00:57:43.900
a reactionary country.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.320
This is not a dumb country.

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.352
This is not a
country that buys in.

00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:49.560
The great tension here is
when we go around to talks,

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.730
this is the smallest room
we've played in 40 talks.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:53.550
People get it.

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:54.300
They're concerned.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:56.350
This is a progressive country.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:58.470
Young people, in
particular, are really

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:01.060
queued in that we've got to
change this governing system.

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.430
It's not working.

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:04.730
And that's why
we're so optimistic.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.250
And I think the
key point I would

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.690
close with as we're getting
near the witching hour

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:12.460
is that it's striking that
in the last five years

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.630
this great movement has been
on two fronts politically.

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:17.860
One is to unleash the
power of unlimited money

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.350
by the wealthiest
institutions and individuals.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.877
On the other hand, the
Supreme Court has worked hard

00:58:22.877 --> 00:58:24.460
and state governments
have worked hard

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.126
to make it harder and harder for
poor people and people of color

00:58:27.126 --> 00:58:30.125
to vote, literally reenacting
Jim Crow statutes now

00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:31.360
in five Southern states.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.550
Something that is obscene.

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:34.930
It would've been
illegal two years ago.

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:37.490
The reason why they're doing
that, making it easy for money

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:39.380
to flood elections, making
it harder for poor people

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.840
to get to the
polls, is they know

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.240
they can't win a fair election.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.600
That system is
really that fragile.

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.764
We just need to organize.

00:58:46.764 --> 00:58:47.430
And we will win.

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:49.570
We need to recognize that we
have the numbers on our side.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:51.030
We have the wind at our sails.

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.360
They're a dying system.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.696
That's what they're doing
this monkey in Congress, where

00:58:54.696 --> 00:58:56.320
they're trying to
stall the government.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.510
Any of the issues they're
trying to push through

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:00.170
would never pass a fair test.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:01.810
So they've got to close the
government down, put a gun

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:04.040
at the head, and say, you
give us our way or we shoot,

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.310
because the know if they
have to put it to a vote,

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.110
they would lose.

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:08.115
They can only do
it by blackmail.

00:59:08.115 --> 00:59:12.150
AUDIENCE: So given the amount
of money that goes into

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:18.030
or the fact that news
sources are so often funded

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.613
by large groups, large
individuals, people

00:59:20.613 --> 00:59:22.983
with a lot of money
and whatnot, do

00:59:22.983 --> 00:59:25.780
you have any recommendations
for either news sources or ways

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:28.480
to determine that the news
sources you're listening to

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.030
aren't simply
giving you the news

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:33.930
that someone with a lot of power
and/or money wants you to know?

00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:36.360
JOHN NICHOLS: Well, let me
begin by saying, of course,

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:41.040
you could just Google a
good news source, right?

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:41.900
I'm teasing.

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:45.139
AUDIENCE: So the
problem is, sure, you

00:59:45.139 --> 00:59:46.055
can find news sources.

00:59:46.055 --> 00:59:46.979
But you don't know--

00:59:46.979 --> 00:59:48.520
JOHN NICHOLS: That's
what I'm saying.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.212
But that's what
people actually do.

00:59:50.212 --> 00:59:52.170
Poor people across America,
they're like, well,

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:53.340
I've got to find something.

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.760
And unfortunately
what they end up with

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.600
isn't always as
genius as Google is.

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.850
They don't always end up
with the perfect news source.

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:02.760
And so the answer
to the question

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.590
is diversity and
encountering voices.

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:08.600
We get this question
everywhere we go.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.520
And the first thing I
always tell people is,

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.170
read something that you
really disagree with a lot.

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:13.670
I'm serious.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.950
I write for "The
Nation" magazine.

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:20.199
Our equivalent is arguably
"National Review,"

01:00:20.199 --> 01:00:21.490
the very conservative magazine.

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:23.820
I read "National
Review" all the time.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.100
It's pretty well written.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.570
I think they've become a little
bit more scared of their base.

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:31.260
But the bottom line is I still
read them on a regular basis.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.090
And I find it very important.

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.840
I read a lot of
conservative publications,

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.050
because I think that
helps to inform me.

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.876
I also read international
publications,

01:00:37.876 --> 01:00:40.250
because I want to read about
America from the perspective

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.470
that other people see it.

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:43.644
So I go to "The Guardian"
a lot in Britain.

01:00:43.644 --> 01:00:45.060
I think they're
very, very useful.

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.100
I go to a lot of the
German publications, which

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.950
have great English language
translation, because I'm not

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:52.330
the best German speaker.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:55.355
And the bottom line
is that when you

01:00:55.355 --> 01:00:57.230
start to read about how
other people see you,

01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.021
it starts to give you
a lot of perspective.

01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:02.600
I happen to like "Deutsche
Welle." "Der Spiegel's," I

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.020
think, coverage of the US
is actually quite good.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.590
And so go for all that.

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:09.244
But this is the conundrum.

01:01:09.244 --> 01:01:10.660
So I hope that
helps a little bit.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.576
But the question you ask
gets to the conundrum

01:01:12.576 --> 01:01:14.710
of what we're talking
about, because all

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.760
across America-- I don't
care who we're with.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.410
I don't care if we're in a
church basement or union hall

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:21.890
or in Google or
wherever we're at,

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:24.890
people say, how do I figure
out what I can trust?

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.780
Well, the answer
to that question

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.650
is, you can't trust anybody.

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.760
What you can trust
is a diverse system

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.755
that gives you a lot of
different perspectives.

01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:35.130
And then you search
through that.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:37.410
You find things
that, ultimately,

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:39.430
touch you that mean
something to you.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.590
And then you use all of that.

01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:44.370
But increasingly in
America, people are getting

01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:48.130
a one-size-fits-all bit of
news that is more likely to be

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:52.205
defined by a negative campaign
ad than by a detailed smart bit

01:01:52.205 --> 01:01:53.122
of coverage.

01:01:53.122 --> 01:01:54.830
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY:
Just to add to that.

01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:59.450
The sort of partisanization
this of news in America,

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.090
especially cable
news, is directly

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.180
a function of the
lack of journalism,

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:07.060
because this is actually Rupert
Murdoch's brilliant business

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.770
move what he did with Fox News.

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:10.660
It wasn't that he said,
let's have a channel

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.576
that will simply
give the Republican

01:02:12.576 --> 01:02:13.950
Party talking
points every night.

01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:15.160
So if you want to know
what they're thinking,

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.370
you can go to this channel.

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:18.661
Instead, he said, if I don't
have any journalists, if I

01:02:18.661 --> 01:02:21.590
don't cover anything, if I
don't have a news room, what can

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:23.300
I do to make people
come to my channel?

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.300
Well, you give them opinions.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.880
You give them ideologies.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.480
So he hired
charismatic presenters

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.280
to present the talking points.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.230
And it's very inexpensive to do.

01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:34.710
John does cable
news all the time.

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:37.760
There are no reporters or
people covering anything there.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.140
You've got producers
and bookers.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.160
But they don't do
any journalism.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.660
They just give
you talking points

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.890
on the issues of the day.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.030
And this reinforces
the sense that people

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:47.990
are going into their
self-defined little cubby

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.180
holes.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.055
They're not seeing what
the rest of the world

01:02:50.055 --> 01:02:52.070
sees, because I would
read "National Review."

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:54.280
I subscribe to "The Economist"
and "Financial Times."

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.190
They are core reading for me.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:57.732
But I go to Fox News.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.190
And after three
minutes, I'm bored.

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:00.981
I know the Republican
Party talking points.

01:03:00.981 --> 01:03:03.529
They aren't educating me
on any interesting ideas.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:05.820
And I suspect a conservative
would go to MSNBC and feel

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.585
the same way, not
to pick on MSNBC.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:10.710
JOHN NICHOLS: When you and
I'm on, it's quite good.

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.100
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: When
John's on, it's different.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.929
But if we had
substantive reporting,

01:03:13.929 --> 01:03:16.345
I think that issue about people
being in their cubby holes

01:03:16.345 --> 01:03:18.006
would disappear,
because I remember

01:03:18.006 --> 01:03:19.880
this wasn't an issue 30
or 40 years ago, when

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.720
we had much more
substantial reporting

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.970
across the political spectrum.

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.660
And it was routine
that people on the left

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.576
would read conservative
and conservative left.

01:03:26.576 --> 01:03:27.730
It wasn't considered weird.

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:28.970
Today, it's sort of
weird if you watch

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:30.810
Fox News for any length of
time for any of my friends,

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.630
you think, what are
you badgering yourself

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:34.654
with this idiocy
for, to be blunt.

01:03:34.654 --> 01:03:36.070
JOHN NICHOLS: To
popcorn off this,

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.010
I'll give you one final point.

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:38.520
I was once traveling
from Jerusalem

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.717
to Bethlehem on a
Palestinian bus.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.300
This kid is sitting
next to me, and he

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:46.710
had three newspapers
on his lap--

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:50.570
or six newspapers-- three Hebrew
language papers, three Arabic

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:51.840
language papers.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.490
And he's 15, 16 years old.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:56.110
I said, what's up
with that, man?

01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:57.047
Are you a paper boy?

01:03:57.047 --> 01:03:57.880
And he said, no, no.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.256
I try to read them
all every day,

01:03:59.256 --> 01:04:01.338
because I'm trying to
figure out this whole thing.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.050
I mean we've got this
thing with the Jews

01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:05.130
and the Palestinians
and the Christians.

01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:07.780
And I want to get it right.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.210
Well, I love that kid, right?

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:11.954
That's what we're
supposed to do.

01:04:11.954 --> 01:04:14.370
And actually, what you folks
do, when you Google something

01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.080
and you get a lot
of articles up,

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.999
that's a very good
model of that.

01:04:18.999 --> 01:04:20.540
But the bottom line
is, again, I want

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.115
to emphasize the people who
are doing that, that kid was

01:04:23.115 --> 01:04:26.710
a self-selected-- he's probably
in the Palestinian parliament

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:31.130
today or whatever or maybe
the Israeli parliament.

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:35.450
But the bottom line
is that most Americans

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:37.755
are rushing through their
lives very, very fast.

01:04:37.755 --> 01:04:39.090
It's faster than ever.

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:41.740
And they're getting little
snippets of information.

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.970
And unfortunately, the
constant information

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:46.450
they get on politics
repeated again and again

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:51.450
is the negative ad 100
times, 1,000 times.

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:53.560
In some media
markets, you can see

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.330
ads for a particular candidate
as much as 2,000 or 3,000 times

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.340
before an election.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.730
You're going to remember that.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:02.990
You're not going to remember
a little quick newscast.

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:06.301
AUDIENCE: I really enjoyed your
previous book, "Our Media."

01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:07.300
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: Oh.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.215
That's an oldy.

01:05:08.215 --> 01:05:10.500
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about this claim

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.410
that the political advertising
is reducing participation

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:18.860
because it also draws out
the fringes, at least that's

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.690
what they say in the media.

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:25.070
But the question I have
is about the hypothesis

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:28.890
that really previously
we had either newspapers

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.590
or we had three big networks.

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:32.180
And everyone got
all of their news

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.790
from the national
and then the local,

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:37.170
during the '70s
when I was a kid.

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:40.100
And now, it's fractured into all
of these specialized networks

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.890
that echo your preferences.

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:46.720
So before people were
educated because they

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.230
had no other outlets
and so they were stuck

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:53.790
with a more broad presentation
of the issues of the day,

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:55.750
and now they don't
have that, so there

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.560
are things like "Democracy
Now" that does great reporting

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.520
but has a very small readership,
I guess, or audience.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.100
So it seems like you have
to get the news, good news,

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.380
adjacent to how people are
living their busy lives.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.110
So that seems like
a bigger problem,

01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:13.040
even though we should
fix campaign finance.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.560
JOHN NICHOLS: Believe
me, we wrote this book

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.907
to not make that division.

01:06:16.907 --> 01:06:18.490
To say, we've got
to fix our politics.

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:20.365
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: Media
right in the middle of it.

01:06:20.365 --> 01:06:21.850
JOHN NICHOLS: But
one of the things I

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.145
do, and I didn't do it here
because I didn't get here

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:23.776
in time.

01:06:23.776 --> 01:06:25.150
I often go when
I come to a town,

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:28.190
and I go to an antique store.

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.260
They have stacks of the
old papers from the town.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.521
And I get the local daily
paper from 50 years ago.

01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:35.020
And I just hold it
up to the people.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.644
And we would go
through the front page.

01:06:36.644 --> 01:06:38.120
We go through a
couple pages of it.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.200
People's jaws drop, because
local daily newspapers

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.590
50 years ago, the range
of things they covered

01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:47.050
would blow your mind.

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:49.320
They had three or four
pages of international news.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.110
Even in the local paper
in Palo Alto or San Jose,

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:56.290
they had news from states
around the country.

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:58.540
I was in Duluth,
Minnesota, once.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.600
And I picked up a paper.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.400
It had a Ralph Nader press
conference from 50 years

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.760
ago or roughly 50 years ago.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.200
It had civil rights stuff.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.140
It had labor stuff,
all this stuff.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.660
Well, we have squeezed
it down to such an extent

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.010
that it isn't just
that they had three

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:17.540
networks and their local
paper in those days.

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.230
The institutions actually gave
them a lot of information.

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:24.210
It was considered the
way that you did it.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.080
And people also got magazines.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.080
Do you know what I mean?

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.970
They had many sources.

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:31.990
Today, we have much more
access to information.

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:37.630
But in the cacophony, we
don't have that easy access

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:39.790
where you live and
in your community,

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:41.589
because that local
paper that I pick up,

01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:43.880
in addition to all that global
stuff and all that stuff

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.560
from around the country,
also had a reporter who

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.610
was tasked every day to
go cover the school board,

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:54.570
a reporter tasked every day
to go cover the city council.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.960
When you read
through that paper,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.070
you knew what was happening
in your community.

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:02.630
And today, it is
very hard, if you

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:05.260
live in a suburb
around San Francisco,

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.200
to know what's happening
in your community,

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.110
unless some desperate citizen
blogger is out there doing

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:11.710
the game.

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:14.001
But the only problem with
that is the desperate citizen

01:08:14.001 --> 01:08:18.827
blogger might not actually be
trying to give the full story.

01:08:18.827 --> 01:08:20.910
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: The
crucial point here again,

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:23.479
not to be Johnny One
Note, is that we've

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:24.960
lost resources to journalism.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.300
And I think that resources to
journalism, people get paid.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.760
They're responsible for a beat.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.350
There are competing
journalists covering it.

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:33.433
So if someone misses it,
someone else will get it.

01:08:33.433 --> 01:08:35.830
So there's that
spur of competition.

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:37.149
We've lost that.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.547
And I've made a career of
being critical of the type

01:08:39.547 --> 01:08:41.880
of journalism we came out of,
as you know from our media

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.390
and not theirs.

01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:45.160
And the problem is
that I think we've

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.850
had a tendency to look at
old media versus new media.

01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:51.302
And there's a split there, when
that's an irrelevant concern.

01:08:51.302 --> 01:08:52.760
They are really
these concerns that

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.170
are using different
technologies at this point.

01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:57.890
And the great crisis is
that on the digital realm

01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:00.380
with advertising no longer
supporting journalism,

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.149
there aren't the
resources for journalism.

01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:04.449
And it's worse online
than it is in old media.

01:09:04.449 --> 01:09:05.990
That's the last
place there are still

01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:07.790
funds going to pay journalists.

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.250
If we lose online journalists,
the reporting, like John

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.910
does for "The Nation," he gets
paid from a print publication.

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:14.240
But he's all over the web.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.649
I mean every day he's
posting articles to the web.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:18.819
If "The Nation" can't
afford to pay him anymore

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:20.727
because they can't
stay in business,

01:09:20.727 --> 01:09:22.560
then John is not writing
on the web anymore.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.101
That's the irony of our times
is old media is supporting much

01:09:25.101 --> 01:09:26.950
of the original
content we consider

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:29.649
what we get we go
online to see news.

01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:31.149
Because you're here
at Google, and I

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:34.649
know this is a great concern
of yours, that there's content

01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:37.229
online that you can
then deliver to people

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:39.915
and make it useful to people.

01:09:39.915 --> 01:09:42.733
I think this issue of how we're
going to somehow get resources

01:09:42.733 --> 01:09:44.899
to independent competing
journalists who are getting

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:49.220
paid to do work and cover
elections and cover communities

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.562
is just foundational.

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:51.770
Just keep that in your minds.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.002
It's certainly the
issue we work on.

01:09:54.002 --> 01:09:55.710
JOHN NICHOLS: And one
last element there,

01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:58.360
as long as Eric is here,
because Eric Googles stuff.

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:07.609
Just Google the Pew
study on Baltimore.

01:10:07.609 --> 01:10:09.650
Just Google those words--
Pew study on Baltimore.

01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:10.500
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: From 2009.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.080
JOHN NICHOLS: From 2009 or '10.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.970
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY:
Well, it came out in '10.

01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:13.980
But it was based in '09.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.396
JOHN NICHOLS: And
incredible study

01:10:15.396 --> 01:10:18.420
that just showed how people get
their information, old media,

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.500
new media, the interplay of it.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.750
I won't go into
detail beyond that it.

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.070
It lays it all out.

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:25.690
We've also written
some essays on it.

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:30.000
But if you Google Pew
study journalism Baltimore,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.900
most of the stuff
you talked about,

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.625
it's laid bare in
some incredible ways.

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:35.750
ROBERT W. MCCHESNEY: Well,
thank you all very much.

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:36.350
JOHN NICHOLS: Thank you.

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.650
Wow.

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:36.950
We loved you.

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:38.150
Thank you so much
for having us on.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:39.350
That was very nice of you.

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:40.961
[APPLAUSE]
