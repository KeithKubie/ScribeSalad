apps went away when the web came about

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740
apps went away when the web came about
 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.320
apps went away when the web came about
but the web enabled a whole new set of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330
but the web enabled a whole new set of
 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.760
but the web enabled a whole new set of
use cases that you couldn't do inside of

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770
use cases that you couldn't do inside of
 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.910
use cases that you couldn't do inside of
native applications the the guys who

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920

started Google Maps originally we're

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450

building a windows app and then they

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760
building a windows app and then they
 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.830
building a windows app and then they
figured out hey you know we can do this

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840
figured out hey you know we can do this
 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.960
figured out hey you know we can do this
on the web and because of the lack of

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970
on the web and because of the lack of
 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.570
on the web and because of the lack of
friction on the web where you can get to

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580
friction on the web where you can get to
 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.700
friction on the web where you can get to
anything by just typing in a URL or

well we already yes we have a solution
for that and we talked about a little

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.210
for that and we talked about a little
 

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.060
for that and we talked about a little
bit before which is using webview and

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.070
bit before which is using webview and
 

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.600
bit before which is using webview and
through Cordova so with we've been

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:27.610
through Cordova so with we've been
 

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.280
through Cordova so with we've been
contributing to the Cordoba project for

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:29.290
contributing to the Cordoba project for
 

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.050
contributing to the Cordoba project for
the last year and a half and really

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.060
the last year and a half and really
 

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.160
the last year and a half and really
trying to make it a better experience

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:32.170
trying to make it a better experience
 

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.040
trying to make it a better experience
for Android and iOS and part of that

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.050
for Android and iOS and part of that
 

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.260
for Android and iOS and part of that
process as involved making it more

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.270
process as involved making it more
 

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.450
process as involved making it more
modular making it easier to have plugins

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:39.460
modular making it easier to have plugins
 

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.340
modular making it easier to have plugins
and one of the sets of plugins that

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.350
and one of the sets of plugins that
 

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.610
and one of the sets of plugins that
we're going to be providing is a set of

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620
we're going to be providing is a set of
 

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.560
we're going to be providing is a set of
of modules that allow you to bring all

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:46.570
of modules that allow you to bring all
 

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.930
of modules that allow you to bring all
the chrome apps api's to your court of

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:48.940
the chrome apps api's to your court of
 

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.430
the chrome apps api's to your court of
apps so we have a bunch of examples

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440
apps so we have a bunch of examples
 

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.769
apps so we have a bunch of examples
actually up in our github repo it's sort

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:52.779
actually up in our github repo it's sort
 

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:54.750
actually up in our github repo it's sort
of show the same code you know that you

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760
of show the same code you know that you
 

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.730
of show the same code you know that you
would just repackage through Cordova and

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:56.740
would just repackage through Cordova and
 

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.500
would just repackage through Cordova and
you know have it running both on your

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.510
you know have it running both on your
 

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.620
you know have it running both on your
desktop and on iOS and Android so that's

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:01.630
desktop and on iOS and Android so that's
 

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.630
desktop and on iOS and Android so that's
packaging abusing using a separate

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640
packaging abusing using a separate
 

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.550
packaging abusing using a separate
program and that'll turn it into an

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560
program and that'll turn it into an
 

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.400
program and that'll turn it into an
Android native app is there is our

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:08.410
Android native app is there is our
 

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.410
Android native app is there is our
entire for Android to natively support

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:10.420
entire for Android to natively support
 

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.040
entire for Android to natively support
the chrome perhaps well I mean to my

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.050
the chrome perhaps well I mean to my
 

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.810
the chrome perhaps well I mean to my
mind it is natively supporting it right

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:15.820
mind it is natively supporting it right
 

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.120
mind it is natively supporting it right
that basically the Play Store is where

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.130
that basically the Play Store is where
 

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.970
that basically the Play Store is where
you get apps for Android right so it's

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:20.980
you get apps for Android right so it's
 

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.800
you get apps for Android right so it's
not like we want people to have to know

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:22.810
not like we want people to have to know
 

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.810
not like we want people to have to know
to go oh I go here for some of my apps

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:24.820
to go oh I go here for some of my apps
 

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.730
to go oh I go here for some of my apps
in this other place for the rest of my

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:26.740
in this other place for the rest of my
 

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.040
in this other place for the rest of my
apps you know having them all be in the

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.050
apps you know having them all be in the
 

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.690
apps you know having them all be in the
play store makes a lot of sense and for

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:30.700
play store makes a lot of sense and for
 

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.640
play store makes a lot of sense and for
the developer you know packaging this up

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:32.650
the developer you know packaging this up
 

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.020
the developer you know packaging this up
it like i said it literally is the same

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.030
it like i said it literally is the same
 

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.000
it like i said it literally is the same
source code so from their standpoint you

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.010
source code so from their standpoint you
 

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.670
source code so from their standpoint you
know the difference is just what what is

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680
know the difference is just what what is
 

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.199
know the difference is just what what is
the end package that's produced and

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:40.209
the end package that's produced and
 

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:41.880
the end package that's produced and
where do they upload it to now i think

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:41.890
where do they upload it to now i think
 

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.190
where do they upload it to now i think
that we've been investigating more ways

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200
that we've been investigating more ways
 

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.020
that we've been investigating more ways
that we can you know coordinate the

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.030
that we can you know coordinate the
 

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.640
that we can you know coordinate the
developer experience between you know

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:47.650
developer experience between you know
 

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.380
developer experience between you know
play and Chrome Web Store and like maybe

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:49.390
play and Chrome Web Store and like maybe
 

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.090
play and Chrome Web Store and like maybe
have shared developer consoles and that

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.100
have shared developer consoles and that
 

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.220
have shared developer consoles and that
sort of thing don't have anything to

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.230
sort of thing don't have anything to
 

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.380
sort of thing don't have anything to
announce on that front but I we continue

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:55.390
announce on that front but I we continue
 

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.850
announce on that front but I we continue
to look to make reduce developer

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:56.860
to look to make reduce developer
 

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.940
to look to make reduce developer
friction yes as you say we've got the

00:10:59.940 --> 00:10:59.950
friction yes as you say we've got the
 

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.640
friction yes as you say we've got the
Chrome Web Store and the play store and

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:02.650
Chrome Web Store and the play store and
 

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.220
Chrome Web Store and the play store and
there's you know is this this is a

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.230
there's you know is this this is a
 

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.660
there's you know is this this is a
fusing model having vote for them is

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:06.670
fusing model having vote for them is
 

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.050
fusing model having vote for them is
there any plans to to unify the two so

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.060
there any plans to to unify the two so
 

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.370
there any plans to to unify the two so
there's no plans right now to unify the

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:11.380
there's no plans right now to unify the
 

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.760
there's no plans right now to unify the
two you know I think you know again for

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:14.770
two you know I think you know again for
 

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.160
two you know I think you know again for
Chrome there's a you know a place where

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.170
Chrome there's a you know a place where
 

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.510
Chrome there's a you know a place where
you go to get your chrome stuff your

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:18.520
you go to get your chrome stuff your
 

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.330
you go to get your chrome stuff your
themes your extensions your apps for

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:21.340
themes your extensions your apps for
 

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.690
themes your extensions your apps for
Android there's a place to get your your

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:24.700
Android there's a place to get your your
 

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.630
Android there's a place to get your your
phone and tablet stuff I think you know

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:27.640
phone and tablet stuff I think you know
 

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.430
phone and tablet stuff I think you know
to some degree we've looked into what it

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440
to some degree we've looked into what it
 

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.810
to some degree we've looked into what it
would look like if we tried to merge

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:30.820
would look like if we tried to merge
 

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.610
would look like if we tried to merge
some of these things and it winds up

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:32.620
some of these things and it winds up
 

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.080
some of these things and it winds up
being a little bit confusing you have to

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.090
being a little bit confusing you have to
 

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.090
being a little bit confusing you have to
add multiple hierarchies of which device

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.100
add multiple hierarchies of which device
 

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.710
add multiple hierarchies of which device
am I looking for and which stuff do I

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720
am I looking for and which stuff do I
 

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.290
am I looking for and which stuff do I
get we might figure something out in the

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:40.300
get we might figure something out in the
 

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.330
get we might figure something out in the
limit but i think you know from from a

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.340
limit but i think you know from from a
 

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.220
limit but i think you know from from a
user standpoint we want to make sure

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:44.230
user standpoint we want to make sure
 

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.950
user standpoint we want to make sure
that if if users go to one store or the

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:46.960
that if if users go to one store or the
 

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.360
that if if users go to one store or the
other and they're looking for something

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:48.370
other and they're looking for something
 

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.190
other and they're looking for something
else that we can give them the pointers

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200
else that we can give them the pointers
 

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.660
else that we can give them the pointers
back to so they find things in the right

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:51.670
back to so they find things in the right
 

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.650
back to so they find things in the right
yeah i think that's one of the things

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:52.660
yeah i think that's one of the things
 

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.060
yeah i think that's one of the things
we've seen right now we don't end up

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.070
we've seen right now we don't end up
 

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.650
we've seen right now we don't end up
with android users in the Chrome Web

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:55.660
with android users in the Chrome Web
 

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.180
with android users in the Chrome Web
Store going where's my android apps or

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.190
Store going where's my android apps or
 

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.550
Store going where's my android apps or
vice versa so I don't think it's a an

00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560
vice versa so I don't think it's a an
 

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.690
vice versa so I don't think it's a an
issue for users hmm so um we've been

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:03.700
issue for users hmm so um we've been
 

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.180
issue for users hmm so um we've been
hearing about the the new chrome based

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:06.190
hearing about the the new chrome based
 

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.130
hearing about the the new chrome based
android webview in some of the sessions

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:08.140
android webview in some of the sessions
 

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.010
android webview in some of the sessions
in the past couple of days it doesn't

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:11.020
in the past couple of days it doesn't
 

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.630
in the past couple of days it doesn't
auto update is that that's correct right

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:12.640
auto update is that that's correct right
 

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.320
auto update is that that's correct right
there are other plans is that under way

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:15.330
there are other plans is that under way
 

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.780
there are other plans is that under way
so yes photo that has been a one of a

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:18.790
so yes photo that has been a one of a
 

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.730
so yes photo that has been a one of a
major feature of comb over the years and

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:20.740
major feature of comb over the years and
 

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.680
major feature of comb over the years and
definitely something that we want to do

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:22.690
definitely something that we want to do
 

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.470
definitely something that we want to do
for web view as well we are facing some

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480
for web view as well we are facing some
 

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.360
for web view as well we are facing some
significant challenges and we go we

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.370
significant challenges and we go we
 

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.890
significant challenges and we go we
don't have a date to announce but we are

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:28.900
don't have a date to announce but we are
 

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.070
don't have a date to announce but we are
actively working on it yeah we have we

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.080
actively working on it yeah we have we
 

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.260
actively working on it yeah we have we
have a process within chrome with the

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.270
have a process within chrome with the
 

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.670
have a process within chrome with the
various pre-release channels plus a

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680
various pre-release channels plus a
 

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.930
various pre-release channels plus a
bunch of internal testing and things

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:36.940
bunch of internal testing and things
 

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.120
bunch of internal testing and things
like that to make sure that if we break

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.130
like that to make sure that if we break
 

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.800
like that to make sure that if we break
someone's website we find out before we

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:40.810
someone's website we find out before we
 

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.150
someone's website we find out before we
go push it out to hundreds of millions

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160
go push it out to hundreds of millions
 

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.040
go push it out to hundreds of millions
of users I think one of the challenges

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.050
of users I think one of the challenges
 

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.840
of users I think one of the challenges
we have with auto updating webview is

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:45.850
we have with auto updating webview is
 

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.430
we have with auto updating webview is
there's this whole ecosystem of Android

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440
there's this whole ecosystem of Android
 

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.110
there's this whole ecosystem of Android
apps that use web view and if we're

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120
apps that use web view and if we're
 

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.250
apps that use web view and if we're
going to be updating that thing very

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:50.260
going to be updating that thing very
 

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.010
going to be updating that thing very
rapidly we need to have mechanisms to be

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.020
rapidly we need to have mechanisms to be
 

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.270
rapidly we need to have mechanisms to be
able to test all of those applications

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:54.280
able to test all of those applications
 

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.610
able to test all of those applications
and and get feedback early in the

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:56.620
and and get feedback early in the
 

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.750
and and get feedback early in the
development process to make sure we

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760
development process to make sure we
 

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.890
development process to make sure we
don't go break a whole bunch of them

00:12:58.890 --> 00:12:58.900
don't go break a whole bunch of them
 

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.080
don't go break a whole bunch of them
when we push out updates but this is not

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.090
when we push out updates but this is not
 

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.460
when we push out updates but this is not
a problem on the web right i mean we

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:02.470
a problem on the web right i mean we
 

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.530
a problem on the web right i mean we
update the browser all the time and and

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:04.540
update the browser all the time and and
 

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.510
update the browser all the time and and
other browsers update all the time is it

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:06.520
other browsers update all the time is it
 

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.030
other browsers update all the time is it
why and we've got massive automated

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040
why and we've got massive automated
 

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.650
why and we've got massive automated
testing infrastructure to see what we

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:10.660
testing infrastructure to see what we
 

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.600
testing infrastructure to see what we
break and stuff like that during the

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:12.610
break and stuff like that during the
 

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.100
break and stuff like that during the
development process before it actually

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.110
development process before it actually
 

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.840
development process before it actually
gets out to users and also with these

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:15.850
gets out to users and also with these
 

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.310
gets out to users and also with these
early release channels like the canary

and
 

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:20.069
and
channel and beta channel people can come

00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079
channel and beta channel people can come
 

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:22.619
channel and beta channel people can come
and yell and say a file a bug you broke

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:22.629
and yell and say a file a bug you broke

my website you bastards and we can fix

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:25.029
my website you bastards and we can fix
 

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:26.369
my website you bastards and we can fix
it before we go send it out to a whole

00:13:26.369 --> 00:13:26.379
it before we go send it out to a whole
 

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:29.160
it before we go send it out to a whole
bunch of users and we don't have those

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.170
bunch of users and we don't have those
 

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.900
bunch of users and we don't have those
mechanisms and processes and

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:30.910
mechanisms and processes and
 

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.119
mechanisms and processes and
infrastructure in place for you know

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:33.129
infrastructure in place for you know
 

00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:34.679
infrastructure in place for you know
testing against the whole ecosystem of

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:34.689
testing against the whole ecosystem of
 

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.629
testing against the whole ecosystem of
Android apps yet and so that's one of

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639
Android apps yet and so that's one of
 

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.280
Android apps yet and so that's one of
the big engineering challenges we face

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.290
the big engineering challenges we face
 

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.470
the big engineering challenges we face
and process challenges we face and being

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480
and process challenges we face and being
 

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.059
and process challenges we face and being
able to do that cuz we want to get there

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:42.069
able to do that cuz we want to get there
 

00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:43.710
able to do that cuz we want to get there
we haven't figured out all the problems

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720
we haven't figured out all the problems
 

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.199
we haven't figured out all the problems
yet and so how do we distribute

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:46.209
yet and so how do we distribute
 

00:13:46.209 --> 00:13:48.269
yet and so how do we distribute
something that big across all the device

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279
something that big across all the device
 

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:52.189
something that big across all the device
or the OEMs all the networks the curves

00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199
or the OEMs all the networks the curves
 

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:54.840
or the OEMs all the networks the curves
so it seems like getting the new chrome

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:54.850
so it seems like getting the new chrome
 

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.369
so it seems like getting the new chrome
webview on there was was kind of it was

00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:56.379
webview on there was was kind of it was
 

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:58.169
webview on there was was kind of it was
a big challenge right it's been it's

00:13:58.169 --> 00:13:58.179
a big challenge right it's been it's
 

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:00.179
a big challenge right it's been it's
been the old Android browser for for a

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:00.189
been the old Android browser for for a
 

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:01.619
been the old Android browser for for a
long time now I mean we got Chrome as

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:01.629
long time now I mean we got Chrome as
 

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:03.660
long time now I mean we got Chrome as
the default browser but we still had the

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:03.670
the default browser but we still had the
 

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.309
the default browser but we still had the
old webview what would the challenge is

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:05.319
old webview what would the challenge is
 

00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:07.019
old webview what would the challenge is
there what yeah what were the real

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:07.029
there what yeah what were the real
 

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.359
there what yeah what were the real
problems and why do we see the the

00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:09.369
problems and why do we see the the
 

00:14:09.369 --> 00:14:10.769
problems and why do we see the the
chrome webview having a kind of slightly

00:14:10.769 --> 00:14:10.779
chrome webview having a kind of slightly
 

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:12.989
chrome webview having a kind of slightly
different feature set to the chrome

00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:12.999
different feature set to the chrome
 

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:14.850
different feature set to the chrome
browser and basically it was another

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:14.860
browser and basically it was another
 

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.189
browser and basically it was another
part of chromium to something different

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199
part of chromium to something different
 

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:20.329
part of chromium to something different
it's a single process environment it's

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339
it's a single process environment it's
 

00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:22.439
it's a single process environment it's
it has it's a slightly different

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:22.449
it has it's a slightly different
 

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:24.030
it has it's a slightly different
graphics architecture there are very

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040
graphics architecture there are very
 

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.980
graphics architecture there are very
small differences by the way which are

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:25.990
small differences by the way which are
 

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.100
small differences by the way which are

00:14:34.859 --> 00:14:34.869
activity to fix those and make them just
 

00:14:34.869 --> 00:14:37.679

like there's a chrome moving forward so

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:37.689
like there's a chrome moving forward so
 

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:39.650
like there's a chrome moving forward so
because it's a single process model I

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660
because it's a single process model I
 

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.179

compared to in to Chrome how does that

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:42.189
compared to in to Chrome how does that
 

00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:43.530
compared to in to Chrome how does that
affect performances or Israel

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:43.540
affect performances or Israel
 

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.359

performance difference now um there's

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:45.369
performance difference now um there's
 

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:47.999
performance difference now um there's
the only difference but the only

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:48.009
the only difference but the only
 

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:50.009
the only difference but the only

again which is using a software path so

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:51.910
again which is using a software path so
 

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.859
again which is using a software path so
far other than that justin is actually

far other than that justin is actually
 

00:14:54.869 --> 00:14:58.590
far other than that justin is actually
simpler and then where we are in comas

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600
simpler and then where we are in comas
 

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.429

would people why would people do that
 

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.210
would people why would people do that
why was there why are so many people

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:12.220
why was there why are so many people
 

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.710

better for you if you need because you

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:36.340
better for you if you need because you

better for you if you need because you
know if there's a hardware read back

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480
know if there's a hardware read back
 

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.690
know if there's a hardware read back

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:52.510
from the the WebKit folk and that's
 

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.230
from the the WebKit folk and that's
going into the you know people are now

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240
going into the you know people are now
 

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.669
going into the you know people are now
taking that into consideration then

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:56.679
taking that into consideration then
 

00:18:56.679 --> 00:18:58.710
taking that into consideration then
pitcher sort of came came up again as

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720
pitcher sort of came came up again as
 

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.880
pitcher sort of came came up again as
hey maybe that will solve all our

00:18:59.880 --> 00:18:59.890
hey maybe that will solve all our
 

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.040
hey maybe that will solve all our
problems and then Hicks is like what but

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.050
problems and then Hicks is like what but
 

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.350
problems and then Hicks is like what but
you guys realize multi element solutions

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360
you guys realize multi element solutions
 

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.210
you guys realize multi element solutions

this question because it's so loaded I

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.150
this question because it's so loaded I
 

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:33.210
this question because it's so loaded I
mean I can talk a little bit about that

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:33.220
mean I can talk a little bit about that
 

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.980
mean I can talk a little bit about that
I think we've kind of talked a lot about

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:34.990
I think we've kind of talked a lot about
 

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.950
I think we've kind of talked a lot about
that and last last day or so I mean

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960
that and last last day or so I mean
 

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.960
that and last last day or so I mean
because we love all that low-level stuff

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:39.970
because we love all that low-level stuff
 

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.010
because we love all that low-level stuff
as well we're kind of going in both

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.020
as well we're kind of going in both
 

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.240
as well we're kind of going in both
directions giving you more low-level

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.250
directions giving you more low-level

sort of you know WebGL being the classic

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:46.870
sort of you know WebGL being the classic
 

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.299
sort of you know WebGL being the classic
example but then we're doing these

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:48.309
example but then we're doing these
 

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:49.980
example but then we're doing these
higher level things as well you know

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:49.990
higher level things as well you know
 

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.840
higher level things as well you know
adding we've been working obviously on

features like flexbox and grid and then

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440
features like flexbox and grid and then
 

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.590
features like flexbox and grid and then
coming up to web components and now

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600
coming up to web components and now
 

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.260
coming up to web components and now
polymer so we're trying to kind of come

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.270
polymer so we're trying to kind of come
 

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.139
polymer so we're trying to kind of come
in without having to

00:19:59.139 --> 00:19:59.149
in without having to

but to have these different layers that

00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:01.099
but to have these different layers that
 

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.279
but to have these different layers that
you can come in that depending on your

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:03.289
you can come in that depending on your
 

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:04.810
you can come in that depending on your
particular scenario so you can get up

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:04.820
particular scenario so you can get up
 

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.519
particular scenario so you can get up
and running really quickly but you can

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:06.529
and running really quickly but you can
 

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:08.680
and running really quickly but you can
still get access to the low-level API is

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:08.690
still get access to the low-level API is
 

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.479
still get access to the low-level API is
if that's what you you want to do and

00:20:10.479 --> 00:20:10.489
if that's what you you want to do and
 

00:20:10.489 --> 00:20:12.549
if that's what you you want to do and
you can start 11 layer and work your way

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559
you can start 11 layer and work your way
 

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:14.409
you can start 11 layer and work your way
down so we're kind of coming at it from

00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:14.419
down so we're kind of coming at it from
 

00:20:14.419 --> 00:20:16.479
down so we're kind of coming at it from
from different different angles yeah

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:16.489
from different different angles yeah
 

00:20:16.489 --> 00:20:19.239
from different different angles yeah
exactly like I feel like it's part of it

00:20:19.239 --> 00:20:19.249
exactly like I feel like it's part of it
 

00:20:19.249 --> 00:20:20.950
exactly like I feel like it's part of it
part of the answer is let's make the low

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960
part of the answer is let's make the low
 

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.659
part of the answer is let's make the low
level less scary and more accessible

00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:22.669
level less scary and more accessible
 

00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:25.089
level less scary and more accessible
better tools that sort of thing because

00:20:25.089 --> 00:20:25.099
better tools that sort of thing because
 

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:27.159
better tools that sort of thing because
you know like it or not you often do you

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:27.169
you know like it or not you often do you
 

00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:28.060
you know like it or not you often do you
really need to understand what's going

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.070
really need to understand what's going
 

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.489
really need to understand what's going
on but then things like web components

00:20:30.489 --> 00:20:30.499
on but then things like web components
 

00:20:30.499 --> 00:20:33.519

and developers can other people can

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:35.299
and developers can other people can
 

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:37.719
and developers can other people can
provide components that people can use

00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:37.729
provide components that people can use
 

00:20:37.729 --> 00:20:39.729
provide components that people can use
that hopefully solves the problems for

00:20:39.729 --> 00:20:39.739
that hopefully solves the problems for
 

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.529
that hopefully solves the problems for
people who don't have to fight through

00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:41.539
people who don't have to fight through
 

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:44.859
people who don't have to fight through
them that other people part is also

00:20:44.859 --> 00:20:44.869
them that other people part is also
 

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:45.729
them that other people part is also
really important because we obviously

00:20:45.729 --> 00:20:45.739
really important because we obviously
 

00:20:45.739 --> 00:20:48.909
really important because we obviously
were huge supporters of our own polymer

00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919
were huge supporters of our own polymer
 

00:20:48.919 --> 00:20:50.349
were huge supporters of our own polymer

that's very cool we've not had double

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:04.700
that's very cool we've not had double
 

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.849
that's very cool we've not had double
yeah and I think as an example like

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:06.859
yeah and I think as an example like
 

00:21:06.859 --> 00:21:09.669
yeah and I think as an example like
Mozilla X tags can play nicely with

00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679
Mozilla X tags can play nicely with
 

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:11.799
Mozilla X tags can play nicely with

the same time yeah many third-party
 

00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:14.829
the same time yeah many third-party
vendors have come out and said yeah

00:21:14.829 --> 00:21:14.839
vendors have come out and said yeah
 

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:16.509
vendors have come out and said yeah
they're getting ready to build the

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:16.519
they're getting ready to build the
 

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.190
they're getting ready to build the
Rhines or web components and frameworks

Rhines or web components and frameworks
 

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.829
Rhines or web components and frameworks
that can then can interoperate yeah I

00:21:20.829 --> 00:21:20.839
that can then can interoperate yeah I
 

00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:22.329
that can then can interoperate yeah I
mean not to beat it to death but the

00:21:22.329 --> 00:21:22.339
mean not to beat it to death but the
 

00:21:22.339 --> 00:21:23.799
mean not to beat it to death but the
cool thing about web components is it's

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:23.809
cool thing about web components is it's
 

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:26.589
cool thing about web components is it's
just like custom HTML tags and all these

00:21:26.589 --> 00:21:26.599
just like custom HTML tags and all these
 

00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:28.209
just like custom HTML tags and all these
frameworks that already have existed

they all work with HTML elements so they

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:32.089
they all work with HTML elements so they
 

00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:33.459
they all work with HTML elements so they
all work with web components it's really

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:33.469
all work with web components it's really
 

00:21:33.469 --> 00:21:34.959
all work with web components it's really
cool you think about it you can hurt you

00:21:34.959 --> 00:21:34.969
cool you think about it you can hurt you
 

00:21:34.969 --> 00:21:36.909
cool you think about it you can hurt you
don't have to throw away what you're

00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919
don't have to throw away what you're
 

00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:38.289
don't have to throw away what you're
already doing and just sort of gently

00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:38.299
already doing and just sort of gently
 

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:40.419
already doing and just sort of gently
embrace parts of you know things done as

00:21:40.419 --> 00:21:40.429
embrace parts of you know things done as
 

00:21:40.429 --> 00:21:41.919
embrace parts of you know things done as
web components it's actually really neat

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:41.929
web components it's actually really neat
 

00:21:41.929 --> 00:21:44.499
web components it's actually really neat
I think it's an idea in this question

00:21:44.499 --> 00:21:44.509
I think it's an idea in this question
 

00:21:44.509 --> 00:21:45.789
I think it's an idea in this question
that web development should you know

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799
that web development should you know
 

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:47.769
that web development should you know
should be high level I mean I remember

00:21:47.769 --> 00:21:47.779
should be high level I mean I remember
 

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:50.649
should be high level I mean I remember
working in in places where you had

00:21:50.649 --> 00:21:50.659
working in in places where you had
 

00:21:50.659 --> 00:21:52.779
working in in places where you had
developers who just did sort of HTML and

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:52.789
developers who just did sort of HTML and
 

00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:55.749
developers who just did sort of HTML and
CSS and then you had saw the number set

00:21:55.749 --> 00:21:55.759
CSS and then you had saw the number set
 

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:57.609
CSS and then you had saw the number set
of developers doing doing JavaScript and

00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:57.619
of developers doing doing JavaScript and
 

00:21:57.619 --> 00:21:59.200
of developers doing doing JavaScript and
you know none of them are really caring

00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.210
you know none of them are really caring
 

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.940
you know none of them are really caring
about sort of the low level paint stuff

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:00.950
about sort of the low level paint stuff
 

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.430
about sort of the low level paint stuff
is that is that no longer possibilities

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440
is that is that no longer possibilities
 

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.049
is that is that no longer possibilities
are we saying that no young we you know

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:05.059
are we saying that no young we you know
 

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:07.690
are we saying that no young we you know
developers need to maybe grow up or is

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:07.700
developers need to maybe grow up or is
 

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.029
developers need to maybe grow up or is
the other different different jobs I

00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039
the other different different jobs I
 

00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:11.350
the other different different jobs I
think that I think that goes by

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360
think that I think that goes by
 

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.730
think that I think that goes by
to one of the earlier questions about

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:12.740
to one of the earlier questions about
 

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.090
to one of the earlier questions about
you know why are native apps faster than

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:16.100
you know why are native apps faster than
 

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.860
you know why are native apps faster than
the web well it turns out in many cases

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:17.870
the web well it turns out in many cases
 

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.660
the web well it turns out in many cases
you can get exactly the same performance

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:19.670
you can get exactly the same performance
 

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.310
you can get exactly the same performance
on both platforms if you know what

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320
on both platforms if you know what
 

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.890
on both platforms if you know what
you're doing and the the problem is is

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:23.900
you're doing and the the problem is is
 

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.840
you're doing and the the problem is is
like a Darren mentioned earlier there's

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:25.850
like a Darren mentioned earlier there's
 

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.020
like a Darren mentioned earlier there's
many many poorly lit paths through the

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:29.030
many many poorly lit paths through the
 

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.669
many many poorly lit paths through the
wet web platform where if you go

00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679
wet web platform where if you go
 

00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:32.380
wet web platform where if you go
wandering off in there bad things are

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:32.390
wandering off in there bad things are
 

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.180
wandering off in there bad things are
going to happen to you and so doing

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:34.190
going to happen to you and so doing
 

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.280
going to happen to you and so doing
things like web components in polymer

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.290
things like web components in polymer
 

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.020
things like web components in polymer
gives us the opportunity to give

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.030
gives us the opportunity to give
 

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.120
gives us the opportunity to give
developers a high-level well lit path

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.130
developers a high-level well lit path
 

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.250
developers a high-level well lit path
that's also highly performant because it

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:42.260
that's also highly performant because it
 

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.169
that's also highly performant because it
stays on all the fast paths inside the

00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:44.179
stays on all the fast paths inside the
 

00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:47.320
stays on all the fast paths inside the
blink and inside of chrome Hiroshi is

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:47.330
blink and inside of chrome Hiroshi is
 

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.230
blink and inside of chrome Hiroshi is
this is there this miss feeling in the

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240
this is there this miss feeling in the
 

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.669
this is there this miss feeling in the
native old as well I know nothing about

00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679
native old as well I know nothing about
 

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:53.950
native old as well I know nothing about
it is the other sections of developers

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960
it is the other sections of developers
 

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.140
it is the other sections of developers
who feel like that kind of low level

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.150
who feel like that kind of low level
 

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.520
who feel like that kind of low level
thing it isn't something they should be

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:57.530
thing it isn't something they should be
 

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.780
thing it isn't something they should be
caring about because if you've got

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:58.790
caring about because if you've got
 

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.299
caring about because if you've got
primitives on Android as well and you

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:01.309
primitives on Android as well and you
 

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:02.980
primitives on Android as well and you
can sort of do extra things with them

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:02.990
can sort of do extra things with them
 

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.720
can sort of do extra things with them
other developers who are saying look I

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:04.730
other developers who are saying look I
 

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.070
other developers who are saying look I
shouldn't have to be caring about this

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080
shouldn't have to be caring about this
 

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.020
shouldn't have to be caring about this
stuff it should just do it yeah and this

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.030
stuff it should just do it yeah and this
 

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.340
stuff it should just do it yeah and this
is this is similar to the point I was

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:09.350
is this is similar to the point I was
 

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:10.480
is this is similar to the point I was
trying to make earlier which is it's

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:10.490
trying to make earlier which is it's
 

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.770
trying to make earlier which is it's
it's actually pretty easy to write a

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:11.780
it's actually pretty easy to write a
 

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.600
it's actually pretty easy to write a
poorly performing app for native as well

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:13.610
poorly performing app for native as well
 

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.610
poorly performing app for native as well
and as a native developer you have to

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:15.620
and as a native developer you have to
 

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.110
and as a native developer you have to
pay attention to these same things and

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120
pay attention to these same things and
 

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.810
pay attention to these same things and
they are poorly lit a lease on the

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:19.820
they are poorly lit a lease on the
 

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.310
they are poorly lit a lease on the
native were in the native world as well

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320
native were in the native world as well
 

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.200
native were in the native world as well
and you just have to be aware of this

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.210
and you just have to be aware of this
 

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.880
and you just have to be aware of this
stuff and and this was a big part of

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:24.890
stuff and and this was a big part of
 

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.010
stuff and and this was a big part of
what we pushed last year with jellybean

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.020
what we pushed last year with jellybean
 

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.390
what we pushed last year with jellybean
again you know with this big push on

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400
again you know with this big push on
 

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.280
again you know with this big push on
project butter we have new tools we had

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:30.290
project butter we have new tools we had
 

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.140
project butter we have new tools we had
new tools that we made available so that

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:32.150
new tools that we made available so that
 

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.549
new tools that we made available so that
people can trace the developers can

00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559
people can trace the developers can
 

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:35.080
people can trace the developers can
trace what their app is doing and figure

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.090
trace what their app is doing and figure
 

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.360
trace what their app is doing and figure
out what the bottlenecks are it's all I

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:37.370
out what the bottlenecks are it's all I
 

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:38.799
out what the bottlenecks are it's all I
think the same concepts it's just

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:38.809
think the same concepts it's just
 

00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:40.720
think the same concepts it's just
different sets of technologies but it's

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:40.730
different sets of technologies but it's
 

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.450
different sets of technologies but it's
really the same thing I think that's

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:43.460
really the same thing I think that's
 

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.460
really the same thing I think that's
also there's cultural differences in the

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:45.470
also there's cultural differences in the
 

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.799
also there's cultural differences in the
developer communities as well I think

00:23:47.799 --> 00:23:47.809
developer communities as well I think
 

00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:49.630
developer communities as well I think
historically web developers haven't

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640
historically web developers haven't
 

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.180
historically web developers haven't
cared about 60 Hertz animations it just

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:52.190
cared about 60 Hertz animations it just
 

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.700
cared about 60 Hertz animations it just
hasn't been on people's radar it's not

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:54.710
hasn't been on people's radar it's not
 

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.169
hasn't been on people's radar it's not
something that you just expect from a

00:23:56.169 --> 00:23:56.179
something that you just expect from a
 

00:23:56.179 --> 00:23:58.360
something that you just expect from a
website but if you're a mobile developer

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:58.370
website but if you're a mobile developer
 

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.560
website but if you're a mobile developer
that's something that you've expected

00:23:59.560 --> 00:23:59.570
that's something that you've expected
 

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.500
that's something that you've expected
from day one and so you you go okay you

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:02.510
from day one and so you you go okay you
 

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.180
from day one and so you you go okay you
start thinking about how do i get sixty

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:04.190
start thinking about how do i get sixty
 

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.710
start thinking about how do i get sixty
Hertz and then start adding features on

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720
Hertz and then start adding features on
 

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.840
Hertz and then start adding features on
top of that whereas many web projects

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:07.850
top of that whereas many web projects
 

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.070
top of that whereas many web projects
they go out all their features and then

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080
they go out all their features and then
 

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.020
they go out all their features and then
go holy cow how do I make this fast and

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:11.030
go holy cow how do I make this fast and
 

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.419
go holy cow how do I make this fast and
and so one of the things we try to do

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:13.429
and so one of the things we try to do
 

00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:15.760
and so one of the things we try to do
inside of Google with lots of other web

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:15.770
inside of Google with lots of other web
 

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.130
inside of Google with lots of other web
developers inside the company is get

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.140
developers inside the company is get
 

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.590
developers inside the company is get
them onto the fastpass first you know

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600
them onto the fastpass first you know
 

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.150
them onto the fastpass first you know
get there hello world the very first

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:22.160
get there hello world the very first
 

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.800
get there hello world the very first
thing they get going on all

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:23.810
thing they get going on all
 

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.360
thing they get going on all
right fast paths and keep it passed

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.370
right fast paths and keep it passed
 

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.950
right fast paths and keep it passed
through development as they add features

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960
through development as they add features
 

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.480
through development as they add features
and capabilities and round out what

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:28.490
and capabilities and round out what
 

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.190
and capabilities and round out what
their program does because it's much

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200
their program does because it's much
 

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.590
their program does because it's much
much harder if someone's been hacking on

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600
much harder if someone's been hacking on
 

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.840
much harder if someone's been hacking on
HTML CSS and JavaScript for a year and

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:34.850
HTML CSS and JavaScript for a year and
 

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.730
HTML CSS and JavaScript for a year and
then they turn up and say hey I'm really

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:36.740
then they turn up and say hey I'm really
 

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.470
then they turn up and say hey I'm really
slow and I use a lot of memory can you

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480
slow and I use a lot of memory can you
 

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.080
slow and I use a lot of memory can you
help me it's much easier to start fast

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.090
help me it's much easier to start fast
 

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.000
help me it's much easier to start fast
and stay fast and have automated tests

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.010
and stay fast and have automated tests
 

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.860
and stay fast and have automated tests
to make sure that you stay on those fast

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:44.870
to make sure that you stay on those fast
 

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.770
to make sure that you stay on those fast
paths as you keep adding things to it in

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:47.780

there so to the core of your question

00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279
there so to the core of your question
 

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.009
there so to the core of your question
about low level versus high level you

00:27:03.009 --> 00:27:03.019
about low level versus high level you
 

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:04.870
about low level versus high level you
know the primitives versus you know

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880
know the primitives versus you know
 

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.120
know the primitives versus you know
these high-level concepts one of the

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.130
these high-level concepts one of the
 

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.519
these high-level concepts one of the
things that that we've seen is that when

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:09.529
things that that we've seen is that when
 

00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:10.629
things that that we've seen is that when
you when people start with high-level

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:10.639
you when people start with high-level
 

00:27:10.639 --> 00:27:12.669
you when people start with high-level
concepts and then they want to change it

00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679
concepts and then they want to change it
 

00:27:12.679 --> 00:27:14.470
concepts and then they want to change it
in a way that the high level construct

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480
in a way that the high level construct
 

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.049
in a way that the high level construct
didn't allow they start having to hack

00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:17.059
didn't allow they start having to hack
 

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:18.639
didn't allow they start having to hack
their way around it and and that's the

00:27:18.639 --> 00:27:18.649
their way around it and and that's the
 

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:19.769
their way around it and and that's the
kind of thing that winds up actually

00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:19.779
kind of thing that winds up actually
 

00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:21.549
kind of thing that winds up actually
contributing to some of the performance

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559
contributing to some of the performance
 

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:24.850
contributing to some of the performance
issues and and so if instead you say

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:24.860
issues and and so if instead you say
 

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.820
issues and and so if instead you say
well every it's okay to have high level

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:26.830
well every it's okay to have high level
 

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.169
well every it's okay to have high level
constructs but they're built up out of

00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:29.179
constructs but they're built up out of
 

00:27:29.179 --> 00:27:31.720
constructs but they're built up out of
primitives that we expose so if you want

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:31.730
primitives that we expose so if you want
 

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.610
primitives that we expose so if you want
to recreate that high level thing or

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:33.620
to recreate that high level thing or
 

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.740
to recreate that high level thing or
pick and choose and take bits and pieces

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:35.750
pick and choose and take bits and pieces
 

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.750
pick and choose and take bits and pieces
of it you can do that and that's part of

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760
of it you can do that and that's part of
 

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.310
of it you can do that and that's part of
the what we're doing with web components

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320
the what we're doing with web components
 

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.500
the what we're doing with web components
is that even though it hides things from

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:41.510
is that even though it hides things from
 

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.720
is that even though it hides things from
from you you can still drill in and get

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:43.730
from you you can still drill in and get
 

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.039
from you you can still drill in and get
into it and take it apart and do

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:45.049
into it and take it apart and do
 

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:46.750
into it and take it apart and do
something different with it that you

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760
something different with it that you
 

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.519
something different with it that you
don't need necessarily to start at the

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:48.529
don't need necessarily to start at the
 

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:49.840
don't need necessarily to start at the
high level you could start at the low

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:49.850
high level you could start at the low
 

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.600
high level you could start at the low
level and build up from there so I am

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:52.610
level and build up from there so I am
 

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.779

yesterday I was like ripping into
 

00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:56.950
yesterday I was like ripping into
application cache for its manifest

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960
application cache for its manifest
 

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.169
application cache for its manifest
format where you add a line to it and

00:27:59.169 --> 00:27:59.179
format where you add a line to it and
 

00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:02.080

there's a real cost to that right so if

there's a real cost to that right so if

there's a real cost to that right so if

you'll have enough beer am yeah and so
there's definitely this challenge of

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:12.670
there's definitely this challenge of
 

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.370
there's definitely this challenge of
making sure that we don't create a

also part of the reason that we have

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:17.770
also part of the reason that we have

also part of the reason that we have
this sort of translate Z role is that

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360
this sort of translate Z role is that
 

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.620
this sort of translate Z role is that
one day we could reverse that and do

than it should have by the way there's
 

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.510

you give developers this thing it says

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.090
you give developers this thing it says
 

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.930
you give developers this thing it says
that looks like make this go faster they

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:51.940
that looks like make this go faster they
 

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.430

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:55.330
code yeah and the problem is that as a
 

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.290

to optimize things so a classic example
 

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.740
to optimize things so a classic example
of this is that

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:01.750
of this is that
 

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.990

garbage collectors in the past had a way
 

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.200
garbage collectors in the past had a way
of invoking the garbage collector of you

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:07.210
of invoking the garbage collector of you
 

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.750

saying do it now and the problem is that

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760
saying do it now and the problem is that
 

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.510
saying do it now and the problem is that

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:41.250
all browsers so we wanted to be will
 

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.599
all browsers so we wanted to be will
have a path where we can compile C code

00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:44.609
have a path where we can compile C code
 

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:47.480
have a path where we can compile C code
down to the JavaScript and and run it in

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:47.490
down to the JavaScript and and run it in
 

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.640
down to the JavaScript and and run it in
all browsers including chrome we want to

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:49.650
all browsers including chrome we want to
 

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.440
all browsers including chrome we want to
be a people to be able to write dart

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:51.450
be a people to be able to write dart
 

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.290
be a people to be able to write dart
code and run it in all browsers by

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300
code and run it in all browsers by
 

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.950
code and run it in all browsers by
compiling it down to JavaScript and so

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960
compiling it down to JavaScript and so
 

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.530
compiling it down to JavaScript and so
you know the capability of being able to

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540
you know the capability of being able to
 

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.390
you know the capability of being able to
work in these other languages is useful

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400
work in these other languages is useful
 

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.680
work in these other languages is useful
to a number of developers and so we

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:03.690
to a number of developers and so we
 

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.240
to a number of developers and so we
wanted to enable that and that was sort

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:05.250
wanted to enable that and that was sort
 

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.550
wanted to enable that and that was sort
of the baseline for it but then going

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560
of the baseline for it but then going
 

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.400
of the baseline for it but then going
beyond that you say is JavaScript really

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:10.410
beyond that you say is JavaScript really
 

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.980
beyond that you say is JavaScript really
the best vm to execute c code in I mean

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:12.990
the best vm to execute c code in I mean
 

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.670
the best vm to execute c code in I mean
it's possible but II are you going to

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680
it's possible but II are you going to
 

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.990
it's possible but II are you going to
get the best possible performance by

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000
get the best possible performance by
 

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.040
get the best possible performance by
doing that and will you be able to do

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.050
doing that and will you be able to do
 

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.339
doing that and will you be able to do
things like threads and and and other

00:41:22.339 --> 00:41:22.349
things like threads and and and other
 

00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:24.079
things like threads and and and other
things similar questions come up with

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:24.089
things similar questions come up with
 

00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:25.820
things similar questions come up with
dart we can compile dart down to

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:25.830
dart we can compile dart down to
 

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.140
dart we can compile dart down to
JavaScript but that might not be the

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.150
JavaScript but that might not be the
 

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.970
JavaScript but that might not be the
fastest way you can run the language and

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980
fastest way you can run the language and
 

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.650
fastest way you can run the language and
so the dart team basically took on a

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660
so the dart team basically took on a
 

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.630
so the dart team basically took on a
challenge that said we're not even going

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640
challenge that said we're not even going
 

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.190
challenge that said we're not even going
to think about putting the dart VM into

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200
to think about putting the dart VM into
 

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.990
to think about putting the dart VM into
chrome unless we can show dramatic

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000
chrome unless we can show dramatic
 

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.329
chrome unless we can show dramatic
performance enhancement both in terms of

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339
performance enhancement both in terms of
 

00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:40.130
performance enhancement both in terms of
startup time and in terms of execution

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140
startup time and in terms of execution
 

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.859
startup time and in terms of execution
performance and then and so that's what

00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:42.869
performance and then and so that's what
 

00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:44.690
performance and then and so that's what
they're working on right now and also we

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700
they're working on right now and also we
 

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.089
they're working on right now and also we
want to do it in a way that doesn't add

00:41:46.089 --> 00:41:46.099
want to do it in a way that doesn't add
 

00:41:46.099 --> 00:41:48.800
want to do it in a way that doesn't add
a tremendous amount of complexity to

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:48.810
a tremendous amount of complexity to
 

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.420
a tremendous amount of complexity to

it needs to be done in a way that's
 

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.540
it needs to be done in a way that's
essentially orthogonal to everything

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:53.550
essentially orthogonal to everything
 

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.339
essentially orthogonal to everything
else that's going on because we can't

00:41:55.339 --> 00:41:55.349
else that's going on because we can't
 

00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:57.290

just keep bolting in New VMs left and

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300
just keep bolting in New VMs left and
 

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.190
just keep bolting in New VMs left and
right if we end up

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200
right if we end up
 

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.250

some horrible n squared dependency mesh

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.260
some horrible n squared dependency mesh
 

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.240
some horrible n squared dependency mesh
so that's the way we're looking at the

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:02.250
so that's the way we're looking at the
 

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.339
so that's the way we're looking at the
problem we haven't made any explicit

00:42:04.339 --> 00:42:04.349
problem we haven't made any explicit
 

00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:05.690

do but that's how we're thinking about
it mmm so I'm my knowledge of pinnacle

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680
it mmm so I'm my knowledge of pinnacle
 

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.280
it mmm so I'm my knowledge of pinnacle
is actually quite low but I mean I got a

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:13.290

really really fast does is that

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:23.970
really really fast does is that
 

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.250
really really fast does is that
something that could happen with with

something that could happen with with
 

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.560
something that could happen with with
dart i mean would we need to put the

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:27.570
dart i mean would we need to put the
 

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.240
dart i mean would we need to put the
dart VM in tacoma mean we do we just be

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:29.250
dart VM in tacoma mean we do we just be
 

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.560
dart VM in tacoma mean we do we just be
able to you know compile it using

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:30.570
able to you know compile it using
 

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.329
able to you know compile it using
something like pinnacle is that is that

00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:32.339
something like pinnacle is that is that
 

00:42:32.339 --> 00:42:33.650
something like pinnacle is that is that
like one solution that we cover both

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660
like one solution that we cover both
 

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.069
like one solution that we cover both
cases well I mean the dirt the dirt tjs

00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079
cases well I mean the dirt the dirt tjs

is already actually doing this quite

00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:38.609
is already actually doing this quite
 

00:42:38.609 --> 00:42:40.400
is already actually doing this quite
well you know if you look at some of the

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:40.410
well you know if you look at some of the
 

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:41.839
well you know if you look at some of the
benchmarks they're doing and some of the

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:41.849
benchmarks they're doing and some of the
 

00:42:41.849 --> 00:42:44.810
benchmarks they're doing and some of the
the tree shaking and other whole program

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820
the tree shaking and other whole program
 

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.040
the tree shaking and other whole program
optimizations that they're able to do

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.050
optimizations that they're able to do
 

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.349
optimizations that they're able to do
with dart tjs they can make programs

00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359
with dart tjs they can make programs
 

00:42:48.359 --> 00:42:51.230
with dart tjs they can make programs
that you know take a dark dart and make

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240
that you know take a dark dart and make
 

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.450
that you know take a dark dart and make
it dart program and emit j/s that's much

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460
it dart program and emit j/s that's much
 

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.250
it dart program and emit j/s that's much
faster than handwritten equivalent to

Jas is so in some ways they're they're

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:57.750
Jas is so in some ways they're they're
 

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:02.089
Jas is so in some ways they're they're
moving that way really pinnacle is it

00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:02.099
moving that way really pinnacle is it
 

00:43:02.099 --> 00:43:04.190
moving that way really pinnacle is it
certainly could be used for that and and

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200
certainly could be used for that and and
 

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.870
certainly could be used for that and and
it's possible that we could get you know

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880
it's possible that we could get you know
 

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.790
it's possible that we could get you know
you know comparable performance and

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800
you know comparable performance and
 

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.670
you know comparable performance and
honestly though if they can get you know

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680
honestly though if they can get you know
 

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.220
honestly though if they can get you know
do it with with JavaScript it's I mean

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:13.230
do it with with JavaScript it's I mean
 

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:17.630
do it with with JavaScript it's I mean
basically with Pinnacle the the security

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640
basically with Pinnacle the the security
 

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.120
basically with Pinnacle the the security
and platform portability that you get

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.130
and platform portability that you get
 

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.800
and platform portability that you get
with Pinnacle would just make

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:21.810
with Pinnacle would just make
 

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:25.430
with Pinnacle would just make

pinnacle just would not be as fast in

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:30.030
pinnacle just would not be as fast in
 

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.550
pinnacle just would not be as fast in
that environment is if you implemented

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560
that environment is if you implemented
 

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.069
that environment is if you implemented
it natively mmm and so there's some

00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079
it natively mmm and so there's some
 

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:35.720
it natively mmm and so there's some
another interesting thing which is just

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:35.730
another interesting thing which is just
 

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.000
another interesting thing which is just
that darts one of the Doug darts goals

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.010
that darts one of the Doug darts goals

that darts one of the Doug darts goals
is danger act with the Dom needed to be

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.050
is danger act with the Dom needed to be
in very much an alternative the

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060

it's a plug-in architecture it's very
 

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.440
it's a plug-in architecture it's very
much asynchronous too what's going on on

00:43:52.819 --> 00:43:52.829
and so it's just very different you
 

00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:54.710

there's a lot of shared memory between
those processes and and so if you really

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:03.850
those processes and and so if you really
 

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.610
those processes and and so if you really
want to measure the memory usage of a

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:05.620
want to measure the memory usage of a
 

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.240
want to measure the memory usage of a
complex system the the gold standard way

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:09.250
complex system the the gold standard way
 

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.950
complex system the the gold standard way
of doing it there's a page on chromium o

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960
of doing it there's a page on chromium o
 

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.360
of doing it there's a page on chromium o
argh I can't remember exactly where it

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:12.370
argh I can't remember exactly where it
 

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:14.520
argh I can't remember exactly where it
is that describes how to do this which

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:14.530
is that describes how to do this which
 

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.620
is that describes how to do this which
is basically you you get a system you

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:16.630
is basically you you get a system you
 

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.040
is basically you you get a system you
have to completely qui a sit you look at

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:19.050
have to completely qui a sit you look at
 

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:23.010
have to completely qui a sit you look at
how many pages of RAM or actually in use

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:23.020
how many pages of RAM or actually in use
 

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:26.100
how many pages of RAM or actually in use
and then you run your experiment and you

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:26.110
and then you run your experiment and you
 

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:27.390
and then you run your experiment and you
ask the operating system okay how many

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400
ask the operating system okay how many
 

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.250
ask the operating system okay how many
pages of RAM are actually in use now

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:29.260
pages of RAM are actually in use now
 

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.750
pages of RAM are actually in use now
because some of the memory that's

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760
because some of the memory that's
 

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.220
because some of the memory that's
allocated by the browser is actually

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:32.230
allocated by the browser is actually
 

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.230
allocated by the browser is actually
held in kernel space some of its shared

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240
held in kernel space some of its shared
 

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.940
held in kernel space some of its shared
between multiple processes so you got to

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:35.950
between multiple processes so you got to
 

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.620
between multiple processes so you got to
make sure you count it exactly once and

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:37.630
make sure you count it exactly once and
 

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:38.910
make sure you count it exactly once and
so you basically have to look at it from

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920
so you basically have to look at it from
 

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.590
so you basically have to look at it from
the whole operating system layer and

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:40.600
the whole operating system layer and
 

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.960
the whole operating system layer and
find out you know during your test what

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:42.970
find out you know during your test what
 

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:44.340
find out you know during your test what
was the beginning memory usage and what

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:44.350
was the beginning memory usage and what
 

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.620
was the beginning memory usage and what
was the end memory usage and and see

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:46.630
was the end memory usage and and see
 

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.690
was the end memory usage and and see
what that is and so so the first thing I

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:48.700
what that is and so so the first thing I
 

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.710
what that is and so so the first thing I
get frustrated because people keep

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:49.720
get frustrated because people keep
 

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.270
get frustrated because people keep
sending me these blog articles about

sending me these blog articles about
 

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.070
sending me these blog articles about

thing we found out as we make chrome

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:03.190
thing we found out as we make chrome
 

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:06.000
thing we found out as we make chrome
faster and make it use less memory which

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:06.010
faster and make it use less memory which
 

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.640
faster and make it use less memory which
we have over the years people open more

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:08.650
we have over the years people open more
 

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.070
we have over the years people open more
tabs and web applications use more RAM

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:11.080
tabs and web applications use more RAM
 

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.490
tabs and web applications use more RAM
which is another problem but anyway well

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:14.500
which is another problem but anyway well
 

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.050
which is another problem but anyway well

now now growing and I think one of our

00:49:33.099 --> 00:49:33.109
now now growing and I think one of our
 

00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:34.839
now now growing and I think one of our
responsibilities is improving the

00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:34.849
responsibilities is improving the
 

00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:37.329
responsibilities is improving the
developer tools so that developers can

00:49:37.329 --> 00:49:37.339
developer tools so that developers can
 

00:49:37.339 --> 00:49:38.980
developer tools so that developers can
diagnose these problems more easily and

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:38.990
diagnose these problems more easily and
 

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:40.900
diagnose these problems more easily and
we've been adding a bunch of things to

we've been adding a bunch of things to
 

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.130
we've been adding a bunch of things to
chrome dev tools to help users

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:42.140

developers find memory leaks and to
 

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:47.020
developers find memory leaks and to
identify large growth and to fix those

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:47.030
identify large growth and to fix those
 

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:49.359
identify large growth and to fix those
problems yeah and I think the other

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:49.369
problems yeah and I think the other
 

00:49:49.369 --> 00:49:51.309
problems yeah and I think the other
thing is is you know users I don't think

00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319
thing is is you know users I don't think
 

00:49:51.319 --> 00:49:52.690
thing is is you know users I don't think

to try to UM you know one of the really

to try to UM you know one of the really
cool things about the web is that that

00:51:51.819 --> 00:51:51.829
cool things about the web is that that
 

00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:53.049
cool things about the web is that that
you can just get up and using that

00:51:53.049 --> 00:51:53.059
you can just get up and using that
 

00:51:53.059 --> 00:51:54.669
you can just get up and using that
application very quickly and then only

00:51:54.669 --> 00:51:54.679
application very quickly and then only
 

00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:56.709
application very quickly and then only
sort of bother the user with with

00:51:56.709 --> 00:51:56.719
sort of bother the user with with
 

00:51:56.719 --> 00:51:58.719
sort of bother the user with with
prompts when they actually want to you

00:51:58.719 --> 00:51:58.729

know get access to some capability and

00:52:00.969 --> 00:52:00.979
know get access to some capability and
 

00:52:00.979 --> 00:52:03.249
know get access to some capability and
so we're excited about you know as we've

00:52:03.249 --> 00:52:03.259
so we're excited about you know as we've
 

00:52:03.259 --> 00:52:05.019
so we're excited about you know as we've
been doing for a while adding more

00:52:05.019 --> 00:52:05.029
been doing for a while adding more
 

00:52:05.029 --> 00:52:07.509
been doing for a while adding more
capabilities to the web and I think that

00:52:07.509 --> 00:52:07.519
capabilities to the web and I think that
 

00:52:07.519 --> 00:52:09.039
capabilities to the web and I think that
that whole home screen things is an

00:52:09.039 --> 00:52:09.049
that whole home screen things is an
 

00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:11.169
that whole home screen things is an
important part of like giving web apps

00:52:11.169 --> 00:52:11.179
important part of like giving web apps
 

00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:13.630
important part of like giving web apps
that that presence on the on the launch

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640
that that presence on the on the launch
 

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.549
that that presence on the on the launch
surface that the user is going to and

00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559
surface that the user is going to and
 

00:52:15.559 --> 00:52:17.259
surface that the user is going to and
then think about you know launching an

00:52:17.259 --> 00:52:17.269
then think about you know launching an
 

00:52:17.269 --> 00:52:20.349
then think about you know launching an
app that the permissions problem does it

00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359
app that the permissions problem does it
 

00:52:20.359 --> 00:52:21.729
app that the permissions problem does it
doesn't necessarily have to be coupled

00:52:21.729 --> 00:52:21.739
doesn't necessarily have to be coupled
 

00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:23.679
doesn't necessarily have to be coupled
to the way in which you launch the

00:52:23.679 --> 00:52:23.689
to the way in which you launch the
 

00:52:23.689 --> 00:52:26.140
to the way in which you launch the
application yeah i think the the core

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:26.150
application yeah i think the the core
 

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:29.109
application yeah i think the the core
challenge that we face is really

00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119
challenge that we face is really
 

00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:31.029
challenge that we face is really
squaring the security model of the web

00:52:31.029 --> 00:52:31.039
squaring the security model of the web
 

00:52:31.039 --> 00:52:33.039
squaring the security model of the web
with the capabilities app developers one

00:52:33.039 --> 00:52:33.049
with the capabilities app developers one
 

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:35.109
with the capabilities app developers one
right we need to be safe to click on

00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119
right we need to be safe to click on
 

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:37.449
right we need to be safe to click on
links but app developers want then

00:52:37.449 --> 00:52:37.459
links but app developers want then
 

00:52:37.459 --> 00:52:40.329
links but app developers want then
access to everything and so I think that

00:52:40.329 --> 00:52:40.339
access to everything and so I think that
 

00:52:40.339 --> 00:52:42.309
access to everything and so I think that
is that is the hardest problem we we

00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319
is that is the hardest problem we we
 

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:43.900
is that is the hardest problem we we
always deal with things like these

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:43.910
always deal with things like these
 

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:45.759

standards basically we don't want to
 

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.740
standards basically we don't want to
take away the prefix until we we are

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:16.750
take away the prefix until we we are
 

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.240

it's a very much a community effort I
think one of the guys from Intel is very

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:30.670
think one of the guys from Intel is very
 

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:33.450
think one of the guys from Intel is very
involved in doing some of the work to

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:33.460

getting to a point where we can take
 

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.520
getting to a point where we can take
away WebKit prefixes and you know we

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:41.530
away WebKit prefixes and you know we
 

00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:43.200
away WebKit prefixes and you know we
might keep the WebKit prefixed version

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:43.210
might keep the WebKit prefixed version
 

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:44.790
might keep the WebKit prefixed version
around for quite some time because

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:44.800
around for quite some time because
 

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.099
around for quite some time because
there's there's a process for

there's there's a process for
 

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:49.680
there's there's a process for

00:55:53.339 --> 00:55:53.349
can take a while yeah I think even
 

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:54.780
can take a while yeah I think even
