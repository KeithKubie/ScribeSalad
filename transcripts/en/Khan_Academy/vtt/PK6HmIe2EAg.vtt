00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:06.433
Sal: ATP or adenosine triposphate
is often referred to as

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:11.567
the currency of energy, or
the energy store, adenosine,

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:16.233
the energy store in biological systems.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.900
What I want to do in this video is get

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.966
a better appreciation of why that is.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.633
Adenosine triposphate.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.833
At first this seems like
a fairly complicated term,

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.300
adenosine triphosphate, and
even when we look at its

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.434
molecular structure it seems
quite involved, but if we break

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.634
it down into its constituent
parts it becomes a little bit

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:40.566
more understandable and we'll
begin to appreciate why,

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:45.000
how it is a store of energy
in biological systems.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.900
The first part is to break
down this molecule between

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.767
the part that is adenosine
and the part that

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:53.366
is the triphosphates, or
the three phosphoryl groups.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.033
The adenosine is this
part of the molecule,

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.167
let me do it in that same color.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:02.966
This part right over here is adenosine,

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.233
and it's an adenine connected to a ribose

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.500
right over there, that's
the adenosine part.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.833
And then you have three phosphoryl groups,

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:16.166
and when they break off they
can turn into a phosphate.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:22.500
The triphosphate part
you have, triphosphate,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.767
you have one phosphoryl
group, two phosphoryl groups,

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:32.233
two phosphoryl groups and
three phosphoryl groups.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.966
One way that you can conceptualize
this molecule which will

00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:39.233
make it a little bit easier
to understand how it's a store

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:44.366
of energy in biological systems
is to represent this whole

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.967
adenosine group, let's just
represent that as an A.

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:50.100
Actually let's make that an Ad.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.900
Then let's just show it bonded to

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.300
the three phosphoryl groups.

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:59.033
I'll make those with a P
and a circle around it.

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:02.166
You can do it like that,
or sometimes you'll see it

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.100
actually depicted, instead
of just drawing these

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
straight horizontal lines
you'll see it depicted

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.766
with essentially higher energy bonds.

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:12.900
You'll see something like that to show

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.367
that these bonds have a lot of energy.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:22.700
But I'll just do it this way
for the sake of this video.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.500
These are high energy bonds.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.833
What does that mean, what does that

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:29.833
mean that these are high energy bonds?

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:33.100
It means that the electrons
in this bond are in a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.700
high energy state, and if
somehow this bond could be

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.633
broken these electrons are
going to go into a more

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:42.834
comfortable state, into
a lower energy state.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:45.500
As they go from a higher
energy state into a lower, more

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.166
comfortable energy state they
are going to release energy.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:52.433
One way to think about it
is if I'm in a plane and

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:55.233
I'm about to jump out I'm
at a high energy state,

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:56.700
I have a high potential energy.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.967
I just have to do a
little thing and I'm going

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:00.633
to fall through, I'm going to fall down,

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.566
and as I fall down I can release energy.

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:06.500
There will be friction
with the air, or eventually

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.766
when I hit the ground
that will release energy.

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:13.101
I can compress a spring
or I can move a turbine,

00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:14.501
or who knows what I can do.

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.233
But then when I'm sitting on my couch

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:18.367
I'm in a low energy, I'm comfortable.

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:23.966
It's not obvious how I could
go to a lower energy state.

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:26.166
I guess I could fall asleep
or something like that.

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:29.167
These metaphors break down at some point.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.900
That's one way to think
about what's going on here.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.501
The electrons in this bond,
if you can give them just

00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:39.301
the right circumstances they
can come out of that bond

00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:43.301
and go into a lower energy
state and release energy.

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:46.166
One way to think about it, you start

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:50.834
with ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:56.833
And one possibility, you put
it in the presence of water and

00:03:56.833 --> 00:04:00.033
then hydrolysis will take
place, and what you're going to

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:03.766
end up with is one of these things
are going to be essentially,

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.967
one of these phosphoryl
groups are going to be

00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:10.700
popped off and turn into
a phosphate molecule.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.966
You're going to have
adenosine, since you don't

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:16.633
have three phosphoryl
groups anymore, you're only

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:18.966
going to have two phosphoryl
groups, you're going to

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:24.233
have adenosine diphosphate,
often known as ADP.

00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:25.166
Let me write this down.

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:29.741
This is ATP, this is ATP right over here.

00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.966
And this right over
here is ADP, di for two,

00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:38.700
two phosphoryl groups,
adenosine diphosphate.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.034
Then this one got plucked
off, this one gets plucked

00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:49.367
off or it pops off and it's
now bonded to the oxygen

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:53.073
and one of the hydrogens
from the water molecule.

00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:56.366
Then you can have another hydrogen proton.

00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:59.433
The really important part of
this I have not drawn yet,

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.100
the really important part of it,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.366
as the electrons in this
bond right over here go into

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:12.033
a lower energy state they
are going to release energy.

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:16.233
So plus, plus energy.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.767
Here, this side of the reaction,

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:23.566
energy released, energy released.

00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.300
And this side of the interaction

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.900
you see energy, energy stored.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.366
As you study biochemistry
you will see time and time

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:37.233
again energy being used in
order to go from ADP and

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:40.300
a phosphate to ATP, so
that stores the energy.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.966
You'll see that in things
like photosynthesis

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.166
where you use light energy to essentially,

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:47.900
eventually get to a point
where this P is put back on,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.367
using energy putting this P
back on to the ADP to get ATP.

00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:57.233
Then you'll see when biological
systems need to use energy

00:05:57.233 --> 00:06:01.300
that they'll use the ATP
and essentially hydrolysis

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.234
will take place and they'll
release that energy.

00:06:03.234 --> 00:06:05.701
Sometimes that energy could
be used just to generate heat,

00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:08.234
and sometimes it can be
used to actually forward

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:12.366
some other reaction or
change the confirmation of

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:17.829
a protein somehow,
whatever might be the case.
