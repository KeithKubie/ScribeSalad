00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:02.794
- All right, gents.

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:04.504
We all know that when
you're forging a blade,

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.423
a nice, rectangular piece of
steel is a good place to start.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.591
But we'd like to make
it more challenging.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.302
So instead, you'll be choosing
the steel that you use

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:14.723
today from this burning barrel.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.224
John, you're up first.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:19.102
Please choose your steel.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.979
I hope and pray
that I'm going to get

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.480
something easy to work with.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.691
Whatever I choose, I hope
I'm familiar with it.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.488
Those are cubes of 1095.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.158
I was excited
that it was 1095.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.745
I was not excited that it was
cubes, shaped like a pyramid.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:42.041
Your first round challenge
is to forge a hatchet.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:47.046
Your hatchets must be between 6
and 8 inches from butt to edge,

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:50.592
and your edge must be
between 4 and 6 inches.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:53.553
Make sure you stick
to those parameters.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.846
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.848
Your three hours starts now.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.770
We've got four different
types of steel, so

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.565
four different configurations.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.943
My first step is to
isolate a single cube,

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.236
and then I take
it to the grinder

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.739
and start cleaning it up.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.200
I think one of those
little bitty cubes

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.368
is going to be enough
steel for a bit.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:23.291
The high carbon bit is going
to go where the edge will.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:27.504
I'm going to grab a
rectangle of mild steel.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:31.007
I'll draw out the mild
steel to form the jacket,

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.425
and then insert the bit.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.677
And it's just a simple
forge weld from there.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:39.641
One hour has elapsed!

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.560
That leaves you two hours
remaining to finish your work.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.861
John has a massive chunk of
mild steel over a big bloom.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.448
Yea, John's probably gonna end
up with more steel for his body

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.616
than he's going to need.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.909
At first, it's
going pretty well.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.915
Oh, that's ugly.

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:07.919
[groan] Gotta start over.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.546
Things weren't
lining up very well.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.214
I started off with
too much metal,

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.841
and then I took some off.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.802
It was still too much.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.471
So I just cut my losses
as quickly as I could,

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.015
and started on another piece.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.184
The first one was too big.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.604
This smaller jacket is
going a whole lot better,

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:31.568
but the clock is starting
to catch up with me.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.570
Two hours has elapsed!

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.406
You have just 60
minutes remaining.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.704
John's setting his welds.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.622
It was difficult
starting over,

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:47.083
but so far things
are going a lot

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.502
smoother than the first time.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:59.053
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:02.348
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines and drop your tools.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.268
This round is over.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.477
All right, bladesmiths.

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:07.812
In this first round
of competition,

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.522
you were to make hatchets.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.566
Now it's time for
the judges to take

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.359
a closer look at your work.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.944
Aaron, young man,
you're up next.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.911
There is a lot of meat here.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.455
There's going to be a lot
of weight on the shaft.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.918
Your alignment isn't bad, but
you've got a bow right in here.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.712
I'm a little worried about
how long your edge is here.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.838
Yes, sir.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.173
All right, John, you're up.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.799
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.556
Yeah, that's lean.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.974
The shape is really aggressive.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.476
Good fighter.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.062
Not that great on a tool
ax, but but for a thrower,

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.563
or a fighter, pretty nice.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:51.856
It looks solid.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:55.610
Super sounds solid,
so very well done.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.986
All right, JC, you're up.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.154
Please present your
hatchet to the judges.

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.746
I like the overall
size of the eye.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.290
That will allow for
a good size handle.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.211
But with all the mass back
here, none of it up there.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.422
I mean, you drew this down to--

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:19.592
that's less than an
eighth of an inch.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.344
Bladesmiths, at the
end of this round,

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.222
each of you was to have
turned in a hatchet head--

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:27.684
an edge that was between
4 and 6 inches in length.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.352
Now, two of you have done that.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.188
Matt, John, you guys will be
moving on to the next round.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:36.067
Aaron, JC, both of your
edges came up short.

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.610
The bladesmith
leaving the forge is--

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.199
JC.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.909
Your blade didn't make the cut.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.953
J Neilson is going
to tell you why.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.913
At the end of the
day, there's not

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.208
enough material left to be able
to correct the parameter ratio.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.043
And that's why we're
sending you home.

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:55.044
JC, please surrender
your hatchet.
