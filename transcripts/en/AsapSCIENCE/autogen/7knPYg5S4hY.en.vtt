00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.380
 This episode is supported by 23andMe (23 and I) 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.040
 There are currently 7.5 billion people living on Earth 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.860
 who 323 million live in the United States 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.280
 As global power, many have views on American livelihoods. 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.400
 But what do the statistics say, 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 and what would happen if we all lived as Americans? 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.000
 First you would have done more sex. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.220
 Studies show that Americans have sex on average 138 times a year 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 which is the second highest in the world after France. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 Porn would be more than 73% of porn in the world is produced in America. 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.460
 Americans drive the 13th mile and four hundred and seventy-six miles (13,476) miles a year, 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 which is the largest in the world. 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.040
 This explains why they have the world's highest car crash rates 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.960
 and the number of meals eaten in the car 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.769
 Seriously. Statistics show that 20% of American meals are consumed in a vehicle. 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.560
 Americans eat on average 8 ounces of meat every day 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.920
 which is almost twice the world's average. 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.580
 This leads to the killing and eating of 10 billion animals annually by Americans, 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.360
 which is 15% of the world's total consumption. 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.500
 The average American also drinks 403 Coca Cola products every year 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.740
 compared to the world average of 92. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.460
 All this leads to the US having the highest total calorie intake, 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.480
 getting sugar, and getting the fat 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.220
 compared to all the other 16 richest countries. 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.620
 But consumption is similar in one category: fruit and vegetable consumption. 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.940
 And all this eating leads to fertilizers, 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.720
 Americans throw 1.6 billion pounds and 220 million car tires annually. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.200
 An American individual produces 729 kg of fertilizer each year 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.520
 of which 544 kg are organic waste. 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580
 This means that the population of America 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.780
 which is roughly 5% of the world, 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.380
 draws 40% of the world's waste. 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.420
 For most of the world, the lifestyle of Americans meant to live longer. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.480
 The US life expectancy is 82.1 for women, and 77.5 for men. 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.260
 But it's still ranked 42th in the world after other industrialized nations like Australia and Canada. 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.560
 This is possible because these countries have publicly funded health care better. 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.420
 The average age in the United States is 37.9 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.080
 which means if you would divide the entire population of America into two equal groups, 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.740
 half of the people would be younger than 37.9, 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.340
 and the other half would be older. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.240
 America is characterized as having an aging population 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.600
 as the average age of the world is 30.1. 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.000
 Nigeria has the lowest average age of 15.3, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.340
 compared to Japan, where aging can become a problem 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.880
 as their average age is 46.9. 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.400
 An American's lifestyle requires about 10 liters of oil each day. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.900
 But some other developed countries consume more on average, such as canadje, 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.880
 who use 10.2 liters each day, 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.680
 while some of the smallest consumers of oil are the citizens of Bangladesh 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.240
 who use 0.1 liters every day. 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.240
 A direct way to measure the impact of the world 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.100
 changed to American livelihood is using global hectare. 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.480
 This measurement looks at how much land, sea and other natural resources are needed to produce 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.280
 what each person consumes each year. 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.080
 For example: eating rice, buying furniture, or clothes they wear. 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 An average man in the world uses 2.7 acres worldwide every year. 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.000
 The highest is the livelihood of citizens in Kuwait who use 8.9 hectares worldwide every year, 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.820
 With the US a little behind using 6.8 acres worldwide every year. 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.840
 With the amount of CO2 (carbon dioxide) freed from this, 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.300
 studies indicate that we would need another half of Earth 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.280
 to absorb it at a safe pace. 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.500
 But some other studies suggest that these are underestimates. 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.940
 So you can imagine whether we would all live like Americans, 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.800
 it would be catastrophic. 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.660
 In fact, we would need 4.1 Earth to keep everyone living as Americans. 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.479
 We thank 23andMe for sponsoring this video. 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720
 If you wanted to understand your DNA, 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.280
 and to see where your ancestors came from, 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.320
 or as your DNA influences physical features and health 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.740
 then check 23andMe / asap 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.840
 We have tried it ourselves and discovered that Greg has a large share of DNA from the Netherlands, 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.480
 while Mitch discovered why he liked pizza so much. 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.060
 All that needs to be done is to blot in a tube, 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.560
 and they will analyze 23 couples of chromosomes 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.280
 from which the name has also come. 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.440
 Again go to 23andMe / asap 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.760
 to find out more about yourself.
