MICHEL DEGRAFF: So one of
the major goals of the course

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.190
is for-- because we all speak
a language, or sometimes

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.326
many languages.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:14.950
And what the students
get to understand

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.340
at the end of the courses
is that we all hold dear

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.140
to an attitude about language.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.880
And some of the
attitudes are positive,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.470
for us and for others.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.780
But oftentimes-- and this
is actually one of the major

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.655
issues that we discuss
throughout the course,

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:28.543
is that--

00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:30.084
sometimes we have
attitudes that have

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:33.880
a negative impact, severe
negative impact, on the lives

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.910
of other people, the life of
sometimes entire communities

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.200
and nations.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.890
So I hope throughout that,
students can actually

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.400
take this theory that
is in the course,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.095
and see ways in which
they can apply it

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:49.180
to themselves, to
their communities,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.470
to their countries.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.260
So clearly, the case that
I have in mind the most

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.930
is my own Haiti, where
attitudes about language

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.040
have been one of the
engines that have really

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.260
gone against the interests
of most Haitians,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.490
that have allowed a few
to keep the majority,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.160
and the oppression.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.280
But then-- this is true
also for the communities.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.660
So I was very pleased to
see that the students took

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.480
that objective very
dearly, and including

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.560
some who, in the
course of this class,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.570
have applied what
they've learned,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.310
and taking it outside,
including volunteering in, say,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.950
the dual language program
that just started in Boston.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.920
It's a dual language
program promoting

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.710
the use of books in
Creole and English,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.980
and where students are
immersed from kindergarten

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.020
in both Creole and English.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.650
And now there's a student who
took that class, my class,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.970
and was volunteering in that
classroom-- for Kindergarteners

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.750
who were learning in
Creole and in English.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.350
And to me, that's a
dream because it's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.320
one case where what
you learn in the course

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.590
can be directly applied in
the real world context, which

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.719
can make actual positive change
in the lives of these children.
