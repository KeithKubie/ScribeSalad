JAMIL MOLEDINA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:03.657
I'm Jamil Moledina from
the Google Play team.

00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:05.490
Glad you could all stick
around for the end.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.050
We've got a really
fun session here

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.320
for you anchoring the
end of the session.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.510
To my left is Mike Festa, who
is the director of Wayfair Next,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.350
and Tatsuo Nomura, who is
the senior product manager

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.990
on Pokemon GO from Niantic.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.930
And you know, that kind
of is the official titles.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.350
But of course, there's so much
more to what you actually do.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.900
I'm wondering if you can give
us a little bit of a background

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
about your road to
get here, and what it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.240
is that you're actually doing.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.480
Starting with you, Matt.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.612
MATT FESTA: Yeah.

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:38.112
Absolutely.

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:39.720
Thank you again for having us.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.860
So I work at Wayfair.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.110
We sell furniture online.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.960
And I created the team
called Wayfair Next.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.910
It's essentially
the R&amp;D department

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.650
internally at Wayfair.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.550
And we were looking at cutting
edge technologies, like Tango

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.062
and Daydream, for AR and VR.

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:57.270
And I think it's a great fit.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.244
Because we're selling
products online.

00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:00.160
We don't have a store.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.789
You can't come in and see
the couch and sit on it.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.830
But this is, I think, one
of the next best things

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.660
that we can offer.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.410
And so I started my
team about a year ago.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.290
It was kind of coming off of
a successful hackathon using

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.140
the Google Tango
development kit.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.570
And people internally
got excited about it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.550
and said, you know,
let's make a team

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.639
and make this an
important endeavor for us.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.930
JAMIL MOLEDINA: But taking
it a little bit further back

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.430
in time.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.660
How did you get
inspired with AR?

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.180
What was it that was interesting
that got you on that track

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.740
to even present it
in the hackathon?

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.040
MATT FESTA: Oh sure.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.540
Yeah.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.097
So I've always been
interested in AR and VR,

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:33.930
as long as I can remember,
since being a kid

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.980
and seeing all these promises
of VR and virtual worlds.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.190
And "The Matrix" is a
big inspiration for me.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.760
I feel like I've been following
the technology for a long time.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.470
I was one of the early
founders or backers of Oculus,

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.089
before they did a Kickstarter.

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:53.380
And I've been playing with
these types of technologies.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.350
So when I saw the Tango
video, I naturally

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.850
signed up immediately.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.580
And I had a Tango devkit, but
I hadn't had the opportunity

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.427
to really take the time
out of my personal life

00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:05.010
and actually write an app or do
something interesting with it,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.790
even though I really wanted to.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.597
And so then the Wayfair
hackathon came up.

00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:10.680
And I said, I know just
the thing I'm going to do.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.590
And that's use
this AR technology

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.004
to show how it can apply to
what we do and sell furniture.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.170
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Makes sense.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.620
Tatsuo, how about you?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.390
What's your story?

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.280
TATSUO NOMURA: So
I studied in Japan.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.900
I went to grad school in Japan.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.460
And after I graduated,
I joined Google Japan.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.000
And then I spent about a year
there as a software engineer.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.160
Then I moved to us to Google
headquarters in Mountain View.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.400
And I joined Google
Mobile Maps team.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.700
And then after that, I
joined this internal startup

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.380
called Niantic 9 which
later became Niantic.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.000
That's how I got involved.

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:56.250
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Now,
you had the good fortune

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.070
to become involved with a
company that was already

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.230
working in AR.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.112
Mike, your situation
is probably more

00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:05.070
familiar to a lot of the
folks in the audience,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.990
where you're working
with a company that

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.900
has a business on Google Play.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.700
But you wanted to bring
AR to the product.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.970
How did you-- I mean, so you
had this successful hackathon.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.310
How did you go about
working with your management

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.722
to develop an AR product?

00:03:23.722 --> 00:03:24.930
MATT FESTA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.900
So it can be a tough sell for
a product that doesn't exist,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.900
that may never exist, that's out
there in this kind of prototype

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.710
form.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.690
But I think what really
sold it internally

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.420
was that the key benefit--
or the differentiator

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.210
between this technology and
what we have currently--

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.700
was so profound that it
really enabled the shopping

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.220
experience at home to be
better than at the store.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.809
So when you think about, I want
to buy a new couch-- you've

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:47.850
got to measure the space.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.710
You've got to figure out how
it's going to fit in your home.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.090
Then you've got to
go to the store.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.930
You've got to see the product.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.157
Imagine it in your space.

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:54.990
And oftentimes, you go
to a furniture store,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.310
and it's like huge ceilings.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.740
And you get the big,
spaced out things.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.590
And the giant couch looks small,
until you get it in your home.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.120
And then you realize
it's too big.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.360
So I thought that was a great
use case for us, to say,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.300
here's the exact product
in your space fitting

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.040
exactly as it needs to fit.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.830
And I think the
long-term vision for that

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.720
is that this technology
is going to be

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.649
in every phone in the next
five years, let's say.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.190
And we want to be
ahead of the curve.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.904
We want to start producing
3D models and 3D content,

00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:25.320
so that by the time everybody
actually has the technology,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.825
our entire catalog is covered.

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:28.200
JAMIL MOLEDINA:
That makes sense.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.530
I mean, a lot of people hesitate
to buy furniture online.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.480
I actually did buy
a couch on Wayfair.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.202
But I can imagine
a lot of people

00:04:35.202 --> 00:04:36.660
would kind of
stumble through that,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.368
not being able to
place it in their home.

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:38.760
MATT FESTA: Right.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.740
And it's only about
7% of furniture sales

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.240
that happen online today.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.340
It's one of the
last remaining brick

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.640
and mortar businesses that
is still not going to online.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.220
We've seen in the
last decade, or even

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.384
almost two decades, more
and more consumer goods

00:04:56.384 --> 00:04:58.800
going online, especially things
that you don't necessarily

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.674
need to see or touch.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.997
Like if you need to order
batteries or paper towels,

00:05:01.997 --> 00:05:03.580
it's easy to just
buy those on Amazon.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.455
Because you know exactly
what you're getting,

00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:07.230
especially repeat
purchases like that.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.520
With furniture, it's
a little different.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.270
It's very unique.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.120
It's personal.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.062
You care about how it looks.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.770
And I think one of
the interesting things

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.610
that Wayfair offers
is a huge selection.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.550
So we have over 7
million products.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.660
And any taste and style
that you can think of,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.657
we have that product online.

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:24.490
Versus the traditional
store where you go in

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.119
and what you see
is what you get.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:27.910
Basically there's a
limited amount of space

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.430
you can put the product in.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.440
Yet it's only 7% right now.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.910
And I think part
of the barrier is

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.451
that you want to
see exactly how it's

00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.740
going to look in your space.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.906
And then you want to be
able to sit on and touch it.

00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:40.410
And that's another, even more
future-facing technology.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.286
But I feel like, you
know, one win at a time.

00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:43.160
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Yeah.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.300
MATT FESTA: And getting
the AR use case of this

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.710
is how it's going
to look is only

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.080
going to accelerate
that shift online.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.510
JAMIL MOLEDINA: So opening
up that larger market was

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.372
something that you
kind of identified.

00:05:53.372 --> 00:05:55.080
Now Tatsuo, one of
the things that you've

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.220
been working on-- so granted,
Niantic was already into AR.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.930
But working with Pokemon was
something that you already

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.666
had an experience with.

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.290
Could you talk a
little bit about that?

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.165
TATSUO NOMURA: Right.

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:12.090
So as I explained, I was
working for Google Maps team

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.500
before joining Niantic.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.180
And every year, we would do
this April Fools project.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.000
"Project"-- I mean, it's
more like a joke thing.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.640
In 2012, we did this thing
called Google Maps 8-bit.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.610
Basically, we turned the whole
map into a classic video game--

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.880
Nintendo theme.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.960
That was my project.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.360
And that went pretty well.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.950
And everybody loved it.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.430
Since then, people started
to ask me to do April Fools.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.500
And the following year,
we did another one.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.470
It's called Google
Maps Treasure Mode.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.730
So basically we turned the map.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.870
It now leads to a
treasure map looking.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.910
And we hid like monsters
and treasures for people

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.410
to look for.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.260
And then the
following year, that's

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.410
when I started working on Google
Maps Mobile, the Android Maps.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.320
And we were talking about
what to do for April Fools.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.370
And I came up with this idea.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.610
What if I have the
Pokemon on the maps?

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.190
I played a lot of video
games growing up, of course.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.630
You know, "Pokemon," "Street
Fighter," "Final Fantasy,"

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.770
all these games.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.620
And every year, I was
thinking in terms of gaming.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.010
So that year I came up with
the idea of doing Pokemon.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.200
And we did this on
the Google Maps.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.060
And that got pretty-- we
generated a quite big buzz.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.660
And at the same time, there
was this internal startup

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.000
called Niantic
Labs within Google

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.670
that John Hanke was leading.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.910
And Niantic had a
product-- still has

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.910
a product-- called Ingress,
which is an AR game where

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.220
you go outside to play.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.390
And he contacted me
after the April Fools.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.240
So he asked, Tatsuo, do you
think we can do something

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.930
with Pokemon?

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.430
You know, Pokemon
in the real world?

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.990
Whether that would make sense.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.520
And of course, right?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.980
Because I played the
game when I was little,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.440
I watched all the anime,
all the movies, right?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.670
I basically was imagining
myself having this fantasy

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.910
that I am Ash and going
out to catch them all.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.070
So that immediately clicked.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.560
So I took John to go to Japan
to meet the Pokemon people.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.900
There's a company called
the Pokemon Company.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.520
They own the IP.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.390
So we went there.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:38.700
We introduced Ingress and the
concept of real-world gaming.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.880
And they very much
loved the idea as well.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.860
That's how we started.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.140
We decided to do this together.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.600
And we started the project.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.430
JAMIL MOLEDINA: I
mean, the natural fit

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.860
seems to be a really
common characteristic here.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.110
Because the original
Pokemon game

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.970
has you finding Pokemon in
the world and capturing them.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.310
And of course, you know,
placing furniture in your home

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.720
is what you
naturally want to do.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.180
It seems that having that
fit to what people want to do

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.840
was a really kind of
driving factor, as opposed

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.372
to the technology for
the technology's sake.

00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:13.080
MATT FESTA: Yeah.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.630
And I think companies that
want to embrace AR just

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.940
for the flash or
for the buzz-- they

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.440
might have some initial
interest or success.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.700
And I think that's great
and exciting to get out

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.110
there and experiment with it.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.920
But at the end of
the day, you have

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.378
to make sure you're answering
a core business need as well.

00:09:28.378 --> 00:09:31.050
It's like, how can this
technology make our offering

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.130
better to the company?

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.880
Or how can we make our gameplay
more engaging or interesting?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.920
And as long as you're
solving those problems,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.594
then I think you'll be
successful in the long run.

00:09:40.594 --> 00:09:41.510
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Great.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.017
So--

00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:42.850
TATSUO NOMURA: Yeah.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:43.840
I mean totally.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.090
So I think for Niantic,
our mission is "adventures

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.660
on foot with others."

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.390
So what we are
really trying to do

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.960
is not necessarily
this gimmicky AR thing.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.870
What we're trying to do is
to bring people to outside,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.740
to explore, to exercise, to
communicate with other people.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.000
That's our core value.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.470
And we achieve that
by using this AR that

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.130
happened to be the
right timing and right

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.524
fit for the IP and everything.

00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:15.190
JAMIL MOLEDINA: So
it sounds like you're

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.220
more about enriching
the lives of the people

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.260
playing and using the apps.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.720
I mean, it's
providing something.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.250
The technology is simply a tool.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.910
But what you're actually trying
to do is enrich their lives.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.280
TATSUO NOMURA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.370
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Cool.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.710
MATT FESTA: Yeah.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.560
Definitely.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.600
So you know, since
you're both the product

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.362
owners of your
respective app and game,

00:10:34.362 --> 00:10:36.820
I'm wondering if we could have
a little bit of a discussion

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.940
about what the design and
production and development

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.290
challenges were.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.050
So let's take design first.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.330
So was there something
about your hypothesis

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.490
of the design of each
of your products,

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.370
that you found along the
way you needed to change?

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.140
Or that you learned
in the process

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.876
of creating needed to be
changed in terms of the design?

00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:56.542
MATT FESTA: Mhm.

00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:57.250
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.210
So one of the things we like
to do now is open office hours.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.862
So at the end of the week on
Fridays from 3:00 to 5:00,

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:04.570
we invite people
throughout the company--

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.000
we have 3,000 employees in
Boston-- to just come up

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.440
and play around and
see what we're doing.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.110
And that's been
great user testing.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.029
Because we can get
this hands-on test.

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:15.820
Especially with Tango,
where it's something

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.726
we can't just send out
to people's devices.

00:11:17.726 --> 00:11:19.600
We actually have to see
them interact with it

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.310
and give them the device.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.960
But getting outside
of engineering,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.300
and getting people that
are working with products,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.460
and they're shopping
at home, and they're

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.560
organizing these
categories-- getting

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.680
them to use the app was really
rewarding and interesting.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.760
And I think we iterated a
lot on the UI and the design

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.670
based on those conversations
and that feedback.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.230
And working with people,
just giving them the device

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.230
and not saying anything.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.100
Saying, go.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.370
Use it.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.860
Seeing where the pitfalls
were, what gestures

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.200
work-- like for example, we
had a two-finger rotation thing

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.700
first.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.370
So you swipe left and right
to rotate the product.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.530
No one could figure that out.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.540
We realized everyone
was trying to circle--

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.840
do the circle rotate-- even
though it didn't necessarily

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.031
match what we were thinking.

00:12:03.031 --> 00:12:05.530
And when we switched to that,
we found that people naturally

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.350
got it a lot faster. in So
in little things like that,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.729
I think the user
testing goes a long way.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:11.770
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Right on.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:12.620
Tatsuo?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.830
TATSUO NOMURA: I guess for
us, one of the big things

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.450
is when we started
the project, we

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.560
thought we could just have
the Pokemon running around

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.600
on the map.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.727
We tried it.

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:22.810
Obviously, it didn't work.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.270
Because we have to-- I
have to-- as a player,

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.890
running around
chasing Pokemon just

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.190
doesn't work in the real world.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.920
That's something we found out.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.860
But in terms of
design, because it's

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.890
a game we expect people
to play in the outside,

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:41.440
we really tried hard to make
the whole gestures or UI

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.260
reachable from your thumb.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.860
That's why the Pokemon
game-- you open

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.800
and most of the
major tasks you can

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.140
accomplish by just one finger.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.960
That's something we
tried really hard.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.160
And with that, we-- there's
one unique gesture in our game

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.520
where you can use one
finger to rotate the map.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.370
Even internally,
we had some debate.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.700
Some people were
thinking, that is not

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.500
something people are used to.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.850
Maybe we should not do it.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.260
But after we implemented and
tested with various people,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.880
everybody liked it.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.350
And we decided to do that.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.220
So there are a lot of-- like
what you said-- trial and error

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.215
during the process.

00:13:22.215 --> 00:13:23.590
JAMIL MOLEDINA:
But in your case,

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.964
though, it seems like there
was quite a bit more involved

00:13:25.964 --> 00:13:27.550
with the throw mechanic.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.245
So I mean, people of all
ages-- kids, my parents--

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:33.370
I mean everyone seems to
naturally get that and get

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.600
a lot of thrill out of that.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.130
But it wasn't a
very simple thing.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.700
Right?

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:36.850
TATSUO NOMURA: Right.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.640
Yeah.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.140
Yeah.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.120
That part actually
was pretty hard.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.360
Even-- if you're thinking it's
just flicking your finger,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.420
how hard that is?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.850
But it took-- I think we did
three or four iterations just

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.660
to get it right.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.360
Because on the phone,
different people

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.190
have different phone size and
have different resolution.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:00.250
So to make it work
across the devices-- that

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.930
was very challenging.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.850
I think we can still improve it.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:10.760
But one of the things
that really was difficult

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.150
is the rate of the sampling.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.750
We're using Unity in our app.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:24.870
The Unity sampler has
some room for improvement.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:30.785
So we had to work around it to
make sure that when you flick,

00:14:30.785 --> 00:14:33.370
it goes-- it's a
2D mapping to 3D.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.090
So making sure that you feel
like you are doing it right.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.400
JAMIL MOLEDINA: OK.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.700
Now you're working with
Tango for the first time.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.370
AR is still a relatively
new technology.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.435
Did you encounter any impact
to your production schedule,

00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:52.840
or to your budget, in kind
of working through some

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.020
of the kinks of AR?

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.080
MATT FESTA: I don't
know that we had.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.204
I mean, our team's a little
bit unique in the sense

00:14:58.204 --> 00:15:00.500
that we're a dedicated R&amp;D team.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.770
So it's kind of
expected that we're

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.390
going to be hacking
things together

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.430
and working with teams.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.250
Like Google, for example,
was working closely with us

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.520
to identify issues for
the Tango Core and things

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.510
that the device was
doing at a lower level.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.890
And so that was, I think,
for us, going into it,

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.700
kind of expected.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.280
We weren't looking for
this perfect out-of-the-box

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:21.880
solution.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.120
It was more like, OK.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.170
We're going to be investing
R&amp;D into cutting edge tech.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.110
So one of the things
that comes with that

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.295
is this kind of unknown
around development time.

00:15:33.295 --> 00:15:35.320
In general, as an
engineer, I find

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.820
that a lot of times
it's really hard

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.907
to estimate how long
a particular task is

00:15:38.907 --> 00:15:39.490
going to take.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.130
Because you might come
to a quick conclusion.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.619
Or something might just work.

00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:44.410
And that's awesome.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.942
But a lot of times it doesn't.

00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:48.400
And then you have to kind of
investigate, and pick and poke

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.010
and figure out why
something that isn't working

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:51.610
isn't working.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.536
And then eventually you
get to your solution.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.910
And it's great to
be an engineer.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.700
It's fun to get
that eureka moment.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.325
But there's a lot of
time where there's

00:15:58.325 --> 00:16:01.570
that kind of unknown window
of, is this going to work?

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.980
Am I doing the right thing?

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.530
Is this our code or
is this Google's code?

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.642
Is this a device problem?

00:16:07.642 --> 00:16:09.100
And I think a lot
of that stuff has

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.350
been ironed out at this point.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.200
Which is great.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.020
But over the last, let's
say, eight months or so,

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.390
while we were doing
the core development,

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.600
it was one of those things
that we just kind of kept--

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.070
trial and error,
see what worked,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.920
and try to make changes
and improvements.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.550
And now it's super-solid.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.639
So it's been great.

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:28.180
JAMIL MOLEDINA: What would you
recommend to people developing

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.260
AR with Tango?

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.490
What would you suggest that they
plan for the core development

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.112
window?

00:16:33.112 --> 00:16:33.820
MATT FESTA: Yeah.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.361
I mean, I think the
first thing to do

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:38.110
is to actually just get a device
in your hands, in your office.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.030
And start showing people
some of the existing

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.690
apps that are out there.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.270
And then with that device,
have your developers--

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.621
you know, we use Unity.

00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.870
I think a lot of companies do.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.790
These guys are
using Unity as well.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.200
Try the Unity toolkit.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.017
Because Google provides a
great starting point in Unity,

00:16:53.017 --> 00:16:54.850
where you can basically
plug in your device.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.550
Load up the sample apps.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.525
Make some changes.

00:16:57.525 --> 00:16:59.650
So for my hackathon, that's
essentially what I did.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.324
I used the Google AR code.

00:17:02.324 --> 00:17:04.240
And I actually spent
more time on my hackathon

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.859
just drawing and
modeling the products

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.442
so that they looked
good than actually

00:17:07.442 --> 00:17:11.361
worrying about the room mapping
and the AR portion of it.

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.569
Unity just gives you a camera
that follows the device

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.099
as you move it around.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.300
So I think that's the
great way to get into it.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.617
Just experiment with it.

00:17:18.617 --> 00:17:20.950
And if you feel like there's
a match for the technology,

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.810
then think about, OK.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.400
What's the core product
that we're going to develop?

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.430
And it's not that unlike
developing for Android

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:31.420
or developing for gaming,
in terms of the technology.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.500
Because Google handles most of
the underlying learning portion

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.370
of it for you.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.782
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Right on.

00:17:37.782 --> 00:17:38.740
Tatsuo, what about you?

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.359
I mean, were there
any stumbling blocks?

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.400
TATSUO NOMURA: Let's see.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.240
So because we started
as-- Niantic is always

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.450
focusing on AR.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.370
So it's not like bringing
in AR will affect us.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.790
We started as an AR.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.970
But I can talk a little
more about the specifics.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.880
Like for example,
the camera overlay--

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.000
you have the Pikachu standing
in front of the camera,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.870
and then react to your Gyro.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.110
That is actually not
that hard, right?

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.580
It's pretty rudimentary.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.700
So you just put
your object there.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.700
Of course, we have
to do some tuning

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.905
to make sure it
looks good and works.

00:18:17.905 --> 00:18:19.905
You know, depending on
what size of the Pokemon,

00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:22.420
it looks correct and everything.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.500
But that part wasn't very hard.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.920
But another major
component of Pokemon GO

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.800
is these PokeStops and Gyms.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.580
Those are real-world locations.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.250
Like probably this
one-- there are

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.930
a lot of PokeStops
around this area as well.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:48.710
We collected all this data for
the past three, four years,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.840
with Ingress.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.550
So Ingress users would submit
this what we call portal data.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.380
When we started
Pokemon GO, we already

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.040
had like a
multi-million locations.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.640
That's something I think we
took a long time to build up.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.430
But once we have it,
that is a foundation

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.887
we had to have in order
to build Pokemon GO.

00:19:09.887 --> 00:19:12.220
MATT FESTA: I think that
brings up an interesting point.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.850
And that's around the content.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.120
And so the development
of the app is one thing.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.820
But the development
of the content

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.440
can then also make or break your
business model or your plan.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.690
And that's one of the things
that we found at Wayfair.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.790
We sell 7 million
products, as I mentioned.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.420
And we started this without
having really any 3D models.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.480
For my hackathon, I was
drawing stuff in the office.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.390
And one of the reasons that my
team was able to get created

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.630
was because internally, we had
discovered that for our photo

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.370
studio, we're basically
taking in products,

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.340
setting them up nicely,
taking a picture.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.690
And that whole process was
relatively slow and expensive.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.310
Internally, one
of our co-founders

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.590
was working on a new
project to basically make

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.520
3D models of the products
for use in 3D renderings.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.890
So they came up with
this business use case

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.650
that, oh, we can, for
a fraction of the cost,

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.700
render out a product.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.620
And then we have that
3D product for use

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.840
in the future, for
whatever other environment

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.650
we want to pull it into for
these photorealistic catalog

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.510
shoots.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.980
So because they were creating
the 3D content for that,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.990
it enabled my team to basically
say, we have 3D models.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.430
Now we can do AR.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.650
But without 3D
content, in our case,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.630
we wouldn't have
really had anything.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.280
And so making the
app is one thing.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.000
But supporting it with content
is in some cases the larger

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.900
challenge.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.899
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Was that
an internally developed

00:20:26.899 --> 00:20:27.510
3D modeler?

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.180
MATT FESTA: So what
we did is added up--

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.959
we were using various
outsourcing opportunities.

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:36.000
And now we're partnering
with different companies

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.115
that specialize in 3D
content production.

00:20:38.115 --> 00:20:39.120
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Great.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.580
MATT FESTA: And so on average,
it costs about $25 for us

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.590
to model a 3D product.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.560
And it's cost savings
over the photography.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.320
But my team is also
developing a 3D scanning

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.820
technology that I
think will further

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.880
drive down costs, and
ultimately push that technology

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.190
into the hands of our
suppliers and vendors

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.590
that have the products
in their facilities.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.480
And they can do that for us.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.297
So I think ultimately, when
we think about AR and VR,

00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:05.130
a lot of it's going to
be about the content.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:10.040
And people need to think about
the 3D aspect of the content.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.059
In a lot of ways, this is like
the web in the early days.

00:21:13.059 --> 00:21:15.600
When you wanted to start selling
stuff online, it's like, oh.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.370
What do I need to sell a
product on the internet?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.160
I need a picture.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.732
I need some descriptions
and pricing.

00:21:19.732 --> 00:21:20.565
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Sure

00:21:20.565 --> 00:21:22.856
MATT FESTA: And I think if
we want to sell stuff in AR,

00:21:22.856 --> 00:21:23.860
we need a 3D model.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.860
And that's something that
in some cases, exists.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.350
Because it's drawn in CAD.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.180
But in other use cases,
it doesn't, like in ours.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.340
For most of our products,
they don't exist in 3D.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.230
So that's an
additional challenge

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.730
that we've been
trying to address.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.200
And I think over
the next few years

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.616
we'll see the
technology get there

00:21:38.616 --> 00:21:40.770
so that almost every
product is going

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.450
to have a 3D representation.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.270
But think about your
application and what content

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.020
you're going to need for it.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.260
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Yeah.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.759
And it sounds like
Unity was helpful

00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:50.594
to you as well in that process.

00:21:50.594 --> 00:21:51.360
MATT FESTA: Mhm.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.943
JAMIL MOLEDINA:
Tatsuo, I'm wondering,

00:21:52.943 --> 00:21:57.300
were there any third party
tools or outsourcing resources

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.040
or anything else
happening around you

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.490
guys that was helpful to you,
that you basically relied on

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.457
in some capacity?

00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:04.290
TATSUO NOMURA: Yeah.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.820
So the 3D models, right?

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.960
Leg We had this 3D model
from Pokemon company.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.605
Because they already created
these 700 and more creatures.

00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:15.480
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Sure.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.310
TATSUO NOMURA: We
have that already.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:21.180
And in terms of tools, we use
Unity, as I described before.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:27.180
And on the client side, we
also developed our own plugin

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.550
to render the map.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.720
And on top of that,
on the back end,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.447
our servers use Google Cloud--

00:22:36.447 --> 00:22:37.280
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Yes.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.196
TATSUO NOMURA: Google
Cloud Engine, excuse me.

00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:39.810
Yeah.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.830
And that definitely enabled
us to scale the game

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.490
to the scale we have today.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.140
And the Google team has been
really, really supportive

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.710
to us.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.860
So yeah.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.780
We've been grateful.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.849
MATT FESTA: As have we.

00:22:55.849 --> 00:22:58.140
JAMIL MOLEDINA: So actually,
let's jump to that moment.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:03.930
So Tatsuo, your game
comes out on a Friday,

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.450
without featuring,
without anything.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.429
Walk us through what happened
that day in your office.

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:10.470
TATSUO NOMURA: Let's see.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:14.840
We launched the game in New
Zealand and Australia first.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.840
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Oh, yes.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.339
Yes.

00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:20.160
TATSUO NOMURA: We didn't
do any advertisement.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.850
Because we were worried that
we will get too much traffic.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.600
We wanted to expand it slowly
to make sure our servers don't

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.750
melt down.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.250
So we started in New
Zealand, Australia.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.890
When you push the
bottom on Google Play,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.030
it takes a couple minutes--
or actually longer,

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.920
like an hour-- to propagate.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.800
And for people to find
out, it takes a lot longer.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.900
So we just clicked
on the button.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.060
And we started
monitoring the graph.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.230
And nothing happened
for a while.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.000
And we were like,
eh, are people--

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.300
we became a little bit
nervous, watching the graph.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.070
But after a couple
hours, we started

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.140
to see the graph just
going up and up and up.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.490
It doesn't stop.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:05.580
Just keep going up.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.940
And the next morning,
we came to the office.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.610
And our engineering manager--
I'm the product manager.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.820
Our engineering
manager announced

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.410
that if we keep this rate, we're
going to have like-- anyway,

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.000
a crazy number of users.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.600
And we were still--
the previous day,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.930
we were still looking at
the graph didn't move much.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.400
And we were a little skeptical.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.180
We're like, no.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.280
We're not going to
get that many users.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.850
But during the day, the
graph just keeps going up.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.220
And we started
seeing online, people

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.400
started to do this
event among themselves,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.840
like user-organized events.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.570
In Sydney, we saw like
3,000 people just gathered.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.260
Started walking, crawling
the city, to catch Pokemon.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.760
And that's when I
think we found out

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.580
this is going a little
crazier than what we expected.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.930
And that's the day, actually--
the following day after the New

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.870
Zealand Australia launch,
we launched in the US.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.760
And after we launched it, I
went back home from the office.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.600
And that was, I think, right
after we clicked the button.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.400
I just went back home, after
monitoring for like 20 minutes.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.730
And I bumped into this person
who was holding the phone

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.060
and doing this.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.930
And immediately I knew she
was playing Pokemon GO.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.450
And I was so happy that
I couldn't stop myself.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.990
You know, I just
walked into her.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.290
I asked, are you
playing Pokemon GO?

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.480
I think I probably
looked really creepy.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.560
Because I was all smiles on my
face, and asking about her--

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.460
how do you like it?

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.500
And how do you find
it and everything?

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.730
And a few days later, we
saw the Pokemon crawl happen

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.330
in San Francisco as well.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.990
There were like about 5,000
people gathered in the market,

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.070
walking from the Ferry Building.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:59.310
I joined them as a user.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.710
And I see everyone was cheering.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.720
And a lot of people had cosplay
in Pokemon and the teams.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.745
That was really, really
a happy moment of mine.

00:26:09.745 --> 00:26:10.620
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Yeah.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.970
That was extraordinary.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.740
We were talking
about this backstage.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.220
We remember where we were
when Pokemon exploded.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.910
And certainly in terms
of our relationship,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:27.000
we were-- Maria Essig and I
were noticing that everyone

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.150
around us was playing it.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.150
We go out on the street.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.450
Everyone is playing it.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.470
So that speaks to a
very specific metric

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.570
that is important to Niantic.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.330
So conventionally,
we're always talking

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.400
about installs and revenue.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.900
But there's also
something else that

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.816
is as important, if
not more important,

00:26:45.816 --> 00:26:46.940
that you guys are tracking.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.340
Right?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.173
TATSUO NOMURA: Yeah.

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:49.440
Absolutely.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:55.470
I mean, in terms of downloads
and the traditional stats,

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.290
I think in September we had
like 500 million downloads.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:00.450
That is a great number.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.710
But there's a very
unique number to us.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.610
Up to, I think, September,
we had that people walked

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.990
a total 4.6 billion kilometers.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.160
I don't know how
many miles is that.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.450
But that's like
from here to Pluto.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.820
It's a crazy number.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.880
So that number is
very, very unique,

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.410
and I think important to us.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.680
Because what we are trying to
do is really-- our core value

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.480
is to take people outside.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.461
Exercise, communicate,
and be healthier.

00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:33.960
Right?

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.220
That's what we are
trying to really do.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.960
You know, the game is
just a form of expression,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.680
if you will.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:48.600
And we also keep articles and
hearing from other people--

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.000
like we see people
in the hospital using

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.210
Pokemon GO in the
hospital to help

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.120
kids doing physical therapy.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.930
And we also see examples of
kids suffering from autism

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.240
were able to use Pokemon
GO to communicate

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.990
with even strangers.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.640
And that is really
just-- I feel very

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.770
happy that I can have
some impact to someone's

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.870
life in a positive way.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.680
And recently I think it
was Stanford and Microsoft.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.510
They published a study
saying that Pokemon

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:32.130
GO users-- we extended
Pokemon GO players' life

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.300
expectancy by like 43 days.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.290
MATT FESTA: Wow.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.900
TATSUO NOMURA: So all
those numbers, I think,

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:45.235
are very important to us
than the traditional stats.

00:28:45.235 --> 00:28:46.110
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Yeah.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.240
It sounds like it has
more to do with caring

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.290
for the people playing your
game than actually tracking

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.820
conventional metrics.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.849
And you know, in a
funny way this also maps

00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:57.640
to what we were talking
about a little bit.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.070
It's not so much about
the installs for you

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.750
either, at least at
an initial level.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.862
How are you guys measuring
impact and success?

00:29:06.862 --> 00:29:07.570
MATT FESTA: Yeah.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.750
So certainly we have
the long-term view

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.540
that this technology is
going to be there eventually.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.500
And we want to start building
our 3D product catalog.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.680
And the devices are
just available now.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.490
I have one of the
Lenovo devices here.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:21.690
So you can buy them now.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.270
And it will be interesting to
see what the adoption rate is

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.740
for that particular device.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.180
But no one's expecting any
ROI on what we've done so far.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.730
It's like, oh, this is an
interesting experiment.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.639
And in the long term,
we see the value.

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.930
In the short term, it's been
a lot more about publicity

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.970
for the company and
just showing that we're

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.196
a forward-thinking tech company.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.570
Oftentimes, you
think of Wayfair,

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.528
you think of furniture.

00:29:43.528 --> 00:29:45.210
You think of the
shopping experience.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.940
But at our core, we consider
ourselves a tech company

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.610
that happens to sell furniture.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.750
And so I think by doing
this type of initiative,

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.380
it's a great way for not
only recruiting but also

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.790
community awareness
that oh, Wayfair's

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.350
a tech anchor in Boston.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.840
And these guys are doing some
really interesting stuff.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.640
And then they learn
about what we're doing.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.890
But then there are so many other
interesting things internally

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.348
that are going on,
like in our data

00:30:06.348 --> 00:30:09.750
analytics and other
teams that are building

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.040
all kinds of crazy products.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.050
And this is kind of like a
way to get people's attention

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.662
and then show a lot of
publicity for the company.

00:30:17.662 --> 00:30:18.870
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Sounds great.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.080
So I'm gonna take a
slightly different tack now.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.800
So both of your
products are out.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.875
Let's pretend I'm
Q. You're Picard.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.450
I have the ability
to redo your mission.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.700
Let's go back to the
beginning of your mission.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.020
What would you do
differently now,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.982
based on what you know,
having shipped your product?

00:30:42.982 --> 00:30:43.690
MATT FESTA: Yeah.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.430
So for me personally,
it goes back

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.562
to that kind of
product model category.

00:30:48.562 --> 00:30:50.270
And now that we get
the device out there,

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.040
we have 10,000
products digitized.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.260
Seeing those products,
it's like, oh,

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.020
I wish we had 3D scanned
all of them, for example.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.720
We're hand modeling
the products.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.940
And that leaves a certain sense
of artistic design, let's say.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.660
Because basically
the 3D modeller

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.630
is looking at photo references.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.340
And they're not necessarily
looking at the real products.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.320
They're just looking at
photos of that product.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.690
Whereas the 3D scanning
technology we're developing

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.140
is millimeter accurate
looks photorealistic.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.901
And it's an actual great
representation of the product.

00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:22.900
So I'm really excited
about the future for that.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.250
But I wish we could have
done that from the beginning,

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:29.170
rather than had this
intermediary step of hand

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.260
modeling all the products.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.020
But the scanning technology
is something that's

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.060
constantly being developed.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.130
Google had an internal
scanning company as well,

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.380
that I guess got the
axe, unfortunately.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.510
But it's one of those
technologies that's really

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.784
promising for the right product,
and then really challenging

00:31:44.784 --> 00:31:45.700
for the wrong product.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.600
Like this end table
wouldn't scan well.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.560
Because it's all white.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.740
And when you try
to reconstruct it,

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.620
there's no good references
to get it looking good.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.470
So we're working on
techniques to kind of enhance

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.420
the scanning process.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.050
But I wish we could
have had that--

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.690
what we have today--
a year ago, and what

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.206
we're going to have in a year
two years ago, basically.

00:32:05.206 --> 00:32:06.080
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Yeah.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.930
That ottoman with
the geometric print

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.376
really presented well
that you were showing me.

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:11.042
MATT FESTA: Mhm.

00:32:11.042 --> 00:32:11.120
Yeah.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.220
So that was a nice one.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.845
Again, that was a
hand model, actually.

00:32:13.845 --> 00:32:16.579
So it was an artist that
kind of put together what

00:32:16.579 --> 00:32:17.870
it looked like based on photos.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.090
And not to discredit
the modelers--

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.620
they do a great job of making
the products look amazing.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.840
But I feel like one of the big
things we're trying to push

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.660
is that super-accurate--
this thing is exactly how it

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.150
fits in your space.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.590
And I think you lose some of
the detail and the precision

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.840
by doing the hand modeling
approach versus the 3D

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.100
scanning approach.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.140
So it's one of those
things that we still don't

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.370
have a perfect solution for.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.110
But I wish, if I
could go back in time,

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.890
we had what we have
now, or even better,

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.810
to use that to build our 3D
models from the beginning

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.150
from 3D scan data.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.430
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Fair enough.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.930
Tatsuo?

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.200
TATSUO NOMURA: So
if you were Q, I'd

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.072
probably ask you to just
give me a real Pikachu.

00:32:56.072 --> 00:32:57.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.190
But if the only thing
you do is reset the time,

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:05.150
I guess what we would
have done is we probably

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:10.620
would have increased our
server capacity to begin with,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.440
to the scale that we have today.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.300
That's one thing we would do.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:21.910
But in terms of other things, I
think we just launched the game

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.000
just a few months ago.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.920
We still planned a lot of
things that we haven't even done

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.620
or haven't even gotten to yet.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.680
So I don't think there's
things I would do differently,

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.365
except the server portion.

00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:37.240
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Yeah.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.676
You're kind of beginning your
adventure now, aren't you?

00:33:39.676 --> 00:33:40.786
TATSUO NOMURA: Yeah.

00:33:40.786 --> 00:33:42.160
JAMIL MOLEDINA:
So last question.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.130
I want to kind of take
our official hats off.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:49.490
Looking at it from the point of
view of being pioneers in AR,

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.914
where do you, Tatsuo and
Mike, think AR is going?

00:33:53.914 --> 00:33:54.830
Or where should it go?

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.130
Or what are the forces that
need to change in order

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.640
to bring about an AR future that
you see as rewarding in five

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.654
years or so?

00:34:03.654 --> 00:34:04.570
MATT FESTA: All right.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:04.750
Yeah.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:05.467
I'll start.

00:34:05.467 --> 00:34:08.050
So this is something I've been
thinking about most of my life.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.510
And Google's been doing a
lot of interesting animation

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.280
in the space of
mapping the world, when

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.010
you look at what's going on
with Google Earth, for example.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.659
I think with AR technology,
we can bring that

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:21.590
to interactive, street-level
technology, essentially.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.139
So when we're scanning a space,
we can present that space in,

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.320
let's say, virtual
reality, for example.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.880
And we can have this
interaction using

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.530
AR with people that are in
the same space, but in VR.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.056
So they could teleport
there and be there with us.

00:34:35.056 --> 00:34:36.639
We can walk around
the street together

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.719
and look at different things,
or pull in different objects.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:42.639
So I think this idea of
augmenting the world,

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.790
and creating a data
set-- a rich data set

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:49.429
that lives on top of the
real space that we're in--

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:51.916
will enable us to connect
better with people

00:34:51.916 --> 00:34:54.290
both in the real sense, where
we're both together looking

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.949
at a thing or a landmark, but
also with a third person that

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.960
could be somewhere else in
VR, experiencing it with us.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.140
So I'm excited for
that type of technology

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.410
that's coming from
the combination of 3D

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.940
scanning, augmented reality,
and virtual reality.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.970
And big data-- to be able
to serve all of this data

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.010
so that we can actually
get to that point.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.560
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Sounds awesome.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.360
Tatsuo?

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.470
TATSUO NOMURA: I think
the technology's just

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.700
emerging right now.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.200
The Tango is coming out.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.690
Next year I guess there will
be new devices coming out.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.610
But even going a lot
further, eventually--

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.800
and hopefully, I
think-- the device

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.990
will become so
small that you don't

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.850
know if someone is wearing it.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.950
And you'll be able
to basically--

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:41.530
you won't be able to know
whether this Pikachu or that's

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.936
Q messing with you.

00:35:44.936 --> 00:35:47.900
And I guess everyone
around my age--

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.680
or there are a lot of game
developers here today,

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.430
I think-- imagine, or have this
fantasy that you become a hero,

00:35:55.430 --> 00:36:00.570
or do things that you won't
be able to do in real life.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.415
But with the AR technology, you
can become something, right?

00:36:05.415 --> 00:36:07.140
It could be a Pokemon trainer.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.580
It could be-- I'm not a big
fan of first person shooter.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:16.120
But if you wanted, you can do
that kind of game play as well.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.740
So I think there are a
lot of interesting things

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.160
we can do in terms of
entertainment gaming.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.880
But besides that,
like what-- I'd

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.060
like to wear my official
hat a little bit.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.110
What Niantic is
trying to do is really

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.070
thinking about how we can
improve people's lives.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:40.910
So not only doing these tricks.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.450
But using the AR, how
can we actually augment

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.940
people's lives--
realities-- if you will.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:55.360
So that's the area I think
that will evolve a lot as well.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:02.900
Like, if you can have this AR
thing-- a more advanced version

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.930
of what we do today--
the local real world

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.300
is actually very interesting,
even your neighborhood.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.150
What we try to do
for you to discover

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:14.660
these things, little things like
a landmark in your neighborhood

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.280
you never visited, or a
restaurant on the corner

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.740
that nobody knows.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:24.910
With AR technology, you can
guide people to those places.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.700
That would actually enhance,
augment, their reality.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.940
I think that's where the
AR technology should be

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.071
or will be going to.

00:37:33.071 --> 00:37:34.820
JAMIL MOLEDINA: That's
a beautiful vision.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.280
I think that's part
of what everyone in AR

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.220
has this opportunity to do,
is to bring people together

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.469
in the real world.

00:37:44.469 --> 00:37:46.760
I think that's probably the
best note for us to end on.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.389
Thank you both for joining us.

00:37:48.389 --> 00:37:49.430
TATSUO NOMURA: Thank you.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.730
MATT FESTA: Yeah.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:50.730
Thank you for having us.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.080
[APPLAUSE]
