WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.750
Okay.
So,
um,
we'll,
uh,
get started on the great gas man.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.860
Um,
you know,
I'm sure that you guys have your own,
um,

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.050
views,
uh,
on,
on the novel,
So,
you know,
uh,
something to,

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.830
um,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.830
so what I'll be talking about today is in some sense I'm kind of more of focus

6
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:24.350
or sharp edge take on guest space,
uh,

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.790
which you certainly free to dispute.
I'm in section,
uh,

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.890
but I want to begin with Maxwell Perkins and his name actually came up last

9
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.670
time,
uh,
when Fitzgerald read the,
in our time stories,
um,

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.590
the Paris addition,
um,

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.890
the person who wrote to was Maxwell Perkins to say that he's the real thing.

12
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:48.310
You have to get him.
Um,
so mental Perkins obviously very,
very important.
Um,

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.000
I would say that he really is the muse of the 1920s,
um,

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.570
till the mucilage doesn't have to be a woman,

15
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:59.250
doesn't have to be a romantic relation.
He's just very,
very good reader,

16
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.810
careful reader,
critical reader,
as well as say.
Um,

17
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.850
and this is a book about Maxwell Perkins and his three sons,

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.300
um,
Fitzgerald on the,
uh,

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.480
left Hemingway in the middle.
And,
um,
Thomas Wolfe,

20
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.660
I'm on the right and these people wrote to him constantly.

21
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.720
I mean he really was their manager and Muse to all three of them.

22
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.050
And so Hemingway and Fitzgerald have done in common as well that they have is

23
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:37.290
great to have an editor that you know,
you're both responding to.
Um,

24
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.520
so anyway,
um,
Maxwell Perkins,
um,

25
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.920
was the one who read the initial drafts of the Great Gas Bay and this is what he

26
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.550
said.
Um,
November 20th,

27
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.550
1924 Gatsby is somewhat vague to readers' eyes,

28
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
can ever quite focus upon him,
his outlines by them.

29
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.950
Now everything about gas VA is more or less than mystery.

30
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.870
Are you more or less vague?

31
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.010
And there's maybe somewhat of an artistic intention,

32
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.800
but I think it is mistaken.

33
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.760
Couldn't he be physically described as distinctly as the others and couldn't do

34
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.150
add one or more one or two countries stakes like the use of that phrase.

35
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.780
Some board,
not verbal,
but physical ones claps.

36
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.760
So very upfront about what he likes in this case,
what he doesn't like.

37
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.850
Um,
and he's also giving us the terminology,
uh,

38
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.730
to the loose terminology vagueness to think about the great Gatsby.

39
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.110
And this is what Fitzgerald says back in turned December 20th and 24 strange to

40
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:53.790
say,
my notion of great Gatsby is vagueness was,
okay,

41
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.710
this is a complicated idea,
but I'm sure you understand,

42
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.590
I know gas being better than I know my own child.

43
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.460
My first instinct after your leather was to let him go and have Tom.

44
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:13.090
You can dominate the book,
but the gas based sticks in my heart.

45
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.750
I had him for a while then lost him.

46
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.470
And now I know I have again just a wonderful keynote.

47
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.520
I think that this can have a better description of and all this relation to his

48
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.300
creation.
Um,

49
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.050
and I think that this is actually probably quite common,
you know,

50
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:36.280
feeling that you know,
this character better than you know,

51
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.230
your family members.
Um,

52
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.520
but in this case also being quite deliberate and stubborn,

53
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.230
um,
not in,

54
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:49.231
not giving into Maxwell Hook in the suggestion that he should make gas be less

55
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.943
vague.

56
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.390
And one other quote from Fitzgerald to Perkins,

57
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:59.350
this is much later than 1940.
Um,

58
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.510
I wish I was in print.

59
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.900
It will be odd of the year or so from now with Scott starting his daughter for

60
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:08.110
shows her friends,

61
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.620
I was an author and finds that no focus is procure a panel with a 25 cent press,

62
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:21.250
keep gasping and the public by,
or is the boat unpopular,

63
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.820
hasn't had this chance but to die so completely and unjustly after having given

64
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:29.620
so much.

65
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.250
Even now there is a little published in American fiction that doesn't slightly

66
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.440
bear my stem in a small way.

67
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.150
I was an original.
It's really heartbreaking that um,

68
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.270
that Fitzgerald and sending never knew that the great Gatsby would become the

69
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:53.370
contract boat that it is.
I mean they will be totally flabbergasted.
Um,
he,

70
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:54.580
his idea was that,
you know,

71
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:58.900
this was something that would just completely disappear.
Um,
so,
you know,

72
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:03.880
I think there we can see several things from,
um,
from this exchange.
Um,

73
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.230
first,
um,

74
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.840
is that Fitzgerald really didn't know how he spoke,

75
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:14.900
was going to end up.
Um,
you know,
so it's completely a matter of,

76
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.290
of hindsight that we are able to say now that this is the American classic.
Um,

77
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.760
he didn't know that it wasn't a classic back then.
It was experimental.
Um,
so,

78
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.001
you know,

79
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:29.530
we shouldn't lose sight of the fact it was an experiment and he really didn't

80
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:34.310
know if it was going to come out well or not.
In fact,
his hunch,
um,

81
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.170
in 94,
there was that it was going to be a failure that it couldn't go nowhere,

82
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.810
that wasn't going to be picked up by anyone.

83
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.230
It was just going to all this effort,
this,
um,

84
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.270
so much given to the novel,
all that was going to come to nothing.

85
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.340
So I think that this in itself,
uh,

86
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.100
suggest to us the experimental nature that he was trying something new.
Um,

87
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.730
and because we are so used to it now,
it in some sense it stops being new to us.

88
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:06.731
So it's very important to go back to that original sense of things being in flux

89
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.840
and not being sure if this was the way things were going to go.
Um,

90
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.490
the other interesting point about this,
uh,

91
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.440
leather is that Fitzgerald said that in a small way,

92
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.710
I was in the original,
right.
So this is not actually model the state.
Um,

93
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.140
I think that he's very proud of the fact that in a small,

94
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.810
well let me know it is mother's Day too.
But you know,

95
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:33.470
I think that he's also taking pride in the fact that,
um,

96
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.500
his greatness resized in the small smallness that is really in the small details

97
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.420
or the great Gatsby,
um,
that he would most like to be read.
Um,

98
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.380
so we are very much operating on the micro register today.

99
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.390
Um,
respecting Fitzgerald says or what kind of a of a,
of an author.

100
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.620
Um,
he was,
um,
and while I like to do today,
um,

101
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.880
this is basically the outline for today's lecture,
um,

102
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.000
is to take the terminology,
uh,
from uh,

103
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.940
Maxwell Perkins fakeness and use a slightly more formal term,

104
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.920
um,
and also stretching it a little bit.

105
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:17.720
So the term I like to propose for us to consider today,
um,

106
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.210
as a kind of,
um,
synonym for Wagner's,
um,
is counter realism.

107
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.931
Um,
you know,

108
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:27.950
we know that there's a lot that in this room mistake and the great gas way,
um,

109
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.050
but there's also a strain of counter realism.
And maybe that's why,
um,

110
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.450
it gives the impression of being vague and,
um,

111
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.700
I like to tease out some of the,
um,
the,

112
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.160
the attributes are manifestations,
um,

113
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.270
of the counter real as a mode of writing.
Um,
first of all,

114
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.880
um,
and I will explain all this but this,
um,
the desire to,
uh,

115
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.510
Captain Lotion,
this is actually something,
um,

116
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.650
that was done in 19th century photography to Garrow type trying to catch them in

117
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.530
motion.
This was started actually,
um,
very much,
um,

118
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.540
by using machines and you know,

119
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.280
the early camera to capture motion.
And I think that,
um,

120
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.800
uh,
Fitzgerald was trying to do something like that,
integrate gas player.
Um,

121
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.350
and now they're,
um,
component of this counter realism is a,

122
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.370
the uncertain boundaries between animate and inanimate and related to that human

123
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:26.910
attributes,
properties of the,

124
00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:30.620
of human personalities are properties of the human body,
um,

125
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.160
being channeled or routed through our properties.
So the machine.
Um,

126
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.010
and then the two,

127
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.840
going back to our discussion of comedy and tragedy,
um,

128
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.870
there's a variety of high tech comedy and variety of hires had tragedy and

129
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:52.430
there's novel,
but they also interconnected.
So,
um,
let's first look at,
um,

130
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.450
what Fitzgerald is trying to do and motion a,

131
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.150
but I thought that I'll just give you a completely static image.
Okay.

132
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:03.390
Of the mansion.
Um,
um,

133
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.540
this is the Guggenheim managed,
um,

134
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.530
movie as we mentioned that she went to a wedding there at your friends,

135
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.540
your senior prom.
Okay.
Um,
so,
um,
and uh,
the,
so this is,

136
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:19.350
you can go and visit.
Um,
but,
um,
I mean this is the Guggenheim Mansion,

137
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.050
so you know,
is over the top.
Um,
but this is the nature of the,
you know,

138
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.680
of those managers,
um,

139
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.300
at cents point or East Asia where Tom and daisy,
uh,
live.

140
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.270
Um,
and so this is a very static,

141
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:37.800
very impressive but static image of a mansion.
Um,

142
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.470
let's see what,
how Fitzgeral,
um,

143
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.700
describes the,
uh,
that,
that,
uh,

144
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.760
you can mention

145
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.350
lawn started at the beach and ran to what the front lawn for quarter of a mile

146
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.580
jumping over sun dials and break was and burning gardens.

147
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:08.210
Finally when they reach the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though

148
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:14.481
from the momentum of this run is lately not a static disruption at all.

149
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.440
Um,
you know,
they,
they are,

150
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.740
there's a little bit of static description of what the house looks like,

151
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.250
but I think that this is really what jumps out at us is the translation of a

152
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:32.490
static physical object into motion.

153
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.230
This is not even trying to capture something that is actually moving,

154
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:37.860
uh,

155
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.860
but trying to attribute motion to something that is otherwise stationary and

156
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:47.910
static.
Um,
and um,
we don't know yet.

157
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:52.911
I mean this is quite early so we don't quite know why Fitzgerald would choose to

158
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:57.300
write in this way.
But definitely this is a very,
very deliberate way of writing.

159
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:01.470
So it makes sure that keep that in mind is that there's quite often a kind of

160
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.030
conversion conversion takes place all the time in Fitzgerald her,
we've see the,

161
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.900
he couldn't lose,
uh,

162
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.980
qualities are sung into visual images and he also can verse stationary objects

163
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.200
into moving objects.
Um,
so there's a quality of,

164
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.360
um,
this much suddenly much more dynamic.
Um,

165
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:27.270
but it also gives a sense that,
um,
even right here,

166
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.400
um,
we can say that it's almost as if the lion has agency,
right?

167
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.780
It's not just sitting there.
Um,
it's not just a Alonda there's mobilize on one.

168
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.660
Um,
it actually is start somewhere.
It goes some place.
Uh,

169
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.930
it jumps over things.
Um,
it generates its own momentum.

170
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.960
So the leaves we can say is that inanimate objects have live and motion in

171
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.583
agency.

172
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.890
And that has tremendous implications both for those inanimate objects and

173
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:05.320
possibly also animate objects like human beings.
You know,

174
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:09.810
when you have inanimate objects taking on the properties of Adam,

175
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.430
that human beings,
um,

176
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.090
what happens to the human beings who supposedly in possession of those

177
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:19.750
properties.
Um,
so,
you know,
this is just a kind of very,
you know,

178
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:22.300
this is not a dramatic moment.
Um,
it,

179
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.220
but it says a lot about the kind of strategy,
um,
the Fitzgerald uses.

180
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:27.940
Um,

181
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.940
so let's go on now and look more at the boundaries between the animate and

182
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:40.120
inanimate,
because I think this was really a kind of a major strategy,
um,

183
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.910
perform throughout the great gas.
Um,
so this is an image of corona,

184
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:50.500
which is the original,
uh,
for the Valley of ashes.
Um,
that,

185
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.370
um,
Fitzgerald describes some way and um,
this,

186
00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.280
there's no man's land,
um,
even in this kind of very desolate,

187
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.680
a visual image,
uh,
but still,
um,
you know,

188
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.710
still we can visualize a such a place.
Um,

189
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.310
there's lit as it is.
Um,

190
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.620
let's look at the way Fitzgerald describes this place.

191
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.270
About halfway between west a and New York,

192
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.630
the motor row hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for water of a mile,

193
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.180
so as to shrink away from the southern desolate area of land.

194
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.880
This is a valley of ashes.
A fantastic farm were ashes,

195
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:41.881
grow like weed into ridges and hills and grew tennis gardens were ashes.

196
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.200
Take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke.

197
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.030
And finally with the transcendent effort of men who moved,

198
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:56.050
move Lee and already crumbling through the powdery air,

199
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.500
occasionally align of gray cars,

200
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.650
cross long and invisible track gives out a ghastly creek and comes to rest.

201
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.220
And immediately to ask Raymond swam up with lead in space and stare up and

202
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.660
impenetrable Clough which screens of skill operations from your site?

203
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.710
I honestly don't know what Fitzgerald is talking about,

204
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:24.130
whether he's really talking about actual ash.

205
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:28.900
Gray men wore those men.
They don't look like people who work at gas stations.

206
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.050
We just don't know what they are.
Um,
so by the end,

207
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.080
by the time we get to the end of the passage to ontological status of the

208
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:43.930
passage is really in depth.
We don't know if this is just hallucination.

209
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.870
Um,
if this is an optical illusion or you know,

210
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:51.871
something even worse than that hallucination on a pot of nick.

211
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:58.370
Um,
so,
um,
the,
um,
we can now see,

212
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.270
um,

213
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.270
the fact that inanimate objects have agency and are capable of moving,

214
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.080
um,

215
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.030
that they tend to render the visual few free,

216
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.740
wildly a very shaky.
It's quite often our focus,
um,

217
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.270
quite often this like a camera than this moving is blurry image.
Um,

218
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.380
so we don't exactly know what we're looking at.
Um,

219
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.560
but even though we can exactly say we can name the thing that we're looking at,

220
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.700
um,
there is something grotesque about this scene,
right?
Just,

221
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.100
and the grotesqueness comes not so much,
uh,

222
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.250
from the landscape itself,
um,
in the original landscape.
You know,

223
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:45.910
it's just sad,
but it's not especially a grotesque.

224
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.250
The grotesqueness comes really completely from Fitzgerald's rhetoric,

225
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:57.070
from his rhetorical intensification of that landscape.

226
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.310
Um,
ashes growing like weed,
um,

227
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.220
and into ridges and hills and grotesque Gordon's ashes,

228
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.940
taking the form of houses and so on.

229
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.790
And maybe ash is turning into those ash gray man.
You know,

230
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:12.620
maybe they are just optical illusions.

231
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.300
They're not really biological human beings.
We don't know.
Um,

232
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.160
so it seems as if this kind of grotesque for candidate,

233
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.870
uh,
to inanimate objects,
ashes are capable of reproduction.

234
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.700
They're capable of reproducing themselves in a way that we tend to think that

235
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.260
only animate things are capable of doing right.

236
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:41.090
With reduction is not a property is now the prerogative of inanimate objects.

237
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.920
But here it seems as if it actually is within the province of enameled objects

238
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.360
to be grotesquely reproductive.
Um,

239
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.610
so this,
this,
this,
um,

240
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.450
already what we're beginning to say is the cons,
the right thing over,
um,

241
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:04.510
have a lot of the things that we had imagined to be on the human side,

242
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.800
the human side that you equation that all those things that we have,
um,
you know,

243
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:11.120
that are in our possession,

244
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:16.070
that we are the sole owners of all those things have been written over,

245
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:21.080
um,
to inanimate objects that may or may not be benign towards us.

246
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:25.410
We don't really know what the relation is between this inanimate objects,
um,

247
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:30.440
and us.
But there's another,
I think there's yet another twist to this,
um,

248
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.050
to this,
um,
passage.
Um,

249
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.480
and it has to do with a fury on obtrusive.
Uh,

250
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.200
but I will say nontrivial,
um,
phrase,

251
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.190
um,

252
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.190
which is the re the motor row hastily joins the railroad and runs beside for

253
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.100
quarter of a mile.
Um,
do you guys remember anything?

254
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.800
I'm hearing that phrase before

255
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.890
the law started and the beach and ran to what the front lawns or quarter of a

256
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:07.560
mile.

257
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.560
So this is the kind of verbal echo,

258
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.250
um,
bad of a very small battalion.

259
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.750
Did how Dan suggested those two passages are connected.
I mean,
you know,

260
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:26.751
we can really see what kind of a craftsman he is a genius in a small way,

261
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:30.330
but you know,
that's why he's so great,
um,

262
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.230
is that it's just this completely factual,

263
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.240
seemingly factual phrase that serves as the bond between those two passages.

264
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.980
So the suggestion was,

265
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.700
seemed to be that there's kind of an underside to that you can garden right in a

266
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.690
mansion grand mansion in the ons on,
um,
that this is really under sy.

267
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.530
Um,
and in fact,
the two of them actually have a lot in common.

268
00:18:55.531 --> 00:19:00.531
There's a lot of common ground and the live the strange and obscure but very

269
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.860
thorough,
um,
and managing live of the inanimate object,

270
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.480
which seem to be the common ground between those two.
So,
you know,
we,
we,

271
00:19:10.481 --> 00:19:12.650
we don't have to read very far,
um,

272
00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.410
into Greg Gatsby to know that there's something very wrong with that marriage

273
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:21.110
between Tom and daisy.
Um,
and,
um,
if this,
um,

274
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:26.270
the landscape itself suggests that the desolation is never really absent from,

275
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.830
from that household.
Um,

276
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.940
so I know that we are all thinking about Gatsby because really,
um,

277
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.310
Maxwell Perkins,
um,

278
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.940
objected mostly to the portrait of gas where the,

279
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.850
he's very vague.
So here is this 1974,

280
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.020
uh,
version,
um,
and Bali by Robert Redford of gas bed.

281
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:54.980
Um,
and you know,
as you say,
um,
when I see it as it is,

282
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.970
is,
is,
it's not,
I wouldn't say it's not,
not my image of guests.

283
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:00.120
We are,

284
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.630
but there's also not my image of Gatsby either because I really hadn't really

285
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:05.900
visualized,
gets me all that much.
So you know,

286
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.260
I have it from co funding in relation to this.
Um,
I mean is okay.
Um,

287
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.150
but I guess I really could do without him.
But anyway,

288
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:18.480
it's,
um,
it is,
uh,
interesting,
um,

289
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.310
kind of foil to what Fitzgerald is trying to do because I don't,

290
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.420
I mean,
you know,
suddenly was which you see the movie and everything,
but,
um,

291
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.520
the book is trying to do something very different.

292
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:33.620
It's not trying to create the Robert Redford like image,
um,
of gasping.

293
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.550
So this is,
um,
why,
um,
Maxwell Perkins,
um,

294
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.960
things that,
uh,
uh,

295
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.130
Gas Bay is vague it personality,

296
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.190
it's an unbroken series of successful gestures.

297
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.800
Then there was something gorgeous about him,

298
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:56.070
some heightened sensitivity to the promises of live as if he would relate it to

299
00:20:56.471 --> 00:21:01.471
one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away.

300
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.760
There's almost no physical description.
This is very early.
It's true.

301
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:08.020
We haven't seen Gatsby,

302
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.380
but there really is never a full flesh physical description of gas pay.

303
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.950
Um,
and is that we get this very,
very ugly,
very abstract,
uh,

304
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.930
descriptions of gas where,
um,
telling him,
telling us,
um,

305
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.030
about his person now are they are,
but not even suppliers with adjectives.

306
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.100
Um,
to name that.
So,
you know,
we can just look at the simple level of syntax.

307
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:36.910
Um,

308
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:41.910
is hedging is Securitas is in the condition.

309
00:21:42.151 --> 00:21:45.370
Old Hands,
right?
If begins with the word,
if,

310
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.830
if who's now at least on unbroken series.

311
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.480
So right there is not even a declarative sentence as a conditional sentence if,

312
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:57.230
and then construction.
Um,
so,
you know,
it's not nick,

313
00:21:57.231 --> 00:22:02.230
it's not even fully committed,
committed himself to that description.

314
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.970
Um,
he's,
he is holding back to some degree.
Um,
and not only that,

315
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:11.950
not only is this kind of very obtrusive conditionality,
um,
to the syntax,

316
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.390
uh,
but then out of nowhere this,

317
00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:21.391
this disruption that he's related to this machine seismograph a machine that

318
00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:26.140
registered earthquakes 10,000 miles away.
You know,

319
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.160
it really isn't a very vivid analogy.

320
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.200
Ally's no graphic analogy.

321
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.160
Gaspe does not look in the least like that kind of machine.
Right?
You know,

322
00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:37.090
we don't know what he looks like,

323
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.210
but we know for sure it doesn't look like one of those machines.

324
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.240
So it is not an analogy that isn't helping us to visualize gas.

325
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.340
Gaspe um,
and quite the contrary is making it.

326
00:22:51.341 --> 00:22:56.230
So that's why I think that,
you know,
the movie is really its own entity.

327
00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:01.200
I mean it's not really,
uh,
related to the book is totally different medium.
Um,

328
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.240
this is the linguistic medium that,
um,

329
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:08.760
that Fitzgerald is working with and trying to do something different.
So,
um,
it,

330
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.570
um,
you know,
and I was,
I have to say it is an open question.

331
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:18.571
I mean some of us actually are more stimulated by the visual medium than by the

332
00:23:18.801 --> 00:23:20.560
linguistic medium.
So,
you know,

333
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:25.561
I'm not saying here that you know that the movie is inferior to the novel.

334
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.730
Um,
but I do think that we have to,
uh,

335
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.770
be sure to give the linguistic medium is too in the sense that it really is

336
00:23:35.531 --> 00:23:40.480
trying to do something different.
Um,
so,
um,
we don't,
you know,
no.
Uh,

337
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.040
what,
what gas bay is like other than that,
um,
he is some,

338
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:50.530
one who seems to be working with a green would be able to work with great

339
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:57.140
distances.
You know,
I think a registered,
um,
and earthquakes 10,000 miles away.

340
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:02.210
I mean that is really not a skill or talent that is necessary in the great

341
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:06.890
Gatsby,
no earthquakes and Greg aspects.
But there is,
um,
something,
um,

342
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:11.950
that caused for kind of a long distance tenacity and persistence,

343
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.300
which is actually across time to enable it to be faithful to one idea.

344
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.520
So it's not 10,000 miles away,

345
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:27.550
but over a number of years remaining stubbornly attached to that one idea of a

346
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:31.820
woman.
Um,
so there's right there,
there's also a kind of,
um,

347
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.740
substitution or transposition,
um,
of,
um,
of,

348
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.550
of a temporal attributes onto a special attribute as well.
But in any case,

349
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.710
uh,
but not completely pinning guests be down.
Um,

350
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.740
I think the fifth Gero is really inviting us to project our own meaning a or

351
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:56.540
project our own reading of gas.
Bear into this very,
very loosely assemble,

352
00:24:56.541 --> 00:25:01.400
very pointed,
but oddly enough pointed,
but not focus is a paradox.

353
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:06.050
But I think that that's really the effect that Fitzgerald is trying to
cultivate.

354
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.600
So,
um,
we,
uh,
we spend quite a bit of time,
uh,

355
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.710
talking about comedy and a tragedy.
Um,

356
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.810
last last couple of classes.
Um,
and I want to,
uh,

357
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.960
bring those back and um,

358
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:30.170
talk a little bit once again,
uh,
about them as a mixture,
um,
that,
um,

359
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.850
they're not too very discrete hours.
Um,
in the three authors that we're reading,

360
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.790
um,
they tend to be,
um,
crossover,
um,
very much,
um,

361
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.120
crossover genres in,
in,
in the Greg aspect.
Um,

362
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.610
and in here because the inanimate,

363
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.000
because machines are so important in this novel,
um,

364
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.740
comedy is quite often a channeled through,
um,

365
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.410
high tech gadgets.
Um,

366
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:02.470
and here is one of the kind of very local,

367
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.130
very basically just right there.
Um,
instance of comedy.
Um,

368
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.180
every Friday,

369
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.680
five trays of oranges and lemons arrived from a footer in New York.

370
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:17.040
Every Monday the same oranges and lemons laugh his back door and a pyramid or

371
00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:18.050
publishers house.

372
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.320
There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of 200 oranges

373
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:28.430
and half an hour if a little button was pressed 200 times by Buffalo's thumb.

374
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.930
Um,
so I think that Cisco was having fun,
uh,
where there's,
um,

375
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.920
there's this comedy both as it comes to us,

376
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.690
but also comedy in the act of conversation.
I mean,

377
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:43.260
there's obviously an author,
it was having grits,
good time writing about this.

378
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:43.860
Um,

379
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.860
so the reduction of the Butler to just his thumb and the thumb read do use once

380
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:55.311
more to a completely utilitarian function oppressing this pattern out 200 times

381
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.030
in half an hour and producing the effect on our oranges.
Um,
so this is,

382
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.920
this is hilarious.
It's not,
I mean,

383
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:05.520
I guess it's terrible if we think about it from the Butler's point of view that

384
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:09.390
this is what he has to do.
Um,
but,
um,

385
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.540
I mean maybe it's kind of repetitive,
monotonous,

386
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:14.640
kind of terrible kind of labor really.

387
00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:16.740
If we think that that's what we have to do,

388
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.520
but as Fisher is telling the story is really not supposed to be a tragic,
um,

389
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.460
is comic.
Although the,
I would say that the tragedy,

390
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:31.140
all these phenomenon of,
uh,
of just kind of unbearable,

391
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:35.110
kind of repetitive labor is actually not so far away from it either.
Um,

392
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.010
that is the nature of comedy here.
Um,

393
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.990
so we'll move on the bed little machine,
even though it's memorable,
it's,

394
00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.060
it's not a star player in the great Gatsby.

395
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:51.180
The telephone is a star player.
Um,
and this is an image,

396
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.570
um,
of,
um,
just what the telephone,

397
00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:58.980
very glamorous looking machine.
Very beautiful.

398
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:04.050
Um,
so you can see that,
why people with one to you know,
right.

399
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:08.580
Works of literature about such a beautiful machine.
Um,

400
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.240
and before we get to you guys know,

401
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:14.850
I'm going to talk about that phone ringing,
you know,

402
00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:18.480
when the Buchanans having dinner,
right?
So,
um,
we'll get there.

403
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.130
But for now I just want to have a little detour,
um,

404
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.390
by way of the great poet who's also,

405
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.160
who mostly is known for,

406
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:32.750
is writing about nature and is not known for his writing about technology.

407
00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.400
Robert Frost.
Um,
but Robert Frost,

408
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.390
Ashley has a poem called the telephone and I think it's very,

409
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:43.330
very useful counterpoint actually,
um,

410
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.100
to first Gero and you see whether he's really talking about the telephone.

411
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:52.080
The title of the poem is the telephone.
Um,

412
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.800
and quite often in frost is this is a dramatic dialogue,

413
00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:00.850
dialogue between two people having found with flour and driven to be away.

414
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.370
I leaned my head and holding by the storm,

415
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.880
I listen and I thought I caught the world.

416
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.790
Who is it that you call me by my name?

417
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.120
Or did you say someone said,
come,

418
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.100
I heard it as I bow.

419
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.620
I may have thought as much but not allow.
Well,
so in Cannes,

420
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.660
so it's a lovely poem.
Um,
as a love.

421
00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.700
It's a love poem about two people who are in love.
Um,

422
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.050
we don't know the gender actually,
I think it's Atlanta.
The one,
um,

423
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:41.890
is someone really wanting to see right.

424
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.210
And just taking,

425
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.520
finding a skews to come and see that person claiming that,
um,

426
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.120
that,
that he's hearing a voice telling him to come.

427
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:57.070
And that is the telephone ubiquitination marks.
Uh,
the froze,

428
00:29:57.071 --> 00:30:00.460
he knows about the telephone,
but he's really not talking about the machine.

429
00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.110
He's talking about,
um,
the kind of impalpable,
um,

430
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:09.850
uh,
uh,
kind of,
um,
audio,
uh,

431
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.290
audible barn or the Bank of Ireland on ability,
um,

432
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.650
that that just brings out one person to the presence of another person.

433
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.950
Um,
and uh,
that is the telephone line.

434
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:28.970
It's that emotional core that really binds one person and that is the most

435
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:32.380
powerful telephone line of or,
um,

436
00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:37.000
so it's a lovely upon and it's very much humanizing the telephone,

437
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.420
um,
giving,
uh,
turn,
turning it into an emotion,

438
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.280
a romantic context,
uh,
charged with human that you motions.
Uh,

439
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.990
and it's really the fact that it's the carrier of human emotions that makes the

440
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:53.470
telephone such an important human vehicle.

441
00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:58.660
It is completely has been completely assimilated into the everyday world of just

442
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.720
human intimacy.
Um,
so,
um,

443
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:07.710
let's see what Fitzgerald does.
Uh,

444
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.490
with the telephone,

445
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.950
the telephone rang inside stuff me and as daisy shook her head decisively at

446
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:21.110
time,
the subject of the stables,
in fact,

447
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.120
pause objects vanish into hair amount of broken fragments of the last five

448
00:31:27.281 --> 00:31:28.300
minutes a table.

449
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:34.020
I remember the candles being lit up again when Leslie and I was conscious of a

450
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:39.541
one of wanting to look squarely at everyone and yet to avoid all eyes.

451
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.320
I couldn't guess with daisy and Tom were thinking,

452
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:49.890
but I doubt if even this Baker who seem to have mastered so in skepticism was

453
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:55.621
able only to put the fifth gas shrill metallic version and see,

454
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.213
oh my,

455
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:03.060
so on the other end of the spectrum from Robert Frost means surprisingly

456
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:07.060
actually,
because he's on the other side of the spectrum,

457
00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:12.040
actually the telephone actually is also charged with enhanced emotions.
You know,

458
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:16.210
this is not just a machine.
So,
you know,
we can almost say,

459
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.220
we can almost always say that machines are,
uh,
always,
um,

460
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.930
carriers of human emotions in one way or another.

461
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:28.900
And that's why they are important.
Uh,
machines.
I mean,

462
00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:33.670
if they were just like that button that the Butler presence were there,
some,

463
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.960
um,
you know,
it's just a,
wouldn't you know,

464
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.950
be a very presence at all.

465
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:43.590
But the telephone is a very important presence and the great Gatsby.
Um,

466
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.850
and what's interesting about this particular scenario,

467
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.270
um,

468
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:55.270
constructed around this high tech machine in the 19 20th is the association.

469
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.030
Uh,

470
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:05.030
we have the of this high tech machine with an intrusive for us into a

471
00:33:07.731 --> 00:33:11.750
traditional household.
Right before the telephone rang.

472
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:16.400
It was a pleasant dinner.
Um,
and um,

473
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:20.180
they say,
and Tom and her cousin,

474
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:25.010
nick and good friend,
Jordan Baker all saying down to a very civilized,

475
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.850
um,
dinner.
Um,
and in the course of that civilized dinner,

476
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.540
suddenly the appearance of barbarian hordes,
uh,

477
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.280
that was mentioned by Tom,
right?

478
00:33:35.281 --> 00:33:38.360
Because been reading this book about the rise of the color empires.

479
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.520
So this,

480
00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:45.200
the first intrusion of somebody not wanted,

481
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.360
um,
but not quite dismissible,
you know,
that is not a trivial,

482
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.960
uh,
reference because Ashley,
they see them,

483
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.250
picks it up and talks about her white girlhood and so on.

484
00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.340
So the rise of the colored empire by Goda,
that,
um,

485
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:04.790
God.
Dot that Tom has been reading that actually first intrusive,

486
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.160
uninvited guests.
It's just a book,

487
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:11.780
but it's very much was an uninvited guest to the dinner.
Um,

488
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.900
and then there's a second uninvited guests coming by way of the telephone.

489
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.740
Um,
so,
you know,
we can say there's a causal relation between them.
You know,

490
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:27.790
it's not as if the telephone was always bringing in people from a different

491
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:33.590
social class really.
Um,
and we know later,
um,
that that,
um,

492
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.080
murder was calling here,
um,

493
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:41.140
is of such a unacceptable social class even though she's okay as a mistress is

494
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:44.330
not okay for her to manage than Daisy's name.
Right.

495
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:48.500
When she mentioned Stacy's name Tom Bricks,
who knows.
So,
you know,

496
00:34:48.501 --> 00:34:53.240
that is the taboo that um,
Tom would not allow [inaudible] um,

497
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.650
to break,
um,

498
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.810
someone like her has no right to mention his wife's name that comes later.

499
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.250
Right now,

500
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:06.310
all we know is that there's a lot of mailers on the part of,

501
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.700
um,
of Murdo.
You don't,
cause if you want to talk to someone discreetly,

502
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:12.920
you don't call during dinner time.
Um,

503
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:17.810
so it was a call that comes bearing mallows to begin with.

504
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.710
Um,
and it's met with,
uh,

505
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.720
well I mean mallows or just have the luxury of being able to ignore,
uh,

506
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.780
uh,
which is the luxury that,
um,
the,

507
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:34.790
the freedom that I'm facing.
Um,
and,
um,
um,
uh,

508
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.280
something at this moment.
Um,
so,
um,

509
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:43.360
all the sort of social antagonisms,
um,
that are kind of bubbling actually be,

510
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.360
we need the service on the great Gatsby.
Uh,
all those antagonisms,
uh,

511
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.150
being,
um,
foregrounded,
uh,

512
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:55.260
by version of this high tech machine.
Um,
so,
um,

513
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.520
and we also shouldn't forget,
I mean this is a book,
um,

514
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.500
the Greek gas basin,
not a book about race.
We have to be very careful,
um,

515
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.090
that,
um,
is,
is,
is,
is,
is even though this reverence arise as the color empires,

516
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.770
it's not primarily about race,

517
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.610
but race is also not unimportant.
Um,

518
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.760
in the great Gatsby,
which is very,
very strange to me.

519
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.570
Somebody should write a paper about this,
uh,

520
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.550
beginning with the reference to rise with color and why essentially a persistent

521
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.530
on the current,
uh,
of,
um,
of,
of blackness actually and,
um,

522
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.090
in,
in this novel.
Um,
so,
um,

523
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:35.350
as there's also is the kind of an undercurrent of German,

524
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.880
is that gas based supposed to be in the pay of the German army?

525
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:43.260
It's supposed to be a cousin of the Kaiser.
Um,
oh,
there was a really,

526
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:48.180
really kill it and quite insistent.
So you know,
as you go on to write papers,

527
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:52.050
you know,
something to know this,
it's very marginal references.
Um,

528
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:55.310
they are not trivial.
So,
um,

529
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.910
let's look now at the ferry.
Um,

530
00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:05.520
the really the stop play or the star high tech player who's going to be the star

531
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:09.090
player all the way through the Great Gas Bay,
which is the car.

532
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:10.960
And um,

533
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:15.330
you should call it automobile dignify a name.
Um,

534
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:20.160
so here's the automobile.
Um,
and this is the 1920s Rose Royce.

535
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.300
Um,
and this actually is a pretty good representation,

536
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.680
or at least this is the car,
um,
that,
uh,
that,
that,
that um,

537
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.940
that was used in the,
uh,
in the great.
Um,

538
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:37.250
and we see nick and uh,
Gatsby there,
Sam Waterston,

539
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:42.210
a snake,
a rubber effort.
Uh,
so it looks very much like that car.

540
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.340
And,
um,
to get a better view of the roast rise to me,
you know,
sorry.
Um,

541
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.260
I have do all respectfully Rose Rose,

542
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:53.700
but this doesn't seem like a very impressive,
the eco,
I mean,
you know,

543
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.390
I can work up some excitement about it,
but,
um,

544
00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.940
it's not,
it's not,

545
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.710
I wouldn't say it's really bad.
Stunning.
Um,

546
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.090
sorry,
uh,
because it looks more steadily move human beings in it.
Um,

547
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.910
but other hoe,
I mean there's just a car.
Um,
but here,

548
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.840
here is,
um,
Fitzgerald,

549
00:38:17.841 --> 00:38:21.780
his description of the Rose Royce and I had seen,

550
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:26.760
and everybody has seen it.
It was a rich cream color,

551
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.541
right?

552
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:32.541
With Nicco swollen here and there and this monstrous lane with triumph and had

553
00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:38.721
boxes and suffered boxes and two boxes and to Harris with a lever in of

554
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:45.721
windshields that mirror but doesn't sons saying down behind many layers of glass

555
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.620
in the sort of green leather conservatory.

556
00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:55.810
He started to town is not a description of that car?

557
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.430
No,
no.
I mean,

558
00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:02.320
this is pure fabrication on Fitzgerald's pot.

559
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.330
Um,
and,
uh,

560
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.360
if there's a kind of a reference back to classical mythology to elaborate,

561
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:14.340
um,
I mean,
I don't know what cognitive elaboration of wind shows.
Um,

562
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.270
so it seems that,
you know,

563
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:20.640
Fisher is not really talking about a cost so much as just an occasion to use the

564
00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:24.840
classical mythology.
And this is in fact the stuff that modern,
um,

565
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.770
mythology is made of.
You know,

566
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:31.771
this is the car is the heart and soul of Marlin and Tana mythology and is high

567
00:39:33.011 --> 00:39:38.011
tech mythology that this is what enables us to create myths about ourselves and

568
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:44.310
about other human beings that we're intrigued.

569
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.800
But so in many ways,
um,

570
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.280
this is Nick's tribute to this completely mysterious,

571
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:56.520
um,
and uh,
and,
and seemingly super human,

572
00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.540
um,
person or not super human in the,

573
00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.930
he's better than all of us,
but in the sense that he's not quite human,

574
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:10.140
both maybe some and superhuman,
but combined,
um,

575
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:14.440
that there's something about him that there,
he's just not like the rest of us.

576
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.120
Um,
and so as a consequence of gas bay,
um,

577
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.760
not being quite like the rest of us,
um,

578
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:27.210
his car also has to be not quite like anything else on earth really.

579
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.150
It has to be this,
this,
this,
um,

580
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.480
basically this creature of language.
Uh,

581
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:38.490
but what is also interesting is that there's a kind of virus gesture.

582
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.070
I didn't attempt to go back Ashley,
um,

583
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:48.120
to that original image of the Valley of ashes and the group fecundity uh,

584
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.700
of the ashes.
Um,

585
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.980
inanimate objects are capable of reproduction here.

586
00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.540
The car is a green leather conservatory.
Um,

587
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:06.210
we don't know what vegetation is in that conservatory.

588
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:11.000
It could be that it is not,
obviously it's not real vegetation.
Um,

589
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:16.120
it is whatever's growing in gas baby's heart rate,
you know,

590
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:21.121
that there is something has to be growing there in order for it to survive all

591
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:25.130
those years.
Um,
and oddly enough,
whatever's growing there,
um,

592
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.190
can be preserved and knowledge,

593
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:32.340
knowledge only by high tech machines,
um,

594
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.880
that he gets base is very much a self made man.
Um,

595
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:42.040
and he's also self and making a particular kind of romantic relation.

596
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.330
Uh,
but the nourishment,
um,
that,

597
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:52.331
that kind of self making needs is actually high tech system sustenance,

598
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:56.840
high temp maintenance and high tech sustenance.
Um,

599
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:01.400
so,
um,
in all these ways,
you know,
we can see that,
um,
the,

600
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
the inanimate has taken over and is really a contributing,

601
00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:11.210
um,
and shedding the human world.
I want to end with,
um,

602
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:16.190
two more,
um,
images of the automobile.

603
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:21.530
Um,
and uh,
this is looking ahead.
Um,
and the first one is,

604
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:24.620
um,
very,
um,

605
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:29.320
marginal and not especially noticeable,
uh,

606
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.790
detail.
Um,

607
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.790
that I think that we should in fact try to notice and try to do something with.

608
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:40.040
Um,
this is when,
um,
uh,
nick is,
is it's uh,

609
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.200
going to New York,
um,
uh,
with Tom.
Um,

610
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.770
a deadman pass as in a horse,
he would bloons um,

611
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:50.480
followed by two carriages,

612
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.370
withdrawn blinds and buy more cheerful carriages for friends.

613
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.980
As we cross Blackwell's island.

614
00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.140
They mostly in past us driven by what she'll four in which said three mothers

615
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.790
Nehru's to bugs and the go,

616
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:13.310
I left Blau as the use of the Ibos road towards us.

617
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:19.070
Qualitative bribery isn't really what I mean by race being a very unexpected on

618
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:23.210
the current,
in the great Gatsby.
Um,

619
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.590
this really is a completely unnecessary detail.

620
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:28.400
Um,

621
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.960
the will never say that the most thing driven by the way she'll for,

622
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.960
uh,
where the three with the two black men and the

623
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:43.500
young black girl,
a black woman,
uh,
sitting in that car.
Um,

624
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.330
I mean the suit reverse or of the of the,

625
00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:52.310
the iconic image of what a skin color,
uh,

626
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:57.260
the chauffeur usually is odd and it was the skin color that people would use.

627
00:43:57.261 --> 00:43:59.560
It usually sitting in the limo saying,
um,

628
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:04.600
so a complete reversal of the color scheme of inside of the Muesli and um,

629
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.670
and um,
but even though that's a striking visual,
um,

630
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:15.530
detail it is not necessary.
Um,

631
00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.970
there's no obviousness Acetate for his placement in the novel.

632
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.090
So we do,
this is one instance where something is,
um,

633
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.200
I would say is under determined in the sense that the passage right there,

634
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:34.500
in fact,
the rest of the novel is not giving us an adequate explanation.

635
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.920
Under determined not enough information is given to,

636
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:42.630
was to enable us to make sense of this particular moment in the novel.

637
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.730
Um,
the only way we can make sense of it as true interpretation.
So,
you know,

638
00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:51.400
interpretation,
interpretations,
actually unnecessary link,
um,

639
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:55.090
in all for this passage to make sense,
uh,

640
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.990
to be an organic part of the novel.
So,
you know,

641
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:03.020
I would argue that in some sense raised is being,

642
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.550
um,
uh,
a dues from times,
um,

643
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.970
as a kind of a visual analog,
um,
to,

644
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:13.283
um,

645
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:18.260
people crossing class boundaries,
um,

646
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.620
that there's something,

647
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:24.660
there's an apple transgression or kind of a reversal of social hierarchy,

648
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.910
um,
modal,
um,

649
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.653
uh,

650
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:35.570
intruding into the dinner of her social betters.
You know,

651
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:40.530
and I'm using that,
um,
phrase deliberately,
um,
that you know,

652
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.970
that that has to be included in ours.
But the offense,
Paula,

653
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.130
the offense of,
of murderers that she,

654
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:51.450
she really should keep stick to social stations,
stick to the place,

655
00:45:51.451 --> 00:45:55.680
and she was intruding into this private space of a social barriers.
Um,

656
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.910
and in some sense this the same kind of a transgression,

657
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.040
uh,
intrusion or reversal of the traditional hierarchies.

658
00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:05.820
Um,

659
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.340
in the three African Americans being driven by a ships chauffeur.

660
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:15.210
So all of that is,
is,
is almost a Fitzgerald can't really talk about it.

661
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.880
Um,
in,
in terms of gas state,
you know,
who's actually the person was responsible,

662
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.150
most responsible for that kind of transgression.
Um,

663
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:27.060
and Gatsby is really related to murder in that way.

664
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:30.360
I mean we think about who gets killed at Amazon novel.

665
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.360
That is one bond between Caspian model,
uh,

666
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:38.340
but there are numerous other bonds between them and raise the kind of uh,

667
00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.580
Ooh,
leak.
Um,
transfer ratio.

668
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:46.140
Transposition Ashley is one of the common grounds between gas being loyal.
Um,

669
00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:50.700
so this is a very intriguing moment,
um,
in the,

670
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.260
in the Greg [inaudible].
Um,
and this is just to round up,
um,

671
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:59.980
what we,
um,
no,
I mean in the ending of,
I mean the plot of the great Gatsby.

672
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.570
I don't think I'm giving anything away.
Um,

673
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:07.700
this is actually the moment when fish actually uses the word charge.

674
00:47:07.901 --> 00:47:12.480
Are they,
um,
the Dev car as the newspaper would call it didn't stop.

675
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.930
It came out of the gathering darkness waiver tragically for moment and then

676
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.320
disappear around the next Ben,
uh,

677
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.170
we know that this is the moment where Mergel gets killed in this course.

678
00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:29.270
She's sorry,
rather,
uh,
I mean it's,

679
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:34.510
the book doesn't really rests on that,
that one detail.
You can know it and still,

680
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.880
you know,
that's right knowledge.
Um,
but this is what happens to Morocco.
Um,

681
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.450
and um,
in some sense this really,
um,

682
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:48.370
there's an echoing already.
Um,
those,
uh,
that man,
you know,
who knows.
Um,

683
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.420
and uh,
in,
in that previous,
um,

684
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.370
passage about automobile,
um,

685
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.780
and in this passage that was just a completely,
uh,

686
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:04.180
you know,
uh,
in conspicuous referenced that it just happened to be a host.
Um,

687
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.870
in the second mention of the car,
um,

688
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:12.520
it actually is a real horse,
not in the sense that there's a dead body in it.

689
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.180
Um,

690
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:18.180
but in the sense that is the carrier of del Vista bringer conveyor of death to

691
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:23.210
Morocco.
So we can get a sense of what the careful writer for Cheryl is.
Right.

692
00:48:23.211 --> 00:48:24.220
You know,
this is really,

693
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:28.180
he is someone who works over at your house over and over again,

694
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.950
so that they all this intricate into connections,
um,
in the novel.

695
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.840
Um,
and in that way,
even though it is not as complicated,
is not,

696
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.040
it is every bit as complicated as fuck.
Like,
it's not as difficult to with,

697
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.110
you know,
on the phase of it as,
as Faulkner,

698
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.010
but it's an Aba that we should read over and over again as well,

699
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:51.090
just to get all those echos and interrelations.
Um,

700
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.430
so we'll come back on Thursday and wrap up the Greek aspect.
