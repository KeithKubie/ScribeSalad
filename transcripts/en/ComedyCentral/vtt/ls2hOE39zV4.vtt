00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.109
I WANT THE TRUTH, STEVE,

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.178
'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE FAKING IT.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.746
- NO, I'M NOT.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.248
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN THE JUNGLE,

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.484
I DID A FEW THINGS
I WASN'T VERY PROUD OF.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.787
TECHNICALLY, STEVEN,
I'M A WAR CRIMINAL.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.289
- GOTTA ROLL.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.525
NO, WOODY,

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:29.329

BY THE GENEVA CONVENTION.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.198
COOTCHY-COOTCHY,
WOOTCHY-COOTCHY.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:37.237

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:41.675
COOTCHY.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.377
YOU'RE A TOUGH
SON OF A BITCH, STEVE.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.846
I WOULD'VE HAD ABU NAZIR
CRYING BY NOW.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.515
TIME FOR MY LAST OPTION.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.050
- OH, MY GOD,
WOODY, STOP.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.118
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.719
- SCREW THIS COURT CASE.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.988
YOU'RE NOT GONNA STEAL
ANY MORE OF MY MONEY.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:58.125
YOU GET UP
OR YOU GO DOWN!

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.794
THREE...TWO...

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.063
TWO AND A HALF...

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.331

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.634
- OOPSIE.

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:09.303
OKAY, STEVE!

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.071
NOW I BELIEVE YOU!

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:17.077
- [grunting]

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.682
[bones cracking]
I'M STILL ALIVE.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:24.852
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M STILL ALI--WAIT.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.987
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.
