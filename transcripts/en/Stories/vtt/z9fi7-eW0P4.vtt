00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.090
KENNETH LOO: The very
first time I did it

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.130
I remember all I felt was panic.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.450
But once I got over that
panic, stressful feeling,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.980
it began to feel natural.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.410
I guess it's the feeling
you'd get if you were a bird.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.010
I actually feel like
I'm the one in the air.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.080
MANUEL ALEGRIA: You're
completely immersed.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.390
It's a great feeling.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.890
For us, it's a way to relax.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.914
MATT RANDAZZO: Like I
describe to most anyone

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:31.330
I talk to about
flying, I say it's

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.790
like driving a hummingbird.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400
I can fly around
through the trees.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.850
It's literally a
technologically-enabled,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.830
out-of-body experience.

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:48.000
KENNETH LOO: FPV stands
for First Person View.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.430
It's flying through the
perspective of a camera mounted

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.240
on the frame of the multirotor.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.710
MANUEL ALEGRIA: It's
real, real all out racing.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.250
It's about pushing the limits.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.972
We want to keep going and
get faster and better.

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:04.930
MATT RANDAZZO: And there's
no money, obviously,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.710
in these races.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.640
But it's bragging rights when
someone can come in first

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.989
or come in at all.

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.030
MANUEL ALEGRIA: It can be
pretty dangerous if you

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.238
don't know what you're doing.

00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:15.540
It's all out, nonstop.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.710
They'll chop you up if you
get hit, crash into the trees.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.262
A few of them have
burned up on me.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:21.970
KENNETH LOO: I think
it's a good day if I

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.160
don't break any propellers.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.481
MANUEL ALEGRIA: Oh!

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:24.980
Bring it in.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.563
Bring it back!

00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:26.940
Bring it back!

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.544
KENNETH LOO: And I only have
a good day if I'm not racing.

00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:31.210
MANUEL ALEGRIA: Out
on the field there's

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.980
a lot of joking, a lot of
anger, a lot of yelling.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.755
It's a ton of fun.

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:37.630
KENNETH LOO: To me it's
definitely a passion.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.660
Some people say, is
that really a sport?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.930
But half the challenge
of flying a multirotor

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.770
is building it efficiently.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230
There's just as
much time invested

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.930
into building and
tuning the quads,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.600
just like there is into building
and tuning a NASCAR vehicle.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.370
And right now I tend to do
all of that stuff in my garage

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.750
and then go race.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.950
But there are organizations
now, like Game of Drones,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.320
Aerial Sports League.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.115
And they're truly
making it competitive.

00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:03.490
MANUEL ALEGRIA:
Am I in the lead?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.300
Who's in the lead?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.560
It seems like a
community is developing.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.389
It's a small community, but it's
getting bigger and bigger now.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.000
KENNETH LOO: The
community of people,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.375
they're just so friendly and
willing to share information

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:16.420
on how to make your plane,
your helicopter fly more

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.540
efficiently, fly
faster, fly longer,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.904
whatever you want it to do.

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:23.320
MATT RANDAZZO: We
are experiencing

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.992
a massive engineering
push on all these.

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:28.450
In the last year,
these things have

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.450
evolved so much that the
quad that you got a year ago

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.020
is outdated.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.530
KENNETH LOO: Right now we're
at a very exciting moment

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.180
in this hobby because these
FPV racing leagues are just

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.040
starting to form.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.595
So there are all of these
areas for the hobby and both

00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:49.030
the sport to develop.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.007
So it's really exciting and
you can sense that anybody

00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:53.215
can really make a difference.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110
MATT RANDAZZO: I think
this is going to explode.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.420
I think this is going to be kind
of similar to-- I hate to say

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.490
this-- like a NASCAR event.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.480
There's going to be
professional racing.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.720
I think this is going
to get really big.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.720
KENNETH LOO: I think it would be
awesome if the hobby developed

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.690
into a real sport,
where pilots became

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.172
as well known as quarterbacks.

00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:20.380
MANUEL ALEGRIA: I can't stop.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.338
It's like an addiction.

00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:22.560
I don't know.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.430
It's really fun.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.930
Woo!

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.017
I can't believe I-- oh, hoo hoo!

00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:30.600
NARRATOR: All Points
Project is a part

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.160
of Seeker Stories,
a channel that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.019
features short documentaries
from around the globe.

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.810
Please check out our
video about the plight

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.860
to save New Mexico's
wild mustangs.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.370
MALE SPEAKER: As
I was growing up,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.780
we were used to seeing
a lot of wild horses.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.270
But a lot of the
horses that you see,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.030
those are the
domestic horses that

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.970
have been dumped by private
owners that financially

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.309
couldn't take care of them.

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:56.850
NARRATOR: New episodes
every Tuesday.
