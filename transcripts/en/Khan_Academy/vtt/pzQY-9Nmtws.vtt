00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.181
So you, as the ancient philosopher in mathematics

00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:07.185
have concluded in order for the multiplication of positive and negative numbers to be

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.177
consistent with everything you've been constructing so far

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:13.502
with all the other properties of multiplication that you know so far

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:17.178
that you need a negative number times a positive

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:20.770
number or a positive times a negative to give you a negative number

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.181
and a negative times a negative

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.846
to give you a positive number and so you accept

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:30.845
it's all consistent so far.. this deal does not make complete concrete

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:35.770
sense to you, you want to have a slightly deeper institution than just having to accept its

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.369
consistent with the distributive property and whatever else and so you try another

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:45.377
thought experiment, you say "well what is just a basic multiplication way of doing it?"

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:47.369
So if I say, two times

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.183
three, one way to

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:55.103
to conceptualize is basic multiplication is really repeating

00:00:55.103 --> 00:00:58.036
addition, so you could view this as two threes

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:02.351
so let me write three plus three

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.703
and notice there are two of them, there are two of these

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:09.770
or you could view this as three twos, and so this is the same thing as

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.434
two plus two plus two and there are

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:17.100
three of them, and either way you can conceptualize

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.602
as you get the same exact answer. This is going to be equal

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:24.597
to six, fair enough!

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:27.569
Now, you knew this before you even tried to tackle negative numbers.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.518
Now let's try to make one of these negatives and see what

00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:33.369
happens. Let's do two

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.516
times negative

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:42.103
three, I want to make the negative into a different color. Two times

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:46.309
negative three.

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:49.851
Well, one way you could view this is the same analogy

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.853
here, it's negative three twice so it would be

00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:56.767
negative.. I'll try to color code it

00:01:56.767 --> 00:02:01.042
negative three and then another negative

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:05.180
three or you could say negative three minus three

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.568
or, and this is the interesting thing, instead of

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:11.036
over here there's a two times positive three

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:14.310
you added two, three times.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.262
But since here is two times negative three

00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:19.036
you could also imagine you are going to subtract two, three times

00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:21.700
So instead of up here, I could

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.519
written two plus two plus two because this is a positive

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.436
two right over here, but since we're doing this over negative three

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:33.702
we could imagine subtracting two, three times, so this would be

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:37.930
subtracting two (repeated)

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.186
subtract another two right over here, subtract another two

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:46.102
and then you subtract another two

00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:54.936
notice you did it, once again, you did it

00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:59.932
three times, so this is a negative three, so essentially you are subtracting

00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:03.770
two, three times. And either way, you can conceptualize

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.264
right over here, you are going to get negative six

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:10.186
negative six is the answer.

00:03:10.186 --> 00:03:16.264
Now, so you are already starting to feel better about this part right over here

00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:18.369
negative times a positive, or a positive times a negative

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.600
is going to give you a negative. Now lets take to the really un-intuitive one

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.685
and measure negative times a negative, and all of a sudden negatives kind of cancel

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:28.037
to give you a positive. Now why is that the case? Well we can just build from

00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:30.969
this example right over here. Let's say we had

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.934
a negative two, lets say we had

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:38.103
negative two, let me do it a different color,

00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:42.851
let's say we had a negative two, I already used this color

00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:45.239
negative two times

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.702
negative three.

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:53.975
So now, we can d- actually I'll do this one first.

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:57.775
Let's do multiplying something by negative three so we'll

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:01.234
repeatedly subtract that thing three times whatever that thing is

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:05.769
so now the thing isn't a positive two so the thing over

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.636
here is a positive two but the thing we're going to subtract is a negative two

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:10.902
So let me make it clear, this says we are going to subtract something

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:13.969
three times, so we subtract something three times, so

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.104
subtracting something (repeatedly) three times

00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:20.642
That's what this part right over here tells us

00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:24.302
and we'll do this, exactly three times

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:28.369
Over here, it was a positive two we subtracted three times, now we're going to

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:32.271
do a negative two, now we're going to do a negative two

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:35.770
and we know from subtracting negative numbers, we already

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.434
built this intuition that subtracting a negative is the same thing

00:04:40.368 --> 00:04:46.105
it's the same thing as adding a positive, and so this

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:50.370
this is going to be the same thing as two plus two plus two and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.606
we're told once again, gives you a positive

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:56.901
six, you can same use the same logic over here, now

00:04:56.901 --> 00:05:00.302
instead of adding negative three twice, really I could have written this as

00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:03.854
negative three as this example

00:05:03.854 --> 00:05:05.569
negative three

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:11.523
negative three, and we added it

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:15.299
we added it, now let me put a plus here to make it clear

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:18.602
over here we added it twice, we added negative three

00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:23.349
two times, or here since we have a negative two, we're going to subtract

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.184
to negative three twice, so we're going to subtract something

00:05:26.184 --> 00:05:30.102
and we're going to subtract something again, and that something is going to be

00:05:30.102 --> 00:05:33.440
our negative three, it's going to be our negative three, so

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.036
negative, negative and put our three right over here

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:41.241
and once again, subtracting negative three is like taking away

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:43.182
someone's debt, which is essentially giving them money,

00:05:43.182 --> 00:05:48.274
this is the same thing as adding three plus three which is once again six. So now

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:51.439
you, the ancient philosopher, feel pretty good. Not only this

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.105
all consistent with all the mathematics you know

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:58.369
the distributive property is also the property of multiplying something

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:00.767
times something all these things you already know, and now

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:04.772
this actually makes conceptual sense to you, this is actually very consistent with

00:06:04.772 --> 00:06:08.108
with your notion, your original notion, or one of the possible notions

00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:12.108
of multiplication which is as repeated addition
