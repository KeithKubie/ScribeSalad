ALINE PEZENTE: So, my
name is Aline Pezente.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.830
I was a Sloan Fellows
'18 graduate student.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.750
I was working with Anjali
at an independent study

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.320
for farmer's economy and
the usage of technology.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.202
So, there is an ever increasing
need to invest in agriculture.

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.910
And one of the biggest
challenge for that

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.950
is the credit, access for
affordable loans for farmers.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.680
And we have been
discussing with Anjali

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.880
about how we can use
technology to solve this issue.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.300
And what is the design
of this technology

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.950
that we can use for
farmers that they can

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.120
have better access to credit?

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.550
But not only that, how we can
help the lenders to access

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.270
those farmers, which
are mostly remote areas,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.830
and they lack data.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.940
So we have been
working with Anjali

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.970
on thinking on as
in these problems,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.780
and also restructuring
the right questions

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.040
that we should think about
to find the proper solutions.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.120
We thought it was more
design thinking, and design

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.780
of thinking about the process,
and how is the clients,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.300
and how are--

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.910
not the clients, but the
farmers' and the lenders'

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.750
perspective, with their lenses,
what are the main questions

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.430
that they do while they
are in the credit process?

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.980
And what are the
status quo today--

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.550
what are the failures
of these status quo?

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.560
And where we find
the technologies

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.880
that have a compelling user
case to deliver solutions

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.080
for lack of data and connection
between farmers and lenders.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.280
So it was a very systematic
approach that we been opting

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.210
and how we think of all those
technologies and innovation,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.620
and deployed this
to this problem.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.810
So, I manage my time with
weekly meetings with Anjali

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.310
for a period of time.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.640
We set up very
narrow deliverables.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.000
And between the process,
we were iterating

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.180
with some of the professors
and some of the resources

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.500
that I needed.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.840
And I took the discipline to
having that in my schedule

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.880
so we could deliver and
have fruitful discussions

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.130
every meeting that
we had together.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.320
And what I learned,
though, in this process

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.210
with her was how to--

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.930
we systematically
think or how we make--

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.210
we make the right questions.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.190
And from the right
questions, we start

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.520
to find the solutions which
derives to the right questions.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.000
And where do we
find the resources?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.400
And it's a system
dynamic way of doing--

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.580
of formulating your
problem statement,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.980
which was very helpful
for me in this process

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.960
of working in the project.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.970
Anjali was super relevant
to help us to think, OK,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.160
to solve this for
this challenge,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.930
we need an expert
in different areas.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.980
Who are the experts?

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.360
And she connected us with those
experts that eventually came

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.970
up and help us to contribute.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.690
And also, she connected us
with many interpreters and also

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.050
companies outside
the scope of MIT.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.160
For example, she connected
us with a guy from India

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.020
from one of--

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.160
the largest solar
panel companies

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.690
who also in certain sense
is still in contact with us

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.450
on thinking about contribution,
with Tata Center who also will

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.490
contribute with our research.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.970
I think that that's
the environment

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.680
that MIT brings to you.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.440
It's quite unique,
right, this possibility

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.279
that help us to
connect with people

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.350
from different backgrounds.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.540
Not only that, they
are the experts

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.480
in the background in the world.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.180
They are the most renowned
faculty members, scientists.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.640
They will add you a
different perspective.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.910
There is this ocean of
think of different ideas,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.900
different perspective that
helps you to build up your own.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.710
This is something
that is unique at MIT.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.300
Also the capacity
of the connection,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.790
right, because the
world expands to you

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.390
and it opens because
you're at MIT.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.770
So there is nothing equal like
that at all in any other place.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.220
All the feedbacks
that I was iterating

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.610
through the connections
that we establish

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.580
through the process in this
course were quite valuable.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.580
Actually, every
feedback, every iteration

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.120
shaped somehow the process
of what we are doing now.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.250
And that's the valuable
thing of this course

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.820
is also to have the possibility
to hear other opinions.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.400
Not only-- if you
stay on your own path,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.640
you're blind to what
is new or outside.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.340
And that prevents you
somehow to make innovation,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.445
which is not the case here.

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:42.380
You see so many different
things sometimes that you never

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.090
thought before.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.020
And that changes.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.600
And that improves
what you are doing.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.550
I guess the biggest
challenge in this process

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.580
is still having the
discipline to find a proper--

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.210
to having the discipline
in this structure

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.540
to find a solution because
there are so many elements

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.210
because you learn how to think.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.230
And seeing the whole
world and to try

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.450
to grasp the answers in a
systematic and organized way

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.640
was, for me, a challenge
in the beginning.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.540
But I learned how to navigate
that eventually later.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.320
So it's now-- it's an
interesting process

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.900
that you learned how to
deal with so many variables

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.090
in making the puzzles to
deliver to a whole-- a clear and

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.040
transparent picture.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.220
Well, this project one, there
is two branches of that.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.740
One is a startup that I'm
doing, which we already

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.600
are creating the fintech,
which is exclusively

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.570
dedicated to the
agricultural market, which

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.250
is the first in the market
where we use data analytics.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.160
And we designed the
process in this course

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.570
to improve and deliver
better financial solutions

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.840
to both lenders and
farmers so we allow

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.820
them to have affordable loans.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.730
And on top of that,
there is also--

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.450
because this is so unique
and so new in the world,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.590
we are doing
research with Anjali

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.300
and other professors, senior
faculty members at MIT

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.610
with support from
the data center

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:37.250
as well to study the economic
behavior of farmers and lenders

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.020
with more data.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.340
This data will help to solve
for the problems of sustainable

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.950
financing.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.810
Or in economy-- in
conclusion, we don't know.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.910
So that's one of
the investigations

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.780
that we are doing.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.660
That's one of the
next challenge,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.860
and again, some of the
answers that we are trying

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.570
to find for this question.
