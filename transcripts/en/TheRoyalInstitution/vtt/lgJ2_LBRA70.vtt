00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.260
In terms of the four laws of thermodynamics,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.990
I think to a particle physicist actually the
conservation of energy

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.410
is the most important one.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.690
If energy wasn't conserved, we'd have no predictive
power whatsoever.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.220
To actually come up with equations of motion
which describe a system...

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.199
any system, I'm talking throwing a ball through
the air, a pendulum, a car rolling down the

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.199
street...

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.539
You have to assume that certain quantities
are conserved.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.789
The wonderful thing is we can build up from
such a basic concept like that,

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.560
something as simple as saying 'energy is conserved:

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.910
Energy in, energy out',

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.390
In a particle physics collision when we take
two beams,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.480
collide them together, mess happens and everything
flies out

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.970
and we've created all these new particles,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.350
some of those particles we can't detect in
the particle detectors,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.180
so things like neutrinos, for example, they
have almost zero mass.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.630
They really don't interact much.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.380
And so when we add up all the pieces of collision
and say

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.380
"OK, did this collision stat with Higgs boson
and then decay to these other products?"

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.090
If we add up all the products of the collision
but one is missing,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.859
then we go if we know that energy is conserved,

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.450
then we can check what that missing product
was.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.749
it's actually a method that's used in particle
physics analysis is to use this missing momentum

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:22.749
method

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.609
and if you know the decay you're looking for,
then you can say,

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.359
"Ok I've measured these three things, and
those two things,

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.119
I've got a missing momentum which corresponds
to my neurtrino,

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.119
You can infer where it came from.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.929
If energy wasn't conserved the answer would
be different every time.

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.159
We'd have no predictive power whatsoever of
how things work in the world.
