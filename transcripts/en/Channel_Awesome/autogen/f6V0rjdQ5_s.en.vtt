really need to be needed and and I think
that<00:07:56.590><c> can</c><00:07:56.860><c> be</c><00:07:56.889><c> trouble</c><00:07:57.610><c> for</c><00:07:57.789><c> some</c><00:07:57.940><c> people</c><00:07:58.360><c> and</c>

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:58.870 align:start position:0%
that can be trouble for some people and
 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
that can be trouble for some people and

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:01.450 align:start position:0%
I guess when you implant that a young
