00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.096
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians!

00:00:01.096 --> 00:00:03.960
I wanted to talk to you
again about mutant plurals.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.056
So to review a mutant plural is,

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:08.478
there are only seven of them in English,

00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:11.944
and they all change sound
when they pluralize.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:14.302
You don't add an -s, you don't add an -en,

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:17.430
you don't change the ending,
you change the vowel,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.764
and there are only seven to go like this.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.492
There's man,

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.855
woman,

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:31.170
tooth,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.146
foot,

00:00:34.146 --> 00:00:36.858
mouse,

00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:40.779
louse,

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.516
and goose.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.865
And these words become in the plural

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:50.707
men,

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:54.041
women,

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:57.170
teeth,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.097
feet,

00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:03.515
mice,

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:06.658
lice,

00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:08.499
and geese.

00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:14.022
Now the reason that we have
these seven weird mutant plurals

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:17.131
in English is kind of
complicated, but I'm lucky enough

00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.726
to be able to work with
an actual linguist.

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:20.492
Hello, Jake!

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:21.755
- [Voiceover] Hey, grammarians!

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:23.770
- [Voiceover] Jake, is it
true that you're a linguist?

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.924
- [Voiceover] Yep, it's true.

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.488
- [Voiceover] All right,
so Jake, what is the deal

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:27.828
with feet?

00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:29.515
Where do these mutant plurals come from?

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:33.640
If we take the word foot and
we drag it through history,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.646
how do we get to the plural as feet?

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:38.028
What's the deal with that?

00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:39.917
- [Voiceover] So if you look
at a lot of Germanic languages

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:42.982
that are around today, you
find similar words to the word,

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:44.347
the English word foot.

00:01:44.347 --> 00:01:46.237
In German we have the word Fuss,

00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:48.390
in Dutch we have the word voet.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.062
And when you have a lot
of different languages

00:01:50.062 --> 00:01:51.904
with slight variations of a word,

00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:54.809
it means there is some
old, old word out there

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:58.812
that all these words are coming from.

00:01:58.812 --> 00:01:59.998
So we can pretty much be sure

00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:02.782
that there's some Proto-Germanic word

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:05.074
that sounds something like foot.

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:06.967
Now back in those days

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:08.753
there was a different
way to form the plural,

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.916
and that was to add an i
sound at the end of a word.

00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:16.225
So if the word was foot, then
the plural was maybe footi.

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:18.252
That means many foots.

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.982
Now there's a tendency in language

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:23.497
that you have to understand here.

00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:25.793
It's called vowel harmony.

00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:30.055
Basically it means that
vowels within a given word,

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:31.847
they like to sound like each other.

00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:34.795
So if you have two syllables
those syllables will start,

00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:39.453
the vowels in those syllables
will start to converge.

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:42.040
And in Germanic languages especially,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.708
there's one typical kind of vowel harmony

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.121
which is--
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:49.422
- [Voiceover] When you
have two vowels in a word,

00:02:49.422 --> 00:02:51.697
the first vowel will try to sound

00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:53.542
more like the second vowel,

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:56.248
if that second vowel is the i sound,

00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:00.596
just like in the plural
formation of nouns.

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:03.482
- [Voiceover] So you're
saying that the suffix -i

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:07.754
at the end of this proposed word footi,

00:03:08.994 --> 00:03:11.922
the u sound tried to sound
more like the i sound.

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:12.563
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:12.563 --> 00:03:13.904
- [Voiceover] This is just
a pattern that we find

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:15.549
in Germanic languages.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.159
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.953
It's very prevalent in Germanic languages,

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:20.203
also exists in some Romance languages,

00:03:20.203 --> 00:03:21.604
some tiny Romance languages.

00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:24.233
- [Voiceover] So what happens
when you combine the u sound

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:24.976
with the i sound?

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.094
What sound do you get?

00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:29.810
- [Voiceover] Well, strangely
you get the ü sound.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.261
- [Voiceover] Are you, what is that?

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:32.719
- [Voiceover] The ü sound.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.638
- [Voiceover] Are you okay?

00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:34.757
- [Voiceover] I think I am okay.

00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:36.070
You know, we linguists have to deal

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.256
with this kind of thing all the time.

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:37.923
- [Voiceover] (laughs) Sorry.

00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:39.015
- [Voiceover] We have
very strong stomachs.

00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:40.225
- [Voiceover] Uh-huh.

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.952
- [Voiceover] You still
get this sound in languages

00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:44.032
like German and Dutch.

00:03:44.032 --> 00:03:47.643
- [Voiceover] So then that's
what this ü is, right?

00:03:47.643 --> 00:03:50.536
So this sound, or I guess,

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:53.306
so the plural of German Fuss

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:55.943
is what you said?

00:03:55.943 --> 00:03:58.233
Füsse?

00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:00.409
Okay, so bring this home for me.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.827
So at some point in the
development of English,

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.678
or of all these Germanic languages,

00:04:07.678 --> 00:04:11.734
we had this word foot and
then it turned into footi,

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:12.904
and then it turned into what?

00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:14.961
It turned into füti?

00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:16.370
- [Voiceover] Something like füti, right.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.146
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:18.984
- [Voiceover] Now eventually that ü sound

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:19.966
dropped out of English,

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.945
which is why it's so
hard for us to pronounce,

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:24.036
and it was replaced in
pretty much all cases

00:04:24.036 --> 00:04:26.334
with the ii sound.

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:29.970
So we get the word feeti
and then the i drops off,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.736
and we're left with foot as the singular

00:04:31.736 --> 00:04:33.161
and feet as the plural.

00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:33.789
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.330
So it goes from foot to feeti.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.086
- [Voiceover] Now the
same exact thing happened

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:44.025
with the word mouse, which
probably used to be moos,

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:47.252
because in Frisian, which is
the closest cousin to English,

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:49.454
the word for mouse still is Muus.

00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:50.186
- [Voiceover] Moos?

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:51.852
- [Voiceover] And you find similar things

00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:53.883
in a lot of Germanic languages

00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:57.954
like muis in Dutch and Maus in German.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:03.609
The plural became muusi,
and then eventually meesi,

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:05.000
then you get mees.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.773
Then a few hundred year later,

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:10.558
during the Great Vowel Shift
that mees becomes mice.

00:05:10.558 --> 00:05:14.005
A lot of ii vowels in
the Great Vowel Shift

00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:17.748
about 500 years ago became ai vowels.

00:05:17.748 --> 00:05:19.523
- [Voiceover] So this is
sort of a broad pattern

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:21.837
these mutant words all take.

00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:23.877
It's this umlaut mutation, right?

00:05:23.877 --> 00:05:27.768
Because these little, these
double dots that go over a,

00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:29.483
oh it looks like a smiley face,

00:05:29.483 --> 00:05:32.685
that go over a vowel
change its color, right?

00:05:32.685 --> 00:05:33.644
They change its meaning.

00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:35.661
- [Voiceover] And that process is called

00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:38.497
either umlaut mutation or i-mutation,

00:05:38.497 --> 00:05:41.914
not eye like the sight organ,
i like the letter in English.

00:05:41.914 --> 00:05:42.705
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:45.676
Well, I hope that cleared
some things up for you.

00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:47.240
You can learn anything.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.365
David out.

00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:49.728
- [Voiceover] Jake out.

00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:50.488
(clap)

00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:52.567
- [Voiceover] That was
a high five, not a slap.
