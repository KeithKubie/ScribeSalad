 You've come to the right place, hooray! A lot of laughter awaits you. 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 This is the "Channel Awesome" youtube channel! 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.360

 Watch him ... they don't give anything else now. 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 So, except for "Red vs. Blue", that's pretty good. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.760
 In fact, "Honest Trailers", they're pretty funny, 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.440
 "How it Should've Ended" is just perfect 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.740
 "Cinema Sins", they can make me laugh every time 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.060
 Oh, hey, hey, "BrentalFloss", he's great, why don't you look at him? 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.500
 God, "Angry Video Game Nerd", gentlemen, I'm not telling that much to people, but he's just great ... 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.680
