Oh

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750
 
 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.139
 
that's undoubtedly true the question

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149
that's undoubtedly true the question
 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.289
that's undoubtedly true the question
though is also why it weren't there more

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299
though is also why it weren't there more
 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.500
though is also why it weren't there more
women involved in in those systems and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510
women involved in in those systems and
 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.019
women involved in in those systems and
will women ever be involved in the same

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029
will women ever be involved in the same
 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.160
will women ever be involved in the same
way the evidence we have is that women

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170
way the evidence we have is that women
 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.240
way the evidence we have is that women
seem to not want to compete at that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250
seem to not want to compete at that
 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.210

level with that kind of violence over a
lifetime there was just a study done of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890
lifetime there was just a study done of
 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.070

women in in in Silicon Valley and about

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080
women in in in Silicon Valley and about
 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.060
women in in in Silicon Valley and about
a third of the women leave very quickly

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
a third of the women leave very quickly
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.549
a third of the women leave very quickly
from the competition another third have

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559
from the competition another third have

males are and I think we have to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270
males are and I think we have to
 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.660
males are and I think we have to
acknowledge the fact that that males

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670
acknowledge the fact that that males
 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.819
acknowledge the fact that that males
tend to be somewhat more bellicose and

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829
tend to be somewhat more bellicose and
 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.590
tend to be somewhat more bellicose and
aggressive whether it's good for them to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
aggressive whether it's good for them to
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.849
aggressive whether it's good for them to
generate these collateralized debt

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859
generate these collateralized debt
 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.460
generate these collateralized debt

that's gender specific but the idea of

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549
that's gender specific but the idea of
 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.510
that's gender specific but the idea of
making all that money and being of high

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520

people who made those huge salaries had

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490
people who made those huge salaries had
 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.340
people who made those huge salaries had
two or three kids in private school and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350
two or three kids in private school and
 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.429
two or three kids in private school and
they had a whole array of expenses which

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439
they had a whole array of expenses which
 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.620
they had a whole array of expenses which
were really high and in general I think

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630
were really high and in general I think
 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.069
were really high and in general I think
it's the case that females don't go for

it's the case that females don't go for
 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.200
it's the case that females don't go for
that kind of money because they don't

a Harvard Business School did a study
 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.950
a Harvard Business School did a study
some years ago and I'm afraid I can't

because women do have babies most women

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880
because women do have babies most women
 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.319
because women do have babies most women
still do and when they have babies they

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329
still do and when they have babies they
 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.190
still do and when they have babies they
have needs there's a lot of discussion

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200
have needs there's a lot of discussion
 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.680
have needs there's a lot of discussion
about the so-called 77 cents on the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690
about the so-called 77 cents on the
 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.500
about the so-called 77 cents on the
dollar that women earn and President

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
dollar that women earn and President
 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.710

Obama has repeated this nonsense himself

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
Obama has repeated this nonsense himself
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.849
Obama has repeated this nonsense himself
repeat it's true women earned 77 cents

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859
repeat it's true women earned 77 cents
 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.470
repeat it's true women earned 77 cents
on the dollar but the reason is that

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
on the dollar but the reason is that
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.599
on the dollar but the reason is that
they're out of the labor force for five

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609
they're out of the labor force for five
 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.910
they're out of the labor force for five
to eight years and if you assume a three

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920
to eight years and if you assume a three
 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.789
to eight years and if you assume a three
percent increase per annum there's your

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799
percent increase per annum there's your
 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.800
percent increase per annum there's your
for eight years there's your difference

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810
for eight years there's your difference
 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.159
for eight years there's your difference
and so the reason is that women make

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
and so the reason is that women make
 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.490
and so the reason is that women make
choices that men don't make don't have

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500
choices that men don't make don't have
 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.430
choices that men don't make don't have
to make and the consequence is that
