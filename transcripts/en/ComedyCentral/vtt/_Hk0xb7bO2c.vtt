00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.180
- I don't know what GHB is,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.141
I'm not a marine biologist,

00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:05.088
and I'm not a low life.

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:06.188
That night I was a lowlife.

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:07.651
But normally I'm a high school teacher.

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:10.318
(hip hop music)

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:25.374
- Welcome to This is
Not Happening presents,

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:26.480
One Crazy Night.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.436
So this is what we do.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:29.554
Where a bunch of comedians tell stories

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.005
about a similar subject.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.253
So this is just one crazy night.

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:33.214
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:34.163
first it's Harley Morenstein, everybody.

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:35.240
Let him hear it.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.971
(audience applauding)

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.170
- I started a cooking
show on the internet.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.437
And I don't know how to cook

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:41.789
and I thought that was
a really irresponsible

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:42.735
thing to do.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:43.682
But I did that.

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:45.212
(audience laughing)

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.975
And it was cool, I guess the whole vibe

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.859
of wrapping things in
bacon and getting drunk

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.698
with your friends really works on YouTube.

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:53.197
You know YouTube where
everyone's retarded?

00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:54.870
(audience laughing)

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.671
That's where we put our show.

00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:58.360
So I'm from Montreal, Canada,
and in Montreal, Canada

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.981
we kind of have Celine Dion

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:01.483
and we have the Montreal Canadians.

00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:03.604
And now our show got really popular.

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:06.697
Me and my buddies on the show
we started to get recognized,

00:01:06.697 --> 00:01:07.732
which is really cool.

00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:10.036
See, me and my buddies, we're sloppy fat

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.249
dudes that never really
wear the right shoes

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:14.680
to the club that are cool enough

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.946
to charm the bouncer
into allowing us access

00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:18.394
to the establishment.

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:20.392
Once Epic Mealtime
happened, the internet show,

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:22.177
and our hometown started to respect us

00:01:22.177 --> 00:01:23.614
in this weird, fucked up like,

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:26.216
"You're the bacon man" type of way,

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:28.626
we got access to the clubs.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:30.832
And now only that, when we got in there,

00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:32.399
they would give us bottles of whiskey.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.937
Let's drink them all and
let's drink them fast

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:37.430
and let's drink them hard,
and let's fucking do it,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.432
let's do it big.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.361
And I ended up outside of the club,

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.570
I guess it was because I had this move

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.871
where I cleared a table of all the drinks

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.492
so I could lie down on it.

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:47.563
(audience laughing)

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:49.553
And it was like, I put my hand down

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:51.831
and I slid it all off and laid on my back

00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:53.786
and I remember them picking me up

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.310
by my arms and legs and bringing me out

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.552
and I was on the streets
now and I don't know

00:01:56.552 --> 00:01:58.019
what it was, it was like 2:00 AM.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:00.680
I'm really fucked up and
I'm all balloon headed

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.032
because people like that
I wrap things in bacon

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.374
on the internet and
everyone's giving me pats

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:06.821
on the back, high fives all around,

00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:09.445
but I'm hurting now, I'm hurting.

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:11.413
I'm like, "Water, water!"

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:14.015
I'm grabbing, I'm like, "Water,
water, water, I need it,

00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:14.977
"I need it!"

00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:16.503
And I get a bottle of water.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:17.683
Someone gives it to me.

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:20.629
This guy's like, "I dare you to chug it."

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.508
And I was fast, I was
drunk, I was so fucking,

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:25.815
I was like, "I dare you
to chug it, motherfucker!"

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:28.932
And I knocked it back
and I was just doing it.

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:30.948
And I'm good at drinking water normally

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:34.110
on real-life basis I can
drink water really well.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.076
(audience laughing)

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:39.150
That night, it was like
my mutant super power.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.780
I drank water perfectly.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.872
(audience laughing)

00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:43.107
I was the perfect water drinker.

00:02:43.107 --> 00:02:45.414
I was doing it and like
everyone was loving it,

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:46.585
I don't know if they were loving it,

00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:47.533
I know my eyes were closed.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:49.701
But I felt love around me,

00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.710
as I was doing it and I
was drinking it perfectly,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.171
and the only thing that weirded me out

00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:56.639
is when I kind of burped
barfed back into my mouth

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.389
and I tasted the water I was drinking.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.889
I was like, "It's weird, why is it weird?"

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:04.848
And I look at it, and it's like milky.

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:07.208
I was like, "Why does it look weird?"

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.041
And I see all these faces,
all these smiling faces,

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.402
and I see, I locate the
face that gave me the water,

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:14.455
and I was like, "Why is it,

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:19.053
"It's electrolytes, please
let this be electrolytes."

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:20.532
(audience laughing)

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:22.365
And he was like, "GHB.

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:26.615
"Molly water, cocaine, drugs."

00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:28.214
And I don't know what GHB is,
I'm not a marine biologist

00:03:28.214 --> 00:03:29.848
and I'm not a lowlife.

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:30.863
I'm not a lowlife.

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:32.206
That night I was a lowlife,

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:34.155
but normally I'm a high school teacher.

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:37.209
I'm good, I don't drink
GHB on the streets.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.859
And I drank all this GHB,

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:39.773
I don't even know what that does,

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:40.958
I don't know what that's
supposed to do to me.

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.755
I don't know what's
happening, and I blacked out.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.795
And I blacked out.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:48.212
My eyes closed, and I felt like movement.

00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:53.428
So I know now what was happening,

00:03:53.428 --> 00:03:55.413
was I closed my eyes and
I turned my brain off

00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:58.309
and I started stomping up the street.

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.671
Like really big man, like
big scary man walking,

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:03.088
like get the fuck out of my way,

00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:04.670
there's a big man
stomping down the street,

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.641
he's really fucked up on GHB,
Molly Water, all that jazz,

00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:10.127
and I heard he's a high school teacher,

00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:11.537
he'll fucking eat your soul

00:04:11.537 --> 00:04:12.370
or something like that.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.203
(audience laughing)

00:04:13.203 --> 00:04:16.939
I blacked out and I
woke up, lying face down

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:21.223
in the middle of the busiest
street in downtown Montreal

00:04:21.223 --> 00:04:23.389
and my buddy Dave and my
buddy Tyler were like,

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.714
kicking and pulling me,
like, "Get up, get up!"

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:27.641
And I grabbed them and I was like,

00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.046
"No, I fucking need this.

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:32.485
"You leave me, I need
to get arrested tonight!

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:34.187
"I need that in my life!"

00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:35.522
And they're kinda like dragging me away.

00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:37.784
And I'm 260 pounds, I want to get arrested

00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:39.032
so I'm dead weight.

00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:41.583
And they're pulling me
and they stop for a second

00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:43.707
just to grab a breath of air

00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:46.382
and I fucking bolt so fast.

00:04:46.382 --> 00:04:48.824
I woke up the next day and the sun was out

00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:51.086
and I was in a stranger's
bed and my pants were on

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:53.442
inside out and I was looking
at the wall and the window

00:04:53.442 --> 00:04:54.529
and I just roll over.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.573
And there's a dude there in a wheelchair

00:04:56.573 --> 00:04:58.013
with no legs.

00:04:58.013 --> 00:04:59.100
And he's staring at me.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.175
And there's wooden legs
attached to his wheelchair.

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.856
And I don't say "What
happened?" or anything.

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:06.339
I'm just looking at his
legs on the wheelchair.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.151
And he was like, "My name's
Vlad, I'm from Russia.

00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:11.637
"And I moved to Oklahoma.

00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:13.627
"I got my legs cut off by a train,

00:05:13.627 --> 00:05:15.407
"And Oprah gave me these wooden legs

00:05:15.407 --> 00:05:17.314
"and I outgrew them."

00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:18.617
(audience laughing)

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:21.670
I'm like, "Yeah, Oprah okay,
fuck talking about Oprah.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.750
"Why are my pants on inside out?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.682
"Who are you Russian man?"

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:26.353
I'm so weirded out right now, I'm like,

00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:27.475
"I'm gonna head outta here."

00:05:27.475 --> 00:05:29.267
And as I go out, I guess
it's his roommate walks out,

00:05:29.267 --> 00:05:32.035
as big as me but like, fit.

00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:34.598
Like for real the fastest runner I bet.

00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:35.547
(audience laughing)

00:05:35.547 --> 00:05:37.115
And this guy comes in,
and he's like, "Sup, dog?

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:38.367
"I'm Point Man."

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:39.354
(audience laughing)

00:05:39.354 --> 00:05:40.378
I'm like, "What's up, Point Man?"

00:05:40.378 --> 00:05:41.524
He's like, "Why don't you
grab a seat over there?"

00:05:41.524 --> 00:05:43.048
And I sit down and I'm
sitting with Point Man

00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:44.826
and Vlad the Russian with no legs

00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:47.007
and I'm sitting there,
the first thing he does

00:05:47.007 --> 00:05:48.391
is he pulls out these documents and a pen

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.128
and he slides it across
the table, and he's like,

00:05:50.128 --> 00:05:51.195
"Let me tell you something about this idea

00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:52.591
"I got called Tit Pillows."

00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:53.755
And this is his words
(audience laughing)

00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:54.751
not mine, this is his pitch,

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:56.495
I would pitch Tit Pillows way better,

00:05:56.495 --> 00:05:57.476
but this is what he told me.

00:05:57.476 --> 00:05:59.275
He was like, "So you basically collaborate

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.272
"with plastic surgeon that specializes

00:06:01.272 --> 00:06:03.191
"in breast reduction,
you keep the titty fat,

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:04.803
"we're gonna put em in pillows,

00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:07.013
"and in various shapes and sizes.

00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:09.526
"Brown tits, Asian tits, white tits,

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:10.482
"whatever you want, bro."

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:14.482
He was like, "You're gonna
be the spokesperson."

00:06:15.893 --> 00:06:18.571
And at this moment I swear to God I notice

00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:20.738
like crossbow on the wall.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.068
And like a knife collection.

00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:26.673
And I'm like, "Dude, I'm
the fucking spokesperson."

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:29.424
Like pen, I'm signing a document now.

00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:31.916
Why am I signing a document,
I don't know what time it is,

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.781
it's the next day, where's my team?

00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:37.285
But the Point Man owns my soul basically.

00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:39.763
And I'm like, "Alright,
I'm gonna head out."

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:41.627
And Point Man's like,
"Whoa, before you go."

00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:44.239
Pulls out Perfect Strangers season one.

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:45.680
(audience laughing)

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.989
Makes me watch it all.

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:51.373
All Perfect Strangers
season one, I sit down

00:06:51.373 --> 00:06:53.069
and I watch the entire thing with him.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.444
I got so much fucking
Balki in Perfect Strangers,

00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:57.366
enough for four lifetimes.

00:06:57.366 --> 00:06:59.859
The moral of the story is fuck my friends.

00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:02.018
If I say I need to get arrested,
I need that in my life,

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:02.967
you leave me alone.

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:04.894
You let me stay there and
you let me get arrested.

00:07:04.894 --> 00:07:06.263
Cause I don't need this shit.

00:07:06.263 --> 00:07:07.228
(hip hop music)

00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:10.395
