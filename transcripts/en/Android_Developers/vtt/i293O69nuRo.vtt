Hsu: Uh, so in my experience
with the Android platform,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.434
it's been really easy
to write, uh, modular code,

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:11.367
because the application model
actually encourages it.

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.634
So, um, in development--

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.801
in actually six weeks
from start to finish,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:20.501
uh, we rewrote all
of the activities several times,

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:22.133
the database back end

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.501
and our web service API calls,

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:27.501
because we just wanted
to do more things,

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:28.834
or do it differently.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.400
And it's really easy,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.901
and you
shouldn't be afraid to do it.
