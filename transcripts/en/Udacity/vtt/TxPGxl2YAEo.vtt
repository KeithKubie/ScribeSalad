00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
From 0 to 10, we have 5 individuals.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
From 11 to 20 it's 7.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
From 21 to 30, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And finally from 31 to 40, it is the remaining 5 data points.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In this example, our chart would look like this.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is a histogram that depicts the count in this data set as the function of the range.
