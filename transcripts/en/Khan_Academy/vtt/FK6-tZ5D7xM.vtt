00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.700
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.700
is get some familiarity with
the graph of tangent of theta.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.833
And to do that, I'll set
up a little unit circle

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:13.700
so that we can visualize what the tangent

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.734
of various thetas are.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.961
Let's say that's a y-axis
and this is my x-axis.

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.701
That is my x-axis, and the unit circle

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:28.066
would look something like this.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:31.146
We already know, this is all a refresher

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:33.966
of the unit circle
definition of trig functions,

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.900
that if I have an angle, an angle theta,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.900
where one side is a positive x-axis

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.900
and then the other side,
so this is the other side,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.700
so the angle is formed like this,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.166
that where this ray
intersects the unit circle,

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.166
the coordinates of that,

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.033
the x and y coordinates
are the sine of theta.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.566
Sorry, the x-coordinate
is the cosine of theta.

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:58.261
It's the cosine of theta, sine of theta.

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:01.900
The x-coordinate here is cosine theta.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.300
The y-coordinate there
is the sine of theta.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.500
But we're concerned
about tangent of theta.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.100
We know that tangent of
theta is the same thing

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.666
as the sine of theta
over the cosine of theta.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.166
Or if you're starting from
the origin and you're going

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:21.166
and you're taking the value of
essentially the y-coordinate,

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.433
the y-coordinate over the x-coordinate,

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.642
it's essentially the slope of this line.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.950
This is going to be your
change in y over change in x.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.833
This right over here is
going to be the slope,

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:35.300
the slope, I guess you could say,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.700
of this ray right over here.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.900
That's going to help us visualize

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.366
what the tangents of different thetas are.

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.033
Let me clean up my unit
circle a little bit

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.766
just so that we can ...

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.100
All right, there we go.

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:50.667
So now let's make a table.

00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:54.496
So let's make a table.

00:01:56.878 --> 00:01:58.900
So for various thetas, let's think about

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.540
what tangent of theta is going to be,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.766
tangent of theta.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.700
So maybe the easiest one,
if theta is zero radians,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.715
so if it's zero radians, what
is the slope of this ray?

00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:10.546
That ray's, the slope is zero.

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:13.034
As x changes, y doesn't change at all.

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:14.832
Now let's think about,

00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:16.566
and I'm just going to pick values

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.300
that are very easy for us to think about

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.433
what the tangent of those values are,

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:21.837
and they'll help us form,

00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:23.966
they'll help us think about
the shape of the graph

00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:26.266
of y is equal to tangent of theta.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:31.445
So let's take pi over four radians.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:37.700
This one right over here,
theta is equal to pi over four.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.960
Now why is that interesting?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.554
And sometimes, it's
easier thinking degrees.

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:42.635
It's a 45-degree angle.

00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:45.833
This here, your x-coordinate
and your y-coordinate

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.044
is the same.

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:48.833
You might remember, it's
square root of two over two,

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:49.900
square root of two over two.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.500
But the important thing is

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.033
whatever you move in the x direction,

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:55.238
you move the same in the y direction.

00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:58.566
So the slope of this ray right over here

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.833
is going to be equal to one,

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:01.966
or another way of thinking about it,

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:04.500
tangent of theta is
going to be equal to one.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.433
Or sine of theta over cosine of theta,

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:07.366
they're the same thing,

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.433
so you're going to get one.

00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:13.032
Let me just clean that up here

00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:16.466
just because I'm going to keep
reusing the same unit circle.

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:20.996
So if I have theta is pi over four,

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:24.233
then the tangent of theta
is going to be equal to one.

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:28.566
Now what if theta is equal
to negative pi over four?

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.733
That is this right over here.

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.866
Let me just draw a little triangle here.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.167
So when x, this x-coordinate over here,

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.300
is square root of two
over two, we know that.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.202
We've seen that multiple
times, square root of two ...

00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:48.161
Actually, let me label
it a little bit better.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.166
So here, our theta is equal to

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.833
negative pi over four radians.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.130
Or if you like to think in degrees,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.766
this would be negative 45 degrees.

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:01.300
And now, your sine and
cosine of this angle

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.633
are going to be the
opposites of each other.

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:06.500
The cosine is square root of two over two.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.167
The x-coordinate of where this intersects

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:09.700
is square root of two over two.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.433
The y-coordinate here is
negative square root of two,

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:17.066
negative square root of two over two.

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:18.966
So what's the tangent?

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.833
Well, it's going to be
your sine over your cosine,

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:23.766
which is going to be negative
one, and you see that.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:25.433
For however much you
move in the x direction,

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:27.237
you move the opposite of that.

00:04:27.237 --> 00:04:30.900
You move the negative of
that in the y direction.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.002
Let me clean this up a little bit

00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:35.584
because I want to keep
reusing my unit circle.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.166
So there you go.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.900
And so this is going to be negative one.

00:04:41.144 --> 00:04:45.366
This is going to be negative one.

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:48.350
Actually, let's just start
plotting a few of these points.

00:04:48.442 --> 00:04:51.689
If we assume that this is the theta axis,

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.386
if you can see that,
that's the theta axis,

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:57.366
and if this is the
y-axis, that's the y-axis,

00:04:57.366 --> 00:05:02.233
we immediately see
tangent of zero is zero.

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:06.700
Tangent of pi over four is
one, thinking in radians.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.666
Tangent of negative pi
over four is negative one.

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:12.340
Now let's think of it.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.925
Right now, if you just
saw that, you might say,

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:15.079
"Oh, maybe this is some type of a line,"

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:17.900
but we'll see very clearly it's not a line

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.900
because what happens as our
angle gets closer and closer to,

00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:28.700
as our angle gets closer
and closer to pi over two,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.858
what happens to the slope of this line?

00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:32.033
So that is theta.

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:34.433
We're getting closer and
closer to pi over two.

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.633
This ray, I guess I should say,

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:39.500
is getting closer and closer
to approaching the vertical,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.392
so its slope is getting more
and more and more positive,

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.566
and if you go all the way to pi over two,

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:47.300
the slope at that point
is really undefined

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.802
but it's approaching,

00:05:48.802 --> 00:05:51.986
one way to think about it is
it is approaching infinity.

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:53.706
So as you get closer and
closer to pi over two,

00:05:53.706 --> 00:05:55.366
so I'm going to make a ...

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:57.689
I'm going to draw essentially
a vertical asymptote

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.800
right over here at pi over two

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.500
because it's not going to be ...

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.500
I guess one way we could think about it,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.233
it's approaching infinity there,

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:10.263
so this is going to be
looking something like this.

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:12.900
It's going to be looking
something like this.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.900
The slope of the ray as
you get closer and closer

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.368
to pi over two is getting
closer and closer to infinity.

00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:22.366
What happens when the angle
is getting closer and closer

00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:24.433
to negative pi over two?

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:27.233
Is getting closer and closer
to negative pi over two?

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:28.900
Well, then, the slope is getting

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.700
more and more and more negative.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.700
It's really approaching negative.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.100
It's approaching negative infinity.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.700
So let me draw that.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.014
Once again, not quite
defined right over there,

00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:42.566
we have a vertical asymptote,

00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:47.566
and we are approaching negative infinity.

00:06:48.088 --> 00:06:50.233
We are approaching negative infinity.

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:52.766
That's what the graph of
tangent of theta looks

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:57.366
just over this section
of, I guess we could say

00:06:57.366 --> 00:06:59.833
the theta axis, but then
we could keep going.

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:02.300
Then we could keep going because

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.309
if our angle, right after
we cross pi over two,

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.135
so let's say we've just
crossed pi over two,

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.100
so we went right across it,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.633
now what is the slope?

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:12.700
What is the slope of this thing?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.381
Well, the slope of this
thing is hugely negative.

00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:17.033
It looks almost like what
I just drew down here.

00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:18.766
It's hugely negative.

00:07:18.827 --> 00:07:21.633
So then the graph jumps back down here,

00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:23.833
and it's hugely negative again.

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:24.900
It's hugely negative.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.366
And then as we increase our theta,

00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:31.166
as we increase our theta,
it becomes less and less

00:07:31.166 --> 00:07:35.724
and less negative all
the way to when we go to,

00:07:35.724 --> 00:07:36.767
what is this ...

00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:38.375
all the way until we go to ...

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.233
let me plot this ...

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:43.167
this angle right over here.

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:44.725
Now what is this angle?

00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:46.366
This, well, I haven't told you yet.

00:07:46.658 --> 00:07:49.043
Let's say that this angle right over here

00:07:49.043 --> 00:07:52.000
is three pi over four.

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:54.567
Now why did I pick three pi over four?

00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:59.567
Because that is pi over
two plus pi over four.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.371
Or you could say two pis over
for plus another pi over four

00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:04.700
is three pi over four.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.114
And the reason why this is interesting

00:08:06.114 --> 00:08:08.028
is because it is another,

00:08:08.028 --> 00:08:09.700
it's forming another,
I guess you could say

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.176
pi over four- pi over
four-pi over two triangle,

00:08:14.176 --> 00:08:17.233
or a 45-45-90 triangle,

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:20.644
where the x and y-coordinates
or the x and y distances

00:08:20.644 --> 00:08:22.101
have the same magnitude.

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.033
But now, the x is going to be negative

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:25.500
and the y is positive.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.702
So the slope here is
going to be the slope,

00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:32.100
the same slope as we had for
negative pi over four radians.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.333
We're going to have a
slope of negative one.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.642
At three pi over four, we
have a slope of negative one.

00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:43.633
Then we increase our
angle all the way to pi.

00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:46.233
Now our slope is back to zero.

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.433
Our slope is back to zero.

00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:51.033
And then as we go beyond that,

00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:56.033
as we go to, as we increase
by another pi over four,

00:08:57.433 --> 00:09:00.166
our slope goes back to being positive one.

00:09:00.396 --> 00:09:02.966
Our slope goes back to being positive one.

00:09:02.966 --> 00:09:04.690
And then once again, as we approach

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.433
three pi over two,

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:09.214
our slope is becoming more
and more and more positive,

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:14.100
getting, approaching positive infinity.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.377
This slope knows if you move a
little bit in the x direction,

00:09:16.377 --> 00:09:18.900
you're moving a lot up in the y direction.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.766
So once again, so now the graph
is going to look like this.

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:24.566
Let me do it in a color
that you can actually see.

00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:29.904
The graph is going to
look something like this.

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:34.833
And it will just continue to do this.

00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:39.833
It will just continue to
do this every pi radians,

00:09:41.725 --> 00:09:43.705
actually, let me do that as a dotted line,

00:09:43.705 --> 00:09:48.033
every pi radians over
and over and over again.

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:52.748
Let me go back, pi, and I
can draw these asymptotes.

00:09:52.934 --> 00:09:55.233
I can draw these asymptotes.

00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:57.166
Let me draw that and that.

00:09:57.166 --> 00:09:59.269
And so the graph of tangent,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.196
the graph of tangent of
theta is going to look,

00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:05.833
is going to look something like this.

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.166
And we could obviously, it's periodic,

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.090
we could just keep doing
it on and on and on

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.733
in both directions.
