Here's the way to look at it is we count up

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the number of equally probable events on this side, 1, 2, 3;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then we count up out of those how many appear on this side,

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
just one; so the answer is one-third.
