00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:02.631
- [Voiceover] Let's
say that we had a cube,

00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:04.744
let me draw the cube here,

00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:07.971
So we have a cube, and we know

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:12.475
that the volume of this cube is equal to

00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:17.119
512 cubic centimeters.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.488
So my question to you is, what are

00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:21.856
the dimensions of this cube?

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:25.176
So what is this length gonna be?

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.475
What is this, I guess you could say depth,

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:29.193
and what is this height going to be?

00:00:29.193 --> 00:00:31.097
And, we know it's a cube, so these are

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.071
all going to be equal.

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:35.091
And so like always, encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:37.602
and try to figure it out.

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:40.826
Well let's call this length x.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.614
If that's x then this is going to be x,

00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:44.518
and then this is x as well.

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:47.954
So if the volume is 512 cubic centimeters,

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:50.531
that means that

00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:54.268
x times x times x

00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:57.078
is going to be equal to 512.

00:00:57.078 --> 00:00:59.370
Is going to be equal to 512,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.320
or we could say that x to the third power

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.178
is equal to 512,

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:04.815
or we could say that x is equal

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:09.325
to the cube root of 512.

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:11.456
So what's the cube root of 512?

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:13.808
And the easiest way I can
think about doing this,

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:15.038
if I don't have a calculator,

00:01:15.038 --> 00:01:18.777
is to just try to do a prime
factorization of this by hand.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.819
So that's what I'm going to attempt to do.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.094
So let's see, does two go into 512?

00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:25.811
Sure, 512s even, so this is going to be

00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:30.017
two times, let's see, 256, yeah,

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:33.569
two times 256.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.796
256 that's also divisible by two.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.351
That's two times 128,

00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:40.817
which is also divisible by two,

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:44.295
that's two time 64,

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:45.664
which is also divisible by two.

00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:47.917
That's two times 32,

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.006
let's see, I can keep going,

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.957
that's two times 16.

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:55.625
Which is two times eight,

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.274
which is two times four,

00:01:57.274 --> 00:01:59.782
which is two times two.

00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:01.477
So 512 that's the same thing as

00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:03.148
two to the, let's see you have,

00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:05.284
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:07.049
seven, eight, nine.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930
That's two to the ninth power.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.812
But what we care about is

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:13.527
what times itself times itself is equal,

00:02:13.527 --> 00:02:15.176
what number, if I have three of 'em

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:18.380
and I multiply 'em
together, get us to 512?

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.796
And to think about that, we could say,

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:21.956
"Look, I have nine numbers here.

00:02:21.956 --> 00:02:23.953
"So let me divide into three groups."

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:26.530
So if this is one group,

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.502
and this is the next group,

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:31.336
and then this is the next group

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:33.635
right over here,

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.887
we could say that 512 is the same thing as

00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:38.139
two times two times two, which is eight,

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.647
times two times two times
two, which is eight,

00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:43.294
times two times two times two.

00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:47.636
So 512 is the same thing as
eight to the third power.

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:50.090
So we could say, that,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.184
x, I'll do it over here,

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:55.342
x is equal to the cube root of,

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.478
instead of writing 512,

00:02:57.478 --> 00:02:58.964
instead of writing 512,

00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:01.379
I could write eight to the third power.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.770
Now, what's the cube root of
something to the third power?

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.558
Well, it's just gonna be this something.

00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:09.668
So x, x is going to be equal to eight.

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:12.826
So if the volume here is
512 cubic centimeters,

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.705
each dimension is going
to be eight centimeters.

00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:19.327
So x is equal to eight centimeters.

00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:20.999
This is equal to eight centimeters.

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.438
I'm just writing the units now.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.203
This is equal to eight centimeters,

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.341
and we're done.

00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:26.571
But, if you didn't know offhand

00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:28.220
that eight to the third power is 512,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.354
this is a reasonable way of
coming to that conclusion.

00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:33.296
Anyway, hopefully that helped.
