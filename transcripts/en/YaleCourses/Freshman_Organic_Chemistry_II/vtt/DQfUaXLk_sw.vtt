1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.320
Yeah.
Since it's going to take a minute for this to start up,

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.120
I'll show you a demonstration here.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.000
<v 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.790
<v 0>it's a way to make tea.</v>

5
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.343
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.570
<v 0>It's a really clever device called a sox Sullen extractor,</v>

7
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.601
and it,

8
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.601
it was invented in order to extract stuff from like bark or leaves or something

9
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.800
like that.
Something that's very insoluble.

10
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.630
So you could imagine to do it like tea,
you put it in a filter paper,

11
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.750
poor solvent through it.
Some of it dissolves,
it goes on through,

12
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.480
and then you have to concentrate the solution.
Okay.

13
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.940
But there's another way to do it,
which is to use this thing here.

14
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.490
Now,
how are we doing

15
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.660
<v 1>and see if I can get the,
uh,</v>

16
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.470
to show up here.
Okay.

17
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.770
<v 0>So the idea is that the problem with that is if the stuff isn't very soluble,</v>

18
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.700
it takes an enormous amount of solvent to get it out.

19
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.260
So what was invented by this man?
Socks lit

20
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.070
<v 1>and I'm having trouble here.
It's his audience,
right.
Dot.</v>

21
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.770
Uh,

22
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.440
<v 0>why is this not on?</v>

23
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.320
<v 0>Oh,
somebody unplugged it.</v>

25
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.350
Sorry for the confusion here.

26
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.190
Technically challenged today.

27
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.343
<v 1>There we go.</v>

28
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.453
Here we go.

29
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.270
<v 0>Okay.
So</v>

30
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.780
<v 1>Huh?</v>

31
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.211
<v 0>Oh,
we have,</v>

32
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.810
here is a flask down below that's going to have the solvent and not very much

33
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:48.644
solvent.

34
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.010
<v 1>Okay.
Uh,
am I good?
I like that.
Okay,</v>

35
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.680
<v 0>so we're going to boil the solvent.
It's going to come through the,</v>

36
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.400
through this arm here,
up to a condenser,

37
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.850
and then drip into the tea leaves or whatever it is we want to extract,

38
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.320
held in a little cup inside here,
right?
And it's solid down here.

39
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.830
So this is just a cup,
but there's this funny snake,

40
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:22.831
like a tube that comes from the bottom of this up around,

41
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.680
down and back inside toward the flask.

42
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.790
So watch what happens when I,
for some,
uh,

43
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.010
liquid in here.

44
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.631
Okay?

45
00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:52.370
So if you just pour water through a filter,

46
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.100
the water runs through very rapidly and doesn't have time to get,

47
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.440
become saturated.
So it's inefficient in two ways.

48
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:04.550
You've got to pour lots of water through and it doesn't get saturated on the way

49
00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:07.700
through this way.
The,
the uh,
liquid,

50
00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:12.290
you distilled up drips down in there,
sits with the stuff which has held,

51
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:15.740
remember in like a filter paper inside here,
right?

52
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.560
And you can see that the liquid,

53
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.800
let me see if I can get it so you can see it.

54
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.640
Did you see that the liquid went not only of course in here where it's with the

55
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:31.880
tea leaves,
but also through this too,
but not that far.

56
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.040
Okay.
So it's there and you can see the meniscus in the side arm.

57
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.170
Now what's going to happen when I pour a little more in it's drip,
drip,
drip.

58
00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:44.030
Actually of course from a condenser,

59
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.910
it's getting right up to the top of that side arm.
What's going to happen.

60
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.910
So it's sitting there and becoming saturated and we go a little bit more,

61
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.413
what's it doing?

62
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.190
It siphons right?

63
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.890
But it sits there with the hot liquid until it gets to the top.

64
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.770
Then it draws all that off.
And then what happens?

65
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.480
More liquid boils up and comes in right and dissolves.

66
00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:34.100
It's the same liquid.
Of course.
It's been distilled now.
All right.

67
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.840
So it comes on up and pretty soon it'll go a little quicker this time because

68
00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:40.550
there's drops in the side arm

69
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.520
and it drains again.

70
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.620
So he use just a small amount of liquid over and over again.

71
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.160
And there are no moving parts right,
except boiling and the liquid.

72
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.180
So it's a really beautiful design of a clever apparatus if you want to make tea

73
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:05.474
efficiently.

74
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.160
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.</v>

75
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.520
<v 0>Now this is starting up</v>

76
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.403
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

77
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.650
<v 0>and if I'm lucky,
it will have backed up my most recent work.</v>

78
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.380
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

79
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.040
<v 0>it's got almost all of it.
That's good.</v>

80
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.460
Let's see if it will come on.
Yeah,

81
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.833
<v 1>yeah.</v>

82
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.070
<v 0>Okay.
Thanks for bearing with me.
Okay.
So a little more about,</v>

83
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:49.340
uh,
uh,
the reactivity of,
of uh,

84
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.930
acid derivatives and then on to,
um,

85
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.870
to the sugar glucose proof,
one of the finest logical,

86
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.420
uh,
creations of the 19th century or ever,

87
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.110
uh,
first,
uh,

88
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.220
alkylation we s we started talking about this last time about the fact that an

89
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.180
[inaudible],
uh,

90
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.090
has charge partial charge both on the carbon and the oxygen.

91
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.460
So if you want to put an alk eal group on by an sn two type reaction problem.

92
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.810
Pardon me.
Oh,
thank you.
Yeah.

93
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.730
Uh,
one more time into the breach here.

94
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.490
John is on the,
uh,

95
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.820
on the button about whether I'm rehearsing the timings.
Okay.

96
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:46.230
So the question is whether you react with the carbon or the oxygen when you do

97
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.780
sn two,
when you react with methyl iodide,

98
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.120
now you could do a calculation and see,
uh,
where the homo is,

99
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.760
right?
The Homo looks like that.

100
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.770
It's a Pi orbital obviously with one,
a node,

101
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.110
a addition to the p orbitals that it's made of,
and that's big on the carbon.

102
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.000
So that would favor reaction on the carbon and the attack would be from the top

103
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.210
because it would come in on top of the p orbital of the carbon.

104
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.290
On the other hand,
if you look at the electrostatic potential,

105
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:23.190
the energy of Proton would have on the surface of this molecule when it's in

106
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:24.120
contact with it,

107
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.980
it's not the most favorable at the position to the homo.

108
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.360
It's minus 143 kilocalories per mole for a proton.

109
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:34.470
That would be there,

110
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.210
but it proton here is minus 170 kilocalories per mole.

111
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.980
And notice that it's the,
uh,
that it not only favors the oxygen,

112
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.830
but it's a sigma attack rather than a pie attack.
So you could imagine,
uh,

113
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.400
either of these positions attacking,
uh,
the methyl iodide.
Now,

114
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:58.250
in fact,
it turns out,
uh,
so that if at attack the carbon,

115
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:02.040
it would attack from the top is shown up here on the right out of the plane.

116
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.190
If it attack the oxygen,
it would attack in the plane.
Right?
And in fact,
it,

117
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.090
the major product is attack on carbon with methyl iodide and it's a negligible

118
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:16.500
amount of Oh,
a methylation.
But it's not always that way.

119
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:20.310
If you have a different,
uh,
a reagent to re,
uh,
different,
uh,

120
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.480
electrified to be attacked by the nucleophile,
for example,

121
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:29.340
silicon and displays chloride,
then it turns out to be just the other way.

122
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:33.870
It goes on oxygen,
85% yield and a negligible amount on the carbon.

123
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.790
So this is obviously a finely balanced thing and is not something that,
uh,

124
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.800
that you're going to be able to predict.

125
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:45.801
This is a part of lore which things go where right now if you use a strong an

126
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:53.040
ion to abstract the hydrogen adjacent to the Carbon Eel,

127
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.450
make the analyte right,

128
00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.720
it's PKA is 12 units higher so that the equilibrium lies completely to form the

129
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.850
ina laid an eye on.

130
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.830
But one could imagine two different in a late and I and swear a protons been

131
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.200
taken from the right or from the left.

132
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.020
So there's another question about a possible reaction mixtures when you react

133
00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:21.940
this with meth.
Elia died and if it's done with two equivalents of methyl iodide,

134
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:26.770
this was done by professor house at,
at the Mit.
Uh,

135
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.400
he found that 41% of the product,
uh,

136
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.870
alkylated on the ch two group and 9% alkylated on the group that had a methyl

137
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:42.460
group attached to it already.
But these aren't very good yields.

138
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.960
There was also 22% of recovered starting material.

139
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.850
So the question is,

140
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:53.851
where did the proton come from that went onto the recovered starting material.

141
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.330
Now this was done by adding a methyl iodide to the [inaudible] solution.

142
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.530
So there's just a little bit of methyl iodide there that reacts,

143
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.020
right and makes the key tone one of these two key tones down here.
Okay.

144
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.740
But then additional anhilate could abstract a proton for one of these and that

145
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:19.930
could become the new inculcate.

146
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.970
That could be where the proton came from to make the starting material,
right?

147
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:25.901
And in fact,

148
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:30.901
21% of the product has a second method beheaded and 6% of the product has three

149
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:37.750
new methyls added to the compound.
So it's a real dog's breakfast.

150
00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:40.750
It's not the way you want to do this kind of thing,
right?

151
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.790
It's a very inefficient reaction.

152
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.910
There are other ways to do it.
Like for example,
use lithium,
uh,

153
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.360
die ice appropriately amid another really strong base.

154
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.600
This is done at very low temperature,
right?

155
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.750
And then the people who did this,
uh,
put in,
uh,

156
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.800
man goodies dichloride in a complex with lithium chloride again at minus 78.

157
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.130
And they made a different in a late and I,

158
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:12.940
and the one with manganese as the counter ion,
right?

159
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.910
And then they added this,

160
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.970
they added to this 1.3 equivalents of Benzel bromide and a different solvent.

161
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.260
The a methyl parole and methyl Perala don't,

162
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.790
and did that at room temperature.
Notice these are a lot,
this is lore.

163
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:35.791
This is a lot of fine description of exactly what solve what temperatures and so

164
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:39.340
on how you do it.
And under those conditions,

165
00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:44.341
they were able to get 88% of this single product after distillation,

166
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.100
right?
So it's the pure stuff.
So it's a very high,

167
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.280
it's possible to do these accolations in it as a very yield reaction.

168
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.590
Now this is,
this is what's called an org sin prep.
There's when people,

169
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:59.360
when there's a very valuable,

170
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:04.100
a technique that people would like to be able to repeat,
it's uh,

171
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.860
it's submitted by the people who,
who,
uh,

172
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.610
who created it and checked by people at this,

173
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:15.290
at this organic syntheses operation,
and then they publish it.

174
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.140
And then you can believe that if you,
if you try it,

175
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:21.050
you'll be able to do it here because it's been checked.

176
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.330
So things that are an org send prep.

177
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.480
I've been very carefully done and all of these conditions are there,

178
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.200
but it would be very difficult ahead of time to figure out exactly all the

179
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:34.400
tricks you need to do to do it.
But you can look it up in organic synthesis.

180
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.190
Okay.
Uh,

181
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.790
Lda can also be used with carboxylic acids now.
Uh,

182
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.350
so we want to make the analyte,
we want to extract that Red Proton.

183
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:48.950
Could you see any problem involved when you treat this with a strong base?

184
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.533
<v 1>Hagen,</v>

185
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.950
<v 0>how's that?
What's,
what's the name of this product or this a starting material.</v>

186
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.690
What kind of compound?

187
00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.480
<v 1>Right.</v>

188
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.490
<v 0>Why did they call it a carboxylic acid?</v>

189
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:02.963
<v 1>Great.</v>

190
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.440
<v 0>That's it.
Good up protons.
Is that the Proton it gives up?
Nope.</v>

191
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.240
Gives that one up so you don't get the eternal light.
However,

192
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.360
this is a strong enough base that it's possible to pull off a second proton and

193
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.290
in fact get the analyte which lacks the negative charge that's supposed to be

194
00:16:22.291 --> 00:16:24.120
there.
Okay,

195
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.070
and then that can react with an owl kio bromide at the more nuclear fillic,

196
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:34.071
the less stable and I and center and give a good yield of the of the alkylated

197
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:39.000
acid.
It's also even better of course to do die carbon eels,

198
00:16:39.001 --> 00:16:42.900
which are more strongly acidic,
so you don't need these really strong acids,

199
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.800
so you use f oxide to do this.
It's,

200
00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:50.460
it's a acidic enough that you could imagine using hydroxide,

201
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.690
but you don't use hydroxide to do this.
You use F oxide.

202
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.530
Can you guess why you useF oxide rather than hydroxide?

203
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.831
As always,

204
00:17:01.831 --> 00:17:05.790
when you begin to get complicated reactions that this is not a very complicated

205
00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:06.270
one.

206
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:11.270
There's several ways things can react and that this is not as in the last case

207
00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:15.750
where you could pull off the wrong proton.
Right.
In this case,
the,
the,

208
00:17:15.751 --> 00:17:20.340
the base can not only pull off the Proton,
it can also act as a nucleophile.

209
00:17:20.341 --> 00:17:22.110
And what would it do as a nucleophile

210
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.490
<v 1>Jack?
That's right.</v>

211
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:30.260
<v 0>Hydroxide would attack the Ester,
right?
Oh,
h minus would come on.</v>

212
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:30.860
Oh.

213
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.660
F oxide would come off and you would convert the Ester to an acid,

214
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
which would react with the strong base hydroxide.

215
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:42.470
And that would be the end of the line because you don't have this really super

216
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:46.730
strong base that could pull off two protons.
Okay.

217
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:51.420
So,
but if he was F and that attacks here,
who cares,

218
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.770
one or the other f oxides is going to come off and you're back where you started

219
00:17:55.771 --> 00:18:00.120
again.
Right.
So then it's possible to wait until you pull that proton off.

220
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.890
Okay.
So that's called,
that compound is a Beta Quito.
Esther.

221
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.760
It's got a ketone in the second carbon from the ester group.
Okay.

222
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:12.680
So you make the anti ion reacted with,
uh,
with our,

223
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:17.070
with the leaving group,
and now you treat it with hydroxide,
right.

224
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.880
Because what you were really after was getting this acid with an r group on it.

225
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.940
Okay.
Uh,

226
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:28.350
but you don't use o h minus for that or you can use to Esther's to make the

227
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.960
thing acidic,
right.

228
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:35.961
Do exactly the same stuff and get the are on now with two acid groups and of

229
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:41.271
course it would be possible to do it a second time and put a second our group on

230
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:45.930
before you do the while.
It's still an ester before you add the hydroxide.

231
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:46.741
Okay.

232
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:51.741
So you can put out kill groups on these Beta Keto esters or melodic Esther

233
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.970
[inaudible] two with two Carbox late groups on it as melodic acid.

234
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.430
Okay.
Now you might want those compounds but much more,

235
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.570
uh,
or,

236
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:08.571
or we already in fact saw using Cyan OCD Kester you remember when we saw that we

237
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:12.720
used it?
Where are was this are with the leaving group?

238
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:15.870
It was the Mitsui Nobu procedure that we went through and showed that,

239
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.030
that that also then can can hydrolyze the,
the CNE group,

240
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:23.940
the night trial as well to give a second carboxyl group.

241
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.910
But mostly people aren't after this.

242
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.240
What thereafter is protonating those to give to give the Beta keto acid or the

243
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.230
melodic acid?
Why did I draw it that way?
Do you remember?

244
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.510
<v 1>The h ports would be higher hydrogen</v>

245
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.750
<v 0>bonded to this oxygen,
but it can do more than that.</v>

246
00:19:56.751 --> 00:19:59.660
Remember from when we were talking about the Bitsa Nobu reaction,

247
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.910
we can do this right,

248
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.960
which results in decarboxylation when we heat it,
right?

249
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.540
And those are enols,

250
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.620
which of course can I summarize to the related ketone or on the second case into

251
00:20:12.621 --> 00:20:13.454
an acid.

252
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:18.550
So the real purpose of using this Beta ketone Ester or the melodic Esther is to

253
00:20:20.031 --> 00:20:23.570
put the,
our group on and then get these compounds.

254
00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:27.080
So it's another way of getting to what was effectively that eda late,

255
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.710
except having the second Carbonie along made it easier to get,

256
00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:34.220
you didn't need to use those really strong basis.
So you can,

257
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.530
you can synthesize and alkylated acid or an alkaline,

258
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.401
uh,

259
00:20:39.401 --> 00:20:43.850
alkaline and acid or now collated ketone alco calculated in the Alpha position

260
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.340
by using these,
uh,
these dye carbon eel compounds.

261
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:54.070
The one on the top is called a Ceto with Siddique Esther synthesis.
Because,

262
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.020
because when you,
when this was still an ester here,
this was ch three,
uh,

263
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:02.860
Ceto acetic acid,
right?

264
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:07.420
So it goes by way of that to get the,
to get the Ketone,
or this one,

265
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:11.170
as we said,
was melodic Esther,
that we started with to get the acid.

266
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.870
Okay.

267
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.610
Notice that these are ways of adding to the art group two carbons,

268
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.420
right?
Either with the Ketone,
I mean,
there'd be another carbon of course,

269
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:25.600
if we're a ketone or two carbons here to make an acid.

270
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.030
And so when one's thinking about synthesis,

271
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:30.910
you try to think about how to put more carbons on.

272
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:33.970
Remember the aren't I stared procedure.
We,
we,
uh,

273
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.450
we talked about with dyes or methane or cyanide,

274
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:42.451
displacing chlorine from an art group or making a grin yard out of the alcohol

275
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.200
haylight and then add Nco to those all add one carbon to the chain.

276
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.570
But this thing adds two carbons at least or more in the,
in the case of this,

277
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:55.910
when you have an art group there and remember,
uh,

278
00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.990
adding a nucleophile to open an EFP oxide also adds to carbon.

279
00:22:01.011 --> 00:22:04.450
So they're there.
If you're in the business of organic synthesis,

280
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.610
these things become second nature.
I need to add this Aha,

281
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.160
I would use that reagent or that region or that region.
Okay.

282
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:16.810
Then one of the most important reactions is the aldol condensation.

283
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.333
<v 1>Okay?</v>

284
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.260
<v 0>It was discovered first with acid Aldehyde,</v>

285
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.600
which treated with base makes the,
uh,

286
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.320
makes the analyte right,
but it can react with itself.

287
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.203
<v 1>All right?</v>

288
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.540
<v 0>And then when you protonate the o minus,
right,
you get this compound,</v>

289
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:44.340
which in the case of acid Aldehyde,

290
00:22:44.341 --> 00:22:48.720
this particular one with a methyl group here in the ch two group here has the

291
00:22:48.721 --> 00:22:52.800
name Al Doll.
So this is called the aldol reaction.

292
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.240
It makes Aldol,
but you can make it with other groups here as well,

293
00:22:57.241 --> 00:23:01.320
not just not just with a methyl group.
And so generically,

294
00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:02.760
they're called Aldols,

295
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.720
the obviously the name is Aldehyde and alcohol Aldol,

296
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:11.400
but it's uh,
it can be dehydrated,

297
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.590
right?
Uh,

298
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:18.770
lose the Oah here at an age down here to give the unsaturated Aldehyde.

299
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.800
Now that's called a Beta hydro.
An aldol.

300
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.420
Aldol is a Beta hydroxy Aldehyde.
Okay.

301
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.500
And this is an Alpha Beta unsaturated Aldehyde.

302
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.870
So these are things that when you,

303
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.750
when you're looking at something you want to make and you see,
Aha,

304
00:23:36.751 --> 00:23:41.751
it's a Beta hydroxy co carbon yield compound or it's an Alpha Beta unsaturated

305
00:23:43.681 --> 00:23:47.390
carbonyl compound.
You think the aldol reaction,

306
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.530
if I assigned you a zillion problems to do that,

307
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.630
that would become second nature to you.

308
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.360
If it turns out that that's important to you,

309
00:23:56.361 --> 00:24:00.950
you will do a lot of problems with it and it'll become second nature to you.
Now,

310
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:05.630
I've shown it here,
base catalyzed,
but it can be acid catalyzed as well.

311
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:06.464
And it'd be,

312
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.520
I would expect you to be able to figure out how the mechanism would work with

313
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:11.840
acid catalin isis.

314
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.480
Now the equilibrium for this as favorable because this isn't very crowded with h

315
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.080
h here and h is down here,
h here,
right?

316
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.670
But if you start with a ketone instead of an Aldehyde,

317
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.850
then the product is more crowded and less stable.

318
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.240
So if you start with acetone instead and make the an ion and tried to do this

319
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:38.970
reaction and make the Beta hydroxy ketone,

320
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.710
now you find that the equilibrium is unfavorable.

321
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.360
So you'd like to figure some trick if that's the compound you want,

322
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.520
that would allow you to get over there.

323
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.000
One way is not the start with the ketone,

324
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.470
but to start with the INA eight so you're much,
much higher and energy.

325
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.970
So these things we've talked about before about using really strong basis to

326
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:05.870
preform the anti on,
those are ways to do this.

327
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.820
But if you want to deal just with hydroxide,
there's a way to do it.
Now,

328
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:15.050
we already went through the demonstration of showing how you make tea by pouring

329
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:18.260
hot water through a tea bag in a funnel,

330
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.430
but a much more efficient ways to use this sock slit extractor.

331
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.560
So the extractor looks like this,

332
00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:29.240
you boil liquid down below and you condense it up above and it drips down into a

333
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.460
paper cup that's holding the tea or whatever it is,
and it begins to rise up.

334
00:25:34.461 --> 00:25:37.670
And when it gets up to the top and finally goes over the top,

335
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.680
it drains down and then the whole cycle starts over again.
Right?

336
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:46.430
So that's a much more efficient way to do extract to make tea.

337
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.790
But it's also a way to make aldol because of what you put in the cup.

338
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.060
So the liquid you're going to use is acetone.

339
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.740
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

340
00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.860
<v 0>The liquid is acetone,
so it's distilling up,</v>

341
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:07.340
sitting there for awhile and then draining back and distilling up again right

342
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.400
now required.
Remember that it takes a catalyst

343
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.890
to make the aldol right.
A base as what we've shown here.

344
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.920
So suppose you had a base that was only in the cup,

345
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.963
right?

346
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:30.850
Then the acetone will come and sit in the cup and reach equilibrium if it's

347
00:26:30.851 --> 00:26:32.770
sitting there for awhile with the base,

348
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.270
which has just a little bit of the alcohol in it because the equilibrium lies to

349
00:26:37.271 --> 00:26:38.680
the left,
right?

350
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.620
But then it drains down into the pot where there's no base,

351
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.080
so it can't go back again.
But the dimer,
of course,

352
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:52.710
much heavier than the starting material,
so it doesn't still,

353
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:56.210
the acetone goes back up,
drips through again,

354
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.430
makes it a little bit more and drains in up a little more,
a little more,

355
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:00.264
a little more.

356
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.740
So all you have to do is put in that cup up above a base,

357
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.360
which is not soluble in acetone,
right?

358
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.150
So barium hydroxide is such a thing.

359
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:16.430
So that's a really fancy way to make,
uh,
an Aldo.

360
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.670
When it was unfavorable,
he was in a sock slit extractor.

361
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.470
Okay.

362
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:27.470
Now it's possible to do a cross aldol condensation where you do,

363
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.460
where the [inaudible] comes from.

364
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:34.140
One carbon eel compound and the carbon eel that gets attacked comes from another

365
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:35.850
one in particular.

366
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.980
Suppose you start with what's called a set o fa known that methyl phenol ketone

367
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.250
make.
It's an ion and at attacks,

368
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.330
if it were to attack itself with methyl and fennel,

369
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.650
the equilibrium would be very unfavorable.
It'd be way too crowded.
Right?

370
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.280
But if you put in there,
so this one won't work,

371
00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:58.080
that's an unfavorable equilibrium.

372
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.890
But suppose instead you use Benzaldehyde.

373
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.920
Right now it's not hindered because it's an Aldehyde.

374
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.000
So you could make the product with benzene here,
Benzine here,

375
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.410
and a chair by this crossed two different reagents.

376
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:16.140
This one and this one aldol condensation.

377
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:21.330
Now it's clear that this one is not going to react with itself with its own

378
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:23.460
ketone because the product will be too hindered.

379
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.710
But why won't the INA late of that react with itself?
It'd be much less hindered.

380
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.080
This is a trick question.

381
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:39.350
Why doesn't the INA late of this carbon eel compound react with the,

382
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.560
with the Aldehyde Ella,

383
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.020
what would the ELA to later this be?
How do you make an analyte?

384
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.610
<v 1>Where do you take the h from?</v>

385
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.850
From the carbon.
It's adjacent to the Carbondale,

386
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.460
<v 0>right?
So that the Pi Star,
the Carbondale will stabilize the an ion.
So what,</v>

387
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.950
what's the story here?

388
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.353
<v 1>There isn't any,</v>

389
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.490
<v 0>the benzene ring,
there's no hydrogen on that carbon,
right?</v>

390
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.870
So this can't form an Eataly and this can't react with itself.

391
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.150
So they'll,
so they cross over without complication,
right?

392
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.310
So that one can't form a needle eight and you can then lose water to make the

393
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:43.560
Alpha Beta unsaturated ketone.
Now I'll just uh,
uh,

394
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.170
go through this,
which I did on the board last year and took a picture of,

395
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.700
so this is the compound we just made on the previous slide,
right?

396
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:56.701
It's an Alpha Beta unsaturated ketone and it undergoes what's called conjugate

397
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.933
edition.

398
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:03.330
That is you expect a nucleophile to act to react with the carbon eel carbon,

399
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.660
the Pi Star.
But if you have a situation like this,

400
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.830
cyanide could react not only there,
but also here.

401
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.580
And if it reacts here and then you put on a proton on the,
Oh,

402
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.460
you could put,

403
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:24.160
you have the Adelaide and I and once the cyanide is attacked up at the top left

404
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:27.400
here,
right?
So there's a charge here,
charge here.

405
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.280
So you could put the Proton,
either place,

406
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.760
the more stable place to put the Proton is down here.

407
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.590
So you have a carbon oxygen double bond rather than to put it on the oxygen.

408
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:42.820
So you have an eternal,
we know that carbon steels are more stable than enols.

409
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.630
So this is the product you get from that.
And sometimes it's,

410
00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:51.220
I think it's safest to call it conjugate addition because you add to a double

411
00:30:51.221 --> 00:30:55.960
bond that cyanide would not normally add to remember alkanes are usually

412
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:58.630
attacked by electrifying,
not nuclear files.

413
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.570
But this one is special because adding here you get,

414
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.960
you generate a stable and I on the inhalation,
okay,

415
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:09.961
so that's called conjugate edition or sometimes it's called one four edition.

416
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.260
So here's the one,
two,
three,
four position.

417
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.620
You add a hydrogen there and cyanide here.

418
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.500
That would be one for addition to this thing.

419
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.780
The product of course would be an email late,

420
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.030
but the analyte it will become a ketone.

421
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.020
So that's just the name that's given this,
uh,
one four edition.

422
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.170
But conjugate I think is better.
Okay.

423
00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.670
Now if you react with the Grin Yar reagent,
fennel,

424
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:40.420
magnesium bromide,
it does the same thing.
Cyanide does,

425
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:44.350
it undergoes conjugate addition and you get a 96% yield of this.

426
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.330
Uh,
and if you use a copper,

427
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.700
it turns out that that sometimes helps to get conjugate edition if you had it.

428
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:59.530
Okay.
But if he use instead of fennel,
magnesium,
bromide,
fennel,

429
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:04.270
lithium,
then it doesn't do the one for or the conjugate addition.

430
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.980
It adds as you would naively of expected to the carbon eel group.
Right.

431
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.630
So obviously there's a lot of subtlety involved here and a lot of Lore,

432
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.660
I would certainly not have expected you to know.
I,
I,
uh,

433
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.420
I would expect you to know that you could add here and having thought about it a

434
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:25.300
little bit,
I would expect you to think that you could add here,

435
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.470
but as to which way it goes and why a grin you,

436
00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:33.471
our reagent goes here and why copper helps it or while fennel lithium goes here

437
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.780
that I wouldn't expect you to know.
Okay.
That's what comes,

438
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:40.940
that's the lore that comes from being in the business awhile.

439
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.130
But when you've been around,
you know what to do,
you know,

440
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:47.330
to throw copper in if you,
if this is the kind of product you want.
Okay.

441
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:50.750
And the same kind of thing happens with,
with hydride edition.

442
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:56.290
So if you have this a cyclohexene own and reduce it with lithium aluminum

443
00:32:56.301 --> 00:32:59.480
hydride the hydride does what you expect it to do.

444
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.780
It adds to the carbon and the carbon eel and you get this unsaturated alcohol

445
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:08.960
cyclohexene old 97% yield,
right?

446
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.840
But if you use a different source of hydride,

447
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:16.010
the Bh four minus instead of alh four minus,

448
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.120
then you get only a 59% yield of this product and you get 41% the rest of it is

449
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:27.830
the material that's lost the double bond.

450
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.460
So the double bond has been reduced to now VH four BH three remember ads,

451
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:39.050
the double bonds,
but BH four minus doesn't.

452
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.060
And when v h three adds,

453
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.750
it adds an age and also the Boron and that's the way you get an alcohol.

454
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:49.280
I remember the hydro voracious oxidation,
right?
Good Bh four minus is different.

455
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.620
It doesn't react with double bonds.

456
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:57.010
And if you take this material and react it with Bh Sodium borohydride,

457
00:33:57.021 --> 00:34:00.230
it doesn't do that.
So that's not where this came from.

458
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.480
Where it came from was having the first edition be conjugate.

459
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.870
So hydride added to this position,

460
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:13.460
the end of the double bond that's conjugated with the carbon eel as in the top

461
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:17.390
left there,
right?
That made this anal eight right,

462
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:22.370
which then got protonated in this position to give them the ketone instead of

463
00:34:22.371 --> 00:34:24.260
the eternal.
Okay.

464
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.580
And now that carbon eel can be reduced by borough hydride the same way this one

465
00:34:28.581 --> 00:34:31.910
could at the beginning and now you get the 41% of that.

466
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.940
So you must initially have gotten almost equal amounts of reduction of the

467
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:41.060
carbonyl group directly by one,
two edition and,

468
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.130
and conjugate addition,
41% of conjugate edition,
which then led to that.

469
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.780
So again,
this is lore and if we drilled you on that,

470
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.120
you would know something,
you would be able to have quick recall of it.
Uh,

471
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.280
having seen it,
I expect you to recognize things like that,

472
00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:02.330
but I don't expect you to know all the details.
In fact,

473
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:07.290
I think no one knows all the details.
This is all sensitive to exact,

474
00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:11.090
you know,
what temperature exactly what salsa use,
what solvent and so on.

475
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:15.650
So it's a complicated thing or adding the copper.
Okay.

476
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:21.130
Now a very interesting reaction is called the Robinson annulation.

477
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.450
Annulation means making your ring.

478
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:28.580
And this was invented in 1935 and here's the beginning of the paper where it was

479
00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:32.810
invented by wraps and a graduate student,
and Sir Robert Robinson,

480
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:37.530
who got the Nobel prize for synthetic organic chemistry.

481
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.910
So it's experiments on the census of substance substances related to steer

482
00:35:42.911 --> 00:35:45.090
roles.
Should I remember steroid?

483
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:50.120
These hormones are six membered ring six membered ring six membered ring five

484
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:54.510
membered ring with various lettuce hanging around it,
right?

485
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:58.590
So there are lots of these different things.
And the 1930s was the golden age,

486
00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:03.591
and that through the 1950s and sixties was the golden age of steroid chemistry.

487
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.140
And remember that was the basis on which con formational analysis was invented

488
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:09.970
in,

489
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:14.970
in 1958 Barton who was working in this field started looking at which side axial

490
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:20.130
equatorial on all that.
That was all done in the context of steroids,
right?

491
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:25.430
But what Robinson says here is the methods for synthesis of one five Dy.

492
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:30.390
Ketones.
So here's the ketone one,
two,
three,
four,
five.

493
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:35.130
So a one five dy.
Ketone.
Okay.
Methods for sentences,
a one five dy.

494
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:39.150
Ketones have been explored in this laboratory for two reasons.
One,

495
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:40.420
it was thought that pinnacles,

496
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.560
such as one might furnish the characteristic angled methyl ketone group to of

497
00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:51.300
estrogen.
So estrogen is a,
is a female hormone,

498
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.200
right?
And it has that five membered ring up in the top right,

499
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.410
has this as a ketone there,
and a methyl,

500
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.740
what's called an angular methyl group adjacent to it.

501
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.170
So how are you going to synthesize that?

502
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.800
So he thought that that could come from this via a pinnacle rearrangement.

503
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:14.010
We talked about the pinnacle rearrangement.
Remember,

504
00:37:14.011 --> 00:37:17.700
what's going to happen is you,
you would protonate here,
lose water,

505
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.240
cad ion meth,
I'd shift,
right?

506
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:26.040
So now you've got the methyl there from this five membered ring.
So,
uh,

507
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.430
so you need that compound if you want to be able to make it that way.

508
00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:33.330
Where do you get a pinnacle?
You get it from pinnacle reduction,

509
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.650
right?
So you would get it from this forming the bond across there.

510
00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:41.970
And we talked about the pinnacle reduction where you put an electron on here,

511
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.450
an electron on here,
the two free radicals couple,

512
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.370
and then you have oh minus cc bond oh minus,
right?

513
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.580
And then they get protonated to give the pinnacle.
Okay?

514
00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:55.320
So that would be the pinnacle reduction.

515
00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:59.820
So that was what he was hoping as a way to try to make this five membered ring

516
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:04.620
with that methyl group,
which is hard to put in there otherwise.
Okay?

517
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.390
Uh,
buy in Trump in trouble.
I Cuellar change,

518
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:11.190
which we would now call a rearrangement.

519
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:15.690
And the second reason was the dye ketones themselves.

520
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.720
Three might be dehydrated with the formation of cyclohexene owns.

521
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.500
So you can make a six membered ring with a double bond carbon eel.

522
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.140
Now what do you notice about that double bond?

523
00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.640
How he says you might be able to go from here to here.
So this might,

524
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:37.850
these double bar double shafted arrows are thinking backwards.

525
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.850
It's called Retro Synthesis.
What could something come from right?
The older,

526
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:47.410
but Arrow will be this going into this.
But when you see this,
you think of this,

527
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.780
why,
why,

528
00:38:51.781 --> 00:38:56.040
when you see this functional group,
do you think of this dye ketone?

529
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.990
You look at that functional group and what would you call it?

530
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.990
Can you give a name to that?
Hey,

531
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.780
can you think of any names for functional groups there?
What's,

532
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.800
what's this functional group to c Double Bondo.
He told me,

533
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.120
and this one
an Lpn,

534
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.200
so you could call it an ene own right,

535
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.990
but then you wouldn't know where the IAN is.

536
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.310
So you have to say where are the Ian is relative to the Ketone to get that

537
00:39:32.311 --> 00:39:35.910
functional group to know that their conjugated.
So it's so the,

538
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.680
if you start with the ketone,
it's the Alpha and the Beta position.

539
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:45.750
So it's an Alpha Beta unsaturated ketone.

540
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.790
And there's another name for Alpha Beta unsaturated ketones.

541
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:56.580
They're the dehydration product of Aldols,
right?

542
00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.840
So the aldol reaction,
where you make an an eye on here,

543
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:06.390
it attacks that carbon deal to make ooh.
And then you dehydrate it.

544
00:40:06.391 --> 00:40:10.650
He says dehydrated here,
lose the OAH and an h here to make the double bond.

545
00:40:10.651 --> 00:40:15.450
So that's the reaction we just talked about.
The aldol reaction.
Uh Okay.

546
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.950
So,
so then you need this compound,
right?

547
00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:22.500
You need that dye ketone if you're going to make it that way.

548
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:26.400
And how will you make it?
You'll make it by forming the red bond,

549
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.610
attacking this double bond here.

550
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.980
What kind of car,
what kind of reactions that Luke,
you've got an idea.

551
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:36.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

552
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.120
<v 0>If you made an anti in here,
right?</v>

553
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.680
That would be an INA laid a n I n pulled an h off there.

554
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.510
Okay.
So you could make the anti in here and then you want to attack a ketone.

555
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.110
Right?
So you'd think of making a bond from here to here.

556
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.710
But this is making the bond from here to here.

557
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.660
Did you ever see anything like that?

558
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:06.370
About eight minutes ago we talked about conjugate edition,

559
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.290
right addition to the double bond adjacent to the carbon eel,
which cause,

560
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.510
cause if the ad I and attacks here,

561
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.620
then you have a minus charge on this carbon adjacent to the Carbon Neil.

562
00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:21.850
It's an anal eight and I am,
so this is an example of conjugate addition.

563
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:26.200
So what you would need then,
this would be conjugate addition to this key tone.

564
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.160
And that ketone before you make the red bond is methyl and a c double bond.

565
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:37.370
C H two vinyl.
So that's methyl vinyl ketone,

566
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.330
right,

567
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:43.330
which is a very important reagent for making these six membered ring compounds.

568
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.030
Okay?
So that's the,
so this,

569
00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:52.130
the idea of making this ring compound by way of methyl vinyl ketone attacking a

570
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:58.760
ketone is called the,
uh,
Robinson annulation procedure.

571
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:03.350
The way of forming a ring.
Okay,
so a base,

572
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:08.240
uh,
to make the anhilate and then methyl vinyl ketone.

573
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:13.690
So it takes this into two six membered rings adjacent to one another with the

574
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.800
carbon eel down here,

575
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:20.540
which is just like what's in the bottom left hand corner of these steroids.

576
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.390
Six membered ring with an oxygen pointed down that way,

577
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.030
and another six membered ring.
So the,

578
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.900
the Robinson annual Asian is just the ticket for forming this thing and they

579
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:32.780
often have a methyl group in that position,
right?

580
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.450
So you'll see these are the four carbons that become these four part,
the,

581
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.940
these four carbons in the product.
So you to do that,

582
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:45.941
you'd need an analyst at this position doing a conjugate addition to attack

583
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:49.130
here.
So this carbon becomes that carbon.

584
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.660
Then you form an anti in here at that position,
right?

585
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.470
And enal eight it is right?
And beyond the carbon eel,

586
00:42:57.471 --> 00:43:00.680
there's one more methyl group.
This one.
Okay.

587
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.780
But once you've got that,

588
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.400
then once you've got the methyl group here and still a ketone here,

589
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.650
right?
Then you can have the anti on of that methyl group,

590
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.780
the analyte attack,

591
00:43:14.781 --> 00:43:19.730
the carbon eel and aldol reaction dehydrate.
And you've got this thing.

592
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:24.731
So that all happens at once when you use methyl vinyl ketone and the Ketone,

593
00:43:25.071 --> 00:43:28.610
except you have to be sure that you've got the right anti on here,

594
00:43:28.611 --> 00:43:31.070
that the anti on is the,
at that position,
the,
you know,

595
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.980
late that you're starting with and not at that position.

596
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.990
And we'll address that on Friday.

597
00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:40.940
How you make sure you've got the right [inaudible].
Okay.
And uh,

598
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:42.160
Woodward,
because on,

599
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.750
on Friday we'll be talking about Woodward's synthesis of the steroids,
cortisone,

600
00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.040
where he used Robinson's of method.

601
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:53.600
We showed this picture before last semester and they're not acknowledging one

602
00:43:53.601 --> 00:43:57.860
another's presence here.
They both were uh,
quite,
uh,

603
00:43:58.310 --> 00:43:58.941
each of them.

604
00:43:58.941 --> 00:44:03.710
I'm sure it was quite confident that he was the most important organic chemists

605
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:06.980
to the 20th century.
And here on,
on the,
what's,

606
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.060
what's especially interesting is here you see the double bonds not drawn,

607
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:15.560
but this is that cyclohexene on the product from a Robinson annulation.

608
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:17.901
Okay.

609
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:21.830
Then there's one called the Clayson condensation or climbs and condensation,

610
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.460
which is now an Ester,
but it's all these are the same.

611
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.380
You make an eda late and you react here with itself.
So in fact,

612
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.680
when I made slides,

613
00:44:31.681 --> 00:44:36.120
I could use exactly the same slide and just plug in one group different each

614
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:37.440
time.
So as you look at these,

615
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:41.370
you'll be able to organize them clearly in your mind.
So here now is an Ester.

616
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.850
Why do we use our o minus rather than hydroxide

617
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.530
as we don't want to make the acid right?
We want to keep the ester.

618
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.910
Okay,
so we have our own minus,
we,
we talked about that before,

619
00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.530
make the Ino eight and now this one comes over and gets attacked.

620
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.210
So it starts like the same way on Haldol does if the starting material,

621
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:09.030
we're an Aldehyde,
right?
Or a ketone.

622
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:14.160
But it's different because you have a leaving group on here.

623
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.390
So when it comes back in,
that leaving group can leave.

624
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.690
So instead of getting an alcohol from the group that gets attacked,

625
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.700
you get a carbonyl group.
Okay?
So it's a Beta Quito,

626
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:31.701
Esther instead of Beta hydroxy ketone Beta Hydroxy Aldehyde.

627
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.100
That's the aldol reaction.
It's a Beta Quito,
Esther,

628
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.660
because you had a leaving group.
So it's not an alcohol right now,
again,

629
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:45.840
this equilibrium is unfavorable if you have a,

630
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:49.440
if you have more complicated groups on here,
right?

631
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.510
But it's,
at first it looked like the owl coc side was catalytic.

632
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.000
We used that here to,
uh,
to,
to,
to,
uh,

633
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.580
make the EDA late.
But then we got it back again here.

634
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:05.460
So it looks like a catalyst that just cycles around and around.

635
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:10.050
You don't need very much of it.
But this Beta Quito,
Esther,

636
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:11.130
is quite acidic,

637
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.090
so it actually eats up the lie.

638
00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:19.590
Lie as in supine suffocation that we talked about last time.
Okay,

639
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.270
then that's good because the equilibrium here might have been unfavorable,

640
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:28.680
but once you do this very exothermic reaction taking off one of those hydrogens,

641
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:32.790
then the reaction is favorable again.
Okay,

642
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:37.650
so now here's,
here's nature's version of the clays and condensation,

643
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.570
okay?
They use the special Esther instead of oxygen.
It's got sulfur here,

644
00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.280
but it does exactly the same thing.

645
00:46:44.281 --> 00:46:48.060
It makes the anti and at attacks you get a Beta Quito,
Esther,

646
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:53.100
it's a thioester and co Aa is coenzyme a.

647
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:56.130
So it's a special art group that's attached to the,

648
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:00.480
to make it an Esther if you're interested.
That's the our group,
right?

649
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.870
There's the sh that's going to be that thing there.
Right?

650
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.350
But that will be for another day.
Okay,

651
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.710
so it,
how do they,

652
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.250
how does nature get around the fact that this equilibrium is unfavorable,

653
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:17.580
that it would come back?
It puts an extra co two in.

654
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:20.280
So instead of starting with this being ch three,

655
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.630
it starts with an extra CO2 group on it here.
So it's a dike die,

656
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:29.080
carbonyl compound,
easier to form the,
the uh,
anti.

657
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.120
And now you might think if that's a negative charge,

658
00:47:31.121 --> 00:47:35.590
it's gonna be hard to form the anti on.
But in the enzyme where it's held,

659
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:39.930
this one is not ionized.
I'm not sure exactly how it's tied up,
but anyhow,

660
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.820
it helps make this one the city,
Kevin,
the carbon eel next door,

661
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.100
and then you get this product.
So it's Maaleh Neil not asset deal.
Right?

662
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.720
And then the equilibrium is driven by losing the co two.
Okay.

663
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:57.010
So that's how nature does Clayson condensations why?

664
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.640
Because it wants to store energy,
right?

665
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.370
So notice it's put this asset,

666
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:06.640
he'll group on the original acid or Esther,

667
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.530
it's for this new bond,

668
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.610
right where it had the word attacked and had a leaving group.
Okay.

669
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:17.470
So then nature reduces it using the reducing agent and a d h that we talked

670
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:18.880
about.
Okay.

671
00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:23.320
So it becomes an alcohol and then it dehydrates,

672
00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.820
it's a Beta hydroxy carbonyl compound,
just like aldols at dehydrates.

673
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.290
And then it gets reduced again to put h two in here.

674
00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.040
So we have this product we started,
uh,
with,

675
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:38.380
with having just one methyl group,

676
00:48:38.381 --> 00:48:42.460
but just two carbons here and now we have one,
two,
three,

677
00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:45.430
four carbons there.
And notice what you can do.

678
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.320
You can take this Esther and plug it in up above

679
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:57.570
and put another two carbons on when you come around to get this right.

680
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:02.270
And you can plug it in,
put another two carbons,
another two carbons.

681
00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.690
So you could make a long chain of carbons,

682
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:10.280
ca of reduced carbons ending in an acid or an ester to start with.

683
00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.490
So,
so these are fatty acids.

684
00:49:13.491 --> 00:49:18.491
That's how you store the energy fueled a burn is these successive ch two groups

685
00:49:18.531 --> 00:49:19.730
that can be oxidized,

686
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:25.010
but the fatty acids that occur in nature are all even numbers of carbon,

687
00:49:25.011 --> 00:49:30.011
not odd numbers because it makes them this way and always adds two carbons at a

688
00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:31.220
time to the chain.

689
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.160
<v 2>Okay.
Now</v>

690
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.470
<v 0>I want to say just two words now about,
or more than two,
but not many,</v>

691
00:49:40.471 --> 00:49:43.530
more than two about,
uh,
carbohydrates.

692
00:49:43.531 --> 00:49:47.760
So carbohydrate was named early on.
I've,
I've got to look it up and find out.

693
00:49:47.761 --> 00:49:52.761
It must've been a in the early 19th century once they could analyze them and see

694
00:49:53.551 --> 00:49:57.090
they were c h two o taken in times.

695
00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:01.290
So carbohydrate,
a hydrate of carbon.
Right now,

696
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.980
Cooper in 1858 had the idea of Tetra Valence.

697
00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:09.120
And once you had that,
a number of sugars had been,
had been observed,

698
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.410
but no one had any idea what structure was.
So that was hard to talk about them,

699
00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.630
right?
You could talk about some of their properties,

700
00:50:15.631 --> 00:50:20.280
but not obviously about their structure.
So if you have a carbohydrate,

701
00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.660
Cooper would put two more bonds on the carbon.
So you can make a chain of these,

702
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:29.090
say six,
right?
But this is unsatisfactorily.

703
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:33.350
You've got to do something with those two,
those two bonds on the end,

704
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.070
right?
You could make a carbon ring,
a six membered ring.

705
00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:41.510
Cyclohexane with Oah is all around,
but that's not what what you do.

706
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:47.210
Uh,
what Cooper did in his very first paper,
you remember about structure,

707
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:52.070
he gave a structure for glucose.
And the structure he gave was this,

708
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.680
what did he do with the extra bonds?

709
00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.130
How did he modify this chain in order to get his structure?

710
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:02.503
<v 1>Okay,</v>

711
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.340
<v 0>well of course,
remember there they're double oxygen's,</v>

712
00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:10.430
where in fact there should be a single oxygen.
That's because of the uh,

713
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.390
but what else?

714
00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:14.243
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

715
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:19.230
<v 0>he took water and put h on one end and o h on the other.</v>

716
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:24.480
Right.
And in fact you can do that.
This is a gem dial.

717
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:29.370
That's an Aldehyde that's been hydrated.
Okay.
That's one way to do it.

718
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:35.130
Another way to do it is to take a,
this is what,

719
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.370
this is what got lost when my computer crashed.

720
00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:43.440
So this one notice took,
took the Hoh that was here,

721
00:51:43.441 --> 00:51:47.730
took the H's away,
put one h up here,
the other h down there.

722
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.770
And this one took the two H's away from this one,
but one h up there,

723
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.330
the other h down there.
Okay.
So,

724
00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:02.310
um,
so these then are sugars,
but who knows which one is which.

725
00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.550
Okay.
Oh,
this is,
sorry,

726
00:52:05.551 --> 00:52:10.551
that was [inaudible] and this is a page from van Hoff's.

727
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:15.270
That was 1858.
1874.
Stereochemistry.
Right.

728
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:19.920
What makes things optically active?
Uh,
Van Hoffen is 1874.

729
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.300
Paper says these compounds are optically active.
Glucose,
love,
yellows,

730
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.360
lactose,
mannitol.
So this,
the,

731
00:52:27.361 --> 00:52:30.630
this is it because he's got four different things on this carbon,

732
00:52:30.631 --> 00:52:34.130
the four that are in the middle of the chain,
right?
Or Mannitol,

733
00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.910
the one where you've added,
uh,
h to each end of the Aldehyde,
right?

734
00:52:38.911 --> 00:52:40.180
That's the,
uh,

735
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:45.260
then you still have these things or derivatives of mannitol or the dye acid

736
00:52:45.451 --> 00:52:47.610
where you have an acid at each end of the chain.

737
00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.700
All these things were optically active,
right?
That's part of his,

738
00:52:50.701 --> 00:52:54.000
so there were a number of sugars known,
uh,
by that time.

739
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:59.390
But the really fine work began to be done in the 1880s by Heinrich Iliani and

740
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.000
Emile Fisher.
And that will be a treat for next time.
