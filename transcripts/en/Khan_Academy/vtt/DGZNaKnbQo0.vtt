00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.810
In this chart right
here we're given scores

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.430
on midterm and final exams,
where the vertical axis

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.920
is the score in points.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.280
And then each of these
pairs of bar charts

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.130
give us for an individual, where
the blue bar is, for example,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.520
how Ishaan did on the
midterm, the yellow is

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.520
how he did on the final.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.110
For Emily, the blue is how
she did on the midterm,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.607
yellow is how she
did on the final.

00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:22.690
And we have a bunch of
interesting questions here.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.730
The first question, what
was the median score

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.429
for the final exam?

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.970
So just as a review,
median literally

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.430
means what was the middle score?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.570
So really we should list all
the scores for the final exam

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.730
and sort them in order
and then figure out

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.480
what the middle
score actually was.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.470
So let's look at all the
scores on final exam.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.020
Sp you have 100 here.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.700
Ishaan got 100 on
the final exam.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.430
Remember, this yellow
bar is the final exam.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.150
So there's 100.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.510
Emily also got 100
on the final exam.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.850
It looks like it was
an easy final exam.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.700
Daniel also got 100
on the final exam.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.480
And then, let's see, Jessica,
it looks like she got a 75.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.579
And then William got an 80.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.120
So if we were to
sort these in order,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.953
and let's say we did
it in increasing order,

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:13.500
you could write-- well,
the lowest score was a 75,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.510
then you have an 80, and then
you have three 100's-- 100,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.810
another 100, and another 100.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.700
So there's five scores
right over here,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.830
so you will have a middle.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.288
If you had an even
number, then you

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:28.270
would take the mean of
the two center values.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.920
But here you have
one center value,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.400
and when you order it like
this, it's pretty clear

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.880
that your center value,
your middle value, is 100.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.761
So the median score for
the final exam is 100.

00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.760
And that's because you
had so many hundreds here

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.570
that the median, the middle
score, was still 100.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.340
What is the midrange
of the midterm scores?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.300
I'll do it in blue
in honor of the color

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.090
of the bars for the midterm.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.761
So the midrange is the mean of
your highest and lowest scores.

00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:00.760
So let's calculate this.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.020
So let's go to the midrange.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.460
The midrange, you could view
it as the arithmetic mean,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.690
or the average of your
highest and lowest scores,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.145
so the midrange of midterm.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.840
So let's see, the
highest midterm score,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.240
looking at the blue, the
highest one is right here.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.120
So Jessica got 100
on the midterm,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.840
so that's your highest score.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.850
Your lowest score on the midterm
looks like this one right

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.350
over here.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.490
Daniel got a 60.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.340
And so the midrange is
going to be the mean,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460
the arithmetic mean
of these two numbers.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.530
So you add 100 plus 60, divide
by 2, you get 160 over 2,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.880
or 80.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.960
So this right over
here is going to be 80.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.335
What was the average student
score for the final exam?

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:49.100
Well, for, that we
just have to add up

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.600
the scores on the final
exams and then divide

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.407
by the number of scores we have.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:55.240
So we might be able to
do that in our heads.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.800
Let's see.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800
Well, we could-- let me
just write it over here.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.990
So we have 100, plus 100,
plus 100, plus 75, plus 80.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.349
So all of that divided by 5,
that will give us our average.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.140
If someone tells you
average without giving

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.556
more information,
they're probably

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:15.680
talking about the
arithmetic mean.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.210
So this is going to be
300 plus another 155,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.535
so it's going to be 455 over 5.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.200
And let's see, 5,
this is going to be

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.020
equal to-- 5 goes in--
let me write it down here.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.390
This is equal to-- 5 goes
into 45, or 450 ninety times

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.370
and into 5 once.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.580
So this is going
to be equal to 91.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.710
So the average score for
the final exam is a 91.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.840
What was the mode for
the final exam scores?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.174
So the mode is the
most common score.

00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:55.840
So once again, we've
listed all of them,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.470
and it's pretty clear the
most common score here is 100.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.810
100 shows up three times,
while a 75 only shows up once,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.760
and an 80 only shows up once.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.220
So here the most
common score is 100.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.420
It shows up three times.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.920
What is the range of
the midterm scores?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.730
So the range is
literally the difference

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.426
between the highest score
and the lowest score.

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:17.300
So the highest score,
we already figured out,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.000
and this is for the midterm.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.469
So the highest score is 100.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.010
And we're going to subtract from
that the lowest score, which

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.190
was a 60.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.580
So the range is equal to 40.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.670
The midrange was the
average of these two things.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.920
The range is just the
difference between the two.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.110
So the range of the
midterm scores is 40.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.090
And we're done.
