okay okay so I got a question about that

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980
okay okay so I got a question about that

okay okay so I got a question about that
so so one of the things we did a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440
so so one of the things we did a
 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.260
so so one of the things we did a
research project a year ago trying to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270
research project a year ago trying to
 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.150
research project a year ago trying to
figure out if there was such a thing as

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
figure out if there was such a thing as
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.260
figure out if there was such a thing as
political correctness from a

political correctness from a
 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.060
political correctness from a
psychometric perspective to find out if

psychometric perspective to find out if
 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.730
psychometric perspective to find out if
there the loose aggregation of beliefs

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740
there the loose aggregation of beliefs
 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.500
there the loose aggregation of beliefs
actually clumped together statistically

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510
actually clumped together statistically
 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.090
actually clumped together statistically
and we actually found two factors which

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100
and we actually found two factors which
 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.979
and we actually found two factors which
I won't go into but then we looked at

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989
I won't go into but then we looked at
 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.080
I won't go into but then we looked at
things that predicted adherence to that

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090
things that predicted adherence to that
 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.470

that politically correct Creed and there

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480
that politically correct Creed and there
 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.909
that politically correct Creed and there
were a couple that were surprising one

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919
were a couple that were surprising one
 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.000
were a couple that were surprising one
was being female was a predictor the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010
was being female was a predictor the
 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.310
was being female was a predictor the
personality attributes associated with

so that would be agreeableness and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300
so that would be agreeableness and
 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.850
so that would be agreeableness and
higher levels of negative emotion we're

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860
higher levels of negative emotion we're
 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.950
higher levels of negative emotion we're
also both independent predictors but so

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960
also both independent predictors but so

which I thought was really important

like they fail to differentiate because

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530
like they fail to differentiate because
 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.710
like they fail to differentiate because
all they see is the oppressive male and

all they see is the oppressive male and

all they see is the oppressive male and
then they may have had experiences that

then they may have had experiences that
 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.710

that their experiences with men might

that their experiences with men might

have been rough enough so that that
 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.620
have been rough enough so that that
differentiation never occurred because

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630
differentiation never occurred because
 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.750
differentiation never occurred because
it has to occur and you have to have a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760
it has to occur and you have to have a
 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.700
it has to occur and you have to have a
lot of experience with men and good men

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710
lot of experience with men and good men
 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.370
lot of experience with men and good men
too before that will occur but it seems

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380
too before that will occur but it seems
 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.200
too before that will occur but it seems
to me that we're also increasingly

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210
to me that we're also increasingly

men are gonna have to stand up for
 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.960
men are gonna have to stand up for
themselves but here's the problem I know

themselves but here's the problem I know
 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.640
themselves but here's the problem I know
how to stand up to a man who's who's

unfairly trespassing against me and the
 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.690
unfairly trespassing against me and the
reason I know that is because the

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700
reason I know that is because the
 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.610
reason I know that is because the
parameters for my resistance are quite

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620
parameters for my resistance are quite
 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.880
parameters for my resistance are quite
well-defined which is we talk we argue

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890
well-defined which is we talk we argue
 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.730
well-defined which is we talk we argue
we push and then it becomes physical

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740
we push and then it becomes physical
 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.250
we push and then it becomes physical
right like if we move beyond the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260
right like if we move beyond the
 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.380
right like if we move beyond the
boundaries of civil discourse we know

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390
boundaries of civil discourse we know
 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.180
boundaries of civil discourse we know
what the next step is ok that's

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
what the next step is ok that's

forbidden in in discourse with women and

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280
forbidden in in discourse with women and
 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.490
forbidden in in discourse with women and
so I don't think that men can control

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500
so I don't think that men can control
 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.860
so I don't think that men can control
crazy women I don't they I really don't

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870
crazy women I don't they I really don't

crazy women I don't they I really don't
believe it I think that they have to

believe it I think that they have to
 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.720
believe it I think that they have to
throw their hands up in in in in what in

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730
throw their hands up in in in in what in
 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.140
throw their hands up in in in in what in
in it's not even disbelief it's that the

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150
in it's not even disbelief it's that the
 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.720
in it's not even disbelief it's that the
cultural there's no step forward that

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730
cultural there's no step forward that
 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.890
cultural there's no step forward that
you can take under those circumstances

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900
you can take under those circumstances
 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.320
you can take under those circumstances
because if the man is offensive enough

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330
because if the man is offensive enough
 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.990
because if the man is offensive enough
and crazy enough the reaction becomes

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000
and crazy enough the reaction becomes
 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.640
and crazy enough the reaction becomes
physical right away or at least the

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650
physical right away or at least the
 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.100
physical right away or at least the
threat is there and when men are talking

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110
threat is there and when men are talking
 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.500
threat is there and when men are talking

to each other in any serious manner that
underlying threat of physicality is

underlying threat of physicality is
 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.310
underlying threat of physicality is
always there especially if it's a real

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320
always there especially if it's a real

conversation and keeps the thing

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880
conversation and keeps the thing

civilized to some degree you know if

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010
civilized to some degree you know if

civilized to some degree you know if
you're talking to a man who wouldn't
