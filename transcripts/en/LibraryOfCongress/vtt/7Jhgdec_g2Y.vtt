Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.280
Today I'm thrilled to say that I'm
also here with our CEO and chairman

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.150

Pamela Bridgewater.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.510

Together we represent the new
leadership at the African Society,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.010
and we are very honored and
pleased to continue this series

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.970
with the Library of
Congress, the Africa Section,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.190
the section of the African
and Middle Eastern Division

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.800
and the poetry and literature
center of the Library of Congress.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.500
Because the African Society's
mission is to educate Americans

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.990
about Africa, the cultures,
the countries, economies,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.250
and the contributions that emanate
from the different countries

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.990
of the continent of Africa,
and we tell a different story

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.920
from what you generally
see in the media.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.360
African literature
and poetry is vital

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.870
to communicating a contemporary
and evolving image of Africa.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.880
And so, we look for it to hearing
from a vital creative voice

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.470
in Professor Namwali Serpell.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.230
The first Zambian to win the Caine
Prize winner for African writing,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.580
and one who shared her prize money

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.790
with the other four
short-listed writers

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.510
which I thought was very amazing.

I am Rob Casper, the head of the
Poetry and Literature Center here

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.730

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.460
We're thrilled to be working
with Patricia in her new role.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.570
A big congratulations to her.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.660
She's been part of the African
Society as you heard from Mary Jane

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.730
for 10 years and now it's to help
us shape this series and continue

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.060
to do amazing work
at that organization.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.960 position:56%
I also want to thank again Mary
Jane [inaudible] African/Middle East

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.230

which hosts the Caine
Prize residency.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.120 position:56%
This is the first time the Library
of Congress is officially partnering

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.910
with the Caine Prize
and the Lannan Center,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.630
and we couldn't be
happier about doing so.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.120 position:56%
So let me take this opportunity to
ask you to turn off your cell phones

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.520
and any other electronic
devices that you have

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.320
that might interfere
with this event.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.830
Second, I want to tell you that
this program is being recorded

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.030
for webcast and by participating
you give us permission

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.900
for future use of that recording.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.420
Before I get into today's program
and explain it a little bit,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.870

Thank you to everyone for coming and
thank you so much to the organizers.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.110
I'm going to read a little bit of
"The Sack" which is the short story

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.680
that won the Caine Prize,
and then I'm going to read

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.320
from a different story
that just came out.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.970
I think just launching
at this month.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.060
"There's a sack."

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.090
"A sack?" "A sack."

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.680
Hmm. A sack.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.380
Big? Yes. Gray.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.840
Like old [inaudible].

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.140
Marks on the outside.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.880
No shadows.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.350
That's how I know it is moving.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.860
Something is moving inside it?

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.640
The whole sack is moving.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.230 position:56%
Down a dirt road with a ditch on the
side with grass and yellow flowers.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.670
There are trees above.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.590
Is it dark?

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.530
Yes, but light is coming.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.850
It is morning.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.870
There's some small
birds talking, moving.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.310
The sack is dragging on the ground.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.960 position:56%
There's a man pulling it behind him.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.310
Who is this man?

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.260
I can't see his face.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.660
He is tallish.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.380
His shirt has stains on the back.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.190
No socks. Business man shoes.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.290
His hands are wet.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.970
Does he see you?

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.270
I don't know.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.570
I'm tired now.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.870
Close the curtains.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.400
Yes, Wana.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.700
Jay left the bedroom
and went to the kitchen.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.650
The wooden door was open but the
metal security gate was closed.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.130
The sky looked bruised.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.430
The insects would be coming soon.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:46.700
They had already begun their
electric clicking in the garden.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.650
He thought of the man
in the bedroom,

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.330
hating him in that tender way he
had cultivated over the years.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.490
Jay washed the plates from lunch.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.270
He swept. A chicken outside
made a popping sound.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.460
Jay sucked his teeth and
went to see what was wrong.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.770
The [inaudible] boy was standing
outside the security gate.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.620
The boy held the bucket
handle with both hands.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.790
The insides of his
elbows splayed taught.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.880
His legs were streaked
white and gray.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.540
"How do you expect me to know
you are here if you are quiet?"

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.830
Jay asked as he opened the gate.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.360
The boy shrugged, a smile
dancing upwards and then receding

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.220
into the settled indifference
of his face.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.650
Jay told the boy to
take off his pata pata's

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.820
and reach for the bucket.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.620 position:56%
Groaning with its weight, Jay heaved
the unwielding thing into the sink.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.070
He could just make out the
shape of the bream flush

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.540
against the inside of the bucket.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.620
It's thin, protruding.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.460
Jay felt the water shift as
the fish turned uneasily.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.940
"A big one today, eh?"

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.090
Jay turned and smiled.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.400
The boy still stood by the door.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.550
His hands clasped in front of him.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.850
His legs were reflected

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.870
in a conclave floor
making him seem taller.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.150
"Do you want something to eat?"

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.560
The boy accented with
a diagonal nod.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.360
"You should eat the fish you catch.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.450
It is the only way to
survive," Jay said.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.830
I told him about the first dream,

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.750
but I did not tell
him about the second.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.550
In the second dream,
I am inside the sack.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.390
The cloth of it is pressing
right down on my eyes.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.520
I turn one way, then the other.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.310
All I can see is gray cloth.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.260
There is no pain, but I can feel
the ground against my bones.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.800
I am curled up.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.630
I hear the sound of the sack
sweeping like a slow broom.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.080
I've been paying him long enough.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.690
Paying down his debt that he
should treat me like a real B'wana.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.420
He does his duties; yes,
but he lacks deference.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.170
His politics would not admit this,

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.570
but I have known this man
since we were children.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.830
I know what the color of my skin
means to someone of our generation.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.100
His eyes have changed.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.360
I think he is going to kill me.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.300
I think that is what these
dreams are telling me.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.500
Nala, I cannot remember your hands.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.300
Thank you.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.900
I'm just going to read a little bit
from this -- this is a new story.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.820
So when I won the Caine Prize,
the writer Tracey Chevalier,

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.410
infamous for writing "Girl
with the Pearl Earring" wrote

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.880
to me having read an
interview I had given with

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.240
"The Economist" in London.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.600
They asked me, "What
literary character do you must

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.900
identify with?"

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.260
So I listed a bunch of them
because I tend to be multi-voiced

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.930
and identify with many people.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.830
One of the characters
I said was Jane Eyre

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.380
who I said was my spiritual twin.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.680
So she wrote to me and she
said, "Oh, you must write

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.520
for this collection
of stories inspired

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.050
by Jane Eyre called
"Reader I married him."

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:01.930
And it's all female writers;
British and American Canadian.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:10.940
There's a woman from Istanbul, and
I wrote a story about a wedding.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.580
I'll just read the beginning of it.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.880
It's called "Double Men."

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.960
A friendship that fails
to negotiate dogs

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.340
and chickens is doomed to wither.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.700 position:56%
Even a friendship that has weathered
decades of hardship and tedium.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.990
Mama Lota and Nangela had
raised their children together,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.730
performed birth and
death rites in tandem,

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.040
carried loads light
and heavy as one.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.130
Now that there were no men
left in their households,

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.950
they depended on each other,
hooked to their everday's,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.980
the tasks attending
to body and home,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.600
and a small field they grew enough
greens, beans, potatoes, cassava,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.510 position:56%
yams, ground nuts, and maize to feed
themselves; and kept the surplus

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.540
in Mama Lota's storehouse.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.580
They gave the damaged
but edible leftovers

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.060
to widows even less
fortunate than they.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.520
Mama Lota bought the dogs

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.170
because the storehouse
had been robbed again.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.210
This time she had caught
them in the act.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.300
She burst through the
door with furious shouts

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.290
for [inaudible] her barely
fair-haired, uncovered,

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.980
light spoken erratically from
the lantern she held aloft.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.840
The boys fled crawling from her
hail storm except for one boy

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.860
who Mama Lota speculated later
to N'angela must have been raised

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.930
by a bitter woman who beat
him too hard and too often.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.730
His lackeys scurried
pitifully around him,

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.620 position:56%
but this boy alone stood lengthening
up like a thread of smoke.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.040
His fist wrapped around a
stone Mama Lota had thrown.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.420
He spat and threw it back.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.290
It struck her above her left eye,
knocked her over, knocked her out,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.430
and turned her eyebrow into
a red smear that healed later

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.130
into a purple crust which everyone
said made sense since her husband,

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.780
long deceased, had been a pastor.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.580
Those thieving boys had broken
in through the one small window

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.280
in the storehouse across
from the locked entrance.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.380
When Mama Lota toppled
across the threshold,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.780
they ran away through the
door she burst through,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.270
ran right over her body.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.160
Their pockets and hands full
of all they planned to sell.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.520
And just for the sake of
it, they stole the lantern

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.650
that had tumbled from her hand.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.700
This was why Mama Lota
had sent her nephew

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.030
to purchase the Doberman Pinchers.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.200
Not because of the stolen
food, nor the requited stone,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.380
nor even the wound it had opened.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.520
It was this pettiness of taking her
lamp which her husband had received

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.920
as a boy from a Muzungu hunter
he had fetched game for,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.300
and which he had polished
every night

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.340
of their marriage whistling
pleasantly

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.490
through the gap in his front teeth.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.250
Mama Lota liked to
remember him this way.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.390
Nearby, his mouth and
hands occupied.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.990
And now the glass and metal
thing that reminded her

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.570
of a lost person, it too, was gone.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.570
They can't even use it Mama Lota
complained in her high soft voice

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.620
as she poured N'angela a
cup of tea a few days later.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.960
"Where will they find a paraffin?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.260
[inaudible] those boys."

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.820
N'angela replied in her
trembly baritone glancing

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.980
at the bandage over
her friend's eye.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.260
They were in Mama Lota's
kitchen sitting on a pair

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.650 position:56%
of rickety chairs inherited from the
church when Pastor [inaudible] died.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.510
The women watched the steam
untangle above their teacups,

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.200
shaking their heads at the
old familiar nightmare,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.070
able-bodied males with
nothing to lose.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.370
A ferocious noise scrapped
through the window.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.480
A snarling, snatching sound.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.830
N'angela started.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.970
The dogs were quarreling.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.870
"What is it good to have
these Doberman around?"

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.170
She shuddered.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.530
"They're like demons."

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.350
"The Doberman breed is
good for protection.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.520
I picked the angriest ones,"
Mama Lota smiled and frowned.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.490
"I'm not going to suffer for some
stupid child who throws stones

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.140
at his elders and just takes."

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.440
She stuck her teeth.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.440
"I don't know."

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.790
N'angela shook her head.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.390
"I think they're eating
our chickens."

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.960
The Doberman's were
indeed rapacious.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.330
They had rather sensibly begun

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.940
to supplement the leftovers Mama
Lota gave them with mice and birds

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.400
and snakes, and yes,
the occasional chicken

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.470 position:56%
from the coop behind the storehouse.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.950
The fonder they became of her,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.590
the more little broken corpses
would the two young dogs lay

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.090
at Mama Lota's feet.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.330
She'd picked the carrying gifts
off her steps with a grimace

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.310
and scold the grinning beasts.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.610
Foolish monkeys.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.910
She'd frown and then smile
patting them on their warm, flat,

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.620
black foreheads as they wagged the
knots where their tails had been.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.530
But they were not foolish.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.130
That was a sentimental view to
take about such vicious creatures.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.960
N'angela discovered how
vicious the very next morning.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: My name is Laverne
Paige, and I'm in the African

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.140
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:52.280
I would like to introduce
you again to our speaker

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.240
and tell you a few personal
things about her, such as the fact

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.580
that she's originally from
Lusaka, Zambia in Southern Africa

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.180
where her family still lives.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.870
And her father is the professor
of psychology at the University

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:14.770
of Zambia, and we have several
of his works here at the Library

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.820
of Congress in our collections.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.860
Her mother is an economist and
has worked for a while with UNDP,

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:28.560
the United Nations
Development Program.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.780
Professor Serpell moved to
Baltimore when she was 9,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.200 position:56%
and she was educated here in the US.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.870
She received her B.A. from Yale
and her Ph.D. from Harvard,

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.070
and she's lived in
California since 2008

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.430
where she is an associate professor
of English at the University

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.840
of California Berkley
which we've been told.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:59.060
Her research work is in
contemporary fiction and film.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.410 position:56%
Her work concerns the relationship
between aesthetic reception, affect,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:10.200
and ethics, and we've been told
also that she's currently working

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.570
on a book of essays and a novel.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:21.480
I'm very interested in the
Baltimore part of her story.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.780
She grew up there.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.700
She started writing quite early.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:32.460
And so, I'm just wondering, when
exactly first started writing

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.500
and why did you turn to fiction?

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.200
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell:
Thank you so much.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.750
I'm going do the questions.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:46.860
So my family moved to Baltimore
in 1989 and it's from around then,

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.890
and there's a little red notebook
that my parents found recently

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.600
and sent to me, and it has my
name very carefully written

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.220
on the inside; and it
has ideas for stories.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.860
Some of them I think I thought
were going to be actual novels

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.670
but they've yet to risen.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:11.770
But they had titles like
"Gymnastics and Horses Don't Rhyme"

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:18.420
which was a story about a girl
who had a mother and a step-mother

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.320
and each of them likes
the other's horse.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.650
So the mother liked horses and
the stepmother likes gymnastics

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.460
and the little girl tries to
figure out how to please them both

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.870
and eventually does an
acrobatic routine on a horse.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.580
I think that was because I
had not encountered divorce

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.550
until I came to America.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.290
I knew about divorce because
my father was divorced,

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.320
but the idea that you had these
two families that you would go back

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.510
and forth, that was new to me.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.160
There was a story about
a murder mystery

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.400
where the witness said they'd seen
something from the side of the road

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.040
and the police officer says, "No.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.610
That's not possible because in this
country we drive on the other side

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.890
of the road," because it
was a British witness.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.760
So again, there were all of
these moments where I was trying

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.590
to understand my new context;
and so, in some way I feel

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:19.490 position:56%
like immigration itself was the
inspiration for me to start writing.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:25.090
I mean there's lots of
other funny little stories.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.560
One was called "Weird Science"
about reading other people's minds.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.130
I think you could get to
that point where you're just

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.110
about to become an
adolescent and you realize

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.410
that there are other people.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:43.580
And so, in that transitional stage
is when I really started writing.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.880
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: Okay.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.220
I'm, again, still interested
in Baltimore.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.710
You early life here.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:56.340
Did you read your stories
in your schoolroom?

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.300
Did you share them
with other children?

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.130
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: Well,
my mom was really excited.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.870
There was a story that
I started writing

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.960 position:56%
about the invention of the alphabet.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.260
That was a school assignment.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.720
You had to write a story.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.860
I had a bunch of people sitting
in a room and someone said,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.270
"Aah" that's our A's,
and then a B flew by.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.430
The [inaudible] before the
horse I think a little bit.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.550
So she was very excited about that.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.490
And so, that's definitely a
story that I read in school.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.570
But I was very interested
in math and English.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:33.480
So the hard sciences and the
very, very human/humanities.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.080
So my parents are both
social scientists; psychology

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.390
and economics, but I always
gravitated to the edges.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.450
And I actually ended
up going to a math

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.450
and science magnet
program in high school.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.990
And some of you may
know the school actually

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.380 position:56%
because it featured very prominently

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.000
on an NPR radio show
called "Cereal."

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.700
So there's a school called
Woodlawn High School --

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.160
yes, some of you are nodding.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.460
So I went to that school.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.950
I was in that magnet program then.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:12.130
I didn't quite overlap with the
main figures in that radio show.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.170
So I started on at
Yale doing biochemistry

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.260
because I was interested in
the sciences and then switched

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.480
to English pretty rapidly.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.820
But much to my mother's dismay.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.110
I grew up in the suburbs
of Baltimore

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.760 position:56%
so we didn't live in the inner city.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.290
We lived in a prominently
Jewish neighborhood actually

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.850
so we were the only brown
people in the neighborhood.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:41.500
But the school I went to, the
magnet school which we would drive

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.920
to everyday was predominantly
brown; brown and black.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.760
The magnet program inside
the school was mostly white

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.110
and there was me inside
the magnet program.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:26:00.490
So it was like I was the chocolate
chip in the whipped cream.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:06.110
The racial politics of Baltimore
were very striking for my family.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.410
I'm mixed race.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.280
My father is British/White.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.580
He's British of origin.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.160
He's a Zambian citizen and has
lived there most of his life.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.540
And my mother is Zambian.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.240
And in Zambia, some of you may
know that in African countries,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.290
there's a category
for mixed race people.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.060
Sometimes it's called colored.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.860
Sometimes it's called mixed.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:33.220
I grew up in Lusaka in a
very international context.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.810
We lived by the university.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.220
I had friends who were Indian.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.520
I had friends who were Zambian.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.820
I had friends who were white.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:45.540 position:56%
It was just a very diverse community
and I was born into this family

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.020 position:56%
in which race was kind of taken for
granted as something inconsequential

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.500
when it came to how
you were treated.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.960
And when we came to the states
there was immediately an imperative

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.260
to choose.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.560
You had to choose.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.830
Are you black or are you white?

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.600
"Why do you talk that way,"
and that sort of thing.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.710
So there was a lot
of pressure to fit

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:09.250 position:56%
into the binary logic in the states.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:15.200 position:56%
It's so nice to have a president
who is Halfrican as we'd like to say

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.190
and is also American
because it's like, "Oh okay,

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.930
this is recognizable now."

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.550
This experience is now
something people talk about.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:27.800
"Americanah" by Chimamanda
Ngozi Adiche.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.250
That's one of the recent novels
from Africa that I quite like.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.920
And I really wish that had
been around when we moved.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.390
That that kind of story about
an African moving to America.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.300
[inaudible] we need their names
as another version of that,

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.960
where it's an immigration story.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.160
&gt;&gt; Patricia Paige: I see.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.390
Let's flip to the other coast.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:28:00.580
You're an associate professor of
English in the English department

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.700
at Berkley, and I'm
wondering if you can talk

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:10.130
about how African literature
fits into that department.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.110
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: Oh, that's
an interesting question.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:16.200
So I was hired ironically
as an Americanist

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.150
because I'm not even a US citizen.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:24.020
But most of the novels in my
dissertation happened to be

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.520
by Americans, and the ones
that were not promptly cut.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:34.630 position:56%
Because when I went from an academic
job market all of the good jobs,

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.410
all of the jobs worth pursuing
were Americanists jobs.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.290
So Berkley is very open-minded.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.660
So as soon as I got there they said
you can teach whatever you want

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.960
and it's fine.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.090
And most of what I taught
has been post 2000 fiction.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.220
I've taught a lot of
contemporary fiction

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:57.070
and I've only just started
teaching African literature,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.870 position:56%
and I've taught it in the context
of a class on black science fiction,

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.690
which was a diasporic class so we
looked at texts from the states,

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:09.620
texts from the Caribbean,
texts from Africa.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:15.340
So in the context of my own
teaching, I mostly taught British

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.190
and American fiction because
that was what I was hired to do,

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:23.430
but I've recently been branching
out into African fiction.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.730
&gt;&gt; Patricia Paige: Okay.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.160
Did you say black science fiction?

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.460
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: I did.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.760
I said black science fiction.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.670
&gt;&gt; Patricia Paige: This is the 10th
anniversary Octavia Butler died

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.970
about ten years ago.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.270
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: Is that right.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.570
I didn't know.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:41.350 position:56%
I know they're making -- they're
finally making a TV show out of her,

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.780
"Parable of the Sowers," the
series which has been around

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.880
and it's an amazing work.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.190
I taught several of her
short stories in that class.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.470
I like her books.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:54.770
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: Thank you.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.100
Let' see. I have so many
questions here and so little time.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.970
Okay. If you could tell us
about your current projects.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.500
Your book of essays and novels.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:11.110
I'm curious also about the style
of writing that you've described

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.080
where you write in verse.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:19.840
And so, with the novel, that's
a big burst or how you do this.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.620
So I'm just wondering how
this affects your writing

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.510
of longer pieces?

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.810
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: Sure.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.900
So the book of essays that I'm
working on is the second work

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.120
of fellowship that I'm expected
to write for my job at Berkley.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.030
My first book was called
"Seven Modes of Uncertainty."

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:44.440
That's about the reading
experience of encountering text

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.320
like Tony Morrison's "Love it"
or Lolita or "By the [inaudible]"

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:55.550
or " The Crying of Lot 49" by
Thomas Pynchon showed these novels

00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:00.990
that confront you with kind of
deep puzzlement as to what happened

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:06.830
or why it happened, and at the
same time crosses that uncertainty

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.640
of knowledge with an
ethical problem.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.010
So in "Beloved" obviously
slavery and infanticide,

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.190
and in "Lolita" pedophilia.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:20.600
So you're confronted with not
knowing exactly where you stand,

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.510
and you're given this really kind
of intractable ethical problem.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.810
And I was interested in whether
this is actually useful for us,

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:33.630
reading these kinds of texts
in thinking about how to be

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.160
as a person and in terms of ethics.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.480
So I don't believe that reading
books makes us better people

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.100
but I do think that books can serve
functionally as ethical philosophy.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.370
They can teach you how to think
about how to be a good person.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.030
So that was my first book.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.370 position:56%
My second book takes up a particular
issue in ethical philosophy

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:59.920 position:56%
which is the face to face encounter,
which is A) an idea about how

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.150
to interact with humans that is
very old from ancient philosophy,

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.180
you know, it's in the
bible has been taken

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.640
up by a Jewish philosopher most
recently Emmanuel [inaudible].

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:15.160
What I'm interested in is -- well,
what happens when you look at kind

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.840
of weird faces, the animal
face, the mixed race face,

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.550
that the passing face,
is it white or black?

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:28.630
I look at faces that have been
damaged and then repaired.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:34.190
So it's a series of chapters about
faces and the most recent chapter

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.750
that I wrote is about emoji's
because I was interested

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.250
in a language made of faces.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.080
So I just gave a talk about that.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.890
The novel is called "The Old Drift"

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:50.920 position:56%
and it's the great Zambian novel you
didn't know you were waiting for.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:56.280
And I'd published parts of
that novel over the years.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.150
So while I was getting my Ph.D.
and while I was getting tenure

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.950
at Berkley, I was also
writing fiction.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.440
And so, I've published
I think four pieces

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.820
of this novel as short stories.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.020
So "The Sack" is in fact, the
last chapter of this novel.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.900
So this is how I work in bursts.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.130
In that, I don't go in order.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:26.760
So I can go kind of across a text,
and I've had this novel in my head

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:32.990
since I was 21 so I've been
developing it over time and working

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.290
on other stories as well
and working on other novels,

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.650
but because "The Sack"
is part of the novel,

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.880
the momentum from winning
the prize allowed us to --

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.760
me and my agent to sell the novel
so it's going to come out in 2018

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.650
with [inaudible] which
I'm very pleased about.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.380 position:56%
So I'm hard at work on it right now.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:58.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: The Zambian novel.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:04.940
I understand that you
travel annually to Zambia.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:10.320
So could you tell us something
about the literary scene in Zambia?

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.690
Do you feel connected there?

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.120
Would you consider teaching there?

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:20.910
And how does this compare to your
connection with American writers?

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:22.790
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell:
That's a good question.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:28.350 position:56%
So my parents moved back in 2002
and since then I go back every year;

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:32.350
for a while every other
year because I was broke.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.360
Now I go back much more frequently.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.090
Last year I was there four times.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:40.850 position:56%
I'm going back on Thursday, actually

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.960
because the Caine Prize
Workshop this year.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.490
So every year after the prize,
the year after the prize is given,

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:55.090
the four and the five short-listed
writers go to a country in Africa

00:34:55.090 --> 00:35:00.580 position:56%
and you have a ten day workshop
with local students and with writers

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.000
from around the continent.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.580
And so, the last time when I was
nominated we went to Cameroon

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.810
and this time we're going to
Zambia which is wonderful for me.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:18.310
So I've had a lot of contact with
the Pen Club, the Pen Society.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:24.010 position:56%
I can't remember exactly how they go
by but in [inaudible] which is made

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:29.740
up of young writers and they meet
every other week at the [inaudible]

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.880
and they talk about
their work in progress.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.990
I've recently became
aware of a new outfit,

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.670
the Lusaka Book Club,
which is just wonderful.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:45.330 position:56%
So they organized an event for me in
September, a reading for me at home,

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.990
and it was just wonderful.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.410
And it's just people in the
community who are interested

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.550 position:56%
in reading and so we had a breakfast
and they asked me all sorts

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.430
of questions about my story.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.110
Then the University of Zambia.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.550
So my dad has been involved
there for a long time.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.050
He's been teaching at
the department there.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.480
He was vice-chancellor
there for a minute.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:08.590
So I had some contact with the
literature department there.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.890
But I'll be very frank with you.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.680
When it comes to teaching
there, I considered it

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.540
when I was a graduate student
when I was home for one summer,

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.750
I spent a lot of time at
the literature department,

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.140
and I felt that I couldn't
thrive there

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:27.660
because of the in-built sexism.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.150
That's a problem in English
departments across the world.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:35.960
But there, it felt particularly
pervasive to me; and so,

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.630
I just felt like that
wasn't an option for me.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.500
But to teach there in terms
of teaching a workshop,

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.380
I did a workshop at the
American International School.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.690
I've done a little workshop

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.640
with some primary school
kids when I was home last.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.030
That kind of teaching I might do,

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.920
but at the university
level, I'm not quite sure.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.700
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: Afterwards I'll
ask you more about the book club.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.000
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: Yeah.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.300
Sure.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.600
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: That's
very interesting to me.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.590 position:56%
I'm wondering about African writers.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.400
Your favorites.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.760
You seem to read all
over the place, and so,

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.500 position:56%
also your favorite American writers.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.800
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: Yeah.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.590 position:56%
So I'll give you an old writer that
I love and a new writer that I love.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:30.420
So when I was quite young I
was introduced to the work

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.950
of Betsey [inaudible] who
is Botswanan born but lived

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:36.990
in South Africa then
went back to Botswana.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:41.360
She wrote a book called
[inaudible] and that was very,

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.810
very powerful for me
as a young woman.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:52.480
Most recently, Binyavanga Wainaina
who won the Caine Prize early on

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.910
and used his prize
money to start Kwani

00:37:55.910 --> 00:38:01.460
which is a Kenyan publishing
house but also magazine.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:08.140
His kind of semi-fictional
least beautifully memoir,

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.190
"One Day I Will Write
About This Place" is one

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:14.760
of my favorite new
texts coming out today.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.450
As for American novelists, Tony
Morrison and Vladimir Nabokov

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:23.560 position:56%
who I mentioned earlier are kind of
my auntie and uncle I think of them.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.860
Uncle Vlad.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.560
I talk about Auntie Tony.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.110
What I admire about both of them is
they seemed to both have been born

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:38.730
with a completely self-sufficient
sense of their worth

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.610
as writers and as people.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:48.040
Just completely confident, and it's
rare, and it's quite beautiful.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.930
Some people I think perceive it
as arrogance, but I think it comes

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.400
with such a healthy dose
of humor in both of them.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.350
People don't often comment on how
funny Tony Morrison's novels are,

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.650
but they are quite funny.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:05.140
Even Beloved has jokes.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.440
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: Please
point them out.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.740
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: I will.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.930
I will. There's an amazing
scene at the end of "Beloved"

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.790
between Stamp Paid and Paul D.
and they're laughing about Setha.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.660
And they're like, "You can't
leave her alone with anybody."

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.960
It's really funny.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.870
I think to have that kind
of self-possession combined

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:29.930
with a sense of humor is
something to aspire to.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.230
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: Okay.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.820
Well, with time constraints,

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:38.010
I should probably ask this last
question which we always ask.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:41.330
What do you think is the
future for African writers,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.830
both from the diaspora
and from the continent?

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.910
What steps need to be taken
to bring more recognition

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:51.560
from the international community?

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:57.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: I think a lot of
young African writers are aspiring

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:03.030
to move beyond a kind of
binary thinking which is

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:09.930
that you either write from within
the continent about African things

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:15.970
which are recognizable to the
west, or you write this kind

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.050
of immigrant narrative
that's on the other side.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.620
And so, this never
the twain shall meet.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:31.020
There's a kind of idea of
authencity and literary nest

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.820
that don't always coincide in
the ways that we want them to.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:41.650
So I think being around
to talk about our work

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:46.220
without becoming cultural
commentators or sociologists

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:52.290
of where we're from is a big
push among young African writers,

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:58.430
and I think on the other
hand, being allowed to write

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:02.610
about whatever we want
is also really important.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:07.560
That kind of freedom to
express an African sensibility

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:13.200
without necessarily African
troubles like child poverty or HIV,

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:20.050 position:56%
Aids or whatever it may be, is a
freedom I think all of us aspire to.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.510
So for this workshop that's coming
up, I've been having conversations

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:27.990
with some of the other
short-listed writers about, "Well,

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:29.290
what are we supposed to write?"

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.950
Because it's going to be in
the Caine Prize anthology.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.650
Does it have to be a
story set in Africa?

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.520
Because I've written
stories set in the states.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.530
I have ideas for novels
that are set in the states

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.570
that don't necessarily
involve African characters.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.020
Sometimes they involve
African American characters.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.910
Sometimes white characters.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.480
And so, my friend,
she said she's going

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.160
to write an African fairy tale,
a mini African Harry Potter.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:01.030
And I'm thinking about writing
something more experimental

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:06.110
and more kind of oriented toward
an international perspective,

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.440
so a series of interactions
between characters

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.340
that are mostly over the Internet.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.480
So I think that's the future I
think, just the freedom to write

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:22.140
about whatever you want and to have
African just be part of what you do

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:28.700
but not necessarily constrained
by -- I think it's died.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.150
Not necessarily constrained

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:38.800
by what people think African
means if that makes sense.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.890
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: We have
a lot to look forward to.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:46.070
That's all I can say
with your writing.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:53.970
And as for the -- we anticipated
having the anthology here

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:55.470
but we don't.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:58.550
However, you can read the sack.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.380
It can be downloaded from the --

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.370
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: From
the Caine Prize website.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.670
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: --
Caine Prize website,

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.930
so you still have access to that.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:12.990
And I think now if
you have questions --

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:16.860
how much time do we have?

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.860
About 15 minutes.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.610
Okay. So questions?

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:27.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Thank you
very much professor.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:32.260
I was interested in your thing that
you interracially had been a theme

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.570
and an inspiration for
you in your writing.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:38.670
In the context of [inaudible]
on immigration.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:46.960
Do you think that might be a
future topic for [inaudible].

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.720
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: That's
an interesting question.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.720
So what's funny about me saying
that immigration was the spark is

00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:00.890
that I actually don't have any
immigration stories technically

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:05.060
unless you count Time
Travel as an immigration.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.620
I have a story in which someone
who is raised in the west

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.720
in the future time travels back
and geographically travels back

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.510
to Africa, but obviously
that's much more speculative

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.780
than addressing contemporary
issues of immigration.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.330
So I have not yet written my
Americana or my we need new names,

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.300
and I'm not sure that I will.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:32.710
I kind of -- I very much enjoy
kind of having Africaness appear

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:37.020
in my American fiction
in an indirect way;

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.400
almost in a stylistic
way and vice versa.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:47.990
That said, my novel, "The Old
Drift" involves immigration

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.980
but it involves telling the story

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:56.750
of how people came from
the west to Zambia.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.930
So "The Old Drift" is the
title of it and it's named

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:04.260
for an early colonial
settlement near what become known

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.600
as Victoria Falls.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.510
We call it [inaudible] which
means the smoke that thunders.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:14.320
So before -- so just 20 years

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:20.040
after David Livingston discovered
Victoria Falls, the British came

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.800
over from what was then
Southern Rhodesia and came up.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.340
And they went across the
Zambezi and they went

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.820
across on what's called a drift.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.520
So it's a calm place in the water
that you can drift things across,

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.280
and they made a settlement
called the Old Drift.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.500
They also come to what
they call black fever

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.210
which is actually malaria.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:47.340
So there's a little graveyard there
called the Old Drift Cemetery.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.620
And so, I'm interested in
those kinds of migrations

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.090
or immigrations into Zambia.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.910
So I have people coming from India.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:59.710
People coming from England
and people coming from Italy.

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:05.080
And as a way of understanding
the international kind of context

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.700
in which I grew up
in the 70s, late 80s.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.600
So I'm interested in immigration
to Africa which is kind of reversal

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.110
of the normal way of
thinking about it.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.090
But in terms of immigration
to America,

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.950
that's still unchartered
territory for me.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.310
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: Those of us who
downloaded "The Sack" and read it,

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:36.940
now that we know it's the
last chapter [inaudible].

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.060
Actually I love it.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.290
Is the whole book comprised
of chapters

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:45.810 position:56%
that have been published separately
as short stories, or was it designed

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:50.430
to each chapter[inaudible]
stand alone?

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:53.170
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: So
it's not a big collection

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.530
of like inter-linked stories.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.720
It's not a collection
of short stories.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:05.130
So my first published story
was "Muzungu" which I wrote

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:06.670
in the context of writing
this novel.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.340
It was a chapter of the novel.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.350
I sent it to Callaloo with another
chapter, and they choose this one,

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:18.170 position:56%
and it was part of an issue that was
called "New Writing From Africa."

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:22.280
They then nominated it for the
Caine Prize for short stories,

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.340
and so then it got labeled a
short story and then it was

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.010
in the best American short stories.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.830
And in fact, when I first
received the email saying I was

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:36.030
in this collection, I said, "Well,

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:40.200
my story is neither
American nor a short story."

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.050
And they wrote back like, "No, no.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:44.440
It's okay."

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.670
So that's happened a
couple of other times.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.110
"The Sack" as well.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:53.990
I sent to the Africa 39 Anthology
unlabeled and they wrote me

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.290
and they said, "Is this a short?

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.380
Should we write a story or say
it's a short coming novel?"

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.720 position:56%
And I said, "You know, I don't know
what the title of the novel is going

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.290
to be so just publish
it as "The Sack,"

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:05.540
and then it was again
nominated as a story.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.920
I have actually written
short stories.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.090
It's not just that I keep
writing this generic line,

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:15.050
but I've written a short story
called "The Book of Faces"

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:18.350
which is the take on
Facebook and the Book

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.520
of Job that's a self-contained
short story,

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.660
and I've written a short
story called "Bottoms up"

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.220
which is a sci-fi story as well.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:30.090
So I do write short stories,
but these just happen

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:34.970
to be self-contained
chapters of the novel.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thank you professor.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:49.140
It's lovely to be here.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.440
[inaudible].

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.740
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell:
Thanks for coming.

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I actually
grew up near Yale,

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.810
and I'm wondering what are
your experiences at Yale

00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:04.250
and how do they compare to
your experience at Berkley?

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:05.550
[inaudible].

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:06.850
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: Yeah.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.150
They were very, very different.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:12.110
So I went -- my parents encouraged
me to go to an ivy league school.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.170 position:56%
I was very much under the impression
that it was just for rich people,

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:20.670
and I went there to visit and I
really enjoyed it, and I thought,

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.830
"This is just an amazing
opportunity,"

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:27.510
for which I only just
completed paying --

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.040
[ Laughter ]

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.900
-- Paying off my student loans.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.230
And you know it was wonderful.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:38.710
It was very different
from Baltimore.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:43.870
I didn't really understand the
socio-economic politics at Yale.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:49.200
And I didn't know that people were
actually rich until I graduated,

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.220
and I discovered that my
roommate's pearls were real.

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.170
I thought they had to be fake.

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:57.470
That sort of thing.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:03.490
But the FM center was a big
part of my kind of acculturation

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:08.680
into learning about what it is
to be black and an ivy leaguer.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:14.690
And I started a poetry
circle there where it's

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:20.080
like a poetry performance
monthly extravaganza.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.190
And I called it Black Coffee.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.890 position:56%
I was very influenced by Love Jones.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.150
I don't know if any of
you know that movie.

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:32.680
I said on the poster,
"Black-oriented

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.010
but not black limited"
so it was open

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:40.360
but it was Afro-centric in spirit.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.580
And we had a really fun time.

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:47.720
Sometimes we had students from
Harvard come visit for the weekend

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.690
and we gave performances,
and I sang.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:55.680
I wasn't much of a
[inaudible] but I liked to sing.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:01.560
I lived in New Haven for a
summer and I liked it a lot.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.940
I really love that city.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:09.190
I think the racial politics
at Berkley are quite different

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:12.600
because of the overturning
of a proposition, I think,

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.790
a few years before I got there.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:19.190
We can no longer use race as a
determining factor in who we admit

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:25.940 position:56%
and our population of black students
has accordingly dropped a lot.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.970
So it's something like 2%.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:33.460 position:56%
So it's a very different campus from
what I experienced even at Yale.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:38.180
So the diversity on campus
is much more comprised

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.590
of Asian American students

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.310
and Latino/Latina Chicano/Chicana
students.

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:46.190
So I've learned a lot
about those cultures

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:50.610
and in teaching my classes that's
been a very interesting aspect is

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:54.070
seeing these kind of forms
of cultural solidarity

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.770
across the student population.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:51:59.920
&gt;&gt; Laverne Paige: What?

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.510
Okay. One more question.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:10.110
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:17.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thanks
again for your talk.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:30.920
It was a great presentation.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:37.640
I have a multipart
question if that's okay.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.660 position:56%
One, is there anything you took away
[inaudible] Baltimore [inaudible]?

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:50.060
And two, do you have any claims
or aspirations to make one

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:57.580 position:56%
of your stories into a movie or a
play or some other kind of art form?

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.730
&gt;&gt; Namwali Serpell: You know,
when I was a teenager I used to go

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:05.330
to Fellow's Point a lot, and
there was a pizza place there.

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:09.790
I don't know if it's still
there that had a pineapple pizza

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.070
that me and my mom used to eat.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.620
So I know it's not very Baltimore,

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:20.190
but that's just the
truth of my memory.

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:22.740 position:56%
We haven't been back in a long time.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:29.010
My sister passed away there and
I think that marked that space

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:34.470
as a space of mourning
for my family.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:38.760
So we drifted around the D.C. area
since then and I have a lot of love

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.340
for D.C. and for Baltimore,

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.620
but sometimes it's more
of like a sad space.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.110
I think about the Nina
Simone song or her --

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:50.550
I think it's just her rendition
of the song about Baltimore.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:54.030
She says, "Baltimore ain't
it hard just to live?"

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.640
And there's something about
that space that still for me,

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.940
rings that bell in my heart.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.000
And I have a novel
that I've finished

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.750
but who knows what's
going to happen to it?

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:08.700
Which is set in the states and
is a noir so it has elements

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.790
of crime fiction, and I
think that would be --

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:15.310
it has all these really
dramatic explosive moments

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.360
like a bomb going off in an
airport and the Bay Bridge

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.310
and the Golden Gate Bridge
collapsing and stuff like that.

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:25.420
So that will be fun to film.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:32.460
The Old Drift is about three
generations of three families,

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.280
and the grandmothers all have these
kind of mythical elements to them.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.080
So one of them is born covered with
hair, and one of them is covered

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.380
with eyes, and one of
them cries all the time;

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.680
and I always think they would
be really wonderful to make

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.010
into a graphic novel because
they're so kind of weird.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.310
It would be really fun to draw.

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:43.610
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Well
thanks for that.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:44.910
Thanks Laverne.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.210
Thanks Nawali.

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:47.510
Thanks for coming out.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:48.810

to come and please come back

Thanks so much.

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:54.010
