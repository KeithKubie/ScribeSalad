00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.246
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So one thing I've heard about 3 d printing or catchphrase is complexity is

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:07.222
free. I don't know if you want to say anything about that. [laugh] I think

00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:11.110
that's an interesting one. It's what, what does that mean to you? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that to

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.926
me means you can get as complex as you want with an object. And you can go as

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:21.184
crazy as you want. I've seen people do stools that were replicated sea foam.

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:24.530
Because they could 3D print them, and there's no other way you could ever

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.324
manufacturer that, now you can. And, I think really what that means also is,

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:32.420
complexity is something that we can tend to put into something, and we tend to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.660
make things over complicated, because now that we can. And, now's kind of the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.176
time where the wave hits the end. Right? And you have to look back and say

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:44.080
again, you know, what's the best way to make this and how do you make something

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.679
that could be really complex, very simplistic, because now we have the

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.845
technology to do it and the design software is so easy. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, right. I mean

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:55.237
I've heard of experiments where they'll like evolve designs and they'll say

00:00:55.237 --> 00:00:58.523
well, now that we can build it in any shape we want, let's just start putting

00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:01.536
out different designs and have it computer analyzed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And see which

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:04.504
the best one is. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that sounds really interesting. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; With 3D

00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:08.637
printing, I mean, the future could be very, very Baroque. [laugh] ... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [laugh]

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:11.324
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You could have your face on every single object in your house if you wanted

00:01:11.324 --> 00:01:14.440
to, ... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [laugh] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; But that's one of those questions that keep coming up, is.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.686
Yeah. [laugh] is how do you scale that back and say, well do I really need my

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:21.887
face on that door knob? Is that the best door knob there is? [laugh] You know,

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:24.303
to be able to grab my head. It's probably not.
