00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.130
I'm now just going to review
a couple of more projectile

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.230
motion problems, because I
really want you to understand

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.380
this as deeply as possible.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.630
Because the rest of physics
that we do and the rest of

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.120
mechanics, a lot of it really
just depends on your

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.280
understanding of projectile
motion.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.810
And hopefully this will
be intuitive for

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.620
you after some point.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.760
Let's just go back to a
problem we did before.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.820
Let's say that I'm at the top
of a building and I take a

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.570
rock or a ball-- and I don't
recommend that you do this--

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.000
and I drop it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.010
I dropped the ball.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:39.890
And let's say that I know that
the building is, well I don't

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.530
know, let's say it's a
very tall building.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.250
Well let's say it's
not too tall.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.600
Let's say we're throwing
it from the 10th story.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.280
So it's roughly 100 feet, or
that's about 30 meters, right?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.950
So the ball is going to go 30
meters down, so the change in

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.520
distance is going to be minus
30 meters, right?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.230
The ball is going to
fall 30 meters.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.740
Now if I ask you, hey you, how
fast is that ball going to be

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.050
right before it hits
the ground?

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.180
Well I could rewrite all the
formulas, but I think

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.230
hopefully you know them by now,
but there's two kind of

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.080
interesting formulas
we might use.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.230
I'll also show you maybe how to
do this more intuitively.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.320
But there's vf squared is equal
to vi squared plus 2ad.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.680
And then there is and this is
2 times delta d, right?

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.690
Whoops, plus 2a times
change in distance.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.870
Sometimes I'll just write
that as distance.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.260
And then there was change in
distance is equal to the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.980
initial velocity times time
plus acceleration time

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.920
squared over 2.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.310
And the there were
the other ones.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.300
Change in distance is rate times
time, and velocity is

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.620
acceleration times time, and
you know about all average

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.700
velocity, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.570
So one of these formulas I
think might strike you as

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.700
immediately useful to what we're
trying to figure out,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.389
because we're trying to figure
out what the velocity is when

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.449
you hit the ground, right?

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.460
We want to know what the
final velocity is.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.220
We know the initial velocity
is 0, right?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.180
We're just letting it go.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.870
And then what's the
acceleration?

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.100
Well the acceleration is
gravity, which is equal to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.110
minus 10 meters per
second squared.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.620
So we could use this formula,
cause we know vi, we know

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.050
acceleration, we know change in
distance, so we could solve

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.740
for velocity.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.860
So we get vf squared is equal
to vi squared-- well that's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.360
just 0, right-- times 2
acceleration, and so

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.560
that's minus 10.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.110
Then what's the distance?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.700
Well the distance is
minus 30, right?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.000
Change in distance
is minus 30.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.130
So you get vf squared is equal
to-- 10 times 30 is 300 is

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:17.940
equal to 600, so if I took 600
square root-- roughly 24.5

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.520
meters per second.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:30.060
So vf is equal to approximately

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.360
24.5 meters per second.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.310
Now if we wanted to know well
how long did it did take the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.920
thing to hit the ground, or how
long should it take the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.990
thing to hit the ground.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.180
Well then we could use
this formula, right?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.460
Cause we know the change in
distance, we know the initial

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.410
velocity is 0, we know the
acceleration, and so we could

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.300
just solve for t.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.100
So change in distance I said
was minus 30, right?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.190
The ball went down 30 meters.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.320
We could say minus 30.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.210
Let me change the colors, cause
I want to make sure you

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.460
know which formula I'm using.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.700
I'll do it in that color.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.209
Minus 30 is equal to the initial
velocity of 0-- so the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.630
initial velocity times anything
is 0, so this term

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.680
cancels out-- plus at
squared over 2.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.740
So what's a? a is minus 10
divided by 2 is minus 5.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.430
So it's minus 5 t squared.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.260
And so you divide both sides by
5, and you get t squared is

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.230
equal to 6.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.920
Once again use the trusty
calculator.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.780
The square root of 6 is
roughly 2.45 seconds.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.100
t is equal to 2.45 seconds.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.790
It's pretty neat.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.190
Using these two formulas
in about 3 minutes.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.390
We probably could do it faster
if we weren't explaining it,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.490
so you could do it really
fast on an exam.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.760
I just said I drop a ball from
a building at 30 meters high.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.530
Very quickly, we were able to
figure out how fast it was

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.920
falling when it hit the ground
and how long should it take

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.570
for it to fall.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.300
And if I were to give you one
of the other pieces of

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.090
information.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.320
If I told you that the ball took
2.45 seconds to fall, and

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.830
I didn't tell you the distance,
then you could have

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.080
figured out the distance based
on that information using the

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.290
same formula.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.390
Hopefully, that makes
some sense.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.270
Actually, I'll leave
it there right now.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.770
I just wanted to show you that
when you actually just go

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.080
straight to the formulas, and
you don't do all the kind of

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.030
meandering explanations
that I tend to do,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.010
which I do for a reason.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.295
I do them to give you
an intuition.

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:54.570
But when you just go straight
to the formulas, these

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.250
problems don't really
take much time.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.490
But with that said, let me
show you how to do it

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.810
intuitively if you forget
the formulas.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.330
So once again, I'm
dropping a ball.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.840
It's a 30 meter building,
right?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.530
And I want to figure out what
the speed is when it hits and

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.730
how long did it take to fall?

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.050
Well let's just start
with our basics.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.620
Let's say I just had amnesia,
and the only thing I remember

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.910
is change in distance is equal
to rate times time, or average

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.930
rate or average velocity
times time.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.920
And I know that change in
velocity is equal to

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.010
acceleration times time,
if I know that my

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.490
acceleration is constant.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.100
Otherwise, it would be the
average acceleration.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.600
But this is all you
have to know.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.040
And I'm going to show
you right now.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.655
So we know what the change
in distance is, right?

00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:52.750
And just so not to confuse you,
we're doing the exact

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.300
same problem.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.555
But I'm just showing you that
you didn't have to memorize

00:06:54.555 --> 00:06:57.340
the formulas, although it might
be faster if you do.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.790
So the change in distance is
minus 30 meters, right?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.900
So let's plug that
in straight.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.375
So we know that minus 30
meters-- this is what I'm

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:11.220
going to use-- is equal
to the average

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.240
velocity times time, right?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.620
Well what's the average
velocity?

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.210
Let's see if we can
figure that out.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.220
Well we know the average
velocity is just the average

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.900
of the initial and the
final velocity.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.330
Well what's the initial
velocity?

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.320
The initial velocity is 0.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.070
vi is 0.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.210
The final velocity is
the final velocity.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.770
We don't know that yet.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.550
So what's the average velocity
going to be?

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.140
It's going to be the average
of these 2 numbers.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.880
So the average velocity is going
to be-- this a little

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.060
too bloody, I don't like this
color-- the final velocity

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.630
plus the initial velocity
over 2 which

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.700
equals vf over 2, right?

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.120
So let's put that into
our formula.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.020
So minus 30 is equal to
the average velocity.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.870
That's just the final velocity
divided by 2 times time.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.260
And now you're saying,
but Sal, we

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.170
still have 2 variables.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.135
We can't solve for either
one of them, right?

00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:25.400
Well if we could write time in
terms of final velocity, then

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.550
we could solve for
final velocity.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.540
So let's try doing that.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.880
So let's use this equation
right there.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.760
Change in velocity is equal to
acceleration times time.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.080
What's the change in velocity?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:43.100
It's the final velocity minus
the initial velocity, and that

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.540
equals acceleration.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.360
Acceleration is minus 10 meters
per second squared

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.500
times time.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.880
And what's the initial
velocity?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.020
That's 0, right?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:57.020
So we know that vf-- this is
0-- is equal to minus 10t.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.640
And if we wanted to write the
other way, we could say t is

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.860
equal to minus vf over 10.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.540
I just rearranged
this equation.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.930
Now I could take this
and substitute it

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.520
back into this equation.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:24.600
And I get minus 30 is equal to
vf over 2 times t, which is

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.320
this right here.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.460
So times minus vf over 10.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:37.790
And if you solve this, you get,
well you essentially the

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.050
exact thing same thing we got
in the previous problem.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.210
You get vf squared
is equal to 600.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.610
I'm skipping some steps just
cause I'm running out of time.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.560
And you get the same answer,
whatever, 24.5 seconds.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.745
I just wanted to do that,
because I wanted to show that

00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:53.310
you really just have to memorize
these two things.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.670
And then you can derive all
those equations on the fly,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.210
although it can be faster to
know them ahead of time.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.790
But these are the only
two things that

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.150
we're ever really using.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.870
Those other equations are just
derivations of them.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.120
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
