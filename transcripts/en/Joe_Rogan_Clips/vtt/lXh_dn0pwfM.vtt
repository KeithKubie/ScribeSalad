1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.270
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience?
Well,

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:06.660
that's one thing that we did learn from talking to Jack Dorsey,

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.130
the CEO of Twitter,
like it's impossible to manage.
There's too many.
Yeah.
Hosts.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.540
They're going up right now by the thousands.
Like if you could see everyone,

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.670
everyone in America posting on Twitter right now,
I'd be like,
oh,

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.400
[inaudible].

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.510
I mean,
imagine all happening.
Oh,
no.
Explosion.
Oh my God.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.530
Ones and Zeros just fussed and all over the place and text.
Just chat.

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.900
Who Do you think,
like if you were to grab somebody's phone,

10
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.610
the most popular person that gets tweeted the most just emotion.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.750
Just looked at it.
How fast would that go?
You know what I mean?
Like just that,

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.620
that one account.
Oh,
be insane.
I mean,

13
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.490
years probably going to sleep some people or do you just pull stuff out of the

14
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:56.730
people?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I follow a lot of other people.
I just followed whenever,

15
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:58.020
whenever things,
someone's interesting.

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.820
So he's got cool pictures of follow that guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just like first,

17
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.390
yeah.
Let me see.
Let me go back to see what else.

18
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:10.110
This person's not wacky.
It's really funny.

19
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.580
As people get mad at you for certain people,

20
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:16.581
you follow people that you guys stop following our Kelly now don't tell them

21
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:20.130
what to do.
Right.
That's first of all.
First of all,
don't tell him what to do.

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.180
Second of all,
what am I doing?
Am I boosting up his profile?

23
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.200
He's fucking art Kellogg.
Okay.
It doesn't matter if I follow them.
If I don't,

24
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.430
I want to know how crazy he is.
That's right,
dude.
Did you see Tyron,

25
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.100
Tyron Woodley,
UFC,

26
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:39.450
a top welterweight former champion had a thing on his Instagram page of him

27
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:44.130
watching our Kelly getting interviewed and where,
who's who was?

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.580
Who is denying that he knows how to hog tie people.

29
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.100
It's laughing at him.
Play this,
play this.
He's all and this interview.
Yeah.

30
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:56.470
It's just crazy.
Shit.
Ain't funny,
but dog.

31
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.990
Oh,
Tyler.

32
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.630
I sent me

33
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.330
paper called Tyler Hoag.

34
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.530
That's great.
He's not using a confident today.
He's like,
ha ha,
Ho Ho.
Hey,

35
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.720

That's hilarious.
Yeah,

36
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.570
that I'd love real talk if you haven't watched that video.
Real talk.

37
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.150
We played it on the podcast multiple times.

38
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.020
The real target is one of the greatest unintentional comedies that's ever been

39
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.340
real talk.
Real talk I and say it.
Oh my God,
what is it?
It's an art Kelly Song.

40
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.780
Okay.

41
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.580
Where he's in an argument with his girlfriend on the phone while he was in the

42
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:48.970
car fare,
was girlfriend on the phone.
He's like getting his hair done and shit.

43
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.950
He's smoking stoke,
he's drinking.

44
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:54.250
It's got like different outfits on and he's still in the conversation and

45
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:56.350
there's one part where he goes,
bitch,

46
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.380
I wish you would my mother clothes Lou real talk bitch.

47
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.680
I wish you would burn my motherfucking clothes real time.

48
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.230
I serious about that.
Listen,

49
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:16.140
I absolutely feel for any person that he's victimized,
absolutely do.
Yeah,

50
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.690
but you cannot deny that that that it is hilarious.
That shit is fun.

51
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.650
There is.
Hold on.
I just play that

52
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.533
fucking

53
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.360
trifling.
Ass

54
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.380
trifling is the best.

55
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.090
It is best African-american's saying of all prideful Triflin Triflin and it's

56
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:46.840
one that why people cannot use.
It's too,
I pronounced it too good.

57
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:50.680
They on that word.
Hey on that word.
As much as they own the n word.
Right.

58
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.450
Top trifle Ling,
you can't be traveling.
He can announced the g and trifling.
Yeah,

59
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.900
you can.
Yeah.
That's why white people are not allowed to use it.

60
00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:01.900
They would ruin it.
Exactly.
He's out there trifling.
He's out there trifling shit.

61
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.400
He's just a bullshit trifling ass trifling.
Well,
here's the thing.

62
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.070
I bet gay guys use trifling.
I bet gay guys,

63
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.720
I'll pull it out out with him over there,
but it's trifling ass.
I know.

64
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.870
It sounds like a rifle that you travel with until trifle it.
Yeah,

65
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.170
like a triathlon is a travel rifle to think at a banning those.

66
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.220
They're good for long range.
Don't bring a trifle with many people.

67
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:27.850
Do you think had to look it up before Webster had to like answer this question.

68
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:31.370
What does a trifling heifer
did?

69
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.130
Try for laugh,

70
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.690
lacking insignificance or solid worth such as a frivolous,

71
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.520
trifling,
be trivial.
A trifling gift.

72
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.760
See,
chiefly dialectical,
my God,

73
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.970
lazy shiftless in a triathlon fellow trifling fellow trifling fellow is eight.

74
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.310
That's the most English thing that ever say.
It got very wide at the fellow.

75
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.090
He's a trifling fed up.
Don't bring y'all off.
Shall they hear without Kathleen?

76
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.810
Hello?
Yeah,
that's a word,
bro.
That's a,
that's a legit word.

77
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.080
Trifling Shit.
That was going to say something else.
I totally forgot.

78
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.040
What did we talk about right before teach them our Kelly Kelly.
Yeah.

79
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.070
I like that point.

80
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.400
He did an album where it was a lot of just talking.
Oh,
trapped in the closet.

81
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.470
Yeah.
Yeah.
There was a whole series of videos.

82
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.560
I think Aziz had a whole thing on that.

83
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.310
I think we did like Aziz Ansari did a bit on it,
I believe so.

84
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:29.260
I know he had a bit,
yeah,
about r Kelly.

85
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.220
It might've been about trapped in the closet.
Yeah.

86
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.900
Trapped in the closet is great,
but it can't fuck with real talk.
Real talk.

87
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.880
Real talk to the jam.
Yeah.
